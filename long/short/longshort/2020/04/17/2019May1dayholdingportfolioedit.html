WE HAVE GENERALLY INVESTED EXCESS CASH IN HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT GRADE LONG-TERM  MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH LESS THAN FIVE YEARS TO MATURITY. WE CLASSIFY ALL OF  OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, THUS SECURITIES ARE RECORDED  AT FAIR VALUE AND ANY ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS, NET OF TAX, IS INCLUDED  AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, \u201cACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.\u201d IF WE JUDGED A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE FOR ANY  SECURITY TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY  WOULD BE WRITTEN DOWN AND A CHARGE RECOGNIZED TO NET INCOME. THE FAIR VALUES FOR  OUR SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS OF THE VALUATION  DATE AND OBSERVABLE PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS. WE CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS  IN DETERMINING WHETHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, INCLUDING: CREDIT  MARKET CONDITIONS; THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES; HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATES  FOR SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE CREDIT RATING; THE PRESENCE OF INSURANCE OF THE SECURITIES  AND, IF INSURED, THE CREDIT RATING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INSURER; THE  EFFECT OF MARKET INTEREST RATES ON THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES; AND THE DURATION  AND EXTENT OF ANY UNREALIZED LOSSES. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL  BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITIES PRIOR TO MATURITY BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES CHANGE IN  THE FUTURE, OR, IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES ARE USED, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS  MAY CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD RESULT IN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET  REALIZABLE VALUE. COST IS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT METHOD. WHERE  THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT INVENTORY COULD BE DISPOSED OF AT LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE,  THE INVENTORY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  ADDITIONALLY, WE PERIODICALLY EXAMINE OUR INVENTORY IN THE CONTEXT OF INVENTORY  TURNOVER, SALES TRENDS, COMPETITION AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS, AND WE RECORD PROVISIONS  TO INVENTORY RESERVE WHEN WE DETERMINE CERTAIN INVENTORY IS UNLIKELY TO BE SOLD.  IF RESERVED INVENTORY IS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN INVENTORY  AND INVENTORY RESERVES ARE MADE. OUR INVENTORY RESERVE WAS $190,000 AS OF MARCH 31,  2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ESTIMATION  IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NET DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS, WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUFFICIENT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME  IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS, BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO REALIZE THE  BENEFIT OF THESE ASSETS. WE EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED ASSETS  QUARTERLY AND ASSESS THE NEED FOR VALUATION ALLOWANCES OR REDUCTION OF EXISTING  ALLOWANCES QUARTERLY. NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS RECORDED AS WE BELIEVE IT IS  MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.  WE HAD $353,735 OF NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 AND $572,655 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  INCLUDED $62,671 IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND $55,886 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018.  12  TABLE  OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE PERCENTAGE OF  REVENUE AND YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS FOR THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS.  PERCENTAGE  OF REVENUE  YEAR ENDED MARCH 31  YEAR-  TO-YEAR  CHANGE  2019  2018  REVENUE  PRODUCT SALES  95.5%  91.5%  (7.4  )%  CONTRACT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  4.5%  8.5%  (53.5  )%  TOTAL REVENUE  100.0%  100.0%  (11.4  )%  COST OF SALES  19.7%  21.0%  (16.9  )%  GROSS PROFIT  80.3%  79.0%  (9.9  )%  EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  15.5%  12.4%  10.9%  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  4.6%  4.8%  (14.7  )%  TOTAL EXPENSES  20.1%  17.2%  3.8%  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  60.2%  61.8%  (13.7  )%  INTEREST INCOME  6.7%  5.2%  14.6%  INCOME BEFORE TAXES  66.9%  67.0%  (11.5  )%  INCOME TAX PROVISION  12.1%  20.4%  (47.5  )%  NET INCOME  54.8%  46.6%  4.3%  TOTAL REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 11% COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A 7% DECREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AND A 54% DECREASE IN CONTRACT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN PRODUCT SALES WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO DECREASED PURCHASES BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN CONTRACT RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT REVENUE WAS DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS.  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR FISCAL 2019 INCREASED TO  80% FROM 79% FOR FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A MORE PROFITABLE REVENUE MIX.  TOTAL EXPENSES INCREASED 4% FOR FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018, DUE TO AN 11% INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY AN 15% DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE  INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NEW PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  WAS DUE TO STAFFING CHANGES.  INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 15% IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON OUR MARKETABLE  SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR SECURITIES.  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 18% OF INCOME  BEFORE TAXES FOR FISCAL 2019, COMPARED TO 30% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE  WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF A DECREASE IN THE FEDERAL TAX RATE AND CERTAIN OTHER  PROVISIONS WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES.  NET INCOME INCREASED 4% IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES,  INCREASED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, A DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE, AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.  13  TABLE  OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $6,877,304 AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $4,755,082 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. THE $2,122,222  INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS DUE TO $14,218,994 IN NET CASH PROVIDED  BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $7,059,328 NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES,  LESS $19,156,100 NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED  TO PRODUCT SALES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT REVENUE AS OUR PRIMARY  SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL FOR FISCAL 2019 AND 2018. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS $14,218,994 FOR FISCAL 2019 AND $15,151,928 FOR FISCAL 2018.  INVENTORY INCREASED $614,437 IN FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKETABLE SECURITY MATURITIES OF $20,800,000, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY FIXED ASSETS PURCHASES OF $68,265 AND MARKETABLE SECURITY PURCHASES  OF $13,672,407.  PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS WERE $68,265 IN FISCAL  2019 AND $604,800 IN FISCAL 2018. PURCHASES WERE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT  AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND WERE FINANCED  WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES CAN VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DEPENDING ON OUR NEEDS AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASING  OPPORTUNITIES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2019 WAS DUE TO $19,374,040 IN CASH DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET  BY NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK OF $217,940 FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  IN ADDITION TO CASH DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS PAID  IN FISCAL 2019, ON MAY 1, 2019 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD HAD DECLARED A  CASH DIVIDEND OF $1.00 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, OR $4,846,010 BASED ON SHARES  OUTSTANDING AS OF APRIL 26, 2019, TO BE PAID MAY 31, 2019. WE PLAN TO  FUND DIVIDENDS THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM  MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. ALL FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE SUBJECT TO BOARD  APPROVAL AND SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH AND MARKETABLE  SECURITY BALANCES, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS THE  BOARD MAY DEEM RELEVANT. FURTHERMORE, DIVIDENDS MAY BE MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED  AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.  WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH GENERATED  FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE ADEQUATE FOR OUR NEEDS AT LEAST THROUGH FISCAL 2020.  OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS CONSIST OF PURCHASE  COMMITMENTS AND THE OPERATING LEASE FOR OUR FACILITY. WE BELIEVE THESE ARRANGEMENTS  HAVE NO MATERIAL CURRENT OR ANTICIPATED FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY, CASH  FLOWS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION.  14  TABLE  OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "NVE CORP /NEW/", "CIK": 724910, "Date": "2019-05-01T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NVEC", "Name": "Nve Corp", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3674.0, "Business": "MN", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 411424202.0, "key": "20190501NVEC", "labelr1": -5.778947368421048, "labelr2": 0.4021896994749184, "labelr3": 1.2573717592077394, "labelr4": -2.934065934065936, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.36430305, "prof1": 0.63569695, "return1&2": 0.946, "return1&2&3": 0.9578947368421054, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9297894736842106, "return2": 1.0040218969947492, "return1": 0.9422105263157896, "return3": 1.0125737175920777, "return4": 0.9706593406593408, "4_day_return": -7.0210526315789386, "cumulative_return1": 0.09220734235566452, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0012577406931148748, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.331302897182689e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 9.943065622749252e-08, "indexx": 2344, "cumreturn1b": 0.9073556479217606, "cumreturndow": 0.9978760145285372, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9953707562991826}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2345, "level_0": 2369, "index": 4598, "text": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ALONG WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION REGARDING OUR EXPECTATIONS OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER NON-HISTORICAL STATEMENTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  COMMVAULT IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES. COMMVAULT WAS INCORPORATED IN 1996 AS A DELAWARE CORPORATION. THE COMMVAULT SOFTWARE PLATFORM IS AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL, INTEGRATED DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTION, BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP ON A SINGLE PLATFORM AND UNIFIED CODE BASE. ALL SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY SHARE THE SAME BACK-END TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER THE BENEFITS OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PROTECTING, MANAGING, AND ACCESSING DATA. THE SOFTWARE ADDRESSES MANY ASPECTS OF DATA MANAGEMENT IN THE ENTERPRISE, WHILE PROVIDING SCALABILITY AND CONTROL OF DATA AND INFORMATION.  IN FISCAL 2018 THE COMPANY ALSO STARTED SELLING APPLIANCES THAT INTEGRATE THE COMMVAULT SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE AND ADDRESS A WIDE-RANGE OF BUSINESS NEEDS AND USE CASES, RANGING FROM SUPPORT FOR REMOTE OR BRANCH OFFICES WITH LIMITED IT STAFF UP TO LARGE CORPORATE DATA CENTERS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPORT AND FIELD OPERATIONS.  COMMVAULT SOFTWARE ENABLES OUR CUSTOMERS TO SIMPLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY PROTECT AND MANAGE THEIR ENTERPRISE DATA THROUGHOUT ITS LIFECYCLE, FROM THE MOBILE WORKER TO THE REMOTE OFFICE, TO THE DATA CENTER, COVERING THE LEADING OPERATING SYSTEMS, RELATIONAL DATABASES, VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENTS AND APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING TODAY\u2019S DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES, OUR CUSTOMERS CAN REALIZE LOWER CAPITAL COSTS THROUGH MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THEIR ENTERPRISE-WIDE STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS. THIS INCLUDES THE AUTOMATED MOVEMENT OF DATA FROM HIGHER COST TO LOWER COST STORAGE DEVICES THROUGHOUT ITS LIFECYCLE, AND THROUGH SHARING AND BETTER UTILIZATION OF STORAGE RESOURCES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE. WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH REDUCED OPERATING COSTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING FAST APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT, REDUCED TRAINING TIME, LOWER COST OF STORAGE MEDIA CONSUMABLES, PROACTIVE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS, AND LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. WE ALSO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPORT AND FIELD OPERATIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WE HAD LICENSED OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO OVER  28,000  REGISTERED CUSTOMERS.  HISTORY AND BACKGROUND  IN EARLY 2000, WE LAUNCHED COMMVAULT GALAXY FOR BACKUP AND RECOVERY, A STORAGE INDUSTRY AWARD WINNER. IN THE YEARS SINCE, COMMVAULT HAS FORGED NUMEROUS ALLIANCES WITH TOP SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND HARDWARE VENDORS TO ENHANCE CAPABILITIES AND TO CREATE A PREMIERE SUITE OF DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. IN 2002, WE LAUNCHED OUR SINGLE-PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION OF OUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO STORING, MANAGING, AND ACCESSING DATA.  HISTORICALLY, OUR SOFTWARE LICENSES HAVE TYPICALLY PROVIDED FOR A PERPETUAL RIGHT TO USE OUR SOFTWARE AND WERE SOLD ON A PER TERABYTE CAPACITY BASIS, PER SOLUTION SETS INSTANCE BASIS, ON A PER-COPY BASIS, OR AS SITE LICENSES.  CAPACITY BASED SOFTWARE LICENSES PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH UNLIMITED LICENSES OF SPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BASED ON A DEFINED LEVEL OF TERABYTES OF DATA UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A RESULT, WHEN WE SELL OUR PLATFORM THROUGH A TERABYTE BASED CAPACITY LICENSE, CERTAIN OF THE VARIOUS COMMVAULT FUNCTIONALITIES ARE BUNDLED INTO ONE CAPACITY BASED PRICE.  INSTANCE BASED LICENSES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL MACHINE BACKUPS, ENDPOINTS, OR EMAIL BOXES.  THESE INSTANCE BASED LICENSES ALSO INCLUDE VARIOUS FUNCTIONALITIES BUNDLED INTO ONE INSTANCE BASED PRICE.  SITE LICENSES GIVE THE CUSTOMER THE ADDITIONAL RIGHT TO DEPLOY THE SOFTWARE ON A LIMITED BASIS DURING A SPECIFIED TERM.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON SUBSCRIPTION AND OTHER REPEATABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MARKET. ANY OF OUR LICENSING MODELS (CAPACITY, INSTANCE BASED, ETC.) CAN BE SOLD VIA A SUBSCRIPTION ARRANGEMENT.  IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHT TO USE THE SOFTWARE OVER A DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME.  THE CAPACITY OF THE LICENSE IS FIXED AND THE CUSTOMER HAS MADE AN UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT TO PAY.  SOFTWARE REVENUE IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 40% OF SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE WAS SOLD UNDER A SUBSCRIPTION MODEL. WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE TO CONTINUE INCREASE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  WE ALSO SELL TO SOME CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS, VIA UTILITY, OR PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODELS.  IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS ACTUAL USAGE IS REGULARLY MEASURED AND BILLED.  REVENUE IN THESE UTILITY ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SOFTWARE IS USED.  30  THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE CONTINUES TO GO THROUGH ACCELERATING CHANGES AS THE RESULT OF COMPOUNDING DATA GROWTH AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO PURSUE AN AGGRESSIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN BOTH DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. OUR DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL BACKUP, BUT ALSO NEW INNOVATIONS IN DE-DUPLICATION, DATA MOVEMENT, VIRTUALIZATION, SNAP-BASED BACKUPS AND ENTERPRISE REPORTING. OUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT INNOVATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS OF ARCHIVING, EDISCOVERY, RECORDS MANAGEMENT, GOVERNANCE, OPERATIONAL REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON BOTH THE DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TRENDS IN THE MARKETPLACE AND, IN FACT, A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR EXISTING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE UTILIZED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH NEW TECHNOLOGIES DISCUSSED ABOVE. WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE CHANGING INDUSTRY DEMANDS WITH OUR COMMVAULT SUITE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE RELEASES, THE DEVELOPMENT, RELEASE AND TIMING OF ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY REMAIN AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND OUR SOLUTIONS OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT BE WIDELY ADOPTED.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO OBSOLESCENCE. WE CONTINUALLY DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE UPDATES TO OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH EVOLVING INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE MUST ADDRESS EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT MAY RENDER OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS OBSOLETE.  IN FISCAL 2018 WE ALSO STARTED SELLING A BACKUP APPLIANCE WHICH INTEGRATES OUR SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE.  IF OUR FORECAST EXCEEDS OUR ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS, A SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNER MAY ASSESS ADDITIONAL CHARGES OR WE MAY INCUR COSTS RELATED TO EXCESS INVENTORY, EACH OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS.  FOR EACH OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WE PROVIDE FULL SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT GENERALLY AVAILABLE RELEASE AND ONE PRIOR RELEASE. WHEN WE DECLARE A PRODUCT RELEASE OBSOLETE, A CUSTOMER NOTICE IS DELIVERED TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF OBSOLESCENCE ANNOUNCING CONTINUATION OF FULL PRODUCT SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. WE PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF EXTENDED ASSISTANCE SUPPORT IN WHICH WE ONLY PROVIDE EXISTING WORKAROUNDS OR FIXES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. WE DO NOT HAVE EXISTING PLANS TO MAKE ANY OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS PERMANENTLY OBSOLETE.  SOURCES OF REVENUES  WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FROM SALES OF LICENSES OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. WE DO NOT CUSTOMIZE OUR SOFTWARE FOR A SPECIFIC END-USER CUSTOMER. WE SELL OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND PRODUCTS TO END-USER CUSTOMERS BOTH DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR SALES FORCE AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH OUR GLOBAL NETWORK OF VALUE-ADDED RESELLER PARTNERS, SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, CORPORATE RESELLERS AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  44%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  45%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017.  IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS, WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE FROM OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE AND APPROXIMATELY ONE-QUARTER OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE FROM NEW CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD IS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM LARGE CUSTOMER SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS DEALS, WHICH WE REFER TO AS ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS. ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS (TRANSACTIONS GREATER THAN $0.1 MILLION) REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  65%  OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  59%  FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND  56%  FOR  FISCAL 2017.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WAS  93%  OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  86%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  87%  IN  FISCAL 2017  . SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WAS  7%  OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  14%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  13%  IN  FISCAL 2017  . THE DOLLAR VALUE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY $19.7 MILLION  , OR  7%  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . THE DOLLAR VALUE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH DIRECT DISTRIBUTION  DECREASED  $21.6 MILLION  , OR  50%  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . DEALS INITIATED BY OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE ARE SOMETIMES TRANSACTED THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS BASED ON END-USER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS IN OUR CONTROL AND CAN CAUSE THIS OVERALL PERCENTAGE SPLIT TO VARY FROM FISCAL YEAR TO FISCAL YEAR. AS SUCH, THERE MAY BE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DOLLARS AND PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH OUR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM TIME TO TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GROWTH OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE, DERIVED FROM BOTH OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL PARTNERS AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, ARE KEY ATTRIBUTES TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BOTH OUR CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS AND DIRECT SALES FORCE IN THE FUTURE, BUT WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT MORE REVENUE TO BE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OVER THE LONG TERM. THE FAILURE OF OUR INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OR OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE TO EFFECTIVELY SELL OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AGREEMENT IS WITH HITACHI VANTARA (HITACHI) AND ALLOWS THEM TO MARKET, SELL AND SUPPORT OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND/OR INCORPORATE OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS INTO THEIR OWN HARDWARE PRODUCTS. OUR OEM PARTNERS, INCLUDING HITACHI, HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO RECOMMEND OR OFFER OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS EXCLUSIVELY OR AT ALL, AND THEY HAVE NO MINIMUM SALES REQUIREMENTS AND CAN TERMINATE OUR RELATIONSHIP AT ANY TIME.  31  WE ALSO HAVE NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING OUR NORTH AMERICAN COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND OUR U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MARKET WITH ARROW ENTERPRISE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS, INC. (ARROW), A SUBSIDIARY OF ARROW ELECTRONICS, INC. PURSUANT TO THESE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THESE DISTRIBUTORS\u2019 PRIMARY ROLE IS TO ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY MANAGING OUR RESELLER PARTNERS AND LEVERAGING THEIR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY  38%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES THROUGH ARROW IN  FISCAL 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  36%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018  AND APPROXIMATELY  36%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2017  . IF ARROW WAS TO DISCONTINUE OR REDUCE THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR AGREEMENT WITH ARROW WAS TERMINATED, AND IF WE WERE UNABLE TO TAKE BACK THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR RESELLER CHANNEL OR FIND ANOTHER NORTH AMERICAN DISTRIBUTOR TO REPLACE ARROW, THEN IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS.  OUR SERVICES REVENUE WAS  56%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  55%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017  . OUR SERVICES REVENUE IS MADE UP OF FEES FROM THE DELIVERY OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPDATES ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS FOR AN ANNUAL FEE BASED ON LICENSES PURCHASED AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE SUBSCRIBED. OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, IMPLEMENTATION AND POST-DEPLOYMENT SERVICES AND TRAINING, ALL OF WHICH TO DATE HAVE PREDOMINANTLY BEEN SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.  MOST OF OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ARE FOR A ONE-YEAR TERM. AS THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD APPROACHES, WE PURSUE THE RENEWAL OF THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. HISTORICALLY, MAINTENANCE RENEWALS HAVE REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. BECAUSE OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR BUSINESS, IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE NOT TO RENEW THEIR MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS WITH US ON BENEFICIAL TERMS, OR AT ALL, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE HARMED.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR SERVICES REVENUE WAS  77%  FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017  . OVERALL, OUR SERVICES REVENUE HAS LOWER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE. THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  92%  FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  98%  FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND  99%  FOR  FISCAL 2017  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS IS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR INTEGRATED APPLIANCE, WHICH INCLUDES HARDWARE. AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES REPRESENTED BY SERVICES REVENUE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  DURING FISCAL 2019, JOSEPH F. EAZOR, FORMER CEO OF RACKSPACE, INC (RACKSPACE), WAS A DIRECTOR ON OUR BOARD.  RACKSPACE HAS BEEN A CUSTOMER OF OURS SINCE 2006.  ON JULY 31, 2018, JOSEPH F. EAZOR RESIGNED FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. TOTAL RECOGNIZED REVENUE RELATED TO RACKSPACE FOR FISCAL  2019  THROUGH JULY 31, 2018 WAS  $0.6  MILLION.  DESCRIPTION OF COSTS AND EXPENSES  OUR COST OF REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COST OF APPLIANCE HARDWARE, THIRD-PARTY ROYALTIES AND OTHER COSTS SUCH AS MEDIA, MANUALS, TRANSLATION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS; AND  \u2022  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARY AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS IN PROVIDING CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE AS FOLLOWS  \u2022  SALES AND MARKETING  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, COMMISSIONS, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT BUSINESS EXPENSES, INCLUDING TRAVEL AND RELATED EXPENSES, SALES PROMOTION EXPENSES, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPENSES AND COSTS FOR MARKETING MATERIALS AND OTHER MARKETING EVENTS (SUCH AS TRADE SHOWS AND ADVERTISING);  \u2022  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  , WHICH IS PRIMARILY THE EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND MODIFYING EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL AND RELATED EXPENSES; CONTRACT LABOR EXPENSE AND CONSULTING FEES AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, CERTIFICATION AND TESTING OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATENT REGISTRATION OF SUCH SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS;  32  \u2022  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR OUR EXECUTIVE, ACCOUNTING, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY ARE OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES, SUCH AS OUTSIDE LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES, COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INSURANCE; AND  \u2022  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  , CONSISTS OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY FOR OUR OWNED CORPORATE CAMPUS HEADQUARTERS LOCATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT WE USE FOR INFORMATION SERVICES AND IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND TEST LABS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\u2019 IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE APPROXIMATELY  47%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  46%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND 44% FOR  FISCAL 2017  . THE INCOME STATEMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR EACH APPLICABLE MONTH IN A PERIOD. TO THE EXTENT THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE TRANSLATION OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUE, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, OUR REVENUE, OPERATING EXPENSES AND NET INCOME WILL GENERALLY DECREASE FOR OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  USING THE AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM  FISCAL 2018  , OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $5.2 MILLION, OUR SERVICES REVENUE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $4.4 MILLION, OUR COST OF SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $1.0 MILLION AND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $5.2 MILLION FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS FOR  FISCAL 2019.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION PRIMARILY FROM CASH BALANCES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESULTING TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. WE RECOGNIZED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OF  $1.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $0.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  , AND  $0.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN PRESENTING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED THEREIN. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE RELATE TO MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AS THEY PERTAIN TO FUTURE EVENTS. WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE REQUIRE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. IN APPLYING OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE MUST DETERMINE WHICH PORTIONS OF OUR REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY (GENERALLY SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE) AND WHICH PORTIONS MUST BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS (GENERALLY SERVICES REVENUE). WE ANALYZE VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE SELLING PRICE OF UNDELIVERED SERVICES WHEN SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, OUR PRICING POLICIES, THE CREDIT-WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN HELPING US TO MAKE SUCH JUDGMENTS ABOUT REVENUE RECOGNITION. CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ON ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  WE DERIVE REVENUE FROM TWO PRIMARY SOURCES: SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES. SERVICES INCLUDE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (SOFTWARE UPDATES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT), CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, INSTALLATION SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION. A TYPICAL CONTRACT INCLUDES BOTH LICENSES AND SERVICES.  OUR SOFTWARE LICENSES TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR A PERPETUAL RIGHT TO USE OUR SOFTWARE. WE ALSO SELL TERM-BASED SOFTWARE LICENSES THAT EXPIRE, WHICH ARE REFERRED TO AS SUBSCRIPTION ARRANGEMENTS. WE DO NOT CUSTOMIZE OUR SOFTWARE AND INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE NOT REQUIRED. THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED BEFORE RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND IS FUNCTIONAL WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, UPDATES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE IS FUNCTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS DISTINCT AS THE USER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE SOFTWARE ON ITS OWN. SOFTWARE AND PRODUCT REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED AND/OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AS THIS IS THE POINT THE USER OF THE SOFTWARE CAN DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM THE FUNCTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE REVENUE RELATED TO THE RENEWAL OF SUBSCRIPTION SOFTWARE LICENSES EARLIER THAN THE BEGINNING OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.  33  IN FISCAL 2018, WE ALSO STARTED SELLING APPLIANCES THAT INTEGRATE OUR SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE AND ADDRESS A WIDE-RANGE OF BUSINESS NEEDS AND USE CASES, RANGING FROM SUPPORT FOR REMOTE OR BRANCH OFFICES WITH LIMITED IT STAFF UP TO LARGE CORPORATE DATA CENTERS. REVENUE RELATED TO APPLIANCES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE APPLIANCES PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER; TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY.  SERVICES REVENUE INCLUDES REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. CUSTOMER SUPPORT INCLUDES SOFTWARE UPDATES ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, TELEPHONE SUPPORT, INTEGRATED WEB-BASED SUPPORT AND BUG FIXES OR PATCHES. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS CUSTOMER SUPPORT CONTRACTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SOFTWARE PURCHASES THE SUPPORT IS RELATED TO. CUSTOMER SUPPORT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.  OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, INSTALLATION SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION. CUSTOMER EDUCATION SERVICES INCLUDE COURSES TAUGHT BY OUR INSTRUCTORS OR THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS. REVENUE RELATED TO OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION SERVICES IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS CONTAIN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SEPARATELY IF THEY ARE DISTINCT. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BASIS. STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING THE RESIDUAL APPROACH. STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED BASED ON OBSERVABLE TRANSACTIONS WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S TYPICAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  IS TYPICALLY SATISFIED  WHEN PAYMENT IS  TYPICALLY DUE  HOW STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IS  TYPICALLY ESTIMATED  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  SOFTWARE LICENSES  UPON SHIPMENT OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD (POINT IN TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SHIPMENT EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES WHICH ARE PAID FOR OVER TIME  RESIDUAL APPROACH  APPLIANCES  WHEN CONTROL OF THE APPLIANCES PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER; TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF DELIVERY  RESIDUAL APPROACH  CUSTOMER SUPPORT REVENUE  SOFTWARE UPDATES  RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACT (OVER TIME)  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD  OBSERVABLE IN RENEWAL TRANSACTIONS  CUSTOMER SUPPORT  RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACT (OVER TIME)  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD  OBSERVABLE IN RENEWAL TRANSACTIONS  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES (EXCEPT FOR EDUCATION SERVICES)  AS WORK IS PERFORMED (OVER TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SERVICES BEING PERFORMED  OBSERVABLE IN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  EDUCATION SERVICES  WHEN THE CLASS IS TAUGHT (POINT IN TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SERVICES BEING PERFORMED  OBSERVABLE IN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  34  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  UNDER ASC 740, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN, IN THE OUR JUDGMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE WEIGH THE AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LEVELS OF PRE-TAX INCOME, LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, EXPECTATIONS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PRE-TAX INCOME, AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WE CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON THE AMOUNT, AND TREND, OF PRE-TAX LOSS IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ITS GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THEREFORE HAVE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE IMPACT OF THE REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TO ZERO.  THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN THE FUTURE, CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATES REGARDING THE REALIZABILITY OF OUR GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND AS A RESULT, FILE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY TAXING AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR JURISDICTIONS AS THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, GERMANY, NETHERLANDS AND UNITED KINGDOM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUES  TOTAL REVENUES  INCREASED  $11.6 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FROM  $699.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $711.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  DECREASED  $1.8 MILLION  , OR  1%  , FROM  $311.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $309.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE REPRESENTED  44%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  45%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018.  THE OVERALL  DECREASE  IN SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN TRANSACTIONS LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION. SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM TRANSACTIONS LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION  DECREASED  $17.9 MILLION  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  .  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE AMOUNT OF ENTERPRISE TRANSACTION REVENUE (TRANSACTIONS GREATER THAN $0.1 MILLION), WHICH  INCREASED  BY  $16.0 MILLION  , OR  9%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  .  ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  65%  AND  59%  OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  INCREASE  IN ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  17%  INCREASE  IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS OF THIS TYPE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  7%  DECREASE  IN THE AVERAGE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS. THE AVERAGE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY  $272,000  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND APPROXIMATELY  $292,000  IN  FISCAL 2018.  WE TRACK SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT ARE TRACKED ARE THE AMERICAS (UNITED STATES, CANADA, LATIN AMERICA), EMEA (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA) AND APAC (AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, SOUTHEAST ASIA, CHINA).  AMERICAS, EMEA AND APAC REPRESENTED 55%, 31% AND 14% OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS AND APAC WAS 1%, WHILE EMEA DECREASED 5%.  \u25aa  THE INCREASE IN AMERICAS SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 21% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM NON-ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE SIZE OF ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS.  \u25aa  EMEA SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DECREASED AS A RESULT OF A 11% DECLINE IN NON-ENTERPRISE TRANSACTION REVENUE. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE IN ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, EMEA SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE DECLINED 2% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25aa  THE INCREASE IN APAC WAS THE RESULT OF A 10% INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS THAT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4% DECREASE IN NON-ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, APAC SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE INCREASED 5% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR.  OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN EMEA AND APAC IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THE  \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\u2019 IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  SECTION.  35  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL (RESELLERS AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS)  INCREASED  $19.7 MILLION  , OR  7%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  , AND SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE  DECREASED  $21.6 MILLION  , OR  50%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE SEE THE  \u201cSOURCES OF REVENUE\u201d  SECTION.  SERVICES REVENUE.  SERVICES REVENUE  INCREASED  $13.4 MILLION  , OR  3%  , FROM  $387.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $401.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . SERVICES REVENUE REPRESENTED  56%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  55%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE NET  INCREASE  IN SERVICES REVENUE IS DUE TO A  $12.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AS A RESULT OF SOFTWARE SALES TO NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWAL AGREEMENTS WITH OUR INSTALLED SOFTWARE BASE.  COST OF REVENUES  TOTAL COST OF REVENUES  INCREASED  $18.9 MILLION  , OR  19%  , FROM  $98.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $117.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . TOTAL COST OF REVENUES REPRESENTED  16%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO 14% IN  FISCAL 2018  .  THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY SALES OF OUR HYPERSCALE APPLIANCES.  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE.  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  $25.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  $7.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  , REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 8% OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO 2% IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IS RELATED TO ADDITIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ROYALTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR APPLIANCE AND HYPERSCALE PRODUCT OFFERINGS. AS SALES OF OUR APPLIANCES AND HYPERSCALE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO RAMP, WE EXPECT THE COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE.  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE  INCREASED  $0.4 MILLION  FROM  $90.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $91.3 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  .

THE  DECREASE  IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A $23.0 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, A $6.1 MILLION DECREASE IN TRAVEL EXPENSES, AND A $2.3 MILLION DECREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  DECREASED  TO  52%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  59%  IN  FISCAL 2018.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED  $1.6 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FROM  $91.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $92.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  .

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS  13%  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  . INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR COMMVAULT, AND WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED SPENDING RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  $10.2 MILLION  , OR  11%  , FROM  $90.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $100.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $11.2 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO A NON-ROUTINE SHAREHOLDER MATTER.  THE COSTS ARE FOR PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO OUR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE SHAREHOLDER AND CONSULTING FEES INCURRED WITH THE OPERATIONAL REVIEW WHICH WAS AGREED TO AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. FISCAL 2019 ALSO INCLUDES $12.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE MODIFICATION OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN  FISCAL 2019  INCLUDES  $1.0 MILLION  OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS COMPARED TO  $0.1 MILLION  OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS RECOGNIZED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN  FISCAL 2018  . GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS  14%  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  13%  IN  FISCAL 2018.  RESTRUCTURING.  IN FISCAL 2019 WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN OUR SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS REDUCE COSTS ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONAL AREAS.  DURING THE YEAR, WE HAVE INCURRED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF  $14.8 MILLION  .  THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATE PRIMARILY TO SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  THESE CHARGES INCLUDE $2.6 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RELATED TO MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING AWARDS GRANTED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRUCTURING.  WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULT. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED COSTS, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYEE MORALE AND THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATIONAL AND GROWTH TARGETS DUE TO THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, ANY OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE  INCREASED  $0.9 MILLION  , FROM  $9.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $10.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019.  36  INTEREST INCOME  INTEREST INCOME  INCREASED  $3.3 MILLION  , FROM  $2.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $5.5 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  .  THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND INCREASED YIELD ON THOSE INVESTMENTS.  OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE IN U.S. TREASURY BILLS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $6.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO EXPENSE OF  $58.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  .  IN FISCAL 2018 WE DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ITS GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THEREFORE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE IMPACT OF THE REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TO ZERO.  THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  RELATES PRIMARILY TO CURRENT FOREIGN TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE WAS  $328.0 MILLION  .  INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE WAS  $102.7 MILLION  OF CASH EQUIVALENTS WHICH CONSISTED OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY  $130.3 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INVESTED IN U.S. TREASURY BILLS. IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY OUR FOREIGN LEGAL ENTITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY  $153.7 MILLION  . THESE BALANCES ARE DISPERSED ACROSS MANY INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH DISPERSION MEETS THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN LEGAL ENTITIES. IN THE EVENT WE NEEDED TO REPATRIATE FUNDS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, SUCH REPATRIATION WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS BY LOCAL LAWS AND/OR TAX CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED $132.7  MILLION OF COMMON STOCK (2.1 MILLION SHARES) UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. OUR FUTURE STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IS SUBJECT TO THE BUSINESS JUDGMENT OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND OTHER ANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM REDUCES THE DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND OUR PREVIOUS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STOCK OFFERINGS THROUGH THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK.  AS OF MAY 3, 2019, THERE IS $111.0 MILLION REMAINING IN THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2020. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AS WELL AS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS.

IN  FISCAL 2019  , CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET  INCOME  ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH CHARGES AND INCREASES IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  IN FISCAL 2018, CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH CHARGES AND INCREASES IN DEFERRED SERVICES REVENUE AS A RESULT OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FROM NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWAL AGREEMENTS WITH OUR INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  37  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.3 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $18.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  $28.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017  .

IN FISCAL 2018, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO $10.9 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF U.S. TREASURY BILLS, AND $7.0 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FISCAL 2017, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO $21.6 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF U.S. TREASURY BILLS, AND $6.4 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $90.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $82.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  $22.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017  . THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $132.7  MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $42.0 MILLION  OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $112.2 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $30.1 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $50.0 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $21.3 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND $6.2 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  A SUMMARY OF THE CASH USED FOR THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING.  YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  CASH USED FOR REPURCHASES (IN THOUSANDS)  $132,697  $112,218  $49,998  SHARES REPURCHASED (IN THOUSANDS)  2,115  2,098  982  AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE  $62.74  $53.49  $50.91  WORKING CAPITAL  INCREASED  $6.0 MILLION  FROM  $322.6 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  TO  $328.7 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE  INCREASE  IN WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUR CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCINGS OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DURING THIS PERIOD. ADEQUATE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE RAISED BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WILL RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY OBTAINING LOANS FROM THIRD PARTIES, THE TERMS OF THOSE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NEGATIVE COVENANTS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, AND WOULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO FUND ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE. IF FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OR ENHANCE OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  38  SUMMARY DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  OUR MATERIAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS CONSIST OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER FACILITIES AND OPERATING LEASES. SOME OF THESE LEASES HAVE FREE OR ESCALATING RENT PAYMENT PROVISIONS. WE RECOGNIZE RENT EXPENSE UNDER LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH \u201cSELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA\u201d  AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OPERATING DATA, WHICH ARE INCLUDED  ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, INCLUDING INFORMATION  WITH RESPECT TO OUR PLANS AND STRATEGY FOR OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND \u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d SECTIONS OF  THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  WE OPERATE ON A FISCAL CALENDAR WHICH, IN A GIVEN FISCAL  YEAR, CONSISTS OF A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO JANUARY 31ST. THE REPORTING PERIODS CONTAINED  IN OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT CONTAIN 52 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH  ENDED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2019, 53 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, WHICH ENDED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2018, AND 52 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS  IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, WHICH ENDED ON JANUARY 28, 2017. HISTORICAL RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED  FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.  OVERVIEW  FRANCESCA\u2019S\u00ae IS A SPECIALTY RETAILER WHICH OPERATES  A NATIONWIDE-CHAIN OF BOUTIQUES PROVIDING CUSTOMERS A UNIQUE, FUN AND PERSONALIZED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. THE MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT  IS DIVERSE AND BALANCE MIX OF APPAREL, JEWELRY, ACCESSORIES AND GIFTS. AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, FRANCESCA\u2019S\u00ae OPERATED 727  BOUTIQUES IN 47 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND ALSO SERVED ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH WWW.FRANCESCAS.COM, ITS ECOMMERCE WEBSITE.  IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE CONSIDER A  VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE KEY MEASURES FOR DETERMINING HOW OUR BUSINESS IS PERFORMING ARE NET SALES, COMPARABLE  SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE  HAVE DEVELOPED A TURNAROUND PLAN TO STABILIZE AND THEN GROW OUR BUSINESS. THIS PLAN INCLUDES STRATEGIES AIMED AT ENHANCING  OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, WHICH HAS DECLINED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED COMPARABLE SALES DECLINES. SEE ABOVE  UNDER ITEM 1. BUSINESS, \u201cOUR GROWTH STRATEGY\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, COMPARABLE SALES  DECLINED 14% AND IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARABLE SALES DECLINED 11%. IN EACH CASE, WE BELIEVE THE DECLINES WERE PRIMARILY THE  RESULT OF OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT MERCHANDISE PLANNING, BUYING AND PROMOTIONAL POLICIES TO LEVERAGE OUR  STRENGTH OF DELIVERING ON-TREND MERCHANDISE AT A COMPELLING VALUE, CAUSING DECLINES IN BOTH CONVERSION RATES AND BOUTIQUE  TRAFFIC. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROWTH IN OUR EXPENSE STRUCTURE HAS OUTPACED OUR REVENUES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE  CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND WE ENDED THE YEAR WITH $20.1 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED  BELOW)  . SU  BSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN  ADDITIONAL $5.0 MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND  FROM THE IRS. AS OF MAY 2, 2019, OUR ESTIMATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.0 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED THE  RECEIPT OF $8.5 MILLION INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS WE RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THE ESTIMATED CASH  BALANCE AS OF MAY 2, 2019 REFLECTS A $5.0 MILLION PAYMENT ON OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BRINGING THE  OUTSTANDING BALANCE BACK DOWN TO $10.0 MILLION AND OUR ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY TO $14.6 MILLION AS OF THAT DATE.  WE  ALSO INCURRED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $33.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $30.0 MILLION IN FISCAL  2017. OUR OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 INCLUDES A NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR  NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S TURNAROUND PLAN AND EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC  AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSED BELOW AND REVERSAL OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER\u2019S (\u201cCEO\u201d) RESIGNATION. SEE BELOW, \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.  IN  ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED A REVIEW OF OUR STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES  TO MAXIMIZE VALUE.  WE RETAINED ROTHSCHILD & CO AND OTHER ADVISORS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXPLORATION OF STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES WILL RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION OR OTHER RESULT  THAT ENHANCES VALUE. ALSO AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WE HAVE NOT SET A TIMETABLE FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW PROCESS, AND WE  DO NOT INTEND TO COMMENT ON THE PROCESS UNLESS A SPECIFIC TRANSACTION OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,  THE PROCESS IS CONCLUDED, OR IT IS OTHERWISE DETERMINED THAT FURTHER DISCLOSURE IS APPROPRIATE OR REQUIRED BY LAW.  IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2019, MR. STEVE LAWRENCE RESIGNED  FROM HIS POSITION AS OUR PRESIDENT AND CEO AND MR. MICHAEL PRENDERGAST OF ALVAREZ & MARSAL WAS APPOINTED AS OUR INTERIM  CEO. ALSO IN FEBRUARY 2019,  OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER DEPARTED THE COMPANY.  WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF A FORMAL SEARCH FOR A PERMANENT CEO AND EITHER A GENERAL MERCHANDISING MANAGER OR A CHIEF  MERCHANDISING OFFICER, BUT ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN EXPERIENCED INTERIM LEADERSHIP TEAM IN PLACE TO EXECUTE ON  OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  30  WE RECORDED A NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $20.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO 153 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES FOR WHICH THE REMAINING, OR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING,  NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. SEE NOTE 4, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS ASSET  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCLUDED A $4.9 MILLION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-OFF OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT  ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEE ABOVE UNDER  ITEM 1. BUSINESS, \u201cOUR SALES CHANNELS\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 INCLUDED A $17.1  MILLION NON-CASH VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018 BECAUSE WE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SEE NOTE  5, INCOME TAXES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.

SEE NOTE 4, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  (3)  NOT MEANINGFUL.  31  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED 9%, OR $43.6 MILLION, TO $428.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO $471.7 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 DUE TO A 14% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOLLOWING AN 11% DECREASE  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2017 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION OF SALES FOR THE 53  RD  WEEK. THE DECREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES WAS DUE TO DECLINES IN BOTH BOUTIQUE TRAFFIC AND CONVERSION RATE. THERE WERE 698 COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES AND 29  NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, COMPARED TO 657 AND 64, RESPECTIVELY, AT FEBRUARY 3, 2018.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS WAS FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY  $265.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017. COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED BY $10.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 DUE TO A DECREASE  IN SALES VOLUME AND MARKED OUT-OF-STOCK CHARGES BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ECOMMERCE SHIPPING EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF HIGHER  ECOMMERCE SALES PENETRATION. OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED BY $10.2 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE 32 NEW BOUTIQUES  OPENED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 26 BOUTIQUES CLOSED DURING THE YEAR; 12 OF WHICH WERE CLOSED DURING THE LAST WEEK OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  ADDITIONALLY, WE SAW INCREASES IN AVERAGE RENT AND RELATED EXPENSES DUE TO INCREASED PENETRATION OF BOUTIQUES IN HIGH TRAFFIC CENTERS,  DEPRECIATION DUE TO INCREASED COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES AND REMODELS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUE REMODELS.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY  COSTS INCREASED TO 61.9% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FROM 56.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AN UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE OF 580 BASIS POINTS. THIS  UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE WAS DRIVEN BY 440 BASIS POINTS DELEVERAGING OF OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES AS WELL AS THE INCREASE  IN OCCUPANCY COSTS DISCUSSED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, MERCHANDISE MARGINS WERE LOWER BY 140 BASIS POINTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED  TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASED MARKDOWNS AND HIGHER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK  CHARGES AND INVENTORY RESERVES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY  $176.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017. THE $2.7 MILLION INCREASE IN MARKETING, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND DEPRECIATION WAS OFFSET  BY A DECREASE OF $2.4 MILLION IN SELLING EXPENSES DUE TO LABOR EFFICIENCIES AT THE BOUTIQUE LEVEL AND THE $0.8 MILLION REVERSAL  OF PREVIOUSLY AWARDED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIGNATION OF OUR PRIOR CEO. PART OF THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL  FEES WAS DUE TO $1.5 MILLION IN CONSULTING EXPENSES INCURRED ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TURNAROUND PLAN AND EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC AND  FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES THAT COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2019.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES INCREASED TO 41.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FROM 37.4% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELEVERAGING OF EXPENSES RESULTING  FROM LOWER SALES.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  WE RECOGNIZED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $20.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 MOSTLY RELATED TO 153 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES FOR WHICH THE REMAINING, OR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING,  NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. ADDITIONALLY, WE WROTE OFF $4.9 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT ARE NO LONGER INTENDED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF  POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEE ABOVE UNDER \u201cRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\u201d  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED TO $7.5 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2018 COMPARED TO $14.3 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017. WE DID NOT INCUR AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT ASSOCIATED  WITH OUR NET LOSS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $17.1 MILLION VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  SEE ABOVE UNDER \u201cRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 22.4% AND 47.9% IN FISCAL  YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DUE TO THE $17.1 MILLION  VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d) ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017. THIS CHANGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $3.3  MILLION NON-CASH EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 AS A RESULT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS USING  THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TAX ACT. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE  TAX ACT AND DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS WAS NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED PROVISIONAL AMOUNT. SEE NOTE  5, \u201cINCOME TAXES,\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  32  FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 3, 2018  JANUARY 28, 2017  VARIANCE  IN DOLLARS  AS A %  OF NET  SALES  (1)  IN DOLLARS  AS A %  OF NET  SALES  (1)  IN DOLLARS%  BASIS  POINTS  (1)  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  NET SALES  $471,678  100.0%  $487,188  100.0%  $(15,510  )  (3  )%  -  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  264,915  56.2%  258,561  53.1%  6,354  2%  310  GROSS PROFIT  206,763  43.8%  228,627  46.9%  (21,864  )  (10  )%  (310  )  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  (2)  176,543  37.4%  160,561  33.0%  15,982  10%  440  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  (2)  258  0.1%  141  0.0%  117  83%  10  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  29,962  6.4%  67,925  13.9%  (37,963  )  (56  )%  (750  )  INTEREST EXPENSE  (452  )  (0.1  )%  (464  )  (0.1  )%  12  3%  -  OTHER INCOME  346  0.1%  147  0.0%  199  135%  10  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  29,856  6.3%  67,608  13.9%  (37,752  )  (56  )%  (760  )  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  14,295  3.0%  25,607  5.3%  (11,312  )  (44  )%  (230  )  NET INCOME  $15,561  3.3%  $42,001  8.6%  $(26,440  )  (63  )%  (530  )  (1)  PERCENTAGE TOTALS OR DIFFERENCES IN THE ABOVE TABLE MAY  NOT EQUAL THE SUM OR DIFFERENCE OF THE COMPONENTS DUE TO ROUNDING.

SEE NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED 3%, OR $15.5 MILLION, TO $471.7 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $487.2 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO AN 11% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES  COMPARED TO A 2% INCREASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE THE DECLINE IN BOUTIQUE CONVERSION  RATE AS OUR MERCHANDISE DID NOT RESONATE WITH OUR GUESTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, HURRICANES HARVEY  AND IRMA ADVERSELY IMPACTED COMPARABLE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 105 BASIS POINTS, MOSTLY AS A RESULT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION  WE EXPERIENCED AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 50 NET NEW BOUTIQUES OPENED  SINCE THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND SALES DURING THE 53  RD  WEEK OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. THERE WERE 657 COMPARABLE  BOUTIQUES AND 64 NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT FEBRUARY 3, 2018 COMPARED TO 604 AND 67, RESPECTIVELY, AT JANUARY 28, 2017.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 2%, OR $6.4  MILLION, TO $264.9 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $258.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED BY  $2.0 MILLION DUE TO LOWER MARKED OUT-OF-STOCK ACTIVITY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ECOMMERCE SHIPPING COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER  ECOMMERCE SALES PENETRATION. OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED BY $8.3 MILLION PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BOUTIQUES  IN OPERATION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2017 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY  COSTS INCREASED TO 56.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 FROM 53.1% IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, AN UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE OF 310 BASIS POINTS. THIS  UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE WAS DUE TO A 230 BASIS POINTS DELEVERAGING OF OCCUPANCY COSTS AS WELL AS 80 BASIS POINTS DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE  MARGIN. THE LOWER MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED MARKDOWNS IN ORDER TO SELL THROUGH SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY LOWER MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK CHARGES AS WE BENEFITTED FROM OUR IN-SEASON CLEARANCE STRATEGY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  10%, OR $16.0 MILLION, TO $176.5 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $160.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. THIS  INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN $11.1 MILLION INCREASE IN BOUTIQUE AND CORPORATE PAYROLL TO SUPPORT OUR LARGER BOUTIQUE BASE  AND ECOMMERCE OPERATIONS, A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY  AND INFRASTRUCTURE, $2.0 MILLION PRIOR YEAR NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIGNATION OF OUR PRIOR CEO AND THE RELATED  SEARCH PROCESS, A $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES DUE TO NEW MARKETING INITIATIVES, AND A $1.4 MILLION INCREASE  IN WEBSITE, LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.0 MILLION DECREASE IN SHORT- AND  LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE EXPENSES AS THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE METRICS WERE NOT ACHIEVED OR ARE NOT EXPECTED TO  BE ACHIEVED.  33  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES INCREASED TO 37.4% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 FROM 33.0% IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BOUTIQUE, TECHNOLOGY  AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS DELEVERAGING OF EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED TO $14.3 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2017 COMPARED TO $25.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 DUE TO THE DECREASE IN TAXABLE INCOME. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 47.9% AND  37.9% IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DUE TO A $3.3 MILLION NON-CASH EXPENSE  AS A RESULT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS USING THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TAX ACT ENACTED  IN DECEMBER 2017.

IN ADDITION, TO  PREPARE FOR THESE PERIODS, WE MUST ORDER AND KEEP IN STOCK MORE MERCHANDISE THAN WE CARRY DURING OTHER PARTS OF THE YEAR. WE EXPECT  INVENTORY LEVELS, ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, GENERALLY TO REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS IN THE  FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INCREASED NET SALES DURING THIS PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THIS SEASONALITY AND GENERALLY  BECAUSE OF VARIATION IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, WE EXPERIENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN NET SALES AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING  THE YEAR.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS  AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (SEE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION).  ADDITIONALLY, ON APRIL 22, 2019, WE RECEIVED AN INCOME TAX REFUND CHECK OF $8.5 MILLION FROM THE IRS. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE  FOR FUNDING NORMAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE OPERATION OF OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUES AND ECOMMERCE BUSINESS, THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN, AND PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL, IF ANY, UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE MAY  USE CASH OR OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT MERCHANDISE IMPORTS OR FOR OTHER CORPORATE  PURPOSES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM  SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES AND  WE TYPICALLY HAVE UP TO 45 DAYS TO PAY OUR INVENTORY VENDORS AND UP TO 60 DAYS TO PAY OUR OTHER VENDORS.  ON FEBRUARY 2, 2019, WE HAD $20.1 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS, $10.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND $12.3 MILLION OF BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY. SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $5.0 MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER OUR  ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  AS OF MAY  2, 2019, OUR ESTIMATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.0 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED THE RECEIPT OF  $8.5 MILLION  INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS WE RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THE ESTIMATED CASH BALANCE AS OF MAY 2, 2019 REFLECTS  A $5.0 MILLION PAYMENT ON OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BRINGING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE BACK DOWN TO $10.0 MILLION  AND OUR ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY TO $14.6 MILLION AS OF THAT DATE. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL  OUR COVENANTS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  34  WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, THE $8.5 MILLION  IRS TAX REFUND CHECK RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019 DISCLOSED ABOVE AND ALONG WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST  REQUIREMENTS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CASH FLOW  A SUMMARY OF OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  FEBRUARY 3,  JANUARY 28,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $9,533  $24,825  $72,171  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (26,199  )  (26,778  )  (21,844  )  PROVIDED BY (USED) IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  5,438  (19,918  )  (53,349  )  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(11,228  )  $(21,871  )  $(3,022  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NET LOSS OR INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ASSET  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND DEFERRED TAXES), THE EFFECT OF WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES AND TENANT ALLOWANCES  RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $15.3  MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO A NET LOSS AS WELL  AS LOWER TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS  FOR INVENTORY PURCHASES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $47.3 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME AND HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR INVENTORY PURCHASES AND OTHER PAYABLES, INCLUDING SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, SUPPLIES, LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES FOR NEW BOUTIQUES, REMODELS, IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES AS WELL AS INVESTMENT IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND  OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITY.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  FEBRUARY 3,  JANUARY 28,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR.  NEW BOUTIQUES  $8,357  $19,280  $13,370  REMODELS  10,537  2,189  3,651  EXISTING BOUTIQUES  3,869  3,125  24  TECHNOLOGY  2,535  1,826  4,067  CORPORATE AND DISTRIBUTION  901  358  740  $26,199  $26,778  $21,852  OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND  2016 WERE $26.2 MILLION, $26.8 MILLION AND $21.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A MAJORITY OF OUR SPENDING IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 WERE INVESTED  IN BOUTIQUE REMODELS AT $10.5 MILLION AND IN NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AT $19.3 MILLION AND $13.4 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND  2016, RESPECTIVELY. SPENDING FOR NEW BOUTIQUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUES THAT WILL OPEN IN THE SUBSEQUENT FISCAL  YEAR.  35  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  2019  FEBRUARY 3,  2018  JANUARY 28,  2017  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT BOUTIQUE COUNT)  NEW BOUTIQUES.  NUMBER OF NEW BOUTIQUES OPENED  32  60  64  AVERAGE COST PER NEW BOUTIQUE  $320  $293  $235  AVERAGE TENANT ALLOWANCE PER NEW BOUTIQUE  $44  $57  $77  TENANT ALLOWANCE COLLECTED  $3,400  $3,100  $3,700  REMODELS.  NUMBER OF BOUTIQUES REMODELED  81  17  32  AVERAGE COST PER REMODELED BOUTIQUE  $149  $129  $114  THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES DURING FISCAL  YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS DUE TO HIGHER COSTS OF FURNITURE AND FIXTURES AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING OUR NEW BOUTIQUE  DESIGN PILOTED IN OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUES LAST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, THE AVERAGE BOUTIQUE BUILD-OUT COSTS WERE HIGHER IN FISCAL  YEARS 2018 AND 2017 COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS DUE TO OPENING LARGER BOUTIQUES, PARTICULARLY IN OUTLET LOCATIONS. THE AVERAGE SIZE  OF BOUTIQUES OPENED IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016 WERE 2,033 SQUARE FEET, 1,714 SQUARE FEET AND 1,597 SQUARE FEET, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE TENANT ALLOWANCE IN EACH YEAR WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO OUR CONTINUED FOCUS IN LOWERING RENTAL RATES. TENANT  ALLOWANCES ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION IN RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. THE AVERAGE COLLECTION PERIOD FOR THESE ALLOWANCES  IS APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AFTER BOUTIQUE OPENING. AS A RESULT, WE FUNDED THE COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES AND REMODELS WITH CASH FLOW  FROM OPERATIONS, TENANT ALLOWANCES FROM OUR LANDLORDS, OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AS NEEDED.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMMENCED A BOUTIQUE REFRESH PROGRAM  AND REMODELED 81 HIGH VOLUME EXISTING BOUTIQUES. WE VIEW THIS REMODEL PROGRAM AS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT TO CONTINUALLY ENHANCE  THE DIFFERENTIATED CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF REMODELS IN EACH YEAR  WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO MORE EXTENSIVE UPGRADE OR ENHANCEMENT PERFORMED AT EACH LOCATION.  THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF FISCAL YEARS 2018,  2017 AND 2016 WERE USED FOR INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING BOUTIQUES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CORPORATE OFFICES AND FOR DISTRIBUTION  FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. OUR SPENDING FOR EXISTING BOUTIQUES TOTALED $3.9 MILLION, $3.1 MILLION AND LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS MOSTLY SPENT IN RELOCATING EXISTING BOUTIQUES. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS  IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 WERE THE HIGHEST DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEM AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTS  SYSTEM.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR  2019 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT WILL BE SPENT ON FUNDING THE OPENING OF FOUR NEW BOUTIQUES  AND INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING BOUTIQUES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF  BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, IF ANY, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM THE  EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE RELATED TAX CONSEQUENCE.  NET CASH PROVIDED  BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2018 WAS $5.4 MILLION WHICH CONSISTED OF $10.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND $0.5 MILLION PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016 WERE $19.9 MILLION AND $53.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH MAINLY CONSISTED OF REPURCHASES  OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  PRIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON AUGUST 30, 2013, FRANCESCA\u2019S COLLECTIONS, INC., AS  BORROWER, AND ITS PARENT COMPANY, FRANCESCA\u2019S LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED  AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, AS ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO. THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED CAPACITY OF $75.0 MILLION (INCLUDING  UP TO $10.0 MILLION FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT) AND WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON AUGUST 30, 2018.  ON MAY 25, 2018,  CONCURRENT WITH ENTERING INTO THE ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW, THE SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT  AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED.  36  ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT  ON MAY 25, 2018, FRANCESCA\u2019S  HOLDINGS CORPORATION (THE \u201cHOLDINGS\u201d), AS A GUARANTOR, CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AS BORROWERS (THE  \u201cBORROWERS\u201d), AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES AS GUARANTORS (TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY AND THE BORROWERS, THE  \u201cLOAN PARTIES\u201d), ENTERED INTO AN ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH  JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR REVOLVING  COMMITMENTS OF $50.0 MILLION (INCLUDING UP TO $10.0 MILLION FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT) AND MATURES ON MAY 25, 2023. AVAILABILITY  UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO A CUSTOMARY BORROWING BASE COMPRISED OF: (A) A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE  BORROWER\u2019S CREDIT CARD ACCOUNTS  (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT); AND  (B) A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE BORROWER\u2019S ELIGIBLE INVENTORY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), AND REDUCED  BY (C) CERTAIN CUSTOMARY RESERVES AND  ADJUSTMENTS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT). THE CREDIT AGREEMENT  ALSO CONTAINS AN INCREASE OPTION PERMITTING THE BORROWERS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, TO ARRANGE WITH LENDERS FOR  ADDITIONAL REVOLVING COMMITMENTS FOR UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $25.0 MILLION. ON FEBRUARY 2, 2019, WE HAD $10.0 MILLION OF  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND $12.3 MILLION OF BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE  NO LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019. SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $5.0  MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS.  AS  OF MAY 2, 2019, WE HAD AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF $10.0 MILLION AFTER A $50 MILLION ON OUR OUTSTANDING BORROWING AND AN  ESTIMATED $14.6 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF THAT DATE.  ALL OBLIGATIONS OF EACH LOAN PARTY UNDER  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING AND FUTURE DIRECT AND  INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE BORROWERS. ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND THE GUARANTEES  OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS (AS WELL AS BANKING SERVICES OBLIGATIONS AND ANY INTEREST RATE HEDGING OR OTHER SWAP AGREEMENTS), ARE SECURED  BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING AND FUTURE DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY  OWNED DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REQUIRES THE LOAN PARTIES  TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RESTRICTION PROHIBITING THE LOAN PARTIES FROM DECLARING OR MAKING DIVIDEND  PAYMENTS, EXCEPT THAT HOLDINGS MAY DO SO SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE PAYMENT CONDITIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PREVIOUS  FISCAL YEAR DOES NOT CONTAIN A \u201cGOING CONCERN\u201d OR LIKE QUALIFICATION OR EXCEPTION AND ALSO REQUIRES THE LOAN PARTIES  TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RATIO OF (I) EBITDAR (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) MINUS UNFINANCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (AS DEFINED  IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), TO (II) FIXED CHARGES OF 1.00 TO 1.00 DURING PERIODS WHEN AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT)  IS LESS THAN $6.0 MILLION (OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN LESS THAN $6.0 MILLION AS FURTHER SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) (SUCH RATIO,  THE \u201cFIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO\u201d). AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, OUR BORROWING AVAILABILITY WAS MORE THAN $6.0 MILLION,  RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BEAR  INTEREST AT A RATE EQUAL TO AN APPLICABLE MARGIN PLUS, AT THE OPTION OF THE BORROWERS, EITHER (A) IN THE CASE OF BASE RATE BORROWINGS,  A RATE EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (1) THE PRIME RATE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., (2) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 1/2 OF 1.00%, AND  (3) LIBOR FOR AN INTEREST PERIOD OF ONE MONTH PLUS 1.00% (SUBJECT TO A 0.0% LIBOR FLOOR), PROVIDED THAT THAT THE INTEREST RATE  FOR BASE RATE BORROWINGS (INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN) SHALL BE NO LESS THAN 1.50% PER ANNUM, OR (B) IN THE  CASE OF LIBOR BORROWINGS, A RATE EQUAL TO THE LIBOR FOR THE INTEREST PERIOD RELEVANT TO SUCH BORROWING SUBJECT TO A 0.00% FLOOR.  THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT RANGES FROM -0.50% TO 0.00% PER ANNUM WITH RESPECT TO BASE RATE  BORROWINGS AND FROM 1.25% TO 1.75% PER ANNUM WITH RESPECT TO LIBOR BORROWINGS, IN EACH CASE BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED  LEVELS OF THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE BORROWERS TO PAY A COMMITMENT FEE FOR THE UNUSED  PORTION OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF 0.20% PER ANNUM.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY  AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS, ON THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY AND ITS  SUBSIDIARIES TO (I) INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; (II) CREATE LIENS; (III) MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS, LOANS AND ADVANCES;  (IV) SELL ASSETS; (V) PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS OR MAKE OTHER RESTRICTED PAYMENTS; (VI) PREPAY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS; (VII)  ENGAGE IN MERGERS OR CONSOLIDATIONS; (VIII) CHANGE THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES; (IX) ENGAGE IN CERTAIN  TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; (X) ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT DIVIDENDS FROM SUBSIDIARIES OR THE ABILITY OF SUBSIDIARIES  TO GRANT LIENS UPON THEIR ASSETS; AND (XI) AMEND CERTAIN CHARTER DOCUMENTS AND MATERIAL AGREEMENTS GOVERNING SUBORDINATED AND JUNIOR  INDEBTEDNESS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT,  INCLUDING: (I) FAILURE TO PAY PRINCIPAL, INTEREST, FEES OR OTHER AMOUNTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WHEN DUE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT  ANY APPLICABLE GRACE PERIOD; (II) ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY PROVING TO HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INCORRECT WHEN MADE OR DEEMED  MADE; (III) A CROSS DEFAULT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS; (IV) BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY EVENTS; (V) UNSATISFIED  MATERIAL FINAL JUDGMENTS; (VI) A \u201cCHANGE OF CONTROL\u201d; (VII) CERTAIN DEFAULTS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY  ACT OF 1974; (VIII) THE INVALIDITY OR IMPAIRMENT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY SECURITY INTEREST; AND (IX) BREACH OF COVENANTS IN  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT,  THE COMPANY INCURRED $0.5 MILLION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE  FACILITY.  37  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PLEASE  REFER TO NOTE 7 TO OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\u201d  IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF OUR ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET SALES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  MANAGEMENT BASES ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES  AND EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR  CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE  A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY. SEE NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, TO OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF OUR SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THE FOLLOWING REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d)  606, \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\u201d ON FEBRUARY 4, 2018 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. PRIOR PERIOD  AMOUNTS WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION.\u201d AS A RESULT  OF ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE RECORDED AN ADJUSTMENT OF $2.1 MILLION, NET OF $0.7 MILLION TAX EFFECT, TO THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF  RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN TIMING OF RECOGNIZING GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE COST OF ESTIMATED  RETURNS IS NOW INCLUDED IN CURRENT ASSETS RATHER THAN NETTED WITH THE ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS, AND ECOMMERCE SALES ARE NOW  RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT RATHER THAN DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT RELATED TO THIS CHANGE DETERMINED TO  BE IMMATERIAL.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN CONTROL OF THE MERCHANDISE IS TRANSFERRED  TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH MERCHANDISE. FOR BOUTIQUE SALES, CONTROL  IS TRANSFERRED AT THE POINT AT WHICH THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES AND PAYS FOR THE MERCHANDISE AT THE REGISTER. FOR ECOMMERCE SALES, CONTROL  IS TRANSFERRED WHEN MERCHANDISE IS TENDERED TO A THIRD PARTY CARRIER FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IS  THE STATED PRICE OF THE MERCHANDISE, NET OF ANY DISCOUNT, SALES TAX COLLECTED AND ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS, AND, IN THE CASE OF  ECOMMERCE SALES, INCLUDES SHIPPING REVENUE. CASH IS TYPICALLY RECEIVED ON THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS,  WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES FUTURE RETURNS ON PREVIOUSLY SOLD MERCHANDISE BASED ON RETURN HISTORY  AND CURRENT SALES LEVELS. ESTIMATED RETURNS ARE PERIODICALLY COMPARED TO ACTUAL SALES RETURNS AND ADJUSTED, IF APPROPRIATE. WE  DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE WILL BE MATERIAL CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS WE  USE TO CALCULATE OUR MERCHANDISE RETURN RESERVE; HOWEVER, IF THE ACTUAL RATE OF MERCHANDISE RETURNS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR  OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES WHILE THE ASSOCIATED  COST OF MERCHANDISE IS INCLUDED AS PART OF PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  WE VALUE MERCHANDISE INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST AND NET  REALIZABLE VALUE ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST BASIS. INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND FREIGHT COSTS. WE RECORD MERCHANDISE  RECEIPTS AT THE TIME THEY ARE DELIVERED TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR TO OUR BOUTIQUES DIRECTLY FROM VENDORS.  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO IDENTIFY SLOW-MOVING  MERCHANDISE. IN ORDER TO CLEAR SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE, WE USE PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWNS OR MARK CERTAIN ITEMS OUT-OF-STOCK AND DISPOSE  OF SUCH INVENTORY AT A PACE SUITABLE FOR OUR MERCHANDISING STRATEGY. EACH PERIOD, WE EVALUATE RECENT SELLING TRENDS AND THE RELATED  PROMOTIONAL EVENTS OR PRICING STRATEGIES IN PLACE TO SELL THROUGH THE CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS. PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWNS, ADDITIONS  TO THE LOWER OF COST AND NET REALIZABLE VALUE (\u201cLNRV\u201d) RESERVE OR INVENTORY DISPOSAL MAY OCCUR WHEN INVENTORY EXCEEDS  OUR EXPECTED CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR REASONS OF STYLE, SEASONAL ADAPTATION, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCE, LACK OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE  OF FASHION ITEMS, COMPETITION OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE INVENTORY IN STOCK WILL NOT SELL AT ITS CURRENTLY TICKETED PRICE.  SUCH MARKDOWNS OR DISPOSALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON EARNINGS, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT AND AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AFFECTED. IN  ADDITION, THE ANTICIPATED DEPLOYMENT OF NEW MERCHANDISE IS REFLECTED WITHIN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWN PLAN AS SUCH  NEW INVENTORY, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL DISPLACE MERCHANDISE CURRENTLY ON-HAND.  WE ALSO ESTIMATE AN INVENTORY SHRINKAGE RESERVE FOR THE PERIOD  OF TIME BETWEEN THE LAST PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNT AND THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATE FOR SHRINKAGE RESERVE CAN BE AFFECTED  BY CHANGES IN MERCHANDISE MIX AND CHANGES IN ACTUAL SHRINKAGE TRENDS.  38  CHANGES TO THE LNRV AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN COST  OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  IF THERE ARE MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS  WE USE TO CALCULATE OUR LNRV OR SHRINKAGE RESERVES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  WE EVALUATE LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE AND HELD FOR SALE  WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THOSE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE  GROUPED AND EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT A BOUTIQUE  LEVEL. IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, WE CONSIDER BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS.  THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE UNDISCOUNTED  FUTURE CASH FLOWS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ASSET AND COMPARING IT AGAINST ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET  IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET AND ITS DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE  ASSET\u2019S HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, CURRENT SALES TRENDS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS DEEMED MATERIAL, AND DISCOUNTED  USING A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. THE INPUTS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE CONSIDERED AS  LEVEL 3 INPUTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ASSESSMENTS, WE RECORDED NON-CASH  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $20.1 MILLION, $0.3 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THESE  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATE TO 153, 3 AND 2 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, FOR WHICH  THE REMAINING NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018, THE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES INCLUDES A $4.9 MILLION WRITE-OFF OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT ARE NO LONGER  INTENDED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE LIABILITY METHOD. UNDER  THIS METHOD, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE IS ACCRUED, AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED  FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS AND THE FINANCIAL  REPORTING BASIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE REALIZATION OF THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT OCCUR.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED  TAX RATES IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS WHEN THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM A  CHANGE IN TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE OF THE CHANGE. CHANGES  IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW EFFECTIVE  ON JANUARY 1, 2018. UPON ENACTMENT, WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AND ONE-TIME NON-CASH DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE OF $3.3 MILLION DUE  TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE REDUCTION OF THE STATUTORY FEDERAL TAX RATE TO 21%.  THIS EXPENSE IS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS  OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT AND DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS WAS NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED PROVISIONAL AMOUNT.  WE PERFORM AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS  NECESSARY AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. BASED ON AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING  PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME, FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND TAX PLANNING  STRATEGIES, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT IS NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT IT WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN FUTURE PERIODS  AND THEREFORE, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS ESTABLISHED AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF  $17.1 MILLION ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE  EVIDENCE IN FUTURE PERIODS AND, IN THE EVENT THAT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, WE MAY REVERSE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE  PERIODS WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR REPORTED NET INCOME IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  A TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION MAY BE RECOGNIZED  WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS  OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS. INCOME TAX POSITIONS MUST MEET A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD  TO BE RECOGNIZED.  WE RECOGNIZE TAX LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND  ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES WHEN THE COMPANY\u2019S JUDGMENT CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF NEW INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY  AVAILABLE. INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THERE WERE NO UNCERTAIN  TAX POSITIONS REQUIRING ACCRUAL AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2018.  39  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT DATE  FAIR VALUE AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (WHICH GENERALLY IS THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD).  BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, FORFEITURES WERE RECOGNIZED AS THEY OCCUR RATHER THAN ESTIMATING EXPECTED FORFEITURES.  WE RECOGNIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTING TO $1.3 MILLION,  $2.4 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEARS  2018 AND 2016 INCLUDED A $0.8 MILLION AND $2.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  RELATED TO THE FORFEITURE OF UNVESTED AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR PREVIOUS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WHO RESIGNED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE  POSITION IN THOSE YEARS. THE NET REVERSAL WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  RESTRICTED STOCK  THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCKS AWARDS IS DETERMINED BASED  ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE AWARD DATE. FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS, COMPENSATION  EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED.  WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF VESTING AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND ADJUST STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SUCH  ASSESSMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES TOTALING $0.9 MILLION,  $1.2 MILLION AND $0 IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT  THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  STOCK OPTIONS  WE GENERALLY USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE  THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, EXCEPT FOR STOCK OPTIONS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS FOR WHICH WE USE A MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION  MODEL. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE USING EACH OF THESE MODELS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.  \u00b7  EXPECTED VOLATILITY.  WE ESTIMATED EXPECTED VOLATILITY USING THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR OWN COMMON STOCK.  \u00b7  EXPECTED TERM.  THE EXPECTED TERM REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME OPTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING. DUE TO LACK OF  SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL DATA, WE USE THE \u201cSIMPLIFIED METHOD\u201d AS ALLOWED BY SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN TOPIC 14D2 TO  ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED TERM. THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD DEFINES EXPECTED TERM AS THE MIDPOINT BETWEEN THE VESTING DATE AND THE CONTRACTUAL  TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION.  \u00b7  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE.  THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON THE RATE OF TREASURY INSTRUMENTS WHOSE MATURITIES ARE  SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD BEING VALUED.  \u00b7  EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD.  THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTATIONS OF NOT PAYING DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON  STOCK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NO STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017.  THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2016 WAS ESTIMATED USING EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 54.2%, EXPECTED TERM OF 5.5  YEARS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 1.2%, AND EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD OF 0%.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE ARE NOT PARTY TO ANY OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS  OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND THE EFFECT SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  40  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  LESS THAN  MORE THAN  TOTAL  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  5 YEARS  (IN THOUSANDS)  LONG TERM DEBT  $10,000  $-  $-  $10,000  $-  ESTIMATED INTEREST ON DEBT  (1)  2,287  530  1,059  698  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (2)  244,891  48,644  80,141  57,067  59,039  MERCHANDISE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS  (3)  28,927  28,927  -  -  -  CONTRACTS FOR SOFTWARE APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION  5,934  3,170  2,540  224  -  (1)  INCLUDES $1.9 MILLION ESTIMATED INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING  BORROWING AND $0.4 MILLION UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, WE ESTIMATED THE INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING BORROWING  AND UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE USING $10.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING, $40.0 UNUSED REVOLVER COMMITMENT, 4.4% CURRENT INTEREST RATE AND 0.20%  UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE RATE UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  (2)  EXCLUDES COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE CHARGES, REAL ESTATE  TAXES AND CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSES WHICH AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 46% OF MINIMUM LEASE OBLIGATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE PRESENTED  BASED ON HISTORICAL COST. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION DUE TO THE IMPRECISE NATURE OF THE  ESTIMATES REQUIRED, WE BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, IF ANY, ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN  IMMATERIAL. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED  BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.

REFERENCES TO 2019, 2018 AND 2017 REFER TO THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY \u2013  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  OUR BUSINESS CHALLENGES -  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  IN ADDITION TO THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  18  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES I  N DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A PORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS O  N A PROACTIVE BASIS WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PR  ESSURE SEAL PRODUCTS, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MOLD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \u2013 THE STRONG U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018 ATTRACTED CHEAPER MATERIAL INTO THE UNITED STATES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPOSITION OF TRADE TARIFFS, WHICH IMPAIRED THE PRICE ADVANTAGE LARGER SUPPLIERS HAD OVER SMALLER COMPETITORS AND HELPED TO MAINTAIN PRICING.  HOWEVER, WITH THE SUBSEQUENT WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF FOREIGN IMPORTS FOR THE MOST PART DISSIPATED DURING MOST OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH HAS LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  MEANWHILE, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPACITY CAME OUT OF THE MARKET THIS TIME, EITHER PLANNED OR UNPLANNED, AS THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OF SEVERAL MILLS.  IN ADDITION, SOME MILLS MOVED CAPACITY FORMERLY USED FOR COATED PRODUCTION TO UNCOATED PRODUCTION DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO GET HIGHER MARGINS ON THESE PRODUCTS.  EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, THIS LED TO A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL GRADES DURING FISCAL 2019.  AT THIS LEVEL, SUPPLIERS HAVE HISTORICALLY RAISED PRICES IN THE MARKETPLACE, AND FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS NO EXCEPTION, WITH SUPPLIERS RAISING PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIES.  IN THE PAST, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE PRICING ADJUSTMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS TO TIMELY PASS ALONG THE REQUIRED PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END USERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR.  SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES HAVE STARTED TO CHANGE RECENTLY.  WITH THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE HAVE BEGUN TO INCREASE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING DOMESTIC DEMAND, HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  HISTORICALLY, THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE NORMALIZATION OF PRICING AND COSTS IN THE MARKETPLACE AT MORE TYPICAL LEVELS, BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF SEVERAL OF THE LARGER DOMESTIC PAPER MILLS, THIS HISTORICAL PENDULUM SWING IN PRICING MAY NOT OCCUR AND MANUFACTURER\u2019S MARGINS MAY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \u2013 MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTORS, ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  SOME CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND BETTER PRICING AND SERVICES, AND OTHER CUSTOMERS MAY BE FORCED TO RELOCATE THEIR BUSINESS TO THEIR NEW PARENT COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  WHILE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE HISTORICAL BUSINESS OF THESE CUSTOMERS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE DISCLOSURES AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY VALUATIONS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INCOME TAXES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THE MOST CRITICAL DUE TO THEIR EFFECT ON OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  19  WE MAINTAIN THE PENSION PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES. INCLUDED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE PENSION PLAN COSTS THAT ARE MEASURED USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  AS OUR PENSION PL  AN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITY RECORDED.  AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION ANALYSIS FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES. WE EVALUATE THESE AMOUNTS PERIODICALLY (AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR) TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED DURING THE YEAR THAT WOULD INDICATE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT.  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AS OF NOVEMBER 30 OF EACH FISCAL YEAR OR EARLIER IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THE COMPANY USES QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50%) THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN APPLYING THIS TEST INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, COST FACTORS AFFECTING THE BUSINESS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SHARE PRICE OF THE COMPANY.  IF QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE NOT DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN A ONE-STEP APPROACH IS APPLIED IN MAKING AN EVALUATION. THE EVALUATION UTILIZES MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING A MARKET APPROACH (MARKET PRICE MULTIPLES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES) AND AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS). THE COMPUTATIONS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SELECTION OF COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO FUTURE EARNINGS REFLECTING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND EARNINGS GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS. A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE SALES, OPERATING MARGINS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, AND GROWTH RATES. IF THE EVALUATION RESULTS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT BEING LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED.  A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 OR FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES UPON SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER IF THE TERMS OF THE SALE ARE FREIGHT ON BOARD (\u201c  FOB  \u201d) SHIPPING POINT (AND THEREFORE TITLE AND ALL RISKS OF OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING RISK OF LOSS, PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER UPON SHIPPING) OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, UPON DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IF THE TERMS OF THE SALE ARE FOB DESTINATION (AND THEREFORE TITLE AND ALL RISKS OF OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING RISK OF LOSS, PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER UPON DELIVERY).  NET SALES CONSIST OF GROSS SALES INVOICED TO CUSTOMERS, LESS CERTAIN RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES. RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. IN SOME CASES AND UPON CUSTOMER REQUEST, WE PRINT AND STORE CUSTOM PRINT PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER SPECIFIED FUTURE DELIVERY, GENERALLY WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. IN THIS CASE, RISK OF LOSS FROM OBSOLESCENCE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, THE CUSTOMER IS INVOICED UNDER NORMAL CREDIT TERMS AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN MANUFACTURING IS COMPLETE. APPROXIMATELY $10.3 MILLION, $9.7 MILLION, AND $10.7 MILLION OF REVENUE WERE RECOGNIZED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DURING FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AND FEBRUARY 28, 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES TO REFLECT ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED UPON HISTORICAL COLLECTION TRENDS, CURRENT ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS. WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS USING A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AGE OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EVALUATION OF CUSTOMERS\u2019 CURRENT AND PAST FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CREDIT SCORES, RECENT PAYMENT HISTORY, CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR SALES MANAGERS, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY.  20  OUR INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE  LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY VALUES ON HAND, USING SPECIFIC AGING CATEGORIES, AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY DEEMED OBSOLETE AND/OR SLOW-MOVING BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE AND ESTIMATED FUTURE USAGE TO ITS ESTIMATED NET REAL  IZABLE VALUE. AS ACTUAL FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY VARY FROM THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT, ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY VALUATIONS MAY BE REQUIRED.  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAXES IN EACH JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ESTIMATING OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPOSURE TOGETHER WITH ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE MUST THEN ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED BASED ON OUR HISTORY OF EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME INCLUDING TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR CARRY-BACK YEARS, AS WELL AS FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. TO THE EXTENT WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE MUST INCLUDE AN EXPENSE WITHIN THE TAX PROVISION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE  TAX  CUTS AND JOBS  ACT  (THE \"  TAX  ACT  \"). THE  TAX  ACT  INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME  TAX  SYSTEM INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A FEDERAL CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION FROM 35% TO 21%; LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND THE TRANSITION OF U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE  TAX  SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL  TAX  SYSTEM.  A MAJORITY OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE  TAX  ACT  ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. IN RESPONSE TO THE  TAX  ACT  , THE SEC STAFF ISSUED GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR THE  TAX  EFFECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  . THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES A ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD FOR COMPANIES TO COMPLETE THE ACCOUNTING. WE REFLECTED THE INCOME  TAX  EFFECTS OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  FOR WHICH THE ACCOUNTING IS COMPLETE. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INCOME  TAX  EFFECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  IS INCOMPLETE BUT WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE, WE RECORDED A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF A COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF THE  TAX  LAWS THAT WERE IN EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE ENACTMENT OF THE  TAX  ACT.  AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 21%, WE RE-VALUED OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF ENACTMENT, WITH RESULTING TAX EFFECTS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE REPORTING PERIOD OF ENACTMENT. THIS CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE RESULTED IN REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE BEING RECOGNIZED OF $3.6 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 DUE TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES BASED ON THE EXPECTED PREVAILING TAX RATE AT THE EXPECTED TIME OF THEIR REALIZATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE ASSESSMENTS AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ACCRUED LIABILITIES, MORE SPECIFICALLY OUR LIABILITIES RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AS THESE PLANS ARE SELF-FUNDED. TO HELP US IN THIS EVALUATION PROCESS, WE ROUTINELY GET OUTSIDE THIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENTS OF OUR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES UNDER EACH PLAN.  IN VIEW OF SUCH UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SINCE SUCH STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE WHEN MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THIS FINANCIAL OVERVIEW IS FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THE PRODUCTION AND SALES OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS, AND EXCLUDE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT, WHICH WE SOLD IN MAY 2016.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND THE COMPARATIVE FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017 ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLES BELOW.  21  CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  OPERATIONS - DATA (  IN THOUSANDS,  2019  2018  2017  EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  NET SALES  $400,782  100.0%  $370,171  100.0%  $356,888  100.0%  COST OF GOODS SOLD  277,422  69.2  252,969  68.3  252,158  70.7  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  123,360  30.8  117,202  31.7  104,730  29.3  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  73,490  18.3  69,222  18.8  62,537  17.5  (GAIN) LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS  (217  )  (0.1  )  162  \u2014  278  0.1  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  50,087  12.4  47,818  12.9  41,915  11.7  OTHER EXPENSE, NET  (153  )  \u2014  (909  )  (0.2  )  (1,882  )  (0.5  )  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  49,934  12.4  46,909  12.7  40,033  11.2  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  12,497  3.1  14,151  3.8  13,616  3.8  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  37,437  9.3%  32,758  8.9%  26,417  7.4%  EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX  \u2014  \u2014  147  \u2014  (24,637  )  (6.9  )  NET EARNINGS  $37,437  9.3%  $32,905  8.9%  $1,780  0.5%  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE - DILUTED  CONTINUING OPERATIONS  $1.45  $1.29  $1.03  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  \u2014  0.01  (0.96  )  NET EARNINGS  $1.45  $1.30  $0.07  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES INCREASED FROM $370.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO $400.8 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AN INCREASE OF 8.3%.  THE MARKET CONTINUES TO BE FAIRLY SOFT WITH COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES.  HOWEVER, DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR MADE DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION MORE ATTRACTIVE INTERNATIONALLY.  THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION, COUPLED WITH THE SHRINKING DOMESTIC MILL CAPACITY, RESULTED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR PAPER AND OTHER MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES DOMESTICALLY.  THOSE INCREASES, IF ABLE TO BE TIMELY PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, WOULD HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE NORMAL INDUSTRY SALES ATTRITION.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN JULY 2018, AND ABTL, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN APRIL 2018, ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET NORMAL INDUSTRY REVENUE DECLINES DUE TO PRINT ATTRITION AND OTHER CHANGES.  THESE TWO ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED OVER $44.7 MILLION IN NET SALES DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  OUR NET SALES INCREASED FROM $356.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2017 TO $370.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AN INCREASE OF 3.7%.  THE MARKET WAS FAIRLY SOFT WITH COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES.  HOWEVER, THE REVERSAL OF SOME OF THE U.S. DOLLAR\u2019S STRENGTH MADE DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION MORE ATTRACTIVE.  THIS FACTOR, ALONG WITH THE SHRINKING OF SOME DOMESTIC MILL CAPACITY, RESULTED IN PAPER PRICE INCREASES.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT PRINTING COMPANY, INC. AND ITS RELATED ENTITIES (\u201c  INDEPENDENT  \u201d), WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN JANUARY 2017, HAD A COMPARATIVE IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $39.3 MILLION ON OUR NET SALES LAST FISCAL YEAR.  THIS ACQUISITION REMAINS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET NORMAL INDUSTRY PRINT ATTRITION AND OTHER FACTORS.  22  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS INCREASED FROM $253.  0 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO $277.4 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019, OR 9.6%.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\u201c  MARGIN  \u201d) DECREASED FROM 31.7% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 30.8% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OUR MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD WAS IMPACTED PRIMARIL  Y BY THE INCREASED COST OF RAW MATERIALS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BY THE ACQUISITION OF ABTL AND WRIGHT, WHICH HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTED MARGIN.  THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED BY RAW MATERIAL AND FREIGHT COST INCREASES.  THE  TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICAL PRICE INCREASES WERE LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PA  SS THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THIS YEAR THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\u2019 ABILITY TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  THESE PRICE INCREASES WIL  L CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR COSTS START TO DECLINE DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE IN FOREIGN IMPORTS OR WEAKENING DOMESTIC DEMAND.  AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ACQUISITION OF WRI  GHT AND ABTL HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS AS NEITHER OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAD MARGINS APPROACHING OUR LEVEL.  WE BELIEVE ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURES AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, THEIR MARGINS WIL  L IMPROVE TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS.  OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM $252.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO $253.0 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018, OR 0.3%.  OUR GROSS MARGIN INCREASED FROM 29.3% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO 31.7% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018. IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, OUR MARGIN WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED MEDICAL EXPENSES DUE TO OUR MEDICAL CLAIMS EXCEEDING HISTORICAL LEVELS.  WE IMPLEMENTED A NEW COST REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES TO OUR HEALTH PLAN, AT THE START OF CALENDAR YEAR 2017.  WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR MARGIN BY OVER $4.0 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201c  SG&A  \u201d) EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6.2%, FROM $69.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO $73.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A EXPENSES DECLINED FROM 18.8% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 18.3% FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT AND ABTL ADDED APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN SG&A EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE SG&A EXPENSES AFTER ACQUISITIONS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, WHICH ALLOWS US TO INTEGRATE MANY OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES\u2019 BACK-OFFICE PROCESSES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018, OUR SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $6.7 MILLION, OR 10.7%, FROM $62.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO $69.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 18.8% AND 17.5% FOR THE FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT ADDED APPROXIMATELY $8.0 MILLION IN SG&A EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, OR 20.3% OF ITS RESPECTIVE NET SALES.  AS WE CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE THIS ACQUISITION INTO OUR CULTURE AND SYSTEMS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THESE EXPENSES TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORICAL SG&A PERCENTAGE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY (I) CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICE FOR HANDLING ITS TRADEMARKS/TRADE NAMES FROM AN INDEFINITE LIFE TO A FINITE LIFE METHOD ON MARCH 1, 2017 WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION TO SG&A EXPENSE DURING THE PERIOD, (II) PAID A SPECIAL BONUS TO OUR NON-MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES OF $500 PER EMPLOYEE IN DECEMBER 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT WHICH IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSE BY $1.2 MILLION, AND (III) PAID APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION MORE IN PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  (GAIN) LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $0.2 MILLION GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $0.2 MILLION LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THE CLOSING AND CONSOLIDATION OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE $0.3 MILLION LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE $0.5 MILLION LOSS ON THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED PROPERTY OFFSET BY THE $0.2 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF A SECOND UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, OUR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $50.1 MILLION, OR 12.4% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $47.8 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT AND ABTL CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $3.4 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR OPERATIONAL INCOME DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, OR 8.8%.  23  OUR  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS $47.8 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $41.9 MILLION, OR 11.7% OF NET SALES, FO  R FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 BY  APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION.  OTHER EXPENSE.  OTHER EXPENSE WAS $0.2 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED TO $0.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THIS DECREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE OF INVESTMENT INCOME IN FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OTHER EXPENSE WAS $0.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO $1.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THIS DECREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE OF INVESTMENT INCOME IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS WELL AS THE RECLASSIFICATION OF PENSION EXPENSE FROM COST OF GOODS SOLD AND SG&A EXPENSE TO OTHER EXPENSE-NET OF $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WERE 25.03%, 30.2%, AND 34.0%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX ACT.  THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT, DESPITE THE TAX ACT ONLY BEING IN EFFECT FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  NET EARNINGS (LOSS).  OUR NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $26.4 MILLION, OR $1.03 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017, $32.8 MILLION, OR $1.29 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $37.4 MILLION, OR $1.45 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH CONSISTED OF A WRITE-OFF OF A $2.0 MILLION RECEIVABLE ($1.4 MILLION, NET OF TAX) RELATING TO THE ESCROWED PURCHASE PRICE FROM THE SALE OF OUR APPAREL SEGMENT AND A $1.6 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE FINAL TAX BASIS ON ASSETS SOLD IN THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT.  NET LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS ($0.96) PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH CONSISTED OF THE NET EARNINGS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT OF $0.09 PER DILUTED SHARE AND THE NET LOSS FROM THE SALE OF $27.1 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR ($1.05) PER DILUTED SHARE.  THE LOSS FROM THE SALE INCLUDED THE WRITE-OFF OF THE BALANCE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $16.1 MILLION, OR $10.7 MILLION, NET OF TAXES.  OVERALL, THE COMPANY REALIZED NET EARNINGS OF $37.4 MILLION, OR $1.45 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, $32.9 MILLION, OR $1.30 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $1.8 MILLION, OR $0.07 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017  WORKING CAPITAL  $134,542  $133,773  $119,282  CASH  $88,442  $96,230  $80,466  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION, OR 0.6%, FROM $133.8 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES BY $13.6 MILLION, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH AND PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $11.2 MILLION, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $1.6 MILLION.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.5-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 5.3-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $14.5 MILLION, OR 12.1%, FROM $119.3 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2017 TO $133.8 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, INCREASED FROM 5.0-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO 5.5-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR CURRENT RATIO INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH.  CASH FLOW COMPONENTS  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $51,335  $45,290  $58,887  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(31,770  )  $(3,953  )  $86,090  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(27,353  )  $(25,573  )  $(72,468  )  24  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $51.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $45.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $58.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017, OR AN INCREASE OF $6.0 MILLION IN 2019 OVER 2018 AND A DECREASE OF $13.6 MILLION  IN 2018 OVER 2017.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THREE FACTORS: (I) A $4.5 MILLION INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS; (II) A $1.5 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; AND (III) A $3.4 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  THESE THREE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE OFFSET BY TWO NEGATIVE FACTORS: (I) AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $3.6 MILLION; AND (II) A $2.4 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  OUR DECREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FOUR FACTORS: (I) A DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RELATED TO OUR APPAREL SEGMENT OF $34.8 MILLION; (II) A DECREASE IN OUR DEFERRED TAXES OF $6.2 MILLION; (III) AN INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $2.7 MILLION; AND (IV) INCREASED EARNINGS OF $31.1 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $31.8 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $4.0 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $86.1 MILLION PROVIDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE $27.8 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE A $2.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE $26.0 MILLION INCREASE IN THE PURCHASES OF BUSINESSES.  THE DECREASE IN CASH IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF $107.4 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE ON MAY 25, 2016, OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $17.2 MILLION IN CASH USED FOR THE PURCHASES OF BUSINESSES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $27.4 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $25.6 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $72.5 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTED FROM TWO FACTORS: (I) $0.4 MILLION MORE IN DIVIDENDS WERE PAID IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018; AND (II) $1.5 MILLION MORE WAS USED TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE BOARD-APPROVED REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  THE DECREASE IN OUR CASH USED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 RESULTED FROM THREE FACTORS: (I) NO DEBT WAS PAID DOWN IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO $10.0 MILLION PAID DOWN IN 2017; (II) $34.9 MILLION LESS IN DIVIDENDS WERE PAID IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO 2017, WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL ONE-TIME DIVIDEND OF $1.50 PER SHARE THAT WAS PAID AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT; AND (III) $5.1 MILLION LESS WAS USED TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE BOARD-APPROVED REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO 2017.  STOCK REPURCHASE \u2013  THE BOARD HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH AUTHORIZED AMOUNT IS CURRENTLY UP TO $40.0 MILLION.  UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, SHARE PURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, SHARE PRICE, TRADING VOLUME AND OTHER FACTORS.  SUCH PURCHASES ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THESE REPURCHASES MAY BE COMMENCED OR SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME OR FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 247,788 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.42 PER SHARE.  SINCE THE PROGRAM\u2019S INCEPTION IN OCTOBER 2008, THERE HAVE BEEN 1,690,024 COMMON SHARES REPURCHASED AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $15.64 PER SHARE. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THERE WAS $13.6 MILLION AVAILABLE TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  UNRELATED TO THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 15 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE ITS SHARES UNDER ITS REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING FISCAL YEAR 2020 AS IT DETERMINES SUCH REPURCHASES TO BE IN ITS AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS BEST INTEREST.  25  CREDIT FACILITY  \u2013  THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, PURSUANT TO WHICH A CREDIT FACILITY HAS BEEN EXTENDED  TO THE COMPANY ( THE \u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \u201d).  THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURES ON AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CR  EDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AN  D CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSING OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE  COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (I) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (II) THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LEVER  AGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.50:1.00.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 3.0% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201c  EBITDA  \u201d).  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD $30.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AND $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $69.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL AS ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  WE DID NOT PAY ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT LINE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  PENSION PLAN \u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201c  ERISA  \u201d). DUE TO THE RECENT ENACTMENT OF THE MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21  ST  CENTURY (\u201c  MAP-21  \u201d) IN JULY 2012, PLAN SPONSORS CAN CALCULATE THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PENSION PLAN LIABILITY USING A 25-YEAR AVERAGE OF INTEREST RATES PLUS OR MINUS A CORRIDOR.  PRIOR TO MAP-21, THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN MEASURING THE PENSION LIABILITY WAS BASED ON THE 24-MONTH AVERAGE OF INTEREST RATES.  WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING EACH OF OUR LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN OUR CURRENT FUNDING STATUS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND ABSENT ANY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EVENT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTED SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE BETWEEN $1.0 MILLION TO $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDED STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDED, AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD A PREPAID PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE INCREASED THE DISCOUNT RATE WE USED TO CALCULATE OUR PENSION LIABILITY TO 4.1% FROM 4.05% USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH DECREASED OUR RECORDED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION (EACH 10 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE POTENTIALLY IMPACTS OUR COMPUTED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $900,000).  IN ADDITION, WE ADOPTED THE NEW MP-2018 MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RP-2014 MORTALITY TABLES (WHICH WERE ADOPTED FOUR YEARS AGO), WHICH REDUCED OUR RECORDED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION.  THE UPDATED MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE MP-2018 REFLECTS SLIGHTLY LOWER PROJECTED MORTALITY EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS SCALE MP-2017 UTILIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018\u2019S VALUATION OF LIABILITIES.  THE PROJECTED RETURN ON OUR PENSION ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.5% FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  INVENTORIES  \u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND OTHER NORMAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  26  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \u2013  T  HERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS S  INCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS OUR CONTRA  CTUAL COMMITMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 (IN THOUSANDS).

WE OWN AND OPERATE 49 RADIO STATIONS IN 16 U.S. MARKETS. OUR RADIO STATIONS CONSIST OF 38 FM AND 11 AM STATIONS LOCATED IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, FLORIDA, NEVADA, NEW MEXICO AND TEXAS. WE ALSO OPERATE ENTRAVISION SOLUTIONS AS OUR NATIONAL SALES REPRESENTATION DIVISION, THROUGH WHICH WE SELL ADVERTISEMENTS AND SYNDICATE RADIO PROGRAMMING TO MORE THAN 100 MARKETS STATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO PROVIDE DIGITAL ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ADVERTISERS TO REACH PRIMARILY ONLINE HISPANIC AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE. WE OPERATE A PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PLATFORM THAT DELIVERS DIGITAL ADVERTISING IN VARIOUS ADVERTISING FORMATS THAT ALLOWS ADVERTISERS TO REACH AUDIENCES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICES ON OUR OWNED AND OPERATED DIGITAL MEDIA SITES; THE DIGITAL MEDIA SITES OF OUR PUBLISHER PARTNERS; AND ON OTHER DIGITAL MEDIA SITES WE ACCESS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS AND EXCHANGES.  WE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING TIME ON TELEVISION STATIONS, RADIO STATIONS AND DIGITAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, AND FROM RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO WITH MVPDS. ADVERTISING RATES ARE, IN LARGE PART, BASED ON EACH MEDIUM\u2019S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TARGETED BY ADVERTISERS. WE RECOGNIZE ADVERTISING REVENUE WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE BROADCAST AND WHEN DISPLAY OR OTHER DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS RECORD IMPRESSIONS ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR THIRD PARTY PUBLISHERS OR AS THE ADVERTISER\u2019S PREVIOUSLY AGREED-UPON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED. WE DO NOT OBTAIN LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEY MAY CANCEL, REDUCE OR POSTPONE ORDERS WITHOUT PENALTIES. WE PAY COMMISSIONS TO AGENCIES FOR LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING. FOR CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH AGENCIES, WE RECORD NET REVENUE FROM THESE AGENCIES. SEASONAL REVENUE FLUCTUATIONS ARE COMMON IN OUR INDUSTRY AND ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO VARIATIONS IN ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES BY BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISERS. OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER GENERALLY PRODUCES THE LOWEST NET REVENUE FOR THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GENERALLY HIGHER DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEARS (2016, 2020, ETC.), RESULTING FROM SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, CONGRESSIONAL MID-TERM ELECTION YEARS (2018, 2022, ETC.), RESULTING FROM INCREASED POLITICAL ADVERTISING, COMPARED TO OTHER YEARS.  WE REFER TO THE REVENUE GENERATED BY AGREEMENTS WITH MVPDS AS RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS PAYMENTS FROM MVPDS FOR ACCESS TO OUR TELEVISION STATION SIGNALS SO THAT THEY MAY REBROADCAST OUR SIGNALS AND CHARGE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS FOR THIS PROGRAMMING. WE RECOGNIZE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE EARNED AS THE TELEVISION SIGNAL IS DELIVERED TO THE MVPD.  OUR FCC LICENSES GRANT US SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WITHIN EACH OF THE TELEVISION MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE REGARD THESE RIGHTS AS A VALUABLE ASSET. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF MOBILE DEVICES AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE FREED UP EXCESS SPECTRUM CAPACITY, THE MONETIZATION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO UTILIZE EXCESS SPECTRUM FOR THE BROADCAST OF THEIR MULTICAST NETWORKS; CHARGING FEES TO ACCOMMODATE THE OPERATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MOVING CHANNEL POSITIONS OR ACCEPTING INTERFERENCE WITH BROADCASTING OPERATIONS; AND MODIFYING AND/OR RELINQUISHING SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WHILE CONTINUING TO BROADCAST THROUGH CHANNEL SHARING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE GENERATED BY SUCH AGREEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LEASE OR WHEN WE HAVE RELINQUISHED ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FOR A STATION OR HAVE RELINQUISHED OUR RIGHTS TO OPERATE A STATION ON THE EXISTING CHANNEL FREE FROM INTERFERENCE.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONSIDER STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF TELEVISION STATIONS TO FURTHER THIS STRATEGY FROM TIME TO TIME, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES EXPECTED TO ARISE AS THE TELEVISION BROADCAST INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES ADVANCES IN ATSC 3.0.  48  OUR PRIMARY EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS PAID TO OUR SALES STAFF AND AMOUNTS PAID TO OUR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FIRMS, AS WELL AS EXPENSES FOR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, PROMOTION AND SELLING, ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. OUR LOCAL PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR TELEVISION CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCING A LOCAL NEWSCAST IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS THAT WERE SURRENDERED IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM. IN ADDITION, COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COSTS OF ONLINE MEDIA ACQUIRED FROM THIRD-PARTY PUBLISHERS AND THIRD PARTY SERVER COSTS. DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE SALARIES AND COMMISSIONS OF SALES STAFF, AMOUNTS PAID TO NATIONAL REPRESENTATION FIRMS, PRODUCTION AND PROGRAMMING EXPENSES, FEES FOR RATINGS SERVICES, AND ENGINEERING COSTS.  CORPORATE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES RELATED TO CORPORATE OFFICERS AND BACK OFFICE FUNCTIONS, THIRD PARTY LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES, AND FEES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY.  HIGHLIGHTS  DURING 2018, OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE DECREASED TO $297.8 MILLION FROM $536.0 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, WHICH WERE $263.9 MILLION IN 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN OUR DIGITAL SEGMENT AND IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT. OUR AUDIENCE SHARES REMAINED STRONG IN THE NATION\u2019S MOST DENSELY POPULATED HISPANIC MARKETS.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $152.9 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $412.0 MILLION IN 2017. THIS DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $259.1 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, WHICH WERE $263.9 MILLION IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM  . IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. THE OVERALL DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $35.1 MILLION AND $31.4 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $63.9 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $66.9 MILLION IN 2017. THIS DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $81.0 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $57.1 MILLION IN 2017. THIS INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE ACQUISITION OF 100% OF THE STOCK OF SMADEX, S.L., OR,  SMADEX, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND THE INCREASED USE OF AUTOMATED BUYING PLATFORMS, REFERRED TO IN OUR INDUSTRY AS PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.

WE USE THE TERM CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THAT MEASURE IS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION AND DOES INCLUDE SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS.  SINCE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE GOVERNING SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO OUR INVESTORS.  WE MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING BY AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO $100.0 MILLION PLUS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD RESULT IN OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO, OR THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL SENIOR DEBT (NET OF UP TO $75.0 MILLION OF UNRESTRICTED CASH) TO TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, NOT EXCEEDING 4.0. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2018, AT THE END OF EVERY CALENDAR YEAR, IN THE EVENT OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO IS WITHIN CERTAIN RANGES, WE MUST MAKE A DEBT PREPAYMENT EQUAL TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR EXCESS CASH FLOW, WHICH IS DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, LESS CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, LESS DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, LESS TAXES PAID, LESS OTHER AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE DEFINITION OF EXCESS CASH FLOW IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN EACH CASE AS OF DECEMBER 31): 2018, 3.2 TO 1; 2017, 4.4 TO 1.  WHILE MANY IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND WE CONSIDER CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE IMPORTANT, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OTHER MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SUCH AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME.  AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES NON-CASH GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES AND INCLUDES SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LINE ITEMS.   THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER BOTH NON-GAAP AND GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED TO MAKE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS.  55  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. A RECONCILIATION OF THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT INCREASED TO $294.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $272.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.7 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $23.9 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017. ADDITIONALLY, $1.9 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $3.0 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP.  56  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS  DECREASED TO  $3.0  MILLION  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $263.9  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE FROM THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019, NET REVENUE WILL INCREASE FROM DIGITAL MEDIA, RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, AND SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, COMPARED TO 2018. WE ANTICIPATE POLITICAL REVENUE WILL DECREASE IN 2019, COMPARED TO 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS).  WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2018. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  COST OF REVENUE-DIGITAL.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $45.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $12.1 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO $125.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $119.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.9 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $6.3 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE, AND DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017, AND SMADEX IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. ADDITIONALLY, $2.9 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF STATION KMIR-TV IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN THAT YEAR, AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $3.3 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO 42% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 22% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2019 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE CUTS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $51.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $49.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $3.5 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, AND A DECREASE OF $0.4 MILLION IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 17% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2019 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE CUTS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  CORPORATE EXPENSES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES DECREASED TO $26.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $27.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $1.0 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM RECORDED IN 2017, WHICH EXPENSES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018, AND DUE DILIGENCE COSTS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND DUE DILIGENCE COSTS RELATED TO THE SMADEX ACQUISITION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CORPORATE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 5% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT CORPORATE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SALARY EXPENSE.  57  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DECREASED  TO  $16.3  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $16.4  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , A  DE  CREASE OF  $0.  1  MILLION. THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN ASSETS BECOMING FULLY DEPRECIATED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED AMORTIZATION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE HEADWAY AND SMADEX ACQUISITIONS.  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION, WE RECOGNIZED INCOME OF $1.2  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS.  OUR HISTORICAL REVENUES HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR CURRENT REVENUES CONTINUE TO BE, AND ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN, DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED, AND WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE U.S., PRIMARILY THOSE OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE OPERATING EXPENSE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS, THAT IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS INCREASED TO $1.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $0.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $1.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT AFFECTED OUR DIGITAL SEGMENT OPERATIONS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS.  OTHER OPERATING GAIN.  OTHER OPERATING GAIN INCREASED TO $1.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $0.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $0.9 MILLION, DUE TO GAINS IN CONNECTION WITH THE REQUIRED RELOCATION OF CERTAIN TELEVISION STATIONS TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  OPERATING INCOME.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, OPERATING INCOME WAS $33.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO $277.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED TO $11.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $15.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $4.1 MILLION. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS THAT WERE TERMINATED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017.  LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  . WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $0.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 RELATED TO CAPITALIZED FINANCE COSTS WRITTEN OFF DUE TO PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT. WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 DUE TO THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT FACILITY.  IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON INVESTMENT.  WE DETERMINED THAT  A DECREASE IN VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT OCCURRED. AS SUCH,  WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $7.9 MILLION OR 37% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS HIGHER THAN OUR STATUTORY RATE DUE TO FOREIGN AND STATE TAXES, AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $82.6 MILLION OR 32% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE, ADJUSTS THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON A \u201cMORE LIKELY THAN NOT\u201d THRESHOLD. THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT MAINTAINED IN ANY SUCH ALLOWANCE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT CALLS.  BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED.  SEGMENT OPERATIONS  TELEVISION  REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.  NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $149.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $148.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS A RESULT IN PART OF RATINGS DECLINES AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC PREFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $35.1 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO $31.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR  58  ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS DECREASED TO $3.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE FROM THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS)  .  WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2018. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $62.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $59.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $2.9 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF STATION KMIR-TV IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN THAT YEAR, AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $21.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $22.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $0.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  RADIO  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $63.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $66.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $3.0 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP. WE BELIEVE THAT A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING, INCLUDING RATINGS DECLINES AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC PREFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECREASE IS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS RADIO, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $41.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $44.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $3.3 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $18.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $18.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES.  DIGITAL MEDIA  NET REVENUE  .  NET REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $81.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $57.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $23.9 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.  THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE CURRENT SHIFT TOWARD PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY AND THAT OTHER TRENDS MAY EMERGE, REQUIRING US TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING AND ADAPTING CERTAIN OF OUR DIGITAL OFFERINGS, AND CLOSELY MONITORING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL MEDIA BUSINESS.  COST OF REVENUE  .  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $45.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $12.1 MILLION.  THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS WAS CONSTANT. BECAUSE OF THIRD PARTY MEDIA COSTS, OUR MARGINS TEND TO BE SMALLER IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT THAN IN OUR OTHER BROADCAST SEGMENTS. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, COST OF REVENUE DECREASED TO 56% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 58% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES  . DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $21.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $6.2 MILLION.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE, AND DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017, AND SMADEX IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR PREEXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  59  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO  $11.6  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $8.1  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , AN INCREASE OF  $3.5  MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017.  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016  CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS  REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.  NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT INCREASED TO $272.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $258.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $13.6 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $34.0 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO NET REVENUE IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT OF $11.5 MILLION DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN LOCAL REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $8.9 MILLION DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT GENERATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018, NET REVENUE WILL INCREASE FROM DIGITAL MEDIA, RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, AND POLITICAL REVENUE, COMPARED TO 2017. WE ANTICIPATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WILL DECREASE IN 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS).  COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  COST OF REVENUE-DIGITAL.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $9.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $23.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO COST OF REVENUE IN PRIOR PERIODS.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO $119.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $113.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $5.9 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $8.8 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT OF $2.6 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR RATINGS SERVICES, AND A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED TO 22% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 44% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DURING 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OPERATING HEADWAY FOR A FULL YEAR IN 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS IN 2017.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $49.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $46.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $2.3 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $3.3 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN PRIOR PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $1.7 MILLION IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DUE TO DECREASES IN EVENT EXPENSE AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED TO 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 18% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE DURING 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OPERATING HEADWAY FOR A FULL YEAR IN 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS IN 2017.  60  CORPORATE EXPENSES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $27.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $24.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $3.4 MILLION. . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CORPORATE EXPENSES DECREASED TO 5% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED CORPORATE EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT CORPORATE EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 AS A RESULT OF EXPENSES IN THE 2017 PERIOD RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED TO $16.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $1.1 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION ON THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AS CERTAIN ASSETS ARE NOW FULLY DEPRECIATED.  OPERATING INCOME.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, AND INCLUDING $0.3 MILLION OF OTHER OPERATING GAIN AS RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT A GAIN AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM, OPERATING INCOME WAS $277.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, COMPARED TO $48.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET INCREASED TO $15.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $15.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $0.7 MILLION. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER INCOME IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF OUR INTEREST SWAP AGREEMENTS.  LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  . WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 DUE TO THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT FACILITY. IN 2016, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED FINANCE COSTS WRITTEN OFF DUE TO PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $82.6 MILLION OR 32% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS LOWER THAN OUR STATUTORY RATE DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS $13.1 MILLION OR 39% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME.  OUR MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE, ADJUSTS THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON A \u201cMORE LIKELY THAN NOT\u201d THRESHOLD. THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT MAINTAINED IN ANY SUCH ALLOWANCE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT CALLS.  BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED.  SEGMENT OPERATIONS  TELEVISION  REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.  NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $148.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $159.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $11.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN LOCAL REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $31.4 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO $29.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2017 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT GENERATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS)  .  COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  61  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $59.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $62.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $2.5 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR RATINGS SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $22.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $21.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $0.7 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES.  RADIO  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $66.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $75.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $8.9 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017. WE BELIEVE THAT  A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING, INCLUDING ADVERTISERS ALLOCATING MORE OF THEIR BUDGET TO DIGITAL ADVERTISING, RATINGS DECLINES AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC PREFERENCES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $44.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $44.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $0.3 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $18.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $20.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $1.7 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN EVENT EXPENSE AND SALARY EXPENSE.  DIGITAL MEDIA  NET REVENUE  .  NET REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $57.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $23.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $34.0 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PRIOR PERIODS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.  THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE CURRENT SHIFT TOWARD PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY AND THAT OTHER TRENDS MAY EMERGE, REQUIRING US TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING AND ADAPTING CERTAIN OF OUR DIGITAL OFFERINGS, AND CLOSELY MONITORING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL MEDIA BUSINESS.  COST OF REVENUE  .  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $9.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $23.5 MILLION.  THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PRIOR PERIODS.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS WAS CONSTANT. BECAUSE OF THIRD PARTY MEDIA COSTS, OUR MARGINS TEND TO BE SMALLER IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT THAN IN OUR OTHER BROADCAST SEGMENTS. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, COST OF REVENUE INCREASED TO 58% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 41% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF DIGITAL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH VOLUME AND RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF THESE PROGRAMMATIC PLATFORMS, THE MARGINS TEND TO BE LOWER.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES  . DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $6.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $8.8 MILLION.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PRIOR PERIODS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  . SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $8.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $4.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $3.3 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PRIOR PERIODS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  62  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAD NET INCOME OF $12.2 MILLION, $175.7 MILLION, AND $20.4 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $33.8 MILLION, $301.5 MILLION AND $57.3 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, WITH CASH ON HAND AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CASH ON HAND AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $5.3 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR LIQUIDITY IS NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT HELD IN ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AS OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY U.S. SOURCES.  2013 CREDIT FACILITY  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PERTAINS TO OUR PREVIOUS BANK FACILITY, OR THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY. THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY WAS TERMINATED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2017 WHEN WE ENTERED INTO OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY. ACCORDINGLY, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SUMMARIZES ONLY CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY AND THE AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR 2013 CREDIT FACILITY, OR THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON MAY 31, 2013, WE ENTERED INTO OUR 2013 CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WE AMENDED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2017. THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTED OF A $20.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN A FACILITY (THE \u201cTERM LOAN A FACILITY\u201d), A $375.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN B FACILITY (THE \u201cTERM LOAN B FACILITY\u201d; AND TOGETHER WITH THE TERM LOAN A FACILITY, THE \u201cTERM LOAN FACILITIES\u201d) WHICH WAS DRAWN ON AUGUST 1, 2013 (THE \u201cTERM LOAN B BORROWING DATE\u201d), AND A $30.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d).

THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY WAS GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR SECURED BASIS BY THE CREDIT PARTIES. THE 2013 CREDIT FACILITY WAS SECURED ON A FIRST PRIORITY BASIS BY OUR AND THE CREDIT PARTIES\u2019 ASSETS. UPON THE REDEMPTION OF THE OUTSTANDING NOTES, THE SECURITY INTERESTS AND GUARANTIES OF US AND THE CREDIT PARTIES UNDER THE INDENTURE AND THE NOTES WERE TERMINATED AND RELEASED.  THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINED ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS THAT ARE CUSTOMARY FOR AN AGREEMENT OF THIS TYPE.  2017 CREDIT FACILITY  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2017 (THE \u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), WE ENTERED INTO OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTS OF A $300.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN B FACILITY (THE \u201cTERM LOAN B FACILITY\u201d), WHICH WAS DRAWN IN FULL ON THE CLOSING DATE. IN ADDITION, THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT WE MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $100.0 MILLION PLUS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD RESULT IN OUR FIRST LIEN NET LEVERAGE RATIO (AS SUCH TERM IS USED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT) NOT EXCEEDING 4.0 TO 1.0, SUBJECT TO US SATISFYING CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN B FACILITY WERE USED ON THE CLOSING DATE TO (A) REPAY IN FULL ALL OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TO TERMINATE THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT, (B) PAY FEES AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY, AND (C) FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY IS GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR SECURED BASIS BY CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING AND FUTURE WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, AND IS SECURED ON A FIRST PRIORITY BASIS BY OUR AND THOSE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ASSETS.  OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEREOF FROM THE DATE WHEN MADE AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO EITHER: (I) THE EURODOLLAR RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT) PLUS 2.75%; OR (II) THE BASE RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT) PLUS 1.75%.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE INTEREST RATE ON OUR TERM LOAN B WAS 5.09%. THE TERM LOAN B FACILITY EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 30, 2024 (THE \u201cMATURITY DATE\u201d).  63  IN THE EVENT WE ENGAGE IN A TRANSACTION THAT HAS THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE YIELD OF ANY LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN B FACILITY WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE CLOSING DATE, WE WILL OWE 1% OF THE AMOUNT OF THE LOANS SO REPRICED OR REPLACED TO THE LENDERS THEREOF (SUCH FEE, THE \u201cREPRICING FEE\u201d). OTHER THAN THE REPRICING FEE, THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE PREPAID AT OUR OPTION WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY, PROVIDED THAT CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ARE OBSERVED, AND SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY BREAKAGE FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPAYMENT OF A LIBOR RATE LOAN. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN B FACILITY SHALL BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS ON THE DATES AND IN THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WITH THE FINAL BALANCE DUE ON THE MATURITY DATE.  SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT LIMIT THE ABILITY OF US AND OUR RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  INCUR LIENS ON OUR PROPERTY OR ASSETS;  \u2022  MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS;  \u2022  CONSUMMATE ANY MERGER, DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION, CONSOLIDATION OR SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ASSETS;  \u2022  DISPOSE OF CERTAIN ASSETS;  \u2022  MAKE CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS;  \u2022  MAKE CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS;  \u2022  ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT LINES OF BUSINESS;  \u2022  ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES;  \u2022  USE LOAN PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE OR CARRY MARGIN STOCK OR FOR ANY OTHER PROHIBITED PURPOSE;  \u2022  CHANGE OR AMEND THE TERMS OF OUR ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS OR THE ORGANIZATION DOCUMENTS OF CERTAIN RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES IN A MATERIALLY ADVERSE WAY TO THE LENDERS, OR CHANGE OR AMEND THE TERMS OF CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS;  \u2022  ENTER INTO SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  MAKE PREPAYMENTS OF ANY SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS; AND  \u2022  CHANGE OUR FISCAL YEAR, OR ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR REPORTING PRACTICES.

ADDITIONALLY, THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A DEFINITION OF \u201cCONSOLIDATED EBITDA\u201d THAT EXCLUDES REVENUE RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND RELATED EXPENSES, AS COMPARED TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d UNDER THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH INCLUDED SUCH ITEMS. AS REPORTED BY US PREVIOUSLY, INCLUDING IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FILED WITH THE SEC ON NOVEMBER 9, 2017, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUE OF $263.9 MILLION RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM (THE \u201cSPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE\u201d) DURING OUR THIRD QUARTER OF 2017. HOWEVER, AS REPORTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND AS ANTICIPATED IN FUTURE INVESTOR COMMUNICATIONS, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE \u201cCONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d EXCLUDES THE SPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE AND RELATED EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH IT MAY RELATE, CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. THE SPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017 WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TOTALING $263.9 MILLION, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TRANSACTION OF A SIMILAR NATURE TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM OR ANOTHER TRANSACTION THAT GENERATES NET REVENUE FROM THE MONETIZATION OF SPECTRUM ASSETS IN SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE MADE A PREPAYMENT OF $50.0 MILLION TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN B FACILITY.  ON APRIL 30, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT AND LIMITED WAIVER (THE \u201cAMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 1, 2019. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENT, THE LENDERS WAIVED ANY EVENTS OF DEFAULT THAT MAY HAVE ARISEN UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FAILURE TO TIMELY DELIVER OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d), AND AMENDED THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, GIVING US UNTIL MAY 31, 2019 TO DELIVER THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE BY US TO DELIVER THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON OR PRIOR TO MAY 31, 2019 WOULD CONSTITUTE AN IMMEDIATE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. BY FILING THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRIOR TO THAT DATE, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED BY THE AMENDMENT, REGARDING DELIVERY OF THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENT, WE AGREED TO PAY TO THE LENDERS CONSENTING TO THE AMENDMENT A FEE EQUAL TO 0.10% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS HELD BY SUCH LENDERS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF MAY 1, 2019. THIS FEE TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON JULY 13, 2017, OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $15.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  ON APRIL 11, 2018, OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $15.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CLASS A COMMON STOCK, FOR A TOTAL REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF UP TO $30.0 MILLION. UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR NEGOTIATED PURCHASES, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS  . THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE REPURCHASED TO DATE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 4.5 MILLION SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $4.23 SINCE THE BEGINNING OF SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $19.1 MILLION. ALL REPURCHASED SHARES WERE RETIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA (AS DEFINED BELOW) INCREASED TO $54.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $50.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $3.4 MILLION, OR 7%. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA INCREASED TO 18% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, MEANS NET INCOME (LOSS) PLUS GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OPERATING AND CORPORATE EXPENSES, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS. WE USE THE TERM CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THAT MEASURE IS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND DOES NOT INCLUDE GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT  65  EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION AND DOES INCLUDE SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS.  SINCE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE GOVERNING SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO OUR INVESTORS.  WE MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING BY AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO $100.0 MILLION PLUS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD RESULT IN OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO, OR THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL SENIOR DEBT (NET OF UP TO $75.0 MILLION OF UNRESTRICTED CASH) TO TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, NOT EXCEEDING 4.0. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2018, AT THE END OF EVERY CALENDAR YEAR, IN THE EVENT OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO IS WITHIN CERTAIN RANGES, WE MUST MAKE A DEBT PREPAYMENT EQUAL TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR EXCESS CASH FLOW, WHICH IS DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, LESS CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, LESS DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, LESS TAXES PAID, LESS OTHER AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE DEFINITION OF EXCESS CASH FLOW IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN EACH CASE AS OF DECEMBER 31): 2018, 3.2 TO 1; 2017, 4.4 TO 1.  WHILE MANY IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND WE CONSIDER CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE IMPORTANT, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OTHER MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SUCH AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME.  AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES NON-CASH GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES AND INCLUDES SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LINE ITEMS.   THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER BOTH NON-GAAP AND GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED TO MAKE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, PLEASE SEE PAGE 56.  CASH FLOW  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $33.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $301.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE HAD NET INCOME OF $12.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WHICH  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $4.6 MILLION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $16.3 MILLION, AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION  . WE HAD NET INCOME OF $175.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WHICH  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $81.8 MILLION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $16.4 MILLION, AND NON-CASH COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS OF $12.3 MILLION  . WE EXPECT TO HAVE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 2019 YEAR.  NET CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $159.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $76.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE SPENT $159.4 MILLION ON PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, $3.2 MILLION ON THE PURCHASE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, $3.5 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES, AND $17.0 MILLION ON NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE SPENT $32.6 MILLION ON THE PURCHASE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, $29.1 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES, AND $12.1 MILLION ON NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $20.3 MILLION DURING THE FULL YEAR 2019. OF THIS AMOUNT, WE EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION WILL BE EXPENDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REQUIRED RELOCATION OF CERTAIN OF OUR TELEVISION STATIONS TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM, WHICH AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED TO US BY THE FCC. THE AMOUNT OF OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MAY CHANGE BASED ON FUTURE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PLANS AND, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE EXPECT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WITH CASH ON HAND AND NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS.  NET CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $88.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $24.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE MADE DEBT PAYMENTS OF $53.0 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $17.8 MILLION, AND PAID $13.8 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF STOCK. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE MADE DEBT PAYMENTS OF $293.6 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $14.7 MILLION, PAID $5.3 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF STOCK, AND RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $298.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY.  66  COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  TOTAL AMOUNTS COMMITTED  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  MORE THAN  5 YEARS  LONG TERM DEBT AND RELATED INTEREST (1)  $321,356  $15,911  $31,350  $30,721  $243,374  MEDIA RESEARCH AND RATINGS PROVIDERS (2)  11,588  10,378  760  360  90  OPERATING LEASES (3)  81,828  10,432  19,184  13,697  38,515  OTHER MATERIAL NON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (4)  9,719  2,105  4,353  3,261  \u2014  TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  $424,491  $38,826  $55,647  $48,039  $281,979  (1)  THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS AND MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY. FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM AMOUNTS INDICATED IN THE TABLE DUE TO FUTURE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING NEEDS, MARKET FACTORS AND OTHER CURRENTLY UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  (2)  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MEDIA RESEARCH AND RATINGS PROVIDERS, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH JUNE 2024, TO PROVIDE TELEVISION AND RADIO AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT SERVICES.  (3)  WE LEASE FACILITIES AND BROADCAST EQUIPMENT UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH DECEMBER 2059. THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE MONTH-TO-MONTH LEASES.  (4)  THESE AMOUNTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OBLIGATIONS FOR SALES SOFTWARE LICENSES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THEREFORE, $0.5 MILLION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE.  WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING WALTER F. ULLOA, JEFFERY A. LIBERMAN AND CHRISTOPHER T. YOUNG. OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  OTHER THAN LEASE COMMITMENTS, LEGAL CONTINGENCIES INCURRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR KEY EMPLOYEES, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR LIABILITIES. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY INTERESTS IN OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT AND MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED OUR RELATED DISCLOSURE IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GOODWILL  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OUR ESTIMATES OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d BECAUSE: (1) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSETS, AND (2) THE IMPACT THAT RECOGNIZING AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD HAVE ON THE ASSETS REPORTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, AS WELL AS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, COULD BE MATERIAL. ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE ASSETS UNDER EVALUATION ARE CRITICAL  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CERTAIN EVENTS OR CERTAIN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE MUST MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.  IN TESTING THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST DETERMINE, BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS LESS THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.  WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IS A REPORTING UNIT.  67  IF IT IS DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE BASED ON THIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT, THE NEXT STEP IS A QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THAT REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING VALUE, NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL EXISTS AND THE TESTING IS COMPLETE. IF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT IS GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD $40.5 MILLION OF GOODWILL IN OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT. WE DID NOT REACH A DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ALONE SO WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST AND COMPARED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 48%, RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE.  IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 6%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD $33.7 MILLION OF GOODWILL IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA REPORTING UNIT. WE DID NOT REACH A DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ALONE SO WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST AND COMPARED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 5%, RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE.  IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 5%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD NO GOODWILL IN OUR RADIO REPORTING UNIT.  WHEN A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE MARKET APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BY APPLYING SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW MULTIPLES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE MULTIPLES ARE DERIVED FROM COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR OPERATING AND INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE MARKET APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS SELECTING COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHICH MAKES THE MARKET APPROACH OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF THAT REPORTING UNIT. THE INCOME APPROACH ALSO REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATED OUR DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FISCAL POLICY AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES, TRANSACTION PREMIUMS AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS. SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHERMORE, SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IN GENERAL OR THE INDUSTRIES OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADVERTISE ON OUR STATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE AUTOMOTIVE, FINANCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL AND RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED ADVERTISING REVENUE. THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS OTHER BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR OUR AUDIENCE PREFERENCES, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING-BASED MEDIUMS, SUCH AS INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND BROADBAND CONTENT PROVIDERS SERVING THE SAME MARKETS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. FINALLY, THE RISK FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SEC REPORTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS.  68  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE OR OF OUR UNITS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, IF MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE AND AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR IF THERE ARE LOWER COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF ANY SUCH FUTURE CHANGE IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION MODELS AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT, OR IF IT DOES, WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE MATERIAL.  INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROADCAST LICENSES ARE INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IS DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE WHEN THERE ARE NO LEGAL, REGULATORY, CONTRACTUAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY LIMIT THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE EVALUATION OF IMPAIRMENT FOR INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS PERFORMED BY A COMPARISON OF THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING VALUE TO THE ASSET\u2019S FAIR VALUE. WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE. THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING USED TO TEST BROADCAST LICENSES REPRESENTS ALL LICENSES OWNED AND OPERATED WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET CLUSTER, BECAUSE SUCH LICENSES ARE USED TOGETHER, ARE COMPLIMENTARY TO EACH OTHER AND ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BEST USE OF THOSE ASSETS. OUR INDIVIDUAL MARKET CLUSTERS CONSIST OF CITIES OR NEARBY CITIES. WE TEST OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THESE MARKET CLUSTERS.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. ALTERNATIVELY, SOME STATIONS UNDER EVALUATION HAVE HAD LIMITED RELEVANT CASH FLOW HISTORY DUE TO PLANNED OR ACTUAL CONVERSION OF FORMAT OR UPGRADE OF STATION SIGNAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT CASH FLOWS AFTER CONVERSION ARE BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR STATIONS IN SIMILAR MARKETS AND POTENTIAL PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 3% TO OVER 1,000%. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 0% TO OVER 450%. THREE MARKETS WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $15.2 MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN 10%.  UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FISCAL POLICY AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES, TRANSACTION PREMIUMS AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS. SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHERMORE, SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IN GENERAL OR THE INDUSTRIES OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADVERTISE ON OUR STATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE AUTOMOTIVE, FINANCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL AND RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED ADVERTISING REVENUE. THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS OTHER BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR OUR AUDIENCE PREFERENCES, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING-BASED MEDIUMS, SUCH AS INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND BROADBAND CONTENT PROVIDERS SERVING THE SAME MARKETS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. FINALLY, THE RISK FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SEC REPORTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE OR OF OUR UNITS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, IF MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE AND AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR IF THERE ARE LOWER COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF ANY SUCH FUTURE CHANGE IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION MODELS AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT, OR IF IT DOES, WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE MATERIAL.  69  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLES SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE PASSAGE OF NEW LAWS OR CHANGES IN REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL OR CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRATEGY COULD RESULT IN THE ACTUAL USEFUL LIVES DIFFERING FROM INITIAL ESTIMATES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE REVISED, WE WILL DEPRECIATE THE NET BOOK VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER ITS REVISED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE. FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE PLANNED USE OF EQUIPMENT, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, CONTRACTUAL AMENDMENTS OR MANDATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN SHORTENED USEFUL LIVES.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSET GROUPS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL CASH FLOWS. LONG-LIVED ASSETS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ARE GROUPED WITH OTHER ASSETS TO THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (EXCLUDING INTEREST) IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, THE ASSETS WILL BE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DETERMINATION IS MADE.  DEFERRED TAXES  DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED ON A LIABILITY METHOD WHEREBY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND DEFERRED LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES ON THE DATE OF ENACTMENT.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER ALL REASONABLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INCLUDING OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, TAX STRATEGIES AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. IN CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, WE MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES USED TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  TELEVISION AND RADIO REVENUE RELATED TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF BROADCAST. REVENUE FOR CONTRACTS WITH ADVERTISING AGENCIES IS RECORDED AT AN AMOUNT THAT IS NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE ADVERTISERS IS RECORDED AS GROSS REVENUE AND THE RELATED COMMISSION OR NATIONAL REPRESENTATION FEE IS RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSE. CASH PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO SERVICES RENDERED RESULT IN DEFERRED REVENUE, WHICH IS THEN RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE ADVERTISING TIME OR SPACE IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED. DIGITAL RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN DISPLAY OR OTHER DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS RECORD IMPRESSIONS ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR THIRD PARTY PUBLISHERS OR AS THE ADVERTISER\u2019S PREVIOUSLY AGREED-UPON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED.  WE GENERATE REVENUE UNDER ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH SERVICES ARE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS WITHIN A SPECIFIC SEGMENT, AND THOSE THAT ARE SOLD ON A COMBINED BASIS ACROSS MULTIPLE SEGMENTS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IN SUCH  REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH CONTAIN MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, REVENUES ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ITEM AND RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR THE SPECIFIC UNIT OF ACCOUNTING.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO WITH MVPDS. WE REFER TO SUCH REVENUE AS RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS PAYMENTS FROM MVPDS FOR ACCESS TO OUR TELEVISION STATION SIGNALS SO THAT THEY MAY REBROADCAST OUR SIGNALS AND CHARGE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS FOR THIS PROGRAMMING. WE RECOGNIZE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE EARNED AS THE TELEVISION SIGNAL IS DELIVERED TO THE MVPD.  WE ALSO GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO UTILIZE EXCESS SPECTRUM FOR THE BROADCAST OF THEIR MULTICAST NETWORKS, CHARGING FEES TO ACCOMMODATE THE OPERATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MOVING CHANNEL POSITIONS OR ACCEPTING INTERFERENCE WITH BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, AND MODIFYING AND/OR RELINQUISHING SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WHILE CONTINUING TO BROADCAST THROUGH CHANNEL SHARING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE FROM SUCH AGREEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LEASE OR WHEN WE HAVE RELINQUISHED ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FOR A STATION OR HAVE RELINQUISHED OUR RIGHTS TO OPERATE A STATION ON THE EXISTING CHANNEL FREE FROM INTERFERENCE.  70  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSIST OF A HOMOGENEOUS POOL OF RELATIVELY SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. WHEN WE ARE AWARE OF A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER\u2019S INABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO US, A SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS IS ESTIMATED AND RECORDED WHICH REDUCES THE RECOGNIZED RECEIVABLE TO THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE BELIEVE WILL ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL BAD DEBTS, BAD DEBT CHARGES ARE RECORDED BASED ON OUR RECENT PAST LOSS HISTORY AND AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF PAST DUE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 28, 2017, WE USED DERIVATIVES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK WITH RESPECT TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT. WE WERE PARTY TO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT FIXED THE VARIABLE BENCHMARK COMPONENT (LIBOR) OF OUR INTEREST RATE ON A PORTION OF OUR TERM LOAN BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2015. ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017, WE TERMINATED THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT. OUR CURRENT POLICY PROHIBITS ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATION OR TRADING PURPOSES.  WE RECOGNIZE ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES AS PART OF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP, AND FURTHER, ON THE TYPE OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE; THEREFORE, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WAS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DIRECTLY TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF NON-PERFORMANCE RISK, WHEN MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WAS DETERMINED BY USING MULTIPLE BROKER QUOTES, ADJUSTED FOR NON-PERFORMANCE RISK, WHEN MATERIAL, WHICH ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF ANY FUTURE PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE MADE UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS. UPON TERMINATION OF THE SWAP AGREEMENTS, $2.5 MILLION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PLEASE SEE NOTE 2 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND U.S. TAX REFORM  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842),  WHICH IS INTENDED TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS RELATING TO LEASES. LESSEES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS AND A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE FASB RETAINED A DUAL MODEL FOR LEASE CLASSIFICATION, REQUIRING LEASES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES TO DETERMINE RECOGNITION IN THE EARNINGS STATEMENT AND CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LEASES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. ASU 2016-02 WILL ALSO REQUIRE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THIS STANDARD ALLOWS ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. THE STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE LEASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND IS EVALUATING ITS PROCESSES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE COMPANY MEETS THE STANDARD\u2019S REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU ON JANUARY 1, 2019, USING THE OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD AND ALSO ELECTED TO USE THE 'PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS', WHICH ALLOWS US NOT TO CONTINUE TO REASSESS OUR PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A MATERIAL INCREASE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE REQUIRED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND CORRESPONDING LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES SUCH AS LEASES ON BROADCAST TOWER SITES AND REAL ESTATE LEASES FOR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT NEW QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE RIGHT OF USE ASSET WILL BE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS AS NOTED IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT METHODOLOGY.  71  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15,  INTANGIBLES-GOODWILL AND OTHER-INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40): CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT  . THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ALIGN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITALIZING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A HOSTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITALIZING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED TO DEVELOP OR OBTAIN INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (AND HOSTING ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE AN INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSE). THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE SERVICE ELEMENT OF A HOSTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR  ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2021. E  ARLY ADOPTION  IS  PERMITTED. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE SHOULD BE APPLIED EITHER RETROSPECTIVELY OR PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  , WHICH SUPERSEDES SUBTOPIC 505-50, EQUITY\u2014EQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES AND EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ASC TOPIC 718, \u201cCOMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d (\u201cTOPIC 718\u201d) TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO CLARIFY THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE FINANCING TO THE ISSUER OR AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC TOPIC 606, \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\u201d (\u201cTOPIC 606\u201d). THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, BUT NO EARLIER THAN A COMPANY\u2019S ADOPTION DATE OF TOPIC 606. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT\u2014REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  . ASU 2018-02 ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO DISCLOSE THEIR ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR RELEASING INCOME TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THIS GUIDANCE SHOULD BE APPLIED EITHER IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS OF THE CHANGE IN THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2017 TAX ACT IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-16,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS OTHER THAN INVENTORY  WHICH ALLOWS ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES ON AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET OTHER THAN INVENTORY WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS. CURRENT GAAP PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES FOR AN INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFER UNTIL THE ASSET HAS BEEN SOLD TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY.  IN ADDITION, THERE HAS BEEN DIVERSITY IN THE APPLICATION OF THE CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE AND TANGIBLE ASSETS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. ASU 2016-16 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN AN INTERIM PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THE ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326),  WHICH  AMENDS CURRENT GUIDANCE ON OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES. THIS AMENDED STANDARD REQUIRES THE USE OF AN ALLOWANCE TO RECORD ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ASSET. THIS STANDARD ALSO REMOVES THE EVALUATION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT A SECURITY HAS BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION TO AVOID RECORDING A CREDIT LOSS. THE UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN MAY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): SCOPE OF MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING  , TO CLARIFY AND REDUCE BOTH (I) DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE AND (II) COST AND COMPLEXITY WHEN APPLYING THE GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 718, TO CHANGE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARD. SPECIFICALLY, AN ENTITY WOULD NOT APPLY MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING IF THE FAIR VALUE, VESTING CONDITIONS, AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE AWARDS ARE THE SAME IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE MODIFICATION. ASU 2017-09 IS  EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2017-09 ON JANUARY 1, 2018. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-09 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD ANY MODIFICATIONS TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. HOWEVER, IF THE COMPANY DOES HAVE A MODIFICATION TO AN AWARD IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2017-09.  72  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-01  , BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (TOPIC 805): CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS,  TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST FRAMEWORK TO USE IN DETERMINING WHEN A SET OF ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED A BUSINESS. ASU 2017-01 IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2018.  IN AUGUST 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-15,  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230): CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS (A CONSENSUS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE),  WHICH PROVIDES SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON EIGHT CASH FLOW CLASSIFICATION ISSUES ARISING FROM CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2018 AND IS REQUIRED TO APPLY IT ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-01,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 OVERALL (SUBTOPIC 825-10): RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  ,  AND ITS RELATED AMENDMENTS IN FEBRUARY 2018, ASU 2018-03,  TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014OVERALL (SUBTOPIC 825-10): RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  . ASU 2016-01  REQUIRES ENTITIES TO CARRY ALL INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS SUCH AS PARTNERSHIPS, UNINCORPORATED JOINT VENTURES, AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED WITHIN NET INCOME. THIS ASU DOES NOT APPLY TO EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE INVESTEE OR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN INVESTMENT COMPANIES. FOR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE, AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO ELECT A PRACTICABILITY EXCEPTION, UNDER WHICH THE INVESTMENT WILL BE MEASURED AT COST, LESS IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES FROM ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS OF AN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY THIS ASU ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT TO ASSESS WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS SUBJECT TO THIS ELECTION IS NOW A SINGLE-STEP MODEL WHEREBY AN ENTITY PERFORMS A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRMENT. IF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATES THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, THE ENTITY WOULD ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT AND RECOGNIZE IN NET INCOME AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY INVESTMENTS FORMERLY CLASSIFIED AS COST METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED USING THE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED THE PRACTICABILITY EXCEPTION WHEREBY THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MEASURED AT COST, LESS IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES FROM ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS OF IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS OF THE SAME ISSUE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THESE STANDARDS PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2018, AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION IN RELATION TO ONE OF ITS EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606),  WHICH AMENDED THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. ASU 2014-09 ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE UPON THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STANDARDS RELATED TO ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): PRINCIPAL VERSUS AGENT CONSIDERATIONS  ; ASU 2016-10,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): IDENTIFYING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND LICENSING  ; ASU 2016-12,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): NARROW-SCOPE IMPROVEMENTS AND PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS  ; AND ASU 2016-20,  TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  ON JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC TOPIC 606 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD APPLIED TO THOSE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE NOT COMPLETED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018. RESULTS FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018 ARE PRESENTED UNDER TOPIC 606, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 605, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION\u201d.  OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 WERE NOT AFFECTED AS THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF ADOPTING TOPIC 606.  U.S. TAX REFORM  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION CALLED THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d). THE TAX ACT MAKES BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE THAT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% THAT AFFECTS THE CURRENT VALUE OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (\u201cDTAS\u201d) AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES (\u201cDTLS\u201d), A TRANSITION TAX ON UNREPATRIATED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND BONUS DEPRECIATION ON QUALIFIED PROPERTY. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (1) A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%; (2) A GENERAL ELIMINATION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES; (3) A NEW PROVISION DESIGNED TO TAX GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d); (4) LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION; (5) LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL TAX CREDIT (\u201cFTC\u2019S\u201d) TO REDUCE THE U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY; (6) POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE; AND (7) BONUS DEPRECIATION ON QUALIFIED PROPERTY.  73  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, WE RECORDED A ONE-TIME NET TAX BENEFIT OF $17.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THIS NET TAX BENEFIT PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF THE NET TAX IMPACT TO OUR DEFERRED TAXES FROM THE  U.S. FEDERAL  CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION.  THERE WAS NO MATERIAL CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE IN 2018. SEE NOTE 13 TO  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SENSITIVITY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  WE HAVE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THOSE SENSITIVE ESTIMATES RELATES TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED ANNUALLY ON OCTOBER 1 FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.  TELEVISION  IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES, WE USED MODELS THAT RELY ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES AND MULTIPLES. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSUME THAT THE TELEVISION SEGMENT REVENUES WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THE INCREASE IN THE TELEVISION EXPENSES, AND THEREFORE THE TELEVISION ASSETS WILL ALSO INCREASE IN VALUE. IF ANY OF THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES, MULTIPLES OR ASSUMPTIONS WERE TO CHANGE IN ANY FUTURE VALUATION, IT COULD AFFECT OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CAUSE US TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF OUR TELEVISION INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE DID NOT RECORD IMPAIRMENT IN 2018 AS THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS WAS GREATER THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES. THE FAIR VALUES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 3% TO OVER 1,000%. ONE MARKET WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN 10%.  WE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL REVIEW OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT AS PART OF OUR GOODWILL TESTING AND DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS IN THE MODELS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS AND PROJECTED TRENDS IN THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY AND HISPANIC MARKET. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 48%,  RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WAS INCREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR AND EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF A COMPONENT OF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE DECREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR TO ACCOUNT FOR RISK WITHIN THE FORECASTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 6%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  RADIO  IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES, WE USED MODELS THAT RELY ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES AND MULTIPLES. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSUME THAT THE RADIO SEGMENT REVENUES WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THE INCREASE IN THE RADIO EXPENSES, AND THEREFORE THE RADIO ASSETS WILL ALSO INCREASE IN VALUE. IF ANY OF THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES, MULTIPLES OR ASSUMPTIONS WERE TO CHANGE IN ANY FUTURE VALUATION, IT COULD AFFECT OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CAUSE US TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT.  74  WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF OUR RADIO INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM  0% TO OVER 450%.  TWO MARKETS WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.2  MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN  10%.  WE DID  NOT HAVE ANY GOODWILL IN OUR RADIO REPORTING UNIT AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  DIGITAL MEDIA  WE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL REVIEW OF OUR DIGITAL MEDIA REPORTING UNIT AS PART OF OUR GOODWILL TESTING AND DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS IN THE MODELS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS AND PROJECTED TRENDS IN THE DIGITAL INDUSTRY AND HISPANIC MARKET. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 5%,  RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WAS INCREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR AND EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF A COMPONENT OF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE DECREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR TO ACCOUNT FOR RISK WITHIN THE FORECASTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 5%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE  BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . HOWEVER, BASED ON RECENT INFLATION TRENDS, THE ECONOMY IN ARGENTINA HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY. AS A RESULT, WE APPLIED THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 830 BY REMEASURING NON-MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES AND MONETARY-ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE INFLATION WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "ENTRAVISION COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "CIK": 1109116, "Date": "2019-05-07T00:00:00", "Ticker": "EVC", "Name": "Entravision Communications Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 4833.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 954783236.0, "key": "20190507EVC", "labelr1": -4.385964912280699, "labelr2": -3.975535168195715, "labelr3": -0.9554140127388614, "labelr4": -7.073954983922821, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.7532976, "prof1": 0.2467024, "return1&2": 1.0853586565802884, "return1&2&3": 1.0957283252737309, "return1&2&3&4": 1.173239653749686, "return2": 1.039755351681957, "return1": 1.043859649122807, "return3": 1.0095541401273886, "return4": 1.0707395498392285, "4_day_return": -15.49707602339181, "cumulative_return1": 0.08744974027227376, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.001189975856442248, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.084700177747699e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 8.481323651464482e-08, "indexx": 2348, "cumreturn1b": 0.9533771181598806, "cumreturndow": 0.984844681860806, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9824892892714224}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2350, "level_0": 2374, "index": 1178, "text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS  REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE  A MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE  MEDICAL DEVICES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE. OUR  PRIMARY FOCUS IS THE SALES AND MARKETING OF OUR LUVIVA\u00ae  ADVANCED CERVICAL SCAN NON-INVASIVE CERVICAL CANCER DETECTION  DEVICE. THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY OF LUVIVA PRIMARILY RELATES TO  THE USE OF BIOPHOTONICS FOR THE NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF CANCERS.  LUVIVA IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY CERVICAL CANCERS AND PRECANCERS  PAINLESSLY, NON-INVASIVELY AND AT THE POINT OF CARE BY SCANNING THE  CERVIX WITH LIGHT, THEN ANALYZING THE REFLECTED AND FLUORESCENT  LIGHT.  LUVIVA  PROVIDES A LESS INVASIVE AND PAINLESS ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL  TESTS FOR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND DETECTION. ADDITIONALLY,  LUVIVA IMPROVES PATIENT WELL-BEING NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES  PAIN, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS CONVENIENT TO USE AND PROVIDES RAPID  RESULTS AT THE POINT OF CARE. WE FOCUS ON TWO PRIMARY APPLICATIONS  FOR LUVIVA: FIRST, AS A CANCER SCREENING TOOL IN THE DEVELOPING  WORLD, WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT TRADITIONAL CANCER-SCREENING  METHODS IS LIMITED OR NON-EXISTENT, AND SECOND, AS A TRIAGE  FOLLOWING TRADITIONAL SCREENING IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD, WHERE A  HIGH NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS CAUSE A HIGH RATE OF  UNNECESSARY AND ULTIMATELY COSTLY FOLLOW-UP TESTS.  WE ARE  A DELAWARE CORPORATION, ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN 1992 UNDER THE  NAME \u201cSPECTRX, INC.,\u201d AND, ON FEBRUARY 22, 2008,  CHANGED OUR NAME TO GUIDED THERAPEUTICS, INC. AT THE SAME TIME, WE  RENAMED OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, INTERSCAN, WHICH ORIGINALLY  HAD BEEN INCORPORATED AS \u201cGUIDED  THERAPEUTICS.\u201d  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE SALE OF DEBT AND EQUITY, FUNDING FROM COLLABORATIVE  ARRANGEMENTS, AND GRANTS.  OUR  PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS,  EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY ENTRANTS INTO THE MEDICAL  DEVICE INDUSTRY. THIS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN INCREASING  NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, INTENSE COMPETITION AND A HIGH FAILURE  RATE. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND,  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  APPROXIMATELY $137.6 MILLION. TO DATE, WE HAVE ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND THE EARLY STAGES OF MARKETING  OUR PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN  MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY NOT BE  SUCCESSFUL IN GROWING SALES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, REQUIRED  REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS MAY NOT BE OBTAINED IN A TIMELY  MANNER, OR AT ALL. OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT EVER GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE  AND WE MAY NOT EVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR ACHIEVE  PROFITABILITY. THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR  PRODUCTS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY, SALES AND  MARKETING, MANUFACTURING AND OTHER EXPENDITURES. WE EXPECT OUR  OPERATING LOSSES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS WE  CONTINUE TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLETE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, OBTAIN REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR  APPROVALS, BUILD OUR MARKETING, SALES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCE  CAPABILITIES, AND CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT.  OUR  PRODUCT REVENUES TO DATE HAVE BEEN LIMITED. IN 2018, THE MAJORITY  OF OUR REVENUES WERE FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES AND  DISPOSABLES. WE EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IN 2019  WILL BE DERIVED FROM REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES AND  DISPOSABLES.  CURRENT  DEMAND FOR LUVIVA  BASED  ON DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WE EXPECT TO GENERATE  PURCHASE ORDERS FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.5 TO $2.0 MILLION IN LUVIVA  DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES IN 2019 AND EXPECT THOSE PURCHASE ORDERS TO  RESULT IN ACTUAL SALES OF $0.5 TO $1.0 MILLION IN 2019,  REPRESENTING WHAT WE VIEW AS CURRENT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE  CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT WE WILL GENERATE ALL OR ANY OF THESE  ADDITIONAL PURCHASE ORDERS, OR THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL NOT BE  CANCELED BY THE DISTRIBUTORS OR THAT PARTS TO BUILD PRODUCT WILL BE  AVAILABLE TO MEET DEMAND, SUCH THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL RESULT IN  ACTUAL SALES. BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORT HISTORY OF SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS, WE CANNOT CONFIDENTLY PREDICT FUTURE SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS BEYOND THIS TIME FRAME AND CANNOT BE ASSURED OF ANY  PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY  PARTICULAR TRENDS WITH REGARD TO SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS.  22  RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  ON  DECEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A CO-DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH  NEWMARS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\u201cNTI\u201d), WHEREBY NTI WILL  PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE LUVIVA DEVICE FOR ITS CONTRACTED  DISTRIBUTION COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND RUSSIA AT ITS ISO  13485 FACILITY IN HUNGARY.  THE AGREEMENT ENABLES  NEWMARS TO MANUFACTURE LUVIVA\u00ae ADVANCE CERVICAL SCAN DEVICES  IN HUNGARY FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE NINE CENTRAL AND EASTERN  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR WHICH NEWMARS HAS DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.  GUIDED THERAPEUTICS WILL MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES AND SELL THESE  AND OTHER PARTS TO NEWMARS AND WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL $2,000  ROYALTY FOR EACH DEVICE SOLD IN THOSE COUNTRIES, WHICH INCLUDE  RUSSIA, UKRAINE, POLAND, ROMANIA, HUNGARY, MOLDOVA, KAZAKHSTAN,  BELARUS AND ARMENIA, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS  AND PARTS ORDERS.  THE ADDITIONAL CARVE OUT FOR THESE  TERRITORIES HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY SMI. THE AGREEMENT WITH NEWMARS  DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO MANUFACTURE SINGLE USE CERVICAL GUIDES,  WHICH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY.  WE RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL FROM THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH  & FAMILY WELFARE TO ALLOW COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE LUVIVA  DEVICE AND DISPOSABLES. THE MINISTRY CONCLUDED THAT THE LUVIVA  DEVICE IS \u201cNON INVASIVE\u201d AND AS SUCH IS \u201cNOT  REGULATED UNDER THE DRUGS AND COSMETICS ACT 1940 AND MEDICAL DEVICE  RULES 2017 THEREUNDER.\u201d AS A RESULT, LUVIVA CAN NOW BE  COMMERCIALIZED IN INDIA.  ON  AUGUST 31, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN HOLDERS OF  THE OUR SERIES C1 PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE  \u201cSERIES C1 PREFERRED STOCK\u201d), INCLUDING JOHN IMHOFF,  THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND MARK FAUPEL, THE CHIEF  OPERATING OFFICER AND A DIRECTOR OF OUR COMPANY (THE  \u201cEXCHANGE AGREEMENTS\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THOSE HOLDERS  SEPARATELY AGREED TO EXCHANGE EACH SHARE OF THE SERIES C1 PREFERRED  STOCK HELD FOR ONE (1) SHARE OF OUR NEWLY CREATED SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE \u201cSERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK\u201d). IN TOTAL, FOR 3,262 SHARES OF SERIES C1  PREFERRED STOCK TO BE SURRENDERED, WE ISSUED 3,262 SHARES OF SERIES  C2 PREFERRED STOCK.  ON  OCTOBER 19, 2018, WE HELD OUR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  (THE \u201cANNUAL MEETING\u201d). AS DESCRIBED IN THE OUR  DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14A, AS AMENDED, ORIGINALLY  FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON OCTOBER 11,  2018, AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, STOCKHOLDERS VOTED AND APPROVED THE  FOLLOWING PROPOSALS: (1) THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTOR-NOMINEES (THE  \u201cDIRECTORS\u201d) OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE  \u201cBOARD\u201d), WITH THE FIVE DIRECTORS RECEIVING THE HIGHEST  NUMBER OF AFFIRMATIVE VOTES CAST BY HOLDERS OF SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK AND HOLDERS OF SERIES C2 PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A SINGLE  CLASS; (2) THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF UHY LLP AS OUR  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM BY A MAJORITY OF THE  VOTES CAST BY THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND OF SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A SINGLE CLASS; (3) AN AMENDMENT TO THE  RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE  \u201cCERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\u201d), TO ENABLE A POTENTIAL  REVERSE SPLIT OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK  AT A RATIO OF BETWEEN 1-FOR-25 AND 1-FOR-800, WITH SUCH RATIO TO BE  DETERMINED AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD AND WITH SUCH  REVERSE SPLIT TO BE EFFECTED AT SUCH TIME AND DATE ON OR BEFORE  MARCH 31, 2019, IF AT ALL, AS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD IN ITS SOLE  DISCRETION (THE \u201cREVERSE SPLIT AMENDMENT\u201d) BY A  MAJORITY OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK VOTING AS A SINGLE CLASS; (4) THE ADOPTION OF AN  AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, TO, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, INCREASE OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK FROM 1,000,000,000  SHARES TO 3,000,000,000 SHARES; AND (5) THE ADOPTION OF OUR 2018  STOCK OPTION PLAN AND THE MATERIAL TERMS THEREUNDER (THE  \u201cPLAN\u201d) BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST BY THE HOLDERS  OF COMMON STOCK AND OF SERIES C2 PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A  SINGLE CLASS.  ON  NOVEMBER 7, 2018, WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF COMMON STOCK SHARES  AUTHORIZED FROM ONE BILLION TO THREE BILLION.  A 1:800  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF ALL OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WAS IMPLEMENTED ON MARCH 29, 2019. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. ALL FRACTIONAL  SHARES CREATED BY THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE ROUNDED TO THE  NEAREST WHOLE SHARE. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK DID NOT CHANGE.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR  MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST  CRITICAL TO INVESTORS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND  CONDITION, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL EARLY IN OUR  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT, THE NUMBER OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRING  EXPLANATION IS LIMITED. AS WE BEGIN TO GENERATE INCREASED REVENUE  FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, WE EXPECT THAT THE NUMBER OF APPLICABLE  POLICIES AND COMPLEXITY OF THE JUDGMENTS REQUIRED WILL  INCREASE.  23  REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  ASC 606  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ESTABLISHES A SINGLE AND  COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH SETS OUT HOW MUCH REVENUE IS TO BE  RECOGNIZED, AND WHEN. THE CORE PRINCIPLE IS THAT A VENDOR SHOULD  RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR  SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION  TO WHICH THE VENDOR EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE  GOODS OR SERVICES. REVENUE WILL NOW BE RECOGNIZED BY A VENDOR WHEN  CONTROL OVER THE GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  IN CONTRAST, REVENUE BASED REVENUE RECOGNITION AROUND AN ANALYSIS  OF THE TRANSFER OF RISKS AND REWARDS; THIS NOW FORMS ONE OF A  NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT ARE ASSESSED IN DETERMINING WHETHER CONTROL  HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED. THE APPLICATION OF THE CORE PRINCIPLE IN ASC  606 IS CARRIED OUT IN FIVE STEPS: STEP 1 \u2013 IDENTIFY THE  CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER: A CONTRACT IS DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT  (INCLUDING ORAL AND IMPLIED), BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PARTIES, THAT  CREATES ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND SETS OUT THE  CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THOSE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. THE CONTRACT  NEEDS TO HAVE COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE  ENTITY WILL COLLECT THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH IT WILL BE ENTITLED.  STEP 2 \u2013 IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE  CONTRACT: A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN A CONTRACT IS A PROMISE  (INCLUDING IMPLICIT) TO TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF BEING DISTINCT AND  IS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE IN THE CONTRACT. STEP 3 \u2013  DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE: TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF  CONSIDERATION THAT THE ENTITY CAN BE ENTITLED TO, IN EXCHANGE FOR  TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED GOODS AND SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER,  EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. STEP 4  \u2013 ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT: FOR A CONTRACT THAT HAS MORE THAN ONE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE ENTITY WILL ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION  PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SEPARATELY, IN EXCHANGE FOR  SATISFYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF  ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDE ADJUSTED MARKET ASSESSMENT  APPROACH, EXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN APPROACH, AND, THE RESIDUAL  APPROACH IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. DISCOUNTS GIVEN SHOULD BE  ALLOCATED PROPORTIONATELY TO ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNLESS  CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET AND REALLOCATION OF CHANGES IN STANDALONE  SELLING PRICES AFTER INCEPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. STEP 5 \u2013  RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS AND WHEN THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION: THE ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT A POINT IN TIME,  EXCEPT IF IT MEETS ANY OF THE THREE CRITERIA, WHICH WILL REQUIRE  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OVER TIME: THE ENTITY\u2019S PERFORMANCE  CREATES OR ENHANCES AN ASSET CONTROLLED BY THE CUSTOMER, THE  CUSTOMER SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVES AND CONSUMES THE BENEFIT OF THE  ENTITY\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS THE ENTITY PERFORMS, AND THE ENTITY  DOES NOT CREATE AN ASSET THAT HAS AN ALTERNATIVE USE TO THE ENTITY  AND THE ENTITY HAS THE RIGHT TO BE PAID FOR PERFORMANCE TO  DATE.  VALUATION OF DEFERRED  TAXES.  WE ACCOUNT FOR  INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LIABILITY METHOD. UNDER THE  LIABILITY METHOD, WE RECOGNIZE DEFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  BASED UPON ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. WE ESTABLISH A  VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT  THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE UTILIZED AGAINST FUTURE  TAXABLE INCOME.  VALUATION OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  GRANTED TO EMPLOYEE, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND  INVESTORS.  ON THE DATE OF  ISSUANCE, THE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AS  DETERMINED USING EITHER THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL OR MONTE  CARLO SIMULATION MODEL.  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURES OF CONVERTIBLE  SECURITIES.  CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT BIFURCATED AS A  DERIVATIVE PURSUANT TO ASC 815 AND NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE  EQUITY COMPONENT UNDER THE CASH CONVERSION GUIDANCE ARE EVALUATED  TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR AT  INCEPTION (A BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE) OR MAY BECOME  BENEFICIAL IN THE FUTURE DUE TO POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS. THE  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE GUIDANCE IN ASC 470-20 APPLIES TO  CONVERTIBLE STOCK AS WELL AS CONVERTIBLE DEBT WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE  SCOPE OF ASC 815. A BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE IS DEFINED AS A  NONDETACHABLE CONVERSION FEATURE THAT IS IN THE MONEY AT THE  COMMITMENT DATE. THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE GUIDANCE  REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE CONVERSION OPTION\u2019S IN-THE-MONEY  PORTION, THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE OPTION, IN EQUITY, WITH AN  OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INSTRUMENT. THE  RESULTING DISCOUNT IS AMORTIZED AS A DIVIDEND OVER EITHER THE LIFE  OF THE INSTRUMENT, IF A STATED MATURITY DATE EXISTS, OR TO THE  EARLIEST CONVERSION DATE, IF THERE IS NO STATED MATURITY DATE. IF  THE EARLIEST CONVERSION DATE IS IMMEDIATELY UPON ISSUANCE, THE  DIVIDEND MUST BE RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION. WHEN THERE IS A  SUBSEQUENT CHANGE TO THE CONVERSION RATIO BASED ON A FUTURE  OCCURRENCE, THE NEW CONVERSION PRICE MAY TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF  AN ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE ON  OCCURRENCE.  ALLOWANCE FOR ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  WE ESTIMATE  LOSSES FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO MAKE REQUIRED  PAYMENTS AND PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE PAYMENT HISTORY OF EACH OF OUR  DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND REVISE OUR  RESERVES AS A RESULT.  INVENTORY  VALUATION.  ALL INVENTORIES  ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST  DETERMINED SUBSTANTIALLY ON A \u201cFIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT\u201d  BASIS. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE NOT  INVENTORIED, BUT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN  PURCHASED.  24  REVERSE STOCK  SPLIT.  ON MARCH 29, 2019,  THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A 1:800 REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF ALL OF OUR  ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. ALL FRACTIONAL  SHARES CREATED BY THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE ROUNDED TO THE  NEAREST WHOLE SHARE. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK DID NOT CHANGE. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT DECREASED THE  COMPANY\u2019S ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM  2,135,478,405 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO 2,669,348 SHARES AS OF THAT  DATE.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON  OF 2018 AND 2017  SALES REVENUE, COST OF  SALES AND GROSS LOSS FROM DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES.  REVENUES  FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES FOR 2018 AND 2017 WERE  APPROXIMATELY $57,000 AND $244,000, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES IN 2018  WERE APPROXIMATELY, $187,000 OR 77% LOWER WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2017, DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT SALES AND  MARKETING EFFORTS. RELATED COSTS OF SALES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $89,000 AND $530,000 IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. COSTS OF SALES  IN 2018, WERE APPROXIMATELY, $441,000 OR 83% LOWER WHEN COMPARED TO  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017, DUE TO INCREASE IN THE INVENTORY COSTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A GROSS LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $32,000 ON THE SALES  OF DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES FOR 2018 COMPARED WITH A GROSS LOSS OF  APPROXIMATELY $286,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR 2018,  DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $244,000, FROM APPROXIMATELY $334,000 IN  2017. THE DECREASE OF $90,000, OR 27%, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO COST  REDUCTION PLANS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PAYROLL  EXPENSES.  SALES AND MARKETING  EXPENSES.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR 2018, DECREASED  TO APPROXIMATELY $195,000, COMPARED TO $245,000 IN 2017. THE  DECREASE, OF APPROXIMATELY $50,000, OR 20% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  COMPANY-WIDE EXPENSE REDUCTION AND COST SAVINGS  EFFORTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR 2018,  DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,077,000, COMPARED TO $2,256,000 FOR  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,179,000,  OR 52%, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND OPTION  EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE SAME PERIOD. FOR 2018, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PROFESSIONAL FEES,  INSURANCE, AND PAID AND ACCRUED COMPENSATION COSTS.  OTHER INCOME.  OTHER  INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $54,000 IN 2018, COMPARED TO $18,000 IN  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017, AN INCREASE OF $36,000 OR 200%. OTHER  INCOME CONSISTS OF REFUNDS FROM PRIOR YEARS FOR INSURANCE  POLICIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2018 INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,763,000,  COMPARED TO $1,106,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE INCREASE OF  APPROXIMATELY $657,000, OR 59%, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF AND INTEREST RECORDED FOR THE VALUE OF THE  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE ON CONVERTIBLE DEBT OUTSTANDING AND  AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS  RECOVERY AND EXPENSE.  FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECOVERY FOR  2018, INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $3,234,000 COMPARED TO FAIR VALUE  OF WARRANTS EXPENSE OF $6,487,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $9,721,000, OR 150% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE FAVORABLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN WARRANT CONVERSION PRICES AND  DECREASE IN STOCK PRICE, IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018.  GAIN FROM EXTINGUISHMENT OF  DEBT.  GAIN FROM THE RESTRUCTURING AND EXCHANGE OF DEBT DUE  TO OFFICERS FOR 2018 INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,039,000,  COMPARED TO NIL FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  NET PROFIT / LOSS.  NET PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCREASED TO  APPROXIMATELY $900,000, OR $1.95 PER SHARE, IN 2018, FROM A NET  LOSS OF $10,974,000, OR $997.64 PER SHARE, IN 2017. THE DECREASE IN  THE NET LOSS OF $11,874,000, OR 108% WAS FOR REASONS OUTLINED  ABOVE. AS STATED PREVIOUSLY, OUR NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY REALIZED DUE TO A $3.2 MILLION GAIN  IN THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECORDED IN 2018 AND A $1.0 MILLION  GAIN FROM EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.  THERE  WAS NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECORDED FOR 2018 OR 2017, DUE TO  RECURRING NET OPERATING LOSSES.  25  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE SALE OF DEBT AND EQUITY, FUNDING FROM COLLABORATIVE  ARRANGEMENTS, AND GRANTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD CASH OF LESS  THAN $1,000 AND A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $10,530,000.  OUR  MAJOR CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CONSISTED OF  CASH OUT-FLOWS OF $1.4 MILLION FROM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING  APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION OF NET PROFIT, AND A NET CHANGE FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1.4 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY REPRESENTED  THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS,  AND PROCEEDS FROM DEBT FINANCING. OUR NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY REALIZED DUE TO A $3.2 MILLION GAIN  IN THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECORDED IN 2018.  ON JUNE  5, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SHENGHUO MEDICAL,  LLC PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED SHENGHUO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO  MANUFACTURE, SELL AND DISTRIBUTE LUVIVA IN TAIWAN, BRUNEI  DARUSSALAM, CAMBODIA, LAOS, MYANMAR, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE,  THAILAND, AND VIETNAM. SHENGHUO WAS ALREADY OUR EXCLUSIVE  DISTRIBUTOR IN CHINA, MACAU AND HONG KONG, AND THE LICENSE EXTENDED  TO MANUFACTURING IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS WELL. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  LICENSE AGREEMENT, ONCE SHENGHUO WAS CAPABLE OF MANUFACTURING  LUVIVA IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISO 13485 FOR MEDICAL DEVICES, SHENGHUO  WOULD PAY US A ROYALTY EQUAL TO $2.00 OR 20% OF THE DISTRIBUTOR  PRICE (SUBJECT TO A DISCOUNT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES),  WHICHEVER IS HIGHER, PER DISPOSABLE DISTRIBUTED WITHIN  SHENGHUO\u2019S EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE  LICENSE GRANT, SHENGHUO WOULD UNDERWRITE THE COST OF SECURING  APPROVAL OF LUVIVA WITH CHINESE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AT  ITS OPTION, SHENGHUO ALSO WOULD PROVIDE UP TO $1.0 MILLION IN  FURTHERANCE OF OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR LUVIVA  FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE  RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS EQUAL TO 2% OF OUR FUTURE SALES IN THE  UNITED STATES, UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $4.0 MILLION. PURSUANT TO THE  LICENSE AGREEMENT, SHENGHUO HAD THE OPTION TO HAVE A DESIGNEE  APPOINTED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (AND RICHARD BLUMBERG IS THAT  DESIGNEE). AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR, AND AS A CONDITION TO, THE  LICENSE, AND TO FURTHER ALIGN THE STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE  PARTIES, WE HAVE AGREED TO ISSUE A CONVERTIBLE NOTE TO SHENGHUO, IN  EXCHANGE FOR AN AGGREGATE CASH INVESTMENT OF $200,000. THE NOTE  WILL PROVIDE FOR A PAYMENT TO SHENGHUO OF $300,000, EXPECTED TO BE  DUE THE EARLIER OF 90 DAYS FROM ISSUANCE AND CONSUMMATION OF ANY  CAPITAL RAISING TRANSACTION BY US WITH NET CASH PROCEEDS OF AT  LEAST $1.0 MILLION. THE NOTE WILL ACCRUE INTEREST AT 20% PER YEAR  ON ANY UNPAID AMOUNTS DUE AFTER THAT DATE. THE NOTE WILL BE  CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE  PER SHARE OF $11,137, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY ANTI-DILUTION  ADJUSTMENT. THE NOTE WILL BE UNSECURED, AND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE  FOR CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT. WE WILL ALSO ISSUE SHENGHUO A  FIVE-YEAR WARRANT EXERCISABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR APPROXIMATELY 22  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION  PRICE OF THE NOTE, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENT.  ON JANUARY 22, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SMI,  PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED SMI AN EXCLUSIVE GLOBAL LICENSE TO  MANUFACTURE THE LUVIVA DEVICE AND RELATED DISPOSABLES (SUBJECT TO A  CARVE-OUT FOR MANUFACTURE IN TURKEY) AND EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION  RIGHTS IN THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, MACAU, HONG KONG AND  TAIWAN. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE SMI AGREEMENT, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR  TO ITS EXECUTION WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH SHENGHUO,  REGARDING THE PREVIOUS LICENSE TO SHENGHUO. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  NEW AGREEMENT, SHENGHUO AGREED TO RELINQUISH ITS MANUFACTURING  LICENSE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS IN SMI\u2019S TERRITORIES, AND  TO WAIVE ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE ORIGINAL SHENGHUO AGREEMENT, ALL FOR  AS LONG AS SMI PERFORMS UNDER THE SMI AGREEMENT. SEE  \u201c\u2014RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.\u201d  BETWEEN  JUNE 13, 2016 AND JUNE 14, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS  WITH HOLDERS OF CERTAIN WARRANTS (INCLUDING JOHN IMHOFF, ONE OF OUR  DIRECTORS) ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN MAY 2013, AND WITH GPB DEBT  HOLDINGS II LLC, HOLDER OF A WARRANT ISSUED FEBRUARY 12, 2016,  PURSUANT TO WHICH EACH HOLDER SEPARATELY AGREED TO EXCHANGE  WARRANTS FOR EITHER (1) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK EQUAL TO 166% OF THE  NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE SURRENDERED  WARRANTS, OR (2) NEW WARRANTS EXERCISABLE FOR 200% OF THE NUMBER OF  SHARES UNDERLYING THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS, BUT WITHOUT CERTAIN  ANTI-DILUTION PROTECTIONS INCLUDED WITH THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS.  AS A RESULT OF THE EXCHANGES, WE EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE ANY  POTENTIAL EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING SHARES  ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS. IN TOTAL, FOR  SURRENDERED WARRANTS THEN-EXERCISABLE FOR AN AGGREGATE OF  22,460,938 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (BUT SUBJECT TO EXPONENTIAL  INCREASE UPON OPERATION OF CERTAIN ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS), WE  ISSUED OR ARE OBLIGATED TO ISSUE 21 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND NEW  WARRANTS THAT, IF EXERCISED AS OF JUNE 14, 2016, WOULD HAVE BEEN  EXERCISABLE FOR AN AGGREGATE OF 4,511 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. IN  CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, IN LIEU OF PRESENTLY ISSUING ALL OF THE  SHARES (FOR EACH HOLDER THAT OPTED FOR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK), WE  AND THE HOLDER FURTHER AGREED THAT WE WILL, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS  AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE WARRANT EXCHANGE  AGREEMENT, FROM TIME TO TIME, BE OBLIGATED TO ISSUE THE REMAINING  SHARES TO THE HOLDER. NO ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAYABLE  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE REMAINING SHARES. THE  HOLDERS THAT ELECTED TO RECEIVE SHARES FOR THEIR SURRENDERED  WARRANTS HAVE AGREED THAT THEY WILL NOT SELL SHARES ON ANY TRADING  DAY IN AN AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEEDING 20% OF THE COMPOSITE  AGGREGATE TRADING VOLUME OF THE COMMON STOCK FOR THAT TRADING DAY.  THE HOLDERS THAT ELECTED TO RECEIVE NEW WARRANTS WILL BE REQUIRED  TO SURRENDER THEIR OLD WARRANTS UPON CONSUMMATION OF OUR NEXT  PUBLIC OFFERING. THE NEW WARRANTS WILL HAVE AN INITIAL EXERCISE  PRICE EQUAL TO THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS AS OF  IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO CONSUMMATION OF THE OFFERING, SUBJECT TO  CUSTOMARY \u201cDOWNSIDE PRICE PROTECTION\u201d FOR AS LONG AS  OUR COMMON STOCK IS NOT LISTED ON A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE,  AND WILL EXPIRE FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE.  26  ON  SEPTEMBER 6, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A ROYALTY AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF  OUR DIRECTORS, JOHN IMHOFF, AND ANOTHER STOCKHOLDER, DOLORES  MALOOF, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE SOLD TO THEM A ROYALTY OF FUTURE SALES  OF SINGLE-USE CERVICAL GUIDES FOR LUVIVA. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  ROYALTY AGREEMENT, AND FOR CONSIDERATION OF $50,000, WE WILL PAY  THEM AN AGGREGATE PERPETUAL ROYALTY INITIALLY EQUAL TO $0.10, AND  FROM AND AFTER OCTOBER 2, 2016, EQUAL TO $0.20, FOR EACH DISPOSABLE  THAT WE SELL (OR THAT IS SOLD BY A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A  LICENSING ARRANGEMENT WITH US).  ON  NOVEMBER 2, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A LOCKUP AND EXCHANGE AGREEMENT  WITH GHS INVESTMENTS, LLC, HOLDER OF APPROXIMATELY $221,000 IN  OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE AND ALL  OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK. PURSUANT  TO THE AGREEMENT, UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 1:800 REVERSE STOCK  SPLIT AND CONTINUING FOR 45 DAYS AFTER, GHS AND ITS AFFILIATES WERE  PROHIBITED FROM CONVERTING ANY PORTION OF THE SECURED PROMISSORY  NOTE OR ANY OF THE SHARES OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK OR SELLING  ANY OF OUR SECURITIES THAT THEY BENEFICIALLY OWNED. WE AGREED THAT,  UPON CONSUMMATION OF OUR NEXT FINANCING, WE WOULD USE $260,000 OF  NET CASH PROCEEDS FIRST, TO REPAY GHS\u2019S PORTION OF THE  SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE AND SECOND, WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT FROM  THE $260,000, TO REPURCHASE A PORTION OF GHS\u2019S SHARES OF  SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, GHS HAS AGREED TO EXCHANGE  THE STATED VALUE PER SHARE (PLUS ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS)  OF ITS REMAINING SHARES OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK FOR NEW  SECURITIES OF THE SAME TYPE THAT WE SEPARATELY ISSUE IN THE NEXT  QUALIFYING FINANCING WE UNDERTAKE, ON A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR BASIS IN  A PRIVATE PLACEMENT EXCHANGE.  A 1:800  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF ALL OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WAS IMPLEMENTED ON NOVEMBER 7, 2016. AS A RESULT OF THE  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING  COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.

SEE  \u201c\u2014RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR INFORMATION REGARDING  CAPITAL-RAISING ACTIVITIES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE WILL  BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE  FINANCING, ADDITIONAL COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS OR OTHER  ARRANGEMENTS, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT OUR  EXISTING AND AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO  SATISFY OUR FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH 2019. WE ARE EVALUATING  VARIOUS OPTIONS TO FURTHER REDUCE OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS TO OPERATE  AT A REDUCED RATE, AS WELL AS OPTIONS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS,  INCLUDING LOANS.  GENERALLY,  SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL WILL BE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP OUR PRODUCTS,  INCLUDING COMPLETING PRODUCT TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS, OBTAINING  ALL REQUIRED U.S. AND FOREIGN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND CLEARANCES,  AND COMMENCING AND SCALING UP MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OUR  PRODUCTS. ANY FAILURE TO OBTAIN CAPITAL WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL  ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS. BASED ON DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WE EXPECT  TO GENERATE PURCHASE ORDERS FOR APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION IN LUVIVA  DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES IN 2019 AND EXPECT THOSE PURCHASE ORDERS TO  RESULT IN ACTUAL SALES OF $1.5 MILLION IN 2019, REPRESENTING WHAT  WE VIEW AS CURRENT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED  THAT WE WILL GENERATE ALL OR ANY OF THESE ADDITIONAL PURCHASE  ORDERS, OR THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL NOT BE CANCELED BY THE  DISTRIBUTORS OR THAT PARTS TO BUILD PRODUCT WILL BE AVAILABLE TO  MEET DEMAND, SUCH THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL RESULT IN ACTUAL SALES.  BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORT HISTORY OF SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CANNOT  CONFIDENTLY PREDICT FUTURE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS BEYOND THIS TIME  FRAME AND CANNOT BE ASSURED OF ANY PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF SALES.  ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY PARTICULAR TRENDS WITH  REGARD TO SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.  33  OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND PRESENTED ON A BASIS  ASSUMING WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESU  LTS OF OPERATIONS.  GENERAL  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PERTAINS TO EMMIS COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (\u201cECC\u201d) AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cEMMIS\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d).  WE PRINCIPALLY OWN AND OPERATE RADIO PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR REVENUES ARE MOSTLY AFFECTED BY THE ADVERTISING RATES OUR ENTITIES CHARGE, AS ADVERTISING SALES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES. THESE RATES ARE IN LARGE PART BASED ON OUR ENTITIES\u2019 ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES/SUBSCRIBERS IN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TARGETED BY THEIR ADVERTISERS. THE NIELSEN COMPANY GENERALLY MEASURES RADIO STATION RATINGS WEEKLY FOR MARKETS MEASURED BY THE PORTABLE PEOPLE METERTM, WHICH INCLUDES ALL OF OUR RADIO STATIONS. BECAUSE AUDIENCE RATINGS IN A STATION\u2019S LOCAL MARKET ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATION\u2019S FINANCIAL SUCCESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO USE MARKET RESEARCH, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUDIENCES IN EACH STATION\u2019S CHOSEN DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET GROUP.  OUR REVENUES VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AS IS TYPICAL IN THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME ARE USUALLY LOWEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.  IN ADDITION TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME FOR CASH, STATIONS TYPICALLY EXCHANGE ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES, WHICH CAN BE USED BY THE STATION IN ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THESE BARTER TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE RECEIVED. WE GENERALLY CONFINE THE USE OF SUCH TRADE TRANSACTIONS TO PROMOTIONAL ITEMS OR SERVICES FOR WHICH WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PAID CASH. IN ADDITION, IT IS OUR GENERAL POLICY NOT TO PREEMPT ADVERTISING SPOTS PAID FOR IN CASH WITH ADVERTISING SPOTS PAID FOR IN TRADE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE SOURCES OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE CATEGORY \u201cNON TRADITIONAL\u201d PRINCIPALLY CONSISTS OF TICKET SALES AND SPONSORSHIPS OF EVENTS OUR STATIONS AND MAGAZINES CONDUCT IN THEIR LOCAL MARKETS. THE CATEGORY \u201cOTHER\u201d INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUES RELATED TO OUR TAGSTATION AND DIGONEX BUSINESSES, NETWORK REVENUES AND BARTER. DURING THE THREE YEAR PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE SOLD ALL OF OUR CITY AND REGIONAL MAGAZINES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . WE ALSO SOLD OUR RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, LOS ANGELES AND ST. LOUIS. THESE SALES IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF NET REVENUES IN FISCAL 2017, 2018 AND 2019.

THESE VARIABLE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATE TO COSTS IN OUR SALES DEPARTMENT, SUCH AS SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND BAD DEBT. OUR COSTS THAT DO NOT VARY AS MUCH IN RELATION TO REVENUE ARE MOSTLY IN OUR PROGRAMMING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS TALENT COSTS, SYNDICATED PROGRAMMING FEES, UTILITIES, OFFICE EXPENSES AND SALARIES. LASTLY, OUR COSTS THAT ARE HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY ARE COSTS IN OUR MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS DEPARTMENT, WHICH WE PRIMARILY INCUR TO MAINTAIN AND/OR INCREASE OUR AUDIENCE AND MARKET SHARE.  KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  THE U.S. RADIO INDUSTRY IS A MATURE INDUSTRY AND ITS GROWTH RATE HAS STALLED. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS IS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: (1) NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS VARIOUS MEDIA DISTRIBUTED VIA THE INTERNET, TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES AND CABLE INTERCONNECTS, AS WELL AS SOCIAL NETWORKS, HAVE GAINED ADVERTISING SHARE AGAINST RADIO AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEDIA AND CREATED A PROLIFERATION OF ADVERTISING INVENTORY AND (2) THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE RADIO AUDIENCE AND TIME SPENT LISTENING CAUSED BY SATELLITE RADIO, AUDIO STREAMING SERVICES AND PODCASTS HAS LED SOME INVESTORS AND ADVERTISERS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RADIO ADVERTISING HAS DIMINISHED.  ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE RADIO INDUSTRY, THE MAJORITY OF OUR STATIONS HAVE DEPLOYED HD RADIO  \u00ae  . HD RADIO OFFERS LISTENERS ADVANTAGES OVER STANDARD ANALOG BROADCASTS, INCLUDING IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY AND ADDITIONAL DIGITAL CHANNELS. IN ADDITION TO OFFERING SECONDARY CHANNELS, THE HD RADIO SPECTRUM ALLOWS BROADCASTERS TO TRANSMIT OTHER FORMS OF DATA. WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH OTHER BROADCASTERS TO PROVIDE THE BANDWIDTH THAT A THIRD PARTY USES TO TRANSMIT LOCATION-BASED DATA TO HAND-HELD AND IN-CAR NAVIGATION DEVICES. THE NUMBER OF RADIO RECEIVERS INCORPORATING HD RADIO HAS INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR, PARTICULARLY IN NEW AUTOMOBILES. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT IMPACT HD RADIO WILL HAVE ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGGRESSIVELY WORKED TO HARNESS THE POWER OF BROADBAND AND MOBILE MEDIA DISTRIBUTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES BY DEVELOPING HIGHLY INTERACTIVE WEBSITES WITH CONTENT THAT ENGAGES OUR LISTENERS, DEPLOYING MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND STREAMING OUR CONTENT, HARNESSING THE POWER OF DIGITAL VIDEO ON OUR WEBSITES AND YOUTUBE CHANNELS, AND DELIVERING REAL-TIME TRAFFIC TO NAVIGATION DEVICES.  THE RESULTS OF OUR RADIO OPERATIONS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STATIONS IN THE NEW YORK MARKET, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR RADIO NET REVENUES. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE LARGER STATION CLUSTERS IN THE NEW YORK MARKET ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR MARKET SHARE TO EXTRACT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF AVAILABLE ADVERTISING REVENUE THROUGH PACKAGING A VARIETY OF ADVERTISING INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED UNIT RATES. MARKET REVENUES IN NEW YORK AS MEASURED BY MILLER KAPLAN ARASE LLP (\u201cMILLER KAPLAN\u201d), AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACCOUNTING FIRM USED BY THE RADIO INDUSTRY TO COMPILE REVENUE INFORMATION, WERE DOWN  2.  0% FOR THE TWELV  E MON  THS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. DURING THIS PERIOD, REVENUES FOR OUR NEW YORK CLUSTER WERE DOWN  3.4%.  OUR UNDERPERFORMANCE IN NEW YORK WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER TICKET SALES REVENUE FOR OUR LARGEST CON  CERT, SUMMER JAM. POOR WEATHER ON THE DAY OF THE CONCERT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TICKET SALES.  AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE HOLD PROMISE FOR LONG-TERM APPRECIATION IN VALUE AND LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS. HOWEVER, EMMIS\u2019 LONG-TERM DEBT AGREEMENTS SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS AND MAY OPPORTUNISTICALLY DISPOSE OF ASSETS WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. IN THAT RESPECT, OVER THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS WE HAVE SOLD RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, LOS ANGELES AND ST. LOUIS. WE HAVE ALSO SOLD ALL OF OUR PUBLISHING ASSETS, EXCEPT  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE SALE OF WLIB-AM IN NEW YORK AND OTHER ASSETS, INCLUDING LAND IN INDIANAPOLIS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ENCOMPASS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND POTENTIALLY DERIVE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  BROADCASTING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE AIRED. PUBLICATION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE MONTH OF DELIVERY OF THE PUBLICATION. BOTH BROADCASTING REVENUE AND PUBLICATION REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS SUCH AS PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE THAT AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS AND COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. THESE CRITERIA ARE GENERALLY MET AT THE TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AIRED FOR BROADCASTING REVENUE AND UPON DELIVERY OF THE PUBLICATION FOR PUBLICATION REVENUE. ADVERTISING REVENUES PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REFLECTED ON A NET BASIS, AFTER THE DEDUCTION OF ADVERTISING AGENCY FEES, USUALLY AT A RATE OF 15% OF GROSS REVENUES.  FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL  WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST FOR WHICH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL ASSETS. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAVE RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $174.9 MILLION IN GOODWILL AND FCC LICENSES, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 74% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS.  IN THE CASE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES WITHOUT THE RELATED FCC LICENSE FOR EACH PROPERTY. FCC LICENSES ARE RENEWED EVERY EIGHT YEARS; CONSEQUENTLY, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR OUR STATIONS\u2019 COMPLIANCE WITH THE VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. HISTORICALLY, ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES HAVE BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PERIODS, AND WE EXPECT THAT ALL FCC LICENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RENEWED IN THE FUTURE. WE CONSIDER OUR FCC LICENSES TO BE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES.  WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL OR OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BUT RATHER TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. WHEN EVALUATING OUR RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE TESTING IS PERFORMED AT THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING LEVEL AS DETERMINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 350-30-35. IN OUR CASE, RADIO STATIONS IN A GEOGRAPHIC MARKET CLUSTER ARE CONSIDERED A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING OPERATED UNDER A LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENT BY ANOTHER BROADCASTER.  WE COMPLETE OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR AND PERFORM ADDITIONAL INTERIM IMPAIRMENT TESTING WHENEVER TRIGGERING EVENTS SUGGEST SUCH TESTING IS WARRANTED.  VALUATION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED BROADCASTING LICENSES  FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC LICENSES IS ESTIMATED TO BE THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC LICENSES, THE COMPANY USES AN INCOME VALUATION METHOD WHEN IT PERFORMS ITS IMPAIRMENT TESTS. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE COMPANY PROJECTS CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE GENERATED BY EACH OF ITS UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ASSUMING THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WAS COMMENCING OPERATIONS IN ITS RESPECTIVE MARKET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VALUATION PERIOD. THIS CASH FLOW STREAM IS DISCOUNTED TO ARRIVE AT A VALUE FOR THE FCC LICENSE. THE COMPANY ASSUMES THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION THAT EXISTS IN EACH MARKET REMAINS UNCHANGED, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT ITS UNIT OF ACCOUNTING COMMENCED OPERATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VALUATION PERIOD. IN DOING SO, THE COMPANY EXTRACTS THE VALUE OF GOING CONCERN AND ANY OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED, AND STRICTLY VALUES THE FCC LICENSE. MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDE MARKET REVENUE, MARKET REVENUE GROWTH RATES, UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AUDIENCE SHARE, UNIT OF ACCOUNTING REVENUE SHARE AND DISCOUNT RATE. EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BASED UPON CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AUDIENCE BEHAVIOR, CONSUMMATED TRANSACTIONS, AND NUMEROUS OTHER VARIABLES THAT MAY BE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THE PROJECTIONS INCORPORATED INTO OUR LICENSE VALUATIONS TAKE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INTO CONSIDERATION.  BELOW ARE SOME OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE REDUCED LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE BASED ON RECENT INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MARKETS GOING FORWARD. THE METHODOLOGY USED TO VALUE OUR FCC LICENSES HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  DECEMBER 1, 2016  DECEMBER 1, 2017  DECEMBER 1, 2018  DISCOUNT RATE  12.2% - 12.5%  12.1% - 12.4%  11.9% - 12.3%  LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATE  1.0% - 2.0%  1.0% - 1.8%  0.3% - 1.0%  MATURE MARKET SHARE  3.1% - 30.4%  12.7% - 31.1%  12.9% - 30.2%  OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN  25.1% - 39.1%  27.0% - 39.1%  26.0% - 38.0%  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO FCC LICENSES IN TWO OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECOGNIZED AS PART OF OUR DECEMBER 1, 2016 AND 2018 ANNUAL TESTING WERE $6.9 MILLION AND $0.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE IMPAIRMENTS WERE MOSTLY RELATED TO DECLINING MARKET REVENUES COMBINED WITH LOWERED EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATES AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL  ASC TOPIC 350-20-35 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS IMPAIRMENT TEST ON DECEMBER 1 OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, UNLESS INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD. WHEN ASSESSING ITS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY USES AN ENTERPRISE VALUATION APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTING UNITS (RADIO STATIONS GROUPED BY MARKET, EXCLUDING ANY STATIONS THAT ARE BEING OPERATED PURSUANT TO AN LMA). MANAGEMENT DETERMINES ENTERPRISE VALUE FOR EACH OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY MULTIPLYING THE TWO-YEAR AVERAGE STATION OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY EACH REPORTING UNIT (CURRENT YEAR BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE NEXT YEAR BASED ON BUDGETED RESULTS) BY AN ESTIMATED MARKET MULTIPLE. THE COMPANY USES A BLENDED STATION OPERATING INCOME TRADING MULTIPLE OF PUBLICLY TRADED RADIO OPERATORS AS WELL AS RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE MULTIPLE IT APPLIES TO ITS RADIO REPORTING UNITS. FOR THE ANNUAL ASSESSMENT PERFORMED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE COMPANY APPLIED A MARKET MULTIPLE OF 8.0 TIMES THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS METHODOLOGY FOR VALUING RADIO PROPERTIES IS A COMMON APPROACH AND BELIEVES THAT THE MULTIPLES USED IN THE VALUATION ARE REASONABLE GIVEN OUR PEER COMPARISONS AND MARKET TRANSACTIONS. TO CORROBORATE THE FAIR VALUES DETERMINED USING THE MARKET APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT ALSO USES AN INCOME APPROACH, WHICH IS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2017-04, INTANGIBLES - GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF MARCH 1, 2017. PRIOR TO MARCH 1, 2017, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT RECORDED DURING THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2017 WAS RECORDED USING THE TWO-STEP METHODOLOGY. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED FROM MARCH 1, 2017 FORWARD WILL BE RECORDED USING THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THE COMPANY USED AN INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF DIGONEX. DIGONEX IS A DYNAMIC PRICING BUSINESS THAT DOES NOT HAVE WELL-ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY TRADING MULTIPLES, ANALYST ESTIMATES OF VALUATIONS, OR RECENTLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD INDICATE FAIR VALUES OF THESE BUSINESSES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY USED A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF DIGONEX.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016, THE COMPANY LOWERED ITS GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR DIGONEX FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO SLOW CLIENT ADOPTION OF DYNAMIC PRICING SERVICES. WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN THE LONG-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS OF DIGONEX, THE LENGTHY SALES CYCLE HAS CAUSED DIGONEX TO PERFORM BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO DATE. THE COMBINATION OF LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS, COUPLED WITH DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE PROJECTIONS, RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT INDICATOR THAT CAUSED THE COMPANY TO ASSESS GOODWILL AND RELATED INTANGIBLES ON AN INTERIM BASIS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016. THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR DIGONEX INDICATED A NOMINAL ENTERPRISE VALUE. THEREFORE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTERIM IMPAIRMENT TEST, EMMIS DETERMINED THAT DIGONEX\u2019S GOODWILL WAS FULLY IMPAIRED AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $2.1 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO OUR IMPAIRMENT OF DIGONEX GOODWILL AND THE SALE OF  TEXAS MONTHLY  (SEE NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DISCUSSION), THE COMPANY\u2019S GOODWILL RELATES ENTIRELY TO ITS RADIO SEGMENT.  DURING OUR DECEMBER 2017 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF $0.3 MILLION OF GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INDIANAPOLIS RADIO CLUSTER. WEAK RATINGS AND DECLINING MARKET REVENUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN INDIANAPOLIS. THIS RESULTED IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INDIANAPOLIS RADIO CLUSTER EXCEEDING ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE BY MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL WE HAD RECORDED FOR THE CLUSTER ON THE ASSESSMENT DATE. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY FULLY IMPAIRED THE GOODWILL OF THIS CLUSTER.  SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR DECEMBER 1, 2018 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES WAS APPROXIMATELY $203.6 MILLION, WHICH WAS IN EXCESS OF THE $170.5 MILLION CARRYING VALUE BY $33.1 MILLION, OR 19.4%. SHOULD OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS WORSEN, OR SHOULD NEGATIVE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR IN THE UNITS THAT HAVE LIMITED FAIR VALUE CUSHION, ADDITIONAL LICENSE IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE NEEDED.  RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES  AS OF DECEMBER 1, 2018  UNIT OF ACCOUNTING  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  PERCENTAGE BY WHICH FAIR  VALUE EXCEEDS CARRYING VALUE  NEW YORK CLUSTER  71,614  102,976  43.8%  98.7FM (NEW YORK)  46,390  47,112  1.6%  AUSTIN CLUSTER  34,720  35,675  2.8%  INDIANAPOLIS CLUSTER  17,823  17,823  0.0%  TOTAL  170,547  203,586  19.4%  IF WE WERE TO ASSUME A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN ANY OF OUR THREE KEY ASSUMPTIONS (A REDUCTION IN THE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATE, A REDUCTION IN LOCAL COMMERCIAL SHARE OR AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE) USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE RESULTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD HAVE BEEN $21.3 MILLION, $13.4 MILLION AND $9.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALSO, IF WE WERE TO ASSUME A MARKET MULTIPLE DECREASE OF ONE OR A 10% DECREASE IN THE TWO-YEAR AVERAGE STATION OPERATING INCOME, TWO OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE RESULTING ESTIMATES OF ENTERPRISE VALUATIONS WOULD STILL EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE ENTERPRISES. AS SUCH, NO ADDITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IF EITHER OF THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS WERE LOWERED.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEFERRED TAXES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR INCOME TAX RETURNS. INCOME TAXES ARE RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AS COMPARED TO AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AFTER DETERMINING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE COMPANY DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT LIKELY TO BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WILL BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST THAT ASSET TO RECORD IT AT ITS EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE.  INSURANCE CLAIMS AND LOSS RESERVES  THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR MOST HEALTHCARE CLAIMS, SUBJECT TO STOP-LOSS LIMITS. CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ARE RECORDED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED WHEN WARRANTED BY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE COMPANY HAD $0.4 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION ACCRUED FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE CLAIMS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS (RANGING FROM $100 THOUSAND TO $250 THOUSAND PER OCCURRENCE) FOR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, EMPLOYMENT LIABILITY, AUTOMOTIVE LIABILITY AND MEDIA LIABILITY CLAIMS.  DISPOSITIONS  THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SALE OF ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS  ON APRIL 30, 2018, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ITS RADIO STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS IN TWO SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS. IN ONE TRANSACTION, EMMIS SOLD THE ASSETS OF KSHE-FM AND KPNT-FM TO AFFILIATES OF HUBBARD RADIO. IN THE OTHER TRANSACTION, EMMIS SOLD THE ASSETS OF KFTK-FM AND KNOU-FM TO AFFILIATES OF ENTERCOM COMMUNICATIONS CORP. EMMIS DECIDED TO SELL ITS STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS TO FURTHER REDUCE OVERALL INDEBTEDNESS. AT CLOSING, EMMIS RECEIVED AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $60.0 MILLION. AFTER DEDUCTING ESTIMATED TAXES PAYABLE AND TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $40.5 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. THE TAXES PAYABLE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY DUE, SO WE REPAID AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVER AND WE HELD EXCESS CASH ON OUR BALANCE SHEET TO ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION UNTIL WE REMIT THE TAXES WHEN DUE. EMMIS RECORDED A $32.1 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF ITS ST. LOUIS STATIONS. OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT. THESE DISPOSALS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS THEY DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF KPWR-FM  ON AUGUST 1, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF KPWR-FM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $80.1 MILLION TO AFFILIATES OF THE MERUELO GROUP. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, EMMIS WAS REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO SELL ASSETS THAT GENERATED AT LEAST $80 MILLION OF PROCEEDS BY JANUARY 18, 2018 AND TO CLOSE ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE SALE OF KPWR-FM SATISFIED THESE REQUIREMENTS. EMMIS FOUND IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO SELL ITS STANDALONE RADIO STATION IN LOS ANGELES THAN TO SELL OTHER ASSETS TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. AFTER PAYMENT OF TRANSACTION COSTS AND WITHHOLDING FOR ESTIMATED TAX OBLIGATIONS, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $73.6 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. EMMIS RECORDED A $76.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF KPWR-FM. KPWR-FM HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT.

SALE OF LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE, ATLANTA MAGAZINE, CINCINNATI MAGAZINE AND ORANGE COAST MAGAZINE  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF  LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE  ,  ATLANTA MAGAZINE  ,  CINCINNATI MAGAZINE  AND  ORANGE COAST MAGAZINE  (THE \u201cHOUR MAGAZINES\u201d) FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $6.5 MILLION TO HOUR MEDIA GROUP, LLC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS PUBLISHING DIVISION, EXCLUDING  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . EMMIS DECIDED TO SELL MOST OF ITS PUBLISHING ASSETS TO REDUCE DEBT OUTSTANDING. EMMIS RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $2.9 MILLION, CONSISTING OF THE STATED PURCHASE PRICE OF $6.5 MILLION, LESS $0.7 MILLION HELD IN ESCROW AND DISPOSITION COSTS TOTALING $2.9 MILLION. THE $2.9 MILLION OF DISPOSITION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO $1.6 MILLION OF SEVERANCE COSTS AND TRANSACTION ADVISORY FEES OF $1.0 MILLION. THE FUNDS HELD IN ESCROW SECURE EMMIS\u2019 POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND WERE SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE RELEASE OF THESE FUNDS FROM ESCROW IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AFTER SETTLING RETENTION BONUSES TO AFFECTED EMPLOYEES, NET PROCEEDS WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. EMMIS RECORDED A $2.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE HOUR MAGAZINES. THESE MAGAZINES HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR PUBLISHING SEGMENT. THIS DISPOSAL DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS IT DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA RADIO STATIONS  ON JANUARY 30, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ITS RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA, IN TWO CONTEMPORANEOUS TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THESE RADIO STATIONS. EMMI  S BELIEVED THAT OPERATING STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA WAS NOT A CORE PART OF ITS RADIO STRATEGY AND ITS STRONG MARKET POSITION IN THE TERRE HAUTE MARKET WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS. AT CLOSING, EMMIS RECEIVED GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATEL  Y $5.2 MILLION FOR BOTH TRANSACTIONS. AFTER PAYMENT OF BROKERAGE AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED $4.8 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018, THE TAXABLE GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF KPWR-FM WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY THE UTILIZATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS.  THE BENEFIT RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018 PRINCIPALLY RELATES TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d), WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. AMONG ITS NUMEROUS CHANGES TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE ACT REDUCED U.S. CORPORATE RATES FROM 35% TO 21%. THE CORRESPONDING REDUCTION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES BASED ON THIS LOWER RATE RESULTED IN A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF $14.2 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 19% FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE DUE TO REALIZATION OF ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX CREDITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY FULLY RESERVED.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY REPAID ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT ON APRIL 12, 2019. CAPITALIZED TERMS IN THIS SECTION NOT DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS 10-K ARE DEFINED IN THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND RELATED AMENDMENTS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT CONSISTED OF THE REMAINING BALANCE OF A TERM LOAN ($69.5 MILLION AND $25.0 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY). THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MATURED ON AUGUST 31, 2018. OUTSTANDING REVOLVER BORROWINGS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 WERE $9.0 MILLION AND WERE FULLY PAID PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDED A SUB-FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO $5.0 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. NO LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE OUTSTANDING DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT BORE INTEREST, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S OPTION, AT EITHER (I) THE ALTERNATE BASE RATE (BUT NOT LESS THAN 2.00%) PLUS 6.00% OR (II) THE ADJUSTED LIBO RATE PLUS 7.00%. THE COMPANY PAID AN UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE OF 75 BASIS POINTS PER ANNUM ON THE AVERAGE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY. PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE TERM LOANS AFTER JULY 18, 2018 WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A FEE TO THE LENDERS EQUAL TO 2% OF THE AMOUNT BEING REPAID. ADDITIONALLY, ON EACH NINETY DAY ANNIVERSARY OF JULY 18, 2018, SUCH REDEMPTION FEE INCREASED BY AN ADDITIONAL 0.5% AND THE INTEREST RATE ON AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING INCREASED BY 0.5%. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS 8.7% AND 10.5% AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT DEBT WAS CARRIED NET OF AN UNAMORTIZED ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT OF $1.8 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT WAS AMORTIZED AS ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRED MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS, INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND CONSOLIDATED EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT).  THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDED A TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANT OF 4.00:1.00. THE COMPANY MAINTAINED COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL COVENANTS THROUGH THE REPAYMENT OF THE TERM LOAN ON APRIL 12, 2019.  THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WERE SECURED BY A PERFECTED FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, THE BORROWER AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND CASH AVAILABLE THROUGH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CAPITAL DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW BUSINESSES.  AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $5.4 MILLION AND NET WORKING CAPITAL OF ($27.4) MILLION. AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $4.1 MILLION AND NET WORKING CAPITAL OF $27.1 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL IS LARGELY DUE TO OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS BEING CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND OUR $25.0 MILLION TERM LOAN, WHICH WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR GIVEN ITS APRIL 2019 MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY PROJECTS ITS ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS, WHICH INCLUDE ITS OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL NEEDS, AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY CAN MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND AND PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE PROJECTIONS, MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THE COMPANY WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT COVENANTS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SINCE WE MANAGE CASH ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, ANY CASH NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR SEGMENT OR OPERATING ENTITY ARE MET BY INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS. SEE INVESTING ACTIVITIES BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF SPECIFIC SEGMENT NEEDS.  A DISCUSSION OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2017 IS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018, FILED ON MAY 10, 2018, AS PART OF ITEM 7, MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDI  TION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $0.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 VERSUS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $7.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN CASH PAID FOR INTEREST.  DURING THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS RADIO STATION IN LOS ANGELES AND ITS RADIO STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS AND USED THE MAJORITY OF THE NET PROCEEDS TO REPAY OUTSTANDING DEBT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $59.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 CONSISTED OF $60.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $0.5 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $78.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 CONSISTED OF $80.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF KPWR-FM IN LOS ANGELES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $65.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 PRIMARILY RELATES TO NET PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OF $60.0 MILLION, DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $5.3 MILLION AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS OF $0.6 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $85.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 PRIMARILY RELATES TO NET PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OF $79.1 MILLION, DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $4.9 MILLION, DEBT-RELATED COSTS OF $1.6 MILLION AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS OF $0.4 MILLION.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, EMMIS HAD $25.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH WERE CURRENT, AND $57.4 MILLION OF NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($7.2 MILLION CURRENT AND $50.2 MILLION LONG-TERM). BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT BORE INTEREST, AT OUR OPTION, AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE PLUS A MARGIN. THE NON-RECOURSE DEBT BEARS INTEREST RANGING FROM 2.0% TO 5.0% PER ANNUM. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE UNDER OUR 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 10.5%.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REFINANCING ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE WAS 6.1%, EXCLUDING OUR VARIOUS NONRECOURSE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REFINANCING ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS OF EMMIS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO BE $1.7 MILLION RELATED TO OUR MORTGAGE, ($0.4 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $1.3 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS), $9.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 98.7FM NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($7.3 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $1.7 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS) AND $1.6 MILLION RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN ($1.3 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $0.3 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS). DIGONEX NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($6.2 MILLION FACE AMOUNT, $6.1 MILLION CARRYING AMOUNT AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019) IS DUE IN DECEMBER 2020. NEXTRADIO NON-RECOURSE DEBT OF $4.0 MILLION IS DUE IN DECEMBER 2021. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE 98.7FM LMA WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY ALL DEBT SERVICE RELATED TO THE 98.7FM NON-RECOURSE DEBT. OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT BEARS INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES BASED ON AMOUNTS BORROWED. AS OF MAY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED ANY AMOUNTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF MAY 3, 2019, WE HAD $8.1 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, $7.0 MILLION OF WHICH MUST BE USED TO PAY REMAINING INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS. AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT DEPENDS UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN OPERATING COVENANTS AND FINANCIAL RATIOS. EMMIS WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AS OF MAY 2, 2019.  AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE HOLD PROMISE FOR LONG-TERM APPRECIATION IN VALUE AND LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS. HOWEVER, EMMIS OPERATING COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS AND MAY OPPORTUNISTICALLY DISPOSE OF ASSETS WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. SEE NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF DISPOSITIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 2019.  INTANGIBLES  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 74% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS CONSISTED OF FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL, THE VALUE OF WHICH DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY UPON THE OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESSES. IN THE CASE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES WITHOUT THE RELATED FCC LICENSE FOR EACH PROPERTY. FCC LICENSES ARE RENEWED EVERY EIGHT YEARS; CONSEQUENTLY, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR STATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. HISTORICALLY, ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES HAVE BEEN RENEWED (OR A WAIVER HAS BEEN GRANTED PENDING RENEWAL) AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EIGHT-YEAR PERIODS, AND WE EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RENEWED IN THE FUTURE.  SEASONALITY  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE USUALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH RESULT IN HIGHER SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. FOR OUR RADIO OPERATIONS, THIS SEASONALITY IS DUE TO THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF MANY OF OUR STATIONS. ADVERTISERS INCREASE SPENDING DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS TO TARGET THESE LISTENERS. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISERS GENERALLY INCREASE SPENDING DURING THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR THIRD QUARTER, IN ANTICIPATION OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFLATION  THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON OPERATIONS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT TO DATE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A HIGH RATE OF INFLATION IN THE FUTURE WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY SINCE OUR SENIOR BANK DEBT IS COMPRISED ENTIRELY OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCINGS AND LIABILITIES  OTHER THAN LEASE COMMITMENTS, LEGAL CONTINGENCIES INCURRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR KEY EMPLOYEES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCINGS OR LIABILITIES.

IN ADDITION TO OUR PROGRAMMABLE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE DESIGN SERVICES, CUSTOMER TRAINING, FIELD ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. OUR PLDS INCLUDE FPGAS, CPLDS AND PROGRAMMABLE SOCS. THESE DEVICES ARE STANDARD PRODUCTS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS PROGRAM TO PERFORM DESIRED LOGIC FUNCTIONS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIGH INTEGRATION AND QUICK TIME-TO-MARKET FOR ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN END MARKETS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION & DATA CENTER, INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, AND AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS GLOBALLY THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL AND THROUGH DIRECT SALES TO OEMS BY SELECTED INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE FIRMS AND BY A DIRECT SALES MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SEC HAS DEFINED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE US TO MAKE OUR MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. BASED ON THIS DEFINITION, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDE: VALUATION OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH IMPACTS LOSSES ON DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS; REVENUE RECOGNITION, WHICH IMPACTS THE RECORDING OF REVENUES; AND VALUATION OF INVENTORIES, WHICH IMPACTS COST OF REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ALSO INCLUDE: THE ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH IMPACTS THEIR VALUATION; THE ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL, WHICH IMPACTS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT; ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WHICH IMPACTS THE PROVISION OR BENEFIT RECOGNIZED FOR INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS, THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH IMPACTS THE VALUATION OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECOGNIZED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE NOT AS SUBJECTIVE, AND THEREFORE, THEIR APPLICATION WOULD NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE AS DIFFICULT, BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.  VALUATION OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF PRIMARILY MARKETABLE DEBT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY SECURITIES. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF  $2.74 BILLION.  WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES FOR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING INDUSTRY STANDARD PRICING SERVICES, DATA PROVIDERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SOURCES AND BY INTERNALLY PERFORMING VALUATION TESTING AND ANALYSES. SEE \"NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\" TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,\" FOR DETAILS OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. IN DETERMINING IF AND WHEN A DECLINE IN VALUE BELOW THE ADJUSTED COST OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, WE EVALUATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS THE MARKET CONDITIONS, TRENDS OF EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT RATINGS, ANY UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND OTHER KEY MEASURES FOR OUR INVESTMENTS. WE DID NOT RECORD ANY OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FOR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES IN FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  OR  2017  . MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WHETHER REALIZED OR UNREALIZED, RECORDED THROUGH THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2019 AFTER THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2016-01.  OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE UPON THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01. THE CARRYING VALUE IS MEASURED AT COST, LESS ANY IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS CHANGES RESULTING FROM OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE IDENTICAL OR A SIMILAR INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. DETERMINING WHETHER AN OBSERVED TRANSACTION IS SIMILAR TO A SECURITY WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO REQUIRES JUDGMENT BASED ON THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURITIES. OUR PERIODIC ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT IS MADE BY CONSIDERING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE\u2019S INDUSTRY, THE INVESTEE\u2019S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STATUS AND SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING AND THE RELATED VALUATION AND/OR OUR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH FINANCINGS. WE ALSO ASSESS THE INVESTEE\u2019S ABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS MILESTONES AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTEE, INCLUDING THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH, THE INVESTEE\u2019S NEED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION AND ANY BONA FIDE OFFER TO PURCHASE THE INVESTEE FROM A  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROSPECTIVE ACQUIRER. THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IS BASED ON THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND ARE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. SEE \u201cNOTE 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WHEN A DECLINE IN VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT OF THE DECLINE. THE IMPAIRMENTS LOSS FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUE FROM SALES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS IS RECOGNIZED UPON THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS AT SHIPMENT, AND IS REDUCED BY ESTIMATED ALLOWANCES FOR DISTRIBUTOR PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND RIGHTS OF RETURN. THE DISTRIBUTOR PRICE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL AND FORECASTED SHIP AND DEBIT CLAIMS, AT THE DISTRIBUTOR AND PART LEVEL TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT PRICING AND BUSINESS TRENDS. FOR FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  54%  OF OUR NET REVENUES WERE FROM PRODUCTS SOLD TO DISTRIBUTORS PRIMARILY FOR SUBSEQUENT RESALE TO OEMS OR THEIR SUBCONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.  REVENUE FROM SALES TO OUR NON-DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS IS RECOGNIZED NET OF SALES INCENTIVES (IF ANY) UPON TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS AT SHIPMENT. SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ON PRODUCT SALES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE.  REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND RENEWALS IS  RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE. REVENUE FROM SUPPORT SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE LICENSES AND SUPPORT SERVICES WERE LESS THAN  2%  OF NET REVENUES FOR ALL OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  VALUATION OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST (DETERMINED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD) OR MARKET (ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE). THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALABLE QUALITY. WE REVIEW AND SET STANDARD COSTS QUARTERLY TO APPROXIMATE CURRENT ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS. OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD STANDARDS FOR PRODUCT COSTS ARE CALCULATED ASSUMING FULL ABSORPTION OF ACTUAL SPENDING OVER ACTUAL VOLUMES. GIVEN THE CYCLICALITY OF THE MARKET, THE OBSOLESCENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT LIFECYCLES, WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORY BASED ON FORECASTED DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE. THESE FORECASTS ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON INPUTS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING BOOKINGS AND EXTENDED BUT UNCOMMITTED DEMAND FORECASTS, AND INTERNAL ANALYSES SUCH AS CUSTOMER HISTORICAL PURCHASING TRENDS AND ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED DESIGN WINS, AS WELL AS MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TECHNOLOGY CHANGES, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND CHANGES IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION. THESE FACTORS REQUIRE ESTIMATES THAT MAY INCLUDE UNCERTAIN ELEMENTS. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMAND THAT WE USE IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR PUBLISHED REVENUE FORECASTS, WHICH ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR DEMAND FORECAST AND THE ACTUAL DEMAND IN THE RECENT PAST HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL WRITE DOWN IN OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ADDITIONAL INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST. IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARE REVIEWED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST AND ASSETS ARE HELD FOR USE, WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSETS. IN THE EVENT SUCH CASH FLOWS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE ASSETS, THE ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES BASED ON THE EXPECTED DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSETS OR BASED ON APPRAISALS. FACTORS AFFECTING IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS HELD FOR USE INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF THE SPECIFIC ASSETS TO GENERATE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS.  WHEN ASSETS ARE REMOVED FROM OPERATIONS AND HELD FOR SALE, WE ESTIMATE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OVER THEIR FAIR VALUE. MARKET CONDITIONS ARE AMONGST THE FACTORS AFFECTING IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE. CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD NECESSITATE IMPAIRMENT RECOGNITION IN FUTURE PERIODS FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS SUCH AS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONSIDERED NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND ARE ONLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL  GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, AND GOODWILL IS WRITTEN DOWN WHEN IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN WHICH THE GOODWILL RESIDES TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED. FOR PURPOSES OF IMPAIRMENT TESTING, XILINX OPERATES AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT. WE USE THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PERFORMED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN FISCAL  2019  . UNLESS THERE ARE INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT, OUR NEXT IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR GOODWILL WILL BE PERFORMED AND COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . TO DATE, NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  XILINX IS A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION OPERATING IN MULTIPLE TAX JURISDICTIONS. WE MUST DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME TO EACH OF THESE JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND APPLY THE APPROPRIATE TAX RATES FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS. WE UNDERGO ROUTINE AUDITS BY TAXING AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DEDUCTIONS AND THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. TAX AUDITS OFTEN REQUIRE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME TO RESOLVE AND MAY RESULT IN INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS IF CHANGES TO THE ALLOCATION ARE REQUIRED BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS WITH DIFFERENT TAX RATES.  IN DETERMINING INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES AND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT AND LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM AUDITS OR DEFICIENCY NOTICES ISSUED BY TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TAXING AUTHORITIES' POSITIONS AND OUR ASSESSMENT CAN CHANGE OVER TIME RESULTING IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN PERIODS WHEN THESE CHANGES OCCUR.  WE MUST ALSO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A RESERVE IN THE FORM OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE.  WE PERFORM A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZE AND MEASURE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS RELATING TO ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING ULTIMATELY REALIZED.  BUSINESS COMBINATION  WE USE THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM THE ACQUIREE BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF FUTURE GROWTH AND MARGINS, FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, EXPECTED COST AND TIME TO DEVELOP IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BRAND AWARENESS AND DISCOUNT RATES. FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH STATEMENT OF INCOME DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED  43%  IN FISCAL  2019  WHILE REVENUES FROM OUR CORE PRODUCTS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE. THE INCREASE IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER ADVANCED PRODUCTS SALES ACROSS ALL END MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNICATIONS. NET REVENUES IN FISCAL  2018  WERE  $2.47 BILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  5%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2017  .  REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED  20%  IN FISCAL  2018  BUT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES FROM OUR CORE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER SALES ACROSS ALL END MARKETS, ESPECIALLY IN DATA CENTER & TME. SEE ALSO \"NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT\" AND \"NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS\" BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PRODUCT AND END MARKET CATEGORIES.  EXCEPT FOR AVNET,  NO  OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OR END CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  10%  OF NET REVENUES FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO GLOBAL MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN END MARKETS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION & DATA CENTER, INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, AND AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR NET REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM SALES OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS, BUT WE ALSO GENERATE SALES FROM SUPPORT PRODUCTS. WE CLASSIFY OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO TWO CATEGORIES: ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND CORE PRODUCTS.  \u2022  ADVANCED PRODUCTS ARE OUR MOST RECENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INCLUDE THE ULTRASCALE+, ULTRASCALE AND 7-SERIES PRODUCT FAMILIES, AND OUR ALVEO BOARDS BUSINESS.  \u2022  CORE PRODUCTS ARE ALL OTHER PRODUCT FAMILIES.  THESE PRODUCT CATEGORIES ARE MODIFIED ON A PERIODIC BASIS TO BETTER REFLECT THE MATURITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. THE MOST RECENT MODIFICATION WAS MADE ON APRIL 3, 2016, WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL 2017, WHEREBY WE RECLASSIFIED OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HOW THESE CATEGORIES ARE ANALYZED AND REVIEWED INTERNALLY.  SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE GROUPED THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED AT THE 28NM, 20NM AND 16NM NODES INTO A CATEGORY NAMED ADVANCED PRODUCTS WHILE ALL OTHER PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED IN A CATEGORY NAMED CORE PRODUCTS.  NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT CATEGORIES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (IN MILLIONS)  2019% OF TOTAL% CHANGE  2018% OF TOTAL% CHANGE  2017  ADVANCED PRODUCTS  $1,952.4  64  43  $1,362.8  55  20  $1,131.3  CORE PRODUCTS  1,106.6  36  \u2014  1,104.2  45  (10  )  1,225.4  TOTAL NET REVENUES  $3,059.0  100  24  $2,467.0  100  5  $2,356.7  NET REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN FISCAL  2019  DRIVEN BY SALES GROWTH IN 28NM, 20NM AND, IN PARTICULAR, 16NM PRODUCT FAMILIES. SALES FROM OUR 16NM PRODUCTS WERE OVER $500.0 MILLION, WHILE SALES FROM OUR 20NM AND 28NM PRODUCTS EXCEEDED $400.0 MILLION AND $900.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL  2019  .  IN FISCAL  2018  , GROWTH ACROSS ALL NODES OF OUR ADVANCED PRODUCTS FAMILIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. SALES FROM OUR 28NM PRODUCTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION, WHILE SALES FROM OUR 20NM AND 16NM PRODUCTS EXCEEDED $300.0 MILLION AND $100.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL  2018  . WE EXPECT SALES OF ADVANCED PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS MORE CUSTOMER PROGRAMS ENTER INTO VOLUME PRODUCTION WITH OUR 16NM PRODUCTS.  NET REVENUES FROM CORE PRODUCTS WERE FLAT IN FISCAL  2019  , WHILE THEY DECREASED IN FISCAL  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL  2019  THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM SPARTAN-6 PRODUCT WAS OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SALES FROM OUR VIRTEX-6 AND VIRTEX-5 PRODUCT FAMILIES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SALES FROM OUR VIRTEX-5, VIRTEX-6 AND SPARTAN-3 PRODUCT FAMILIES.  NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS  OUR END MARKET REVENUE DATA IS DERIVED FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR END CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRIMARY MARKETS, WHICH IS BASED ON REPORTS PROVIDED BY DISTRIBUTORS AND OUR INTERNAL RECORDS. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY, STARTING APRIL 1, 2018, WE CLASSIFY OUR END MARKETS INTO BUSINESSES WITH SIMILAR MARKET DRIVERS: DATA CENTER & TME; AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER; COMMUNICATIONS; AND INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE CLASSIFY REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS, BUT NOT YET SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TO THE END MARKETS, AND NOT IDENTIFIABLE TO AN END MARKET, AS CHANNEL REVENUE. THE CHANNEL REVENUE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS AND WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TO THE END CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE GIVEN PERIOD. THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE CALCULATION IN THE TABLE BELOW REPRESENTS THE YEAR-TO-YEAR DOLLAR CHANGE IN EACH END MARKET.  NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS FOR FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM DATA CENTER. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM TME, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, DATA CENTER.  NET REVENUES FROM AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER INCREASED, IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS, IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES IN FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AUTOMOTIVE AND AUDIO, VIDEO AND BROADCAST.  NET REVENUES FROM COMMUNICATIONS INCREASED IN FISCAL  2019  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM ALL SUB-SEGMENTS, WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTH COMING FROM WIRELESS BUSINESS DRIVEN BY BOTH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF 4G LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) NETWORKS AND THE ACCELERATED GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT RAMP OF 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS. IN FISCAL  2018  , NET REVENUES FROM COMMUNICATIONS DECREASED, DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN SALES FROM BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS, FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET REVENUES FROM INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE INCREASED, IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS, IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  WERE DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM ALL SUB-SEGMENTS.  CHANNEL REVENUE WAS A POSITIVE AMOUNT IN FISCAL  2019  , BECAUSE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS EXCEEDED WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SHIPPED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING SUCH PERIOD. IN FISCAL  2018  , CHANNEL REVENUE WAS A NEGATIVE AMOUNT BECAUSE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS WAS LOWER THAN WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SHIPPED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING SUCH PERIOD.  NET REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY  GEOGRAPHIC REVENUE INFORMATION REFLECTS THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE DISTRIBUTORS, OEMS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS WHO PURCHASED OUR PRODUCTS. THIS MAY DIFFER FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE END CUSTOMERS. NET REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM DATA CENTER AND WIRELINE, AND THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE.  NET REVENUES IN ASIA PACIFIC INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM WIRELESS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, FROM INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL, WHILE THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES FROM CONSUMER, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FROM INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL.  NET REVENUES IN EUROPE INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL  2019  , THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AUTOMOTIVE, WHILE IN FISCAL  2018  THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH FROM TME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES FROM WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS.  NET REVENUES IN JAPAN INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL 2019, THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES IN TME AND AUDIO, VIDEO AND BROADCAST, WHILE IN FISCAL 2018 THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES IN TME AND INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO END-MARKET MIX, AS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DERIVED FROM WIRELESS (WHICH HAS RELATIVELY LOWER GROSS MARGIN) HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  GROSS MARGIN MAY BE AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE IN \"RISK FACTORS,\" INCLUDED IN PART I OF THIS FORM 10-K, SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE-PRICING PRESSURE, MANUFACTURING-YIELD ISSUES AND WAFER PRICING. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MITIGATE ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS FROM THESE FACTORS BY CONTINUING TO IMPROVE YIELDS ON OUR ADVANCED PRODUCTS, IMPROVE MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE MANAGEMENT, CONTINUING GROWTH IN WIRELESS DRIVEN BY BOTH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF 4G LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) NETWORKS AND THE RAMP UP GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT OF 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGIN IN THE FUTURE.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WE PASS MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF REDUCED PRICES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN ACCEPTABLE MARGINS. PRICE EROSION IS COMMON IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, AS ADVANCES IN BOTH PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PERMIT CONTINUAL REDUCTIONS IN UNIT COST. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO OFFSET MUCH OF THIS REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR MATURE PRODUCTS WITH INCREASED REVENUES FROM NEWER PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  CHANGE  2018  CHANGE  2017  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $743.0  16%  $639.8  6%  $601.4  PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  24%  26%  26%  R&D SPENDING INCREASED BY $103.2 MILLION OR  16%  DURING FISCAL  2019  , AND BY $38.4 MILLION OR  6%  DURING FISCAL  2018  , FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION), AS WE INCREASED HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS. FOR FISCAL 2018, THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MASK AND WAFER SPENDING.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO SELECTIVELY INVEST IN R&D EFFORTS IN AREAS SUCH AS NEW PRODUCTS AND MORE ADVANCED PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, IP CORES AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONSIDER ACQUISITIONS TO COMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY FOR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES IN CRITICAL AREAS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  CHANGE  2018  CHANGE  2017  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  $398.4  10%  $362.3  8%  $335.2  PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  13%  15%  14%  SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED BY $36.1 MILLION OR  10%  DURING FISCAL  2019  , AND BY $27.1 MILLION OR  8%  DURING FISCAL  2018  , FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VARIABLE SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGIN SUCH AS SALES COMMISSION AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. IN FISCAL  2018  , THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) FROM INCREASED HEADCOUNT RELATING TO REVENUE GROWTH.  EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE TRANSITION OF OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER POSITION, WHEREBY MOSHE GAVRIELOV RESIGNED FROM THOSE ROLES AND VICTOR PENG ASSUMED THESE ROLES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED RESTRUCTURING MEASURES TO REALIGN RESOURCES AND DRIVE OVERALL OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, WHICH IMPACTED APPROXIMATELY 60 POSITIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND FUNCTIONS WORLDWIDE. WE RECORDED TOTAL TRANSITION CHARGES OF $33.4 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERANCE PAY EXPENSES AND OTHER BENEFITS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2019, THE REMAINING ACCRUAL FOR SEVERANCE AND OTHER BENEFITS WAS IMMATERIAL.

BUSINESS COMBINATION\" TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \"FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" FOR MORE INFORMATION).  THE AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AS CERTAIN INTANGIBLES WERE FULLY AMORTIZED IN FISCAL 2017 AND DURING FISCAL 2018.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  CHANGE  2018  CHANGE  2017  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME FROM THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN FISCAL  2018  , WE HAD NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME OF  $5.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE OF  $8.3 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2017  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME FROM THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LOWER INTEREST EXPENSES FROM THE 2024 NOTES AND ITS RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

THE TCJA PROVIDES FOR NUMEROUS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, THE REQUIREMENT FOR COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED AND THE CREATION OF A NEW TAX ON THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI) OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  SOME PROVISIONS OF THE TCJA BEGAN TO IMPACT US IN FISCAL 2018, WHILE OTHER PROVISIONS IMPACTED US BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2019.  STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 118 ALLOWED COMPANIES TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS AND RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF THE TAX LAW CHANGES DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  WE RECORDED PROVISIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $214.7 MILLION IN OUR FISCAL 2018 RESULTS.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $2.4 MILLION AS MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018. THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ENDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ALTHOUGH THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD HAS CLOSED, FURTHER TECHNICAL GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE TCJA, INCLUDING FINAL REGULATIONS ON A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS, IS EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 740, THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE ANY EFFECTS OF THE GUIDANCE IN THE PERIOD THAT SUCH GUIDANCE IS ISSUED.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF INCOME EARNED IN LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEW TAX ON GILTI.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL TAX RATE OF 31.5% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX NET OF THE REVERSAL OF THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF INCOME EARNED IN LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS.

THE  \u201cCATCH-UP\u201d  PROVISION REQUIRES US TO PAY 100% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH INCOME, IF ANY, THAT EXCEEDS THE  HURDLE RATE BUT IS LESS THAN 125% OF THE QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE (OR 2.1875%) IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER (8.75% ANNUALIZED). THE  CATCH-UP  PROVISION IS MEANT TO PROVIDE OUR ADVISER WITH 20% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS IF A HURDLE RATE DID NOT APPLY WHEN OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDS 125% OF THE QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE IN ANY  CALENDAR QUARTER. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WAS $1.3 MILLION.  THE CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE EQUALS 20% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS IN EXCESS OF UNREALIZED DEPRECIATION SINCE OUR INCEPTION,  IF ANY, COMPUTED AS ALL REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION SINCE OUR INCEPTION, LESS ANY PRIOR PAYMENTS, MEASURED AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR YEAR AND PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE RECORDED CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEES OF $2.1 MILLION IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WHICH WERE NOT CONTRACTUALLY DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT.  NO CREDITS WERE APPLIED TO THE INCENTIVE FEE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019; HOWEVER, THE ADVISER MAY CREDIT SUCH FEE IN THE  FUTURE.  EXAMPLES OF HOW THE INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE CALCULATED ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 0.55%, THERE WOULD BE  NO INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE BECAUSE SUCH INCOME WOULD NOT EXCEED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.75%.  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 2.00%, THE  INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = 100.0% \u00d7 (2.00% - 1.75%)  = 0.25%  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 2.30%, THE  INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = (100.0% \u00d7  (\u201cCATCH-UP\u201d.  2.1875% - 1.75%)) + (20.0% \u00d7 (2.30% - 2.1875%))  = (100.0% \u00d7  0.4375%) + (20.0% \u00d7 0.1125%)  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  = 0.4375% + 0.0225%  = 0.46%  \u2022  ASSUMING NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS OF 6% AND REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION OF 1%,  THE CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = 20.0% \u00d7 (6.0% - 1.0%)  = 20.0% \u00d7 5.0%  = 1.0%  FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE CALCULATION OF THE  TWO-PART  INCENTIVE FEE, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL  GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE CALCULATION UNDER GAAP, SEE \u201c  ITEM 1.  BUSINESS \u2014 TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES \u2014 INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  \u201d  (7)  INCLUDES AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $53.0 MILLION IN  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND $5.1 MILLION OF SECURED BORROWINGS. SEE \u201c  ITEM 7.

SEE \u201c  ITEM 1. BUSINESS\u2014TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED  PARTIES\u2014ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT  \u201d  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  (10)  TOTAL ANNUALIZED GROSS EXPENSES, BASED ON ACTUAL AMOUNTS INCURRED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019 (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN FOOTNOTE 9), WOULD BE $52.0 MILLION. AFTER ALL  NON-CONTRACTUAL,  UNCONDITIONAL, AND IRREVOCABLE CREDITS DESCRIBED IN FOOTNOTE 4, FOOTNOTE 5, AND FOOTNOTE 6 ABOVE ARE  APPLIED TO THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE LOAN SERVICING FEE, TOTAL ANNUALIZED EXPENSES AFTER FEE CREDITS, BASED ON ACTUAL AMOUNTS INCURRED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN FOOTNOTE 9), WOULD BE  $42.6 MILLION OR 10.39% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSETS.  EXAMPLE  THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES THE PROJECTED DOLLAR AMOUNT OF TOTAL CUMULATIVE EXPENSES THAT WOULD BE INCURRED OVER VARIOUS PERIODS WITH RESPECT TO A  HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IN CALCULATING THE FOLLOWING EXPENSE AMOUNTS, WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD REMAIN AT THE LEVELS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  THE EXAMPLE BELOW AND THE EXPENSES IN THE TABLE  ABOVE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF OUR FUTURE EXPENSES, AND ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN. WHILE THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES, AS REQUIRED BY THE SEC, A 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN, OUR PERFORMANCE WILL VARY AND MAY RESULT IN  A RETURN GREATER OR LESS THAN 5.0%. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE NOT IN THOUSANDS.  1 YEAR  3 YEARS  5 YEARS  10 YEARS  COMMON STOCKHOLDERS WOULD PAY THE FOLLOWING EXPENSES ON A $1,000 INVESTMENT.  ASSUMING A 5% ANNUAL RETURN CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF ORDINARY INCOME  (1)(2)  $98  $281  $446  $794  ASSUMING A 5% ANNUAL RETURN CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF CAPITAL GAINS  (2)(3)  $107  $304  $478  $835  (1)  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS EXAMPLE, WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE ASSUMED 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN WOULD  CONSTITUTE ORDINARY INCOME. WHILE WE RECORDED CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEES OF $2.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THESE FEES WERE NOT CONTRACTUALLY DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ADVISORY  AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THE ASSUMED 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE HURDLE RATE OF 7.0% (ANNUALIZED) THAT WE MUST ACHIEVE UNDER THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT TO TRIGGER THE PAYMENT OF AN INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE, WE HAVE ASSUMED, FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS EXAMPLE, THAT NO INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE PAYABLE IF WE REALIZED A 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN.  (2)  WHILE THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES REINVESTMENT OF ALL DISTRIBUTIONS AT NAV PER SHARE, PARTICIPANTS IN THE DIVIDEND  REINVESTMENT PLAN WILL RECEIVE A NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE DISTRIBUTION PAYABLE TO A PARTICIPANT BY THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE CLOSE OF TRADING ON THE  VALUATION DATE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION, AND THIS PRICE PER SHARE MAY DIFFER FROM NAV PER SHARE.

HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ANY AMOUNTS IN THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIPS FOR ANY FUTURE PERIODS. EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS, DOLLAR AMOUNTS INCLUDED HEREIN ARE IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE  INDICATED.  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  WE WERE INCORPORATED UNDER THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON FEBRUARY 18, 2005. ON JUNE 22, 2005, WE COMPLETED OUR INITIAL  PUBLIC OFFERING AND COMMENCED OPERATIONS. WE OPERATE AS AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED,  CLOSED-END,  NON-DIVERSIFIED  MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANY AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED  AS A BDC UNDER THE 1940 ACT. FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE CODE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND OBTAIN FAVORABLE RIC TAX  TREATMENT, WE MUST MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.  WE WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTING IN  DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED PRIVATE BUSINESSES OPERATING IN THE U.S. OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO: (I) ACHIEVE AND GROW CURRENT INCOME BY INVESTING IN DEBT SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE  STABLE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW TO PAY EXPENSES, MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT GROW OVER TIME; AND (II) PROVIDE OUR STOCKHOLDERS WITH LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS BY INVESTING IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES, GENERALLY, IN COMBINATION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DEBT SECURITIES, THAT WE BELIEVE CAN GROW OVER TIME TO PERMIT US TO SELL OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS  FOR CAPITAL GAINS. TO ACHIEVE OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO INVEST IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TOTALING UP TO $30 MILLION, ALTHOUGH INVESTMENT SIZE MAY  VARY, DEPENDING UPON OUR TOTAL ASSETS OR AVAILABLE CAPITAL AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT. WE EXPECT THAT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVER TIME WILL CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 75% IN DEBT SECURITIES AND 25% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AT COST. AS OF MARCH 31,  2019, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS MADE UP OF 75.1% IN DEBT SECURITIES AND 24.9% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AT COST.  WE FOCUS ON INVESTING IN LOWER MIDDLE  MARKET BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BUSINESS\u2019 FREE CASH FLOW AND ITS ABILITY TO GROW IT OVER TIME, ADEQUATE ASSETS FOR LOAN COLLATERAL, EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAMS WITH A  SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, REASONABLE CAPITALIZATION OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, INCLUDING AN AMPLE EQUITY CONTRIBUTION OR CUSHION BASED ON PREVAILING ENTERPRISE VALUATION MULTIPLES, AND THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE  APPRECIATION AND GAIN LIQUIDITY IN OUR EQUITY POSITION, IF ANY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT LIQUIDITY IN OUR EQUITY POSITION WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A MERGER OR ACQUISITION OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, A PUBLIC OFFERING OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S STOCK  OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY EXERCISING OUR RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY TO REPURCHASE OUR WARRANTS, AS APPLICABLE, THOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE RIGHTS. WE INVEST IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT NEED FUNDS FOR  GROWTH CAPITAL, TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS, OR TO RECAPITALIZE OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REFINANCE THEIR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES. WE SEEK TO AVOID INVESTING IN HIGH-RISK, EARLY-STAGE ENTERPRISES.  WE INVEST BY OURSELVES OR JOINTLY WITH OTHER FUNDS AND/OR MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, DEPENDING ON THE OPPORTUNITY, AND HAVE OPPORTUNISTICALLY MADE  SEVERAL  CO-INVESTMENTS  WITH OUR AFFILIATE GLADSTONE CAPITAL PURSUANT TO THE  CO-INVESTMENT  ORDER. WE BELIEVE THE  CO-INVESTMENT  ORDER HAS ENHANCED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES. IF WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN AN INVESTMENT WITH ONE OR MORE  CO-INVESTORS,  WHETHER OR NOT AN  AFFILIATE OF OURS, OUR INVESTMENT IS LIKELY TO BE SMALLER THAN IF WE WERE INVESTING ALONE.  BUSINESS  PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY  WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  REMAINS COMPETITIVE, WE CONTINUE TO SEE NEW INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF PROVIDING A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY IN SUPPORT OF MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT  SPONSOR-LED  BUYOUTS OF LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES IN THE U.S. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE EXITED FIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES WITH A COMBINED FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO THEIR EXITS OF $131.4 MILLION, AND INVESTED $57.8 MILLION IN TWO NEW  PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, RESULTING IN A NET REDUCTION OF THREE COMPANIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF 30 COMPANIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. FROM OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2005 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, WE MADE INVESTMENTS IN  49 COMPANIES, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN SYNDICATED LOANS, FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, BEFORE GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND DIVESTITURES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE MAJORITY OF THE DEBT SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO HAVE A SUCCESS FEE COMPONENT, WHICH ENHANCES THE YIELD  ON OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS. UNLIKE PIK INCOME, WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE SUCCESS FEES AS INCOME UNTIL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED. DUE TO THE CONTINGENT NATURE OF SUCCESS FEES, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ANY OR ALL OF  THESE SUCCESS FEES OR KNOW THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD UNRECOGNIZED, CONTRACTUAL SUCCESS FEES OF $30.1 MILLION, OR $0.92 PER COMMON SHARE. CONSISTENT WITH GAAP, WE GENERALLY HAVE NOT  RECOGNIZED SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES AND RELATED INCOME IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNTIL EARNED.  FROM INCEPTION THROUGH MARCH 31,  2019, WE COMPLETED SALES OF 16 PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT WE ACQUIRED UNDER OUR BUYOUT STRATEGY (WHICH EXCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN SYNDICATED LOANS). IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE SALES HAVE GENERATED $185.9 MILLION IN NET REALIZED GAINS AND  $23.4 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME UPON EXIT, FOR A TOTAL INCREASE TO OUR NET ASSETS OF $209.3 MILLION. WE BELIEVE, IN AGGREGATE, THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE EQUITY-ORIENTED INVESTMENT SUCCESSES AND EXEMPLIFY OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF STRIVING TO  ACHIEVE RETURNS THROUGH CURRENT INCOME ON THE DEBT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL GAINS FROM THE EQUITY PORTION. THE 16 LIQUIDITY EVENTS HAVE OFFSET ANY REALIZED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY INCURRED DURING THE RECESSION IN  CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF PERFORMING SYNDICATED LOANS AT A REALIZED LOSS TO PAY OFF A FORMER LENDER. THESE SUCCESSFUL EXITS, IN PART, ENABLED US TO INCREASE THE MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION BY 70.0% FROM MARCH 2011 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, AND ALLOWED  US TO DECLARE AND PAY A $0.03 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, A $0.05 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN NOVEMBER 2013, A $0.05 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN DECEMBER 2014, AND A $0.06 PER  COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN EACH OF JUNE 2017, DECEMBER 2017, JUNE 2018, AND DECEMBER 2018.  CAPITAL RAISING EFFORTS  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH EXTENSIONS OF AND INCREASES TO THE CREDIT FACILITY AND BY ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FORM OF  PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EXTENDED THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S REVOLVING PERIOD MULTIPLE TIMES, MOST RECENTLY TO AUGUST 2021, AND CURRENTLY HAVE A TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT OF $200.0 MILLION (WITH A  POTENTIAL TOTAL COMMITMENT OF $300.0 MILLION THROUGH ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS OF NEW OR EXISTING LENDERS). DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE SOLD 168,824 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE SOLD 127,412 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY 2.3 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $21.2 MILLION IN MAY 2017,  INCLUSIVE OF THE JUNE 2017 OVER-ALLOTMENT, AND APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION SHARES OF OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $74.8 MILLION IN AUGUST 2018.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS HISTORICALLY, MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THUS  OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE NEW INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON EQUITY. ON MARCH 31, 2019, THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS $11.60 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTED A 6.5% DISCOUNT TO OUR MARCH 31, 2019 NAV PER SHARE OF  $12.40. WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK TRADES BELOW NAV, OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY IS CONSTRAINED BY PROVISIONS OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN ISSUANCE PRICE BELOW THE THEN CURRENT NAV  PER SHARE WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, OTHER THAN THROUGH SALES TO OUR THEN EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS PURSUANT TO A RIGHTS OFFERING.  AT OUR 2018 ANNUAL  MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS HELD ON AUGUST 9, 2018, OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL AUTHORIZING US TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR THEN CURRENT NAV PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THAT THE  NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ISSUED AND SOLD PURSUANT TO SUCH AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXCEED 25.0% OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO EACH SUCH SALE, PROVIDED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAKES CERTAIN DETERMINATIONS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH  SALE. THIS AUGUST 2018 STOCKHOLDER AUTHORIZATION IS IN EFFECT FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. WE SOUGHT AND OBTAINED STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL CONCERNING SIMILAR PROPOSALS AT EACH ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS SINCE 2008, AND WITH  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL, WE ISSUED SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THREE OFFERINGS AT A PRICE BELOW THE THEN CURRENT NAV PER SHARE, ONCE IN MAY 2017, ONCE IN MARCH 2015, AND ONCE IN OCTOBER 2012. CERTAIN SALES UNDER THE  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM IN MARCH 2018 AND APRIL 2018 WERE ALSO BELOW THE THEN CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE. THE RESULTING PROCEEDS, IN PART, HAVE ALLOWED US TO (I) GROW  OUR PORTFOLIO BY MAKING NEW INVESTMENTS, (II) GENERATE ADDITIONAL INCOME THROUGH THESE NEW INVESTMENTS, (III) ENSURE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY TESTS AND (IV) INCREASE OUR DEBT CAPITAL WHILE STILL COMPLYING WITH OUR  APPLICABLE  DEBT-TO-EQUITY  RATIOS. REFER TO  \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \u2014 EQUITY \u2014 COMMON STOCK\u201d  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR COMMON  STOCK.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  OUR ABILITY TO SEEK EXTERNAL DEBT FINANCING, TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AVAILABLE UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, IS FURTHER SUBJECT TO THE ASSET COVERAGE  LIMITATIONS OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH REQUIRE US TO HAVE ASSET COVERAGE (AS DEFINED IN SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT, AS AMENDED) OF AT LEAST 150% ON EACH OF OUR SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS AND OUR SENIOR SECURITIES THAT ARE STOCK  (SUCH AS OUR TWO SERIES OF TERM PREFERRED STOCK).  ON APRIL 10, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING A \u201cREQUIRED MAJORITY\u201d (AS SUCH TERM  IS DEFINED IN SECTION 57(O) OF THE 1940 ACT) THEREOF, APPROVED THE MODIFIED ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN SECTION 61(A)(2) OF THE 1940 ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE SBCAA. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR  SENIOR SECURITIES CHANGED FROM 200% TO 150% EFFECTIVE APRIL 10, 2019, ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 APPROVAL. UNDER THE 200% ASSET COVERAGE STANDARD PRIOR TO APRIL 10, 2019, WE WERE ABLE TO BORROW DEBT OR ISSUE  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 FOR EVERY $1.00 OF EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. STARTING FROM APRIL 10, 2019, UNDER THE 150% ASSET COVERAGE STANDARD, WE MAY BORROW DEBT OR ISSUE SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.00 FOR EVERY $1.00 OF  EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE MODIFIED ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 1940 ACT DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE SEPARATELY SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OF 200% WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR ASSET COVERAGE RATIO ON OUR SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS WAS 997.6% AND OUR ASSET COVERAGE ON OUR SENIOR  SECURITIES THAT ARE STOCK (OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK) WAS 309.1%.  INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AND INCLUSIVE OF  NON-CASH  TRANSACTIONS, WE INVESTED $57.8 MILLION  IN TWO NEW PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, RECEIVED $175.8 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM REPAYMENTS AND SALES, AND EXTENDED $54.3 MILLION OF  FOLLOW-ON  INVESTMENTS TO EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THROUGH REVOLVER  DRAWS, TERM LOANS, AND ADDITIONS TO EQUITY, AS APPLICABLE.

INTEREST INCOME FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES INCREASED 1.7% FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. GENERALLY, THE  LEVEL OF INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF OUR INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD MULTIPLIED BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE YIELD. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF OUR  INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $380.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO $373.4 MILLION DURING THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ORIGINATION OF $44.3 MILLION OF NEW DEBT  INVESTMENTS AND $51.7 MILLION OF  FOLLOW-ON  DEBT INVESTMENTS TO EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES AND $16.5 MILLION OF LOANS PLACED BACK ON ACCRUAL STATUS AFTER MARCH 31, 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE  PAY-OFF  OR RESTRUCTURE OF $65.3 MILLION OF DEBT INVESTMENTS AND $68.3 MILLION OF LOANS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE IMPACT ON THE  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PRINCIPAL BALANCE WHEN CONSIDERING THE TIMING OF NEW INVESTMENTS,  PAY-OFFS,  RESTRUCTURES, AND ACCRUAL STATUS CHANGES, AS APPLICABLE. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE YIELD ON OUR INTEREST-BEARING  INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RECEIPTS RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME, WAS 13.0% AND 13.1% FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE YIELD MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, BASED ON THE  CURRENT STATED INTEREST RATE ON INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS.  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT MARCH 31, 2019, CERTAIN OF OUR LOANS TO  B-DRY,  LLC  (\u201cB-DRY\u201d),  MERIDIAN RACK & PINION, INC.

THE ADDITIONAL COMMON SHARES WILL HAVE A NEW HOLDING PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE DAY FOLLOWING THE DATE ON WHICH THE SHARES ARE CREDITED TO THE COMMON  STOCKHOLDER\u2019S ACCOUNT. COMPUTERSHARE PURCHASES SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET IN CONNECTION WITH THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE PLAN. THE COMPUTERSHARE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN IS NOT OPEN TO HOLDERS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK.  EQUITY  REGISTRATION STATEMENT  ON JUNE 5, 2018, WE FILED A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM  N-2  (FILE  NO. 333-225447),  WHICH THE SEC DECLARED EFFECTIVE ON JULY 13, 2018. THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT PERMITS US TO ISSUE, THROUGH ONE OR MORE TRANSACTIONS, UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $300.0 MILLION IN  SECURITIES, CONSISTING OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS, DEBT SECURITIES, AND WARRANTS TO PURCHASE COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, OR DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING THROUGH CONCURRENT, SEPARATE OFFERINGS OF SUCH SECURITIES.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $225.3 MILLION IN SECURITIES UNDER THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT.  COMMON  STOCK  IN FEBRUARY 2018, WE ENTERED INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH CANTOR FITZGERALD & CO. (\u201cCANTOR\u201d), LADENBURG  THALMANN & CO., INC., AND WEDBUSH SECURITIES, INC. (EACH A \u201cSALES AGENT\u201d), UNDER WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, FROM TIME TO TIME, THROUGH THE SALES AGENTS, UP TO AN AGGREGATE OFFERING  PRICE OF $35.0 MILLION IN WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS  AN \u201cAT-THE-MARKET\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d)  PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD  REMAINING CAPACITY TO SELL UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $31.8 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30,  2018, WE SOLD 168,824 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM WITH CANTOR AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GROSS PRICE OF $11.09 PER SHARE AND RAISED APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION OF GROSS PROCEEDS. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NET PRICE PER SHARE, AFTER  DEDUCTING COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WAS $10.87 AND RESULTED IN TOTAL NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION. CERTAIN OF THESE SALES WERE BELOW OUR THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE DURING THE SALES PERIOD, WITH A  DISCOUNT OF $0.002 PER SHARE, WHEN COMPARING THE SALES PRICE PER SHARE, AFTER DEDUCTING COMMISSIONS, TO THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE; HOWEVER, THE NET DILUTIVE EFFECT (AFTER COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US) OF THESE SALES WAS  $0.00 PER COMMON SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD AT A SLIGHT DISCOUNT TO NAV PER SHARE AND RESULTING ROUNDING. IN AGGREGATE, THE SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018 WERE ABOVE OUR THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV  PER SHARE.  IN MARCH 2018, WE SOLD 127,412 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE ATM PROGRAM WITH CANTOR AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE GROSS PRICE OF $10.45 PER  SHARE AND RAISED APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION OF GROSS PROCEEDS. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NET PRICE PER SHARE, AFTER DEDUCTING COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WAS $10.24 AND RESULTED IN TOTAL NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.3 MILLION. THESE SALES WERE BELOW OUR THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE DURING THE SALES PERIOD, WITH SUCH DISCOUNTS RANGING FROM $0.01 PER SHARE TO $0.07 PER SHARE, WHEN COMPARING THE SALES PRICE PER SHARE, AFTER DEDUCTING COMMISSIONS,  TO THE THEN-CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE; HOWEVER, THE NET DILUTIVE EFFECT (AFTER COMMISSIONS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US) OF THESE SALES WAS $0.00 PER COMMON SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD AT A SLIGHT DISCOUNT TO NAV PER  SHARE AND RESULTING ROUNDING.  IN MAY 2017, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 2.1 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF  $9.38 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS BELOW OUR THEN CURRENT NAV OF $9.95 PER SHARE. GROSS PROCEEDS TOTALED $19.7 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND ESTIMATED OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WERE  $18.7 MILLION, WHICH WERE USED TO REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN JUNE 2017, THE UNDERWRITERS PARTIALLY EXERCISED THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION AND PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 155,265 SHARES AT  THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $9.38 PER SHARE AND ON THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS SOLELY TO COVER OVER-ALLOTMENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN GROSS PROCEEDS OF $1.5 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND  OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, OF $1.4 MILLION.  64  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ANTICIPATE ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT  DETERMINE THE TIMING OR TERMS OF ANY FUTURE EQUITY ISSUANCES OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO ISSUE EQUITY ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK IS TRADING AT A PRICE BELOW NAV PER SHARE, THE 1940 ACT PLACES REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS  ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BY ISSUING COMMON STOCK. GENERALLY, THE 1940 ACT PROVIDES THAT WE MAY NOT ISSUE AND SELL OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR NAV PER COMMON SHARE, OTHER THAN TO OUR THEN EXISTING COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  PURSUANT TO A RIGHTS OFFERING, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND MEETING OTHER STATED REQUIREMENTS. ON MARCH 29, 2019, THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS $11.60 PER SHARE,  REPRESENTING A 6.5% DISCOUNT TO OUR NAV PER SHARE OF $12.40 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  AT OUR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS HELD ON AUGUST 9,  2018, OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL AUTHORIZING US TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR THEN CURRENT NAV PER COMMON SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF SUCH APPROVAL, PROVIDED THAT OUR BOARD OF  DIRECTORS MAKES CERTAIN DETERMINATIONS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH SALE. AT OUR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN AUGUST 2019, WE INTEND TO ASK OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF A SIMILAR PROPOSAL SO THAT IT MAY BE IN EFFECT  FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  TERM PREFERRED STOCK  IN  AUGUST 2018, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 2,990,000 SHARES OF OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. GROSS PROCEEDS TOTALED $74.8 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS  AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WERE $72.1 MILLION. TOTAL UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING WERE $2.7 MILLION, WHICH HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DISCOUNTS TO THE LIQUIDATION VALUE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD ENDING AUGUST 31, 2025, THE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE.  OUR SERIES E  TERM PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY AND PROVIDES FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.375% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH EQUATES TO $4.8 MILLION PER YEAR). WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF  OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON AUGUST 31, 2025, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. IN  ADDITION, TWO OTHER POTENTIAL MANDATORY REDEMPTION TRIGGERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED  STOCK, AND (2) IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN ASSET COVERAGE AS REQUIRED BY SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT (WHICH IS CURRENTLY 150%) AND ARE UNABLE TO CORRECT SUCH FAILURE WITHIN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM A PORTION OF OUR  OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK OR OTHERWISE CURE THE ASSET COVERAGE REDEMPTION TRIGGER (WE MAY ALSO REDEEM ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO CAUSE ASSET COVERAGE TO BE UP TO 200%). WE MAY ALSO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SERIES E  TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT OUR SOLE OPTION AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER AUGUST 31, 2020.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM  THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK, ALONG WITH BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK, EACH OF WHICH HAD A LIQUIDATION  PREFERENCE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE VOLUNTARY REDEMPTION OF OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK, WE INCURRED A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $1.7 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN REALIZED  LOSS ON OTHER IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  AND WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED ISSUANCE COSTS AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION.  PRIOR TO ITS REDEMPTION IN AUGUST 2018, OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDED FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.75% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH  EQUATED TO $2.8 MILLION PER YEAR). WE WERE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON DECEMBER 31, 2021, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED  BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK WAS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.  PRIOR TO ITS REDEMPTION IN AUGUST 2018, OUR SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDED FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.50% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH  EQUATED TO $2.6 MILLION PER YEAR). WE WERE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON MAY 31, 2022, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT  UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. OUR SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK WAS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 2,300,000 SHARES OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $25.00 PER SHARE.  GROSS PROCEEDS TOTALED $57.5 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WERE $55.4 MILLION. TOTAL UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING WERE  $2.1 MILLION, WHICH HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DISCOUNTS TO THE LIQUIDATION VALUE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2023, THE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE.  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY. OUR SERIES  D TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDES FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.25% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH EQUATES TO $3.6 MILLION PER YEAR). WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 30,  2023, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. IN ADDITION, TWO OTHER POTENTIAL MANDATORY REDEMPTION TRIGGERS ARE AS  FOLLOWS: (1) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK, AND (2) IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN ASSET COVERAGE OF AT  LEAST 200% AND ARE UNABLE TO CORRECT SUCH FAILURE WITHIN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK OR OTHERWISE CURE THE ASSET COVERAGE REDEMPTION TRIGGER (AND WE MAY ALSO REDEEM  ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO CAUSE THE ASSET COVERAGE TO BE 240%). WE MAY ALSO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT OUR SOLE OPTION AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE USED A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK TO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL 1.6 MILLION  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH HAD A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS VOLUNTARY REDEMPTION, WE INCURRED A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.2 MILLION, WHICH HAS BEEN RECORDED  IN REALIZED LOSS ON OTHER IN OUR ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  AND WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED ISSUANCE COSTS AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION.  PRIOR TO ITS REDEMPTION IN SEPTEMBER 2016, OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDED FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 7.125% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH  EQUATED TO $2.9 MILLION PER YEAR). WE WERE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT  UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK WAS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.  EACH SERIES OF OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS A PREFERENCE OVER OUR COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDENDS, WHEREBY NO DISTRIBUTIONS ARE  PAYABLE ON OUR COMMON STOCK UNLESS THE STATED DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS, ON THE MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL. THE SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK ARE  CONSIDERED LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND, AS SUCH, AFFECT OUR ASSET COVERAGE, EXPOSING US TO ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE RISKS. THE ASSET COVERAGE ON OUR SENIOR SECURITIES THAT ARE STOCK (OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES E TERM  PREFERRED STOCK) AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 309.1%, CALCULATED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT.  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  ON AUGUST 22, 2018, WE, THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE FIFTH AMENDED AND  RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, ORIGINALLY ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 30, 2013, WITH KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (\u201cKEYBANK\u201d) AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LEAD ARRANGER, MANAGING AGENT AND LENDER, THE ADVISER, AS SERVICER, AND CERTAIN OTHER LENDERS  PARTY THERETO. THE REVOLVING PERIOD WAS EXTENDED TO AUGUST 22, 2021, AND IF NOT RENEWED OR EXTENDED BY SUCH DATE, ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE ON AUGUST 22, 2023 (TWO YEARS AFTER THE REVOLVING PERIOD END DATE). AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019, THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED TWO  ONE-YEAR  EXTENSION OPTIONS THAT MAY BE EXERCISED ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AUGUST 22, 2018 AMENDMENT DATE, SUBJECT TO  APPROVAL BY ALL LENDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY COMMITMENT AMOUNT WAS INCREASED FROM $165.0 MILLION TO $200.0 MILLION AND, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CAN BE EXPANDED TO A TOTAL FACILITY AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION THROUGH ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM EXISTING OR NEW LENDERS.  ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY GENERALLY BEAR INTEREST AT  30-DAY  LIBOR PLUS 2.85% PER ANNUM UNTIL AUGUST 21, 2021, WITH THE MARGIN THEN INCREASING TO 3.10% FOR THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST 22, 2021 TO AUGUST 21, 2022, AND INCREASING FURTHER TO 3.35% THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS AN UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE ON THE DAILY UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT OF 0.50% PER ANNUM IF THE AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 50% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT, 0.75% PER ANNUM IF THE  AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS GREATER THAN 50% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 65% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT, AND 1.00% PER ANNUM IF THE AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS GREATER THAN 65% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT  AMOUNT. WE INCURRED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AMENDMENT.  INTEREST IS PAYABLE MONTHLY DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY. AVAILABLE BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS AND APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE SIZE, CHARACTERISTICS, AND QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY BUSINESS INVESTMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES  THAT ANY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON PLEDGED LOANS BE REMITTED DIRECTLY BY THE BORROWER INTO A LOCKBOX ACCOUNT WITH KEYBANK. KEYBANK IS ALSO THE TRUSTEE OF THE ACCOUNT AND GENERALLY REMITS THE COLLECTED FUNDS TO US ONCE A MONTH.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS A SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY, PROHIBIT  CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, LIQUIDATIONS OR DISSOLUTIONS) AND RESTRICT CERTAIN MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES WITHOUT THE LENDERS\u2019 CONSENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO  GENERALLY SEEKS TO RESTRICT DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS TO THE SUM OF (I) OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, (II) NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND (III) AMOUNTS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING BEEN PAID DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 855(A) OF THE CODE. LOANS ELIGIBLE TO BE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, LOAN SIZE, PAYMENT  FREQUENCY AND STATUS, AVERAGE LIFE, PORTFOLIO COMPANY LEVERAGE, AND LIEN PROPERTY.  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO COMPLY WITH OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL COVENANTS, WHICH OBLIGATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAINTAIN CERTAIN  FINANCIAL RATIOS, INCLUDING ASSET AND INTEREST COVERAGE AND A MINIMUM NUMBER OF OBLIGORS REQUIRED IN THE BORROWING BASE. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A PERFORMANCE GUARANTY THAT REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN (I) A MINIMUM NET  WORTH (DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY TO INCLUDE OUR MANDATORY REDEEMABLE TERM PREFERRED STOCK) OF THE GREATER OF $210.0 MILLION OR $210.0 MILLION PLUS 50% OF ALL EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED DEBT RAISED MINUS 50% OF ANY EQUITY OR SUBORDINATED  DEBT REDEEMED OR RETIRED AFTER NOVEMBER 16, 2016, WHICH EQUATED TO $218.7 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, (II) ASSET COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS OF AT LEAST 150% (OR SUCH PERCENTAGE AS MAY BE SET  FORTH IN SECTION 18 OF THE 1940 ACT, AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 61 OF THE 1940 ACT), AND (III) OUR STATUS AS A BDC UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND AS A RIC UNDER THE CODE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AND AS DEFINED IN THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTY OF  THE CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAD A NET WORTH OF $533.9 MILLION, ASSET COVERAGE ON OUR SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS OF 997.6%, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT, AND AN ACTIVE STATUS  AS A BDC AND RIC. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABILITY, AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS BASED ON COLLATERAL QUALITY, OF $137.5 MILLION UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY.  IN JULY 2013, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN EFFECTIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT WITH KEYBANK  EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 2013 FOR A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $45.0 MILLION. THE INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT EXPIRED IN APRIL 2016. PRIOR TO ITS EXPIRATION IN APRIL 2016, THE AGREEMENT EFFECTIVELY LIMITED THE INTEREST RATE ON A PORTION OF OUR BORROWINGS  UNDER THE THEN EFFECTIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. WE INCURRED A PREMIUM FEE OF $75 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN NET REALIZED LOSS ON OTHER ON OUR ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  DURING THE YEAR  ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  UNLIKE PIK INCOME, WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE SUCCESS FEES AS INCOME UNTIL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED. DUE TO THE CONTINGENT NATURE OF SUCCESS FEES, THERE  ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ANY OR ALL OF THESE SUCCESS FEES OR KNOW THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE HAD UNRECOGNIZED, CONTRACTUAL  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES OF $30.1 MILLION AND $28.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY $0.92 AND $0.87 PER COMMON SHARE), RESPECTIVELY, ON OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH GAAP, WE HAVE  NOT RECOGNIZED SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES AND RELATED INCOME IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNTIL EARNED.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DRAWN. SINCE THESE LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS HAVE  EXPIRATION DATES AND WE EXPECT MANY WILL NEVER BE FULLY DRAWN, THE TOTAL LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENT AMOUNTS DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMBINED UNUSED LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 TO BE IMMATERIAL.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE ALSO EXTENDED A GUARANTY ON BEHALF OF ONE OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, CCE,  WHEREBY WE HAVE GUARANTEED $1.0 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS OF CCE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THIS OR ANY PREVIOUS GUARANTIES, AND WE CONSIDER THE CREDIT RISKS TO BE REMOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS  GUARANTY TO BE IMMATERIAL.  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AT COST.

(C)  INCLUDES INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AND SECURED BORROWING AND DIVIDEND OBLIGATIONS ON EACH  SERIES OF OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST PAYMENTS CALCULATED FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE WAS BASED UPON RATES AND OUTSTANDING BALANCES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. DIVIDEND OBLIGATIONS ON OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE  PREFERRED STOCK ASSUME QUARTERLY DECLARATIONS AND MONTHLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS THROUGH THE DATE OF MANDATORY REDEMPTION OF EACH SERIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIOD REPORTED. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OUR INVESTMENT  VALUATION POLICY (WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS) AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2\u2014  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ADDITIONALLY, REFER TO NOTE 3 \u2014  INVESTMENTS  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND OUR APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 820, \u201c  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.\u201d  WE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY AS A  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2\u2014  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  CREDIT MONITORING AND  RISK RATING  THE ADVISER MONITORS A WIDE VARIETY OF KEY CREDIT STATISTICS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TO HELP US ASSESS  CREDIT QUALITY AND PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, ARE USED AS INPUTS IN OUR VALUATION TECHNIQUES. GENERALLY, WE, THROUGH THE ADVISER, PARTICIPATE IN PERIODIC BOARD MEETINGS OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HOLD BOARD SEATS AND  ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE ANNUAL AUDITED AND MONTHLY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. USING THESE STATEMENTS OR COMPARABLE INFORMATION AND BOARD DISCUSSIONS, THE ADVISER CALCULATES AND EVALUATES CERTAIN CREDIT STATISTICS.  THE ADVISER RISK RATES ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE ADVISER DOES NOT RISK RATE EQUITY SECURITIES. FOR LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED BY A  SEC-REGISTERED  NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATION (\u201cNRSRO\u201d), THE ADVISER GENERALLY USES THE AVERAGE OF TWO CORPORATE LEVEL NRSRO\u2019S RISK RATINGS FOR SUCH SECURITY. FOR ALL OTHER DEBT  SECURITIES, THE ADVISER USES A PROPRIETARY RISK RATING SYSTEM. WHILE THE ADVISER SEEKS TO MIRROR THE NRSRO SYSTEMS, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE SAME RISK RATING AS AN NRSRO FOR THESE  SECURITIES. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ON DEBT SECURITIES AND THE EXPECTED LOSS, IF THERE IS A DEFAULT. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM USES A SCALE OF 0 TO >10, WITH >10 BEING  THE LOWEST PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. IT IS THE ADVISER\u2019S UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST DEBT SECURITIES OF LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES DO NOT EXCEED THE GRADE OF BBB ON AN NRSRO SCALE, SO THERE WOULD BE NO DEBT SECURITIES IN THE LOWER MIDDLE MARKET  THAT WOULD MEET THE DEFINITION OF AAA, AA OR A. THEREFORE, THE ADVISER\u2019S SCALE BEGINS WITH THE DESIGNATION >10 AS THE BEST RISK RATING WHICH MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO A BBB FROM AN NRSRO; HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT A >10 ON THE  ADVISER\u2019S SCALE IS EQUAL TO A BBB OR BAA2 ON AN NRSRO SCALE. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM COVERS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS AND THE SECURITIES WE HOLD.  68  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS RISK RATINGS FOR ALL LOANS IN OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018.

AS A RIC, WE GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON THE PORTION OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND GAINS  DISTRIBUTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. TO MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A RIC, WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR STATUS AS A BDC AND MEET CERTAIN  SOURCE-OF-INCOME  AND ASSET DIVERSIFICATION  REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS A RIC, WE MUST DISTRIBUTE TO STOCKHOLDERS AT LEAST 90% OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID DEDUCTION. OUR POLICY GENERALLY IS TO MAKE  DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT UP TO 100% OF INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME.

OUR REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE TITLES AND SOFTWARE TITLES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE NBA 2K LEAGUE BEGAN ITS SECOND SEASON ON APRIL 2, 2019.  TRENDS AND FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS  PRODUCT RELEASE SCHEDULE.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF OUR PRODUCT RELEASES AND THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THOSE TITLES. OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. SALES OF  GRAND THEFT AUTO  PRODUCTS GENERATED  25.7%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . IN OCTOBER 2018, WE RELEASED  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  . SALES OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION  PRODUCTS GENERATED  32.1%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE TIMING OF OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  OR  RED DEAD REDEMPTION  PRODUCT RELEASES MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.  ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND RETAILER PERFORMANCE.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY UNFAVORABLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS DETERIORATING CONSUMER DEMAND, PRICING PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS, CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  70.1%  ,  70.7%  AND  65.5%  OF NET REVENUE DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , FIVE CUSTOMERS COMPRISED  66.6%  AND  65.4%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, RESPECTIVELY, WITH OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS (THOSE THAT INDIVIDUALLY COMPRISED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE) ACCOUNTING FOR  55.8%  AND  53.2%  OF SUCH BALANCE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  40.1%  AND  15.7%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  37.7%  AND  15.5%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  . THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. BANKRUPTCIES OR CONSOLIDATIONS OF OUR LARGE RETAIL CUSTOMERS COULD SERIOUSLY HURT OUR BUSINESS, DUE TO UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND THE CONCENTRATION OF PURCHASING POWER AMONG THE REMAINING LARGE RETAILERS. CERTAIN OF OUR LARGE CUSTOMERS SELL USED COPIES OF OUR GAMES, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY REDUCING DEMAND FOR NEW COPIES OF OUR GAMES. WHILE THE DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT THAT WE NOW OFFER FOR CERTAIN OF OUR TITLES MAY SERVE TO REDUCE USED GAME SALES, WE EXPECT USED GAME SALES TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  HARDWARE PLATFORMS.  WE DERIVE MOST OF OUR REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS MADE FOR VIDEO GAME CONSOLES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS SONY'S PS4 AND MICROSOFT'S XBOX ONE, WHICH COMPRISED  83.7%  OF OUR NET REVENUE BY PRODUCT PLATFORM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PLATFORMS AND THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE OF THESE PLATFORMS. WHEN NEW HARDWARE PLATFORMS ARE INTRODUCED, DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE USED ON OLDER PLATFORMS TYPICALLY DECLINES, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS DURING THE MARKET TRANSITION TO THE NEW CONSOLES. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR CONSOLE HARDWARE SALES. WE MANAGE OUR PRODUCT DELIVERY ON EACH CURRENT AND FUTURE PLATFORM IN A MANNER WE BELIEVE TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE TO MAXIMIZE OUR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. ACCORDINGLY, OUR STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON A SELECT NUMBER OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY TITLES FOR THESE PLATFORMS, WHILE ALSO EXPANDING OUR OFFERINGS FOR EMERGING PLATFORMS SUCH AS TABLETS, SMARTPHONES AND ONLINE GAMES.  ONLINE CONTENT AND DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION.  THE INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IS DELIVERING A GROWING AMOUNT OF CONTENT THROUGH DIGITAL ONLINE DELIVERY METHODS. WE PROVIDE A VARIETY OF ONLINE DELIVERED PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR TITLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH RETAILERS AS PACKAGED GOODS PRODUCTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH DIRECT DIGITAL DOWNLOAD (FROM WEBSITES WE OWN AND OTHERS OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES) AS WELL AS A LARGER SELECTION OF OUR CATALOG TITLES. IN ADDITION, WE AIM TO DRIVE ONGOING ENGAGEMENT AND INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM RECURRENT CONSUMER SPENDING ON OUR TITLES  THROUGH VIRTUAL CURRENCY, ADD-ON CONTENT, AND IN-GAME PURCHASES  . WE ALSO PUBLISH AN EXPANDING VARIETY OF TITLES FOR TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES, WHICH ARE DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS THROUGH DIGITAL DOWNLOAD. OUR \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" DISCLOSES THAT NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS COMPRISED  63.0%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE EXPECT ONLINE DELIVERY OF GAMES AND GAME OFFERINGS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND TO BECOME AN INCREASING PART OF OUR BUSINESS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  27  PRODUCT RELEASES  WE RELEASED THE FOLLOWING KEY TITLES IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  .

THEREFORE, NO PRIOR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RESTATED IN OUR TABLES AND DISCUSSION BELOW. REFER TO NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCLOSURE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN GENERAL, THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 RESULTS IN A MORE ACCELERATED REVENUE PATTERN, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) THE ELIMINATION OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (\"VSOE\") OF FAIR VALUE WHEN ALLOCATING BETWEEN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND (II) THE CHANGE OF OUR ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD TO A USER LIFE. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT ON A GIVEN PERIOD MAY DIFFER FROM THIS GENERAL TREND. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE RELEASED  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  THE ACCELERATION OF REVENUE FOR THIS TITLE WAS MATERIAL AND IS THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION IN OUR \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" BELOW. SEE NOTES 1 AND 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR NET REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS LED BY TITLES FROM A VARIETY OF OUR TOP FRANCHISES, PRIMARILY  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2, GRAND THEFT AUTO  ,  NBA 2K,  AND  WWE 2K.  OUR NET REVENUE  INCREASED  TO  $2,668.4 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $875.5 MILLION  OR  48.8%  COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THIS INCREASE INCLUDED A  $741.2 MILLION  INCREASE  28  IN NET REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE REMAINING INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY SALES OF THE TITLES DESCRIBED ABOVE.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF  $107.1 MILLION  FROM A REDUCTION IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED. OUR DETERMINATION TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ALONG WITH OUR RECENT POSITIVE TREND OF EARNINGS.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR NET INCOME WAS  $333.8 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $173.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $2.90  , AS COMPARED TO DILUTED INCOME PER SHARE OF  $1.54  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . OUR OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCREASED  COMPARED TO THE OPERATING INCOME FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GROSS PROFIT DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSE FOR TITLES RELEASED DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $1,392.0 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH, COMPARED TO  1,246.4 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH FROM  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM SALES, PRIMARILY OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSES AS WELL AS ROYALTY PAYMENTS. THESE NET INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF OUR RESTRICTED STOCK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO BANK TIME DEPOSITS AND PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS.

HOWEVER, THE IMPACT ON A GIVEN PERIOD MAY DIFFER FROM THIS GENERAL TREND. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE RELEASED  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  THE ACCELERATION OF REVENUE FOR THIS TITLE DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 WAS MATERIAL AND IS THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION BELOW. SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM FULL GAME AND OTHER INCLUDED A $576.9 MILLION INCREASE IN NET REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE WAS A NET DECREASE DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM  GRAND THEFT AUTO V,  OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, OUR  WWE 2K  FRANCHISE,  L.A. NOIRE,  AND  MAFIA III,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  42.9%  , AS COMPARED TO  49.9%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 RESULTED IN A 6.1% INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE. THE REMAINING PERCENTAGE DECREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INTERNAL ROYALTIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF WHEN ROYALTIES ARE EARNED AND TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES.  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES  INCREASED  BY  $500.9 MILLION  AND ACCOUNTED FOR  46.5%  OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  41.3%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

SELLING AND MARKETING  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $135.3 MILLION  IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO $108.5 MILLION IN HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES. ADVERTISING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RELEASE OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  IN OCTOBER 2018, OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE.  THE REMAINING INCREASE IS DUE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $33.4 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) INCREASES IN PERSONNEL EXPENSES DUE TO ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT, (II) A REDUCTION OF EXPENSE IN THE PRIOR PERIOD RELATED TO UPDATING THE FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, (III) INCREASES IN IT RELATED EXPENSES FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND (IV) INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RELATED PRIMARILY TO SHARE BASED AWARDS GRANTED UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ZELNICKMEDIA, AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  INCLUDE OCCUPANCY EXPENSE (PRIMARILY RENT, UTILITIES AND OFFICE EXPENSES) OF $22.0 MILLION  AND $18.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR DEVELOPMENT STUDIOS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $33.8 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED PERSONNEL EXPENSE DUE TO (I) INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND (II) HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR TITLES FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $3.7 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RECOGNITION OF A  $11.3 MILLION  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN SEPTEMBER 2017, AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A CERTAIN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IPR&D\") INTANGIBLE ASSET FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MOVE TO OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN DECEMBER 2017 AND AN INCREASE IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.  32  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , BUSINESS REORGANIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED  $19.7 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF A BENEFIT DUE TO UPDATING ESTIMATES FOR AND COMPLETING OUR 2016 PLAN AS WELL AS COSTS RELATED TO OUR 2018 PLAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE MAY RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN FUTURE PERIODS TO TRUE-UP ESTIMATES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL REORGANIZATION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REORGANIZATIONS.

THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A  $16.8 MILLION  INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SIZE OF, NATURE OF, AND RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A  $14.2 MILLION  DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\"), WHICH MATURED JULY 1, 2018. THE NET INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD ON THE EARLY CONVERSION OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WITH NO CORRESPONDING GAINS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  PROVISION/BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES  WE RECOGNIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF  $107.1 MILLION  FROM A REDUCTION IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED. OUR DETERMINATION TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  DURING THE YEAR ALONG WITH OUR RECENT POSITIVE TREND OF EARNINGS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE. THE ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM  35%  TO  21%  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 AND REQUIRED COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE ACT MADE OTHER CHANGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (1) A BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (\"BEAT\"), WHICH IS A NEW MINIMUM TAX, (2) GENERALLY ELIMINATING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, (3) A NEW PROVISION THAT TAXES GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (\"GILTI\"), (4) THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION, AND (5) OTHER BASE BROADENING PROVISIONS.  THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118,  INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACTS  (\"SAB 118\"), WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT'S IMPACT. SAB 118 PROVIDES A MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH SHOULD NOT EXTEND BEYOND ONE YEAR FROM THE ACT ENACTMENT DATE, DURING WHICH A COMPANY ACTING IN GOOD FAITH MAY COMPLETE THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE ACT UNDER ASC 740. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAB 118, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE ACT MUST BE REFLECTED IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 740 IS COMPLETE. WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING AND RECORDED A DECREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $4.6 MILLION  TO ADJUST THE PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. THE IMPACT OF THE ACT DIFFERS FROM THESE ESTIMATES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE, GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED, AND ACTIONS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE ACT.  THE ACT SUBJECTS A U.S. SHAREHOLDER TO CURRENT TAX ON GILTI EARNED BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FASB STAFF Q&A TOPIC NO. 5,  ACCOUNTING FOR GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME  , STATES THAT AN ENTITY CAN MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION EITHER TO RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAXES FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE AS GILTI IN FUTURE YEARS OR PROVIDE FOR THE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO GILTI RESULTING FROM THOSE ITEMS IN THE YEAR THE TAX IS INCURRED. WE HAVE ELECTED TO RECOGNIZE THE RESULTING TAX ON GILTI AS AN EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.  OUR INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS  $101.1 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $36.9 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  , THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  (43.4)%  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $107.1 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, A BENEFIT OF  $35.0 MILLION  FOR TAX CREDITS,  33  $13.3 MILLION  FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, AND  $9.0 MILLION  FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX EXPENSE FROM OTHER IMMATERIAL ITEMS, WHICH INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE ACT.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF  31.6%  , THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  (27.0)%  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $53.2 MILLION  FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES (PREVIOUSLY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT AND TAX DEFICIENCIES WERE RECOGNIZED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL), A BENEFIT OF  $22.6 MILLION  FOR TAX CREDITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UTILIZED, A BENEFIT OF  $15.1 MILLION  FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND A BENEFIT OF  $7.9 MILLION  FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT AND  $10.4 MILLION  FOR CHANGES IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER U.S. STATUTORY RATE, INCREASED TAX BENEFITS FROM CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, INCREASED TAX BENEFITS FROM TAX CREDITS, REDUCED TAX EXPENSE FROM THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND TAX CREDITS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEDUCTIONS TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN, WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE AWARD VESTING. SINCE WE RECOGNIZE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON A DISCRETE BASIS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN EACH PERIOD.  ON JUNE 21, 2018, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION IN SOUTH DAKOTA V. WAYFAIR, WHICH OVERTURNED PREVIOUS CASE LAW THAT PRECLUDED STATES FROM REQUIRING RETAILERS TO COLLECT SALES TAX ON SALES MADE TO IN-STATE CUSTOMERS UNLESS THE RETAILER HAD PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. ALTHOUGH THIS CASE IS LIMITED TO SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS DECISION ON OUR STATE INCOME TAX FOOTPRINT.  THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF TAX PAYABLE IN A GIVEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD MAY BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY SUDDEN OR UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN THE MIX AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS BY TAXING JURISDICTIONS, OR CHANGES TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING RULES OR REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 24, 2018, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN OPINION IN ALTERA CORP. V. COMMISSIONER REQUIRING RELATED PARTIES IN AN INTERCOMPANY COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENT TO SHARE EXPENSES RELATED TO STOCK COMPENSATION. ON AUGUST 7, 2018, THE OPINION WAS WITHDRAWN TO ALLOW TIME FOR A RECONSTITUTED PANEL TO CONFER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS AND THE FINAL OPINION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF  $139.0 MILLION  , OF WHICH  $23.9 MILLION  WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF REALIZED. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS INCREASED BY  $10.5 MILLION.  WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO AUDIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2014. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2013. CERTAIN U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2017.  WE ARE REGULARLY AUDITED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR REASONABLY FORESEEABLE TAX ASSESSMENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR NET INCOME WAS  $333.8 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO  $173.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $2.90  , AS COMPARED TO  $1.54  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING OF  115.2 MILLION  WERE  2.4 MILLION  HIGHER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SETTLEMENT ON CONVERSION OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK USING THE STATED CONVERSION RATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, NORMAL STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY INCLUDING GRANTS AND FORFEITURES, OFFSET BY SHARE REPURCHASES.

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET REVENUE INCREASED BY $13.1 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE OF $159.4 MILLION IN NET REVENUE FROM OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $134.9 MILLION IN NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III  , WHICH RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2016.  NET REVENUE FROM OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  FRANCHISE INCREASED $32.0 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE OF $114.9 MILLION IN NET REVENUE FROM  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $78.0 MILLION FROM  GRAND THEFT AUTO V.  NET REVENUE FROM CONSOLE GAMES INCREASED BY $22.6 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 81.6% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 81.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM CONSOLE GAMES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III,  WHICH RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2016. NET REVENUE FROM PC AND OTHER DECREASED BY $9.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE TO 18.4% COMPARED TO 19.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PC AND OTHER WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  CIVILIZATION VI  , WHICH RELEASED ON THE PC IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM SOCIAL POINT TITLES FOR WHICH WE HAD ONLY TWO MONTHS OF NET REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS IT WAS ACQUIRED IN JANUARY 2017.  NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS INCREASED BY $209.2 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 63.1% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 51.8% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER REVENUE RELATED TO OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  CIVILIZATION VI  AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO V  . NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL AND OTHER CHANNELS DECREASED BY $196.1 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 36.9% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 48.2% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL AND OTHER CHANNELS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III, GRAND THEFT AUTO V,  AND  BIOSHOCK: THE COLLECTION  , WHICH RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER 2016, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM  L.A. NOIRE  DUE TO RELEASES ON PS4, XBOX ONE, SWITCH, AND HTC VIVE.  NET REVENUE FROM RECURRENT CONSUMER SPENDING ON OUR TITLES THROUGH VIRTUAL CURRENCY, ADD-ON CONTENT, AND MICROTRANSACTIONS INCREASED BY $287.9 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 41.6% OF NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 25.8% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN RECURRENT CONSUMER SPENDING WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VIRTUAL CURRENCY NET REVENUE FROM  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE,  OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, AND SOCIAL POINT TITLES WITH ONLY TWO MONTHS OF NET REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS IT WAS ACQUIRED IN JANUARY 2017.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS 49.9%, AS COMPARED TO 42.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO  MAFIA III  AND  CIVILIZATION VI  RELEASING IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS LOWER PRODUCT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL SALES. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERNAL ROYALTIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF WHEN ROYALTIES ARE EARNED AND TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES DECREASED BY $40.0 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 41.3% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 43.9%. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE. CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT BY $9.8 MILLION AND $6.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  35  OPERATING EXPENSES  (THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS)  2018% OF NET REVENUE  2017% OF NET REVENUE  INCREASE/(DECREASE)% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  SELLING AND MARKETING  $256,092  14.3%  $285,453  16.0%  $(29,361  )  (10.3  )%  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  247,828  13.8%  211,409  11.9%  36,419  17.2%  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  196,373  11.0%  137,915  7.8%  58,458  42.4%  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  43,969  2.5%  30,707  1.7%  13,262  43.2%  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  14,742  0.8%  \u2014  \u2014%  14,742  100.0%  TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES  $759,004  42.3%  $665,484  37.4%  $93,520  14.1%  INCLUDES STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHICH WAS ALLOCATED AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  2018  2017  SELLING AND MARKETING  $13,258  $9,963  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  $58,037  $42,908  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $18,020  $7,952  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  $2,424  $\u2014  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES INCREASED TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES BY $8.4 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  SELLING AND MARKETING  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES DECREASED BY $29.4 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO $44.2 MILLION IN LOWER ADVERTISING EXPENSES. ADVERTISING EXPENSES WERE LOWER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RELEASES OF  MAFIA III  AND  CIVILIZATION VI  IN OCTOBER 2016 AND  BATTLEBORN  IN MAY 2016, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD FOR  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE  AND  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $36.4 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) INCREASES IN PERSONNEL EXPENSES, INCLUDING STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DUE TO ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, (II) INCREASES IN PROFESSIONAL FEES, RELATED PRIMARILY TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ZELNICKMEDIA AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN OUR SHARE PRICE, (III) INCREASES IN IT RELATED EXPENSES FROM THE PURCHASE OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND (IV) INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE DUE TO NEW LOCATIONS, INCLUDING OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK AND FOR SOCIAL POINT, AS WELL AS INCREASED RENT IN OTHER LOCATIONS. THIS OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY A $6.5 MILLION REDUCTION OF EXPENSE RELATED TO REVERSING A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIAL POINT ACQUISITION AS WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WAS $0 BASED ON THE LOWER PROBABILITY OF SOCIAL POINT ACHIEVING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE 24-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 INCLUDE OCCUPANCY EXPENSE (PRIMARILY RENT, UTILITIES AND OFFICE EXPENSES) OF $18.2 MILLION AND $15.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR DEVELOPMENT STUDIOS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $58.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED PERSONNEL EXPENSE DUE TO (I) INCREASED HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, AND (II) HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION EXPENSES FOR TITLES THAT HAVE NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES INCREASED BY $13.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RECOGNITION OF A $11.3 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A CERTAIN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IPR&D\") INTANGIBLE ASSET FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT.  36  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED AND INITIATED ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A STRATEGIC REORGANIZATION AT ONE OF OUR LABELS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INITIATIVE WE INCURRED BUSINESS REORGANIZATION EXPENSES OF $14.7 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, DUE PRIMARILY TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS WITH NO CORRESPONDING COSTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ALTHOUGH WE MAY RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN FUTURE PERIODS TO TRUE-UP ESTIMATES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL REORGANIZATION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS REORGANIZATION.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A $20.7 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR 1.75% CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN DECEMBER 2016 AND HIGHER GAINS ON EARLY CONVERSIONS OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES AS WELL AS HIGHER INTEREST INCOME DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND THE RISE OF INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION LOSSES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  PROVISION/BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MAKES BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT US. THE ACT REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE ACT MAKES OTHER CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT US, BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2018. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO (1) A BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT), WHICH IS A NEW MINIMUM TAX, (2) GENERALLY ELIMINATING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, (3) A NEW PROVISION THAT TAXES GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI), (4) THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION, AND (5) OTHER BASE BROADENING PROVISIONS.  THE FASB STAFF Q&A, TOPIC 740, NO. 5,  ACCOUNTING FOR GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME  , STATES THAT AN ENTITY CAN MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAXES FOR TEMPORARY BASIS DIFFERENCES EXPECTED TO REVERSE AS GILTI IN FUTURE YEARS OR PROVIDE FOR THE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO GILTI IN THE YEAR THE TAX IS INCURRED. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GILTI PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND HAS NOT YET DETERMINED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY. AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND ANALYSIS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME THAT IS SUBJECT TO GILTI AND THEREFORE IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE AND HAS NOT REFLECTED ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO GILTI IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATED INCREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $18.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. THE ESTIMATED INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF A TRANSITION TAX OF $26.6 MILLION, OFFSET BY INCREASED BENEFITS FROM DOMESTIC PRODUCTION DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, WE RECORDED A DECREASE TO NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $47.7 MILLION AND A CORRESPONDING DECREASE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $39.8 MILLION AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FROM INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES AS A SOURCE OF INCOME AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, RESULTING IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $7.9 MILLION. THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY RELATING TO INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES, DUE TO THE RATE CHANGE, RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $6.2 MILLION.  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE ACT, AND THE AMOUNTS RECORDED REPRESENT PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES FOR CERTAIN IDENTIFIED INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR WHICH THE ACCOUNTING IS INCOMPLETE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CAN BE DETERMINED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (SAB 118). FURTHER ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW HISTORICAL PRACTICES USED TO CALCULATE THE UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL TIME TO EVALUATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE NEW TAX LAW ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATIVE GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED. THE IMPACT OF THE ACT MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, DUE TO CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE, GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED, AND ACTIONS WE MAY  37  TAKE AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE ACT AND ITS IMPACT AND EXPECT TO RECORD ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES NO LATER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS $36.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $9.7 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF 31.6%, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF (27.0)% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $53.2 MILLION FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES (PREVIOUSLY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT AND TAX DEFICIENCIES WERE RECOGNIZED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL), A BENEFIT OF $22.6 MILLION FOR TAX CREDITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UTILIZED, A BENEFIT OF $15.1 MILLION FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND A BENEFIT OF $7.9 MILLION FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT AND $10.4 MILLION FOR CHANGES IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO $53.2 MILLION FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AN INCREASED BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $17.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND $11.0 MILLION OF INCREASED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM TAX CREDITS OF $12.7 MILLION AND PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, TAX CREDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, AND CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT MAY ARISE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEDUCTIONS TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN, WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE AWARD VESTING. SINCE WE RECOGNIZE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON A DISCRETE BASIS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN EACH PERIOD.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, WE HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF $128.5 MILLION, OF WHICH $22.8 MILLION WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF REALIZED. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS INCREASED BY $8.3 MILLION.  WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO AUDIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2013. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2012. CERTAIN U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2016.  WE ARE REGULARLY AUDITED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR REASONABLY FORESEEABLE TAX ASSESSMENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OUR NET INCOME WAS $173.5 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $67.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $1.54, AS COMPARED TO $0.72 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017. BASIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING OF 110.1 MILLION WERE 19.9 MILLION HIGHER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SETTLEMENT ON CONVERSION OF OUR 1.75% CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK USING THE STATED CONVERSION RATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. SEE NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTE 13 - EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN TO FUND (I) THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF OUR PUBLISHED PRODUCTS, (II) WORKING CAPITAL, (III) ACQUISITIONS AND (IV) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE EXPECT TO RELY ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS WELL AS ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FUNDS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND OUR NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT TO SATISFY OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $744.5 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY-LIQUID IN NATURE AND REPRESENT AN INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  38  NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cNEW CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT REPLACED OUR EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS TERMINATED ON THE SAME DAY. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT RUNS THROUGH  FEBRUARY 8, 2024  . THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR AN UNSECURED FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH COMMITMENTS OF  $200,000  , INCLUDING SUBLIMITS FOR (I) THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT IN AN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF UP TO  $25,000  AND (II) BORROWINGS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT DENOMINATED IN POUNDS STERLING, EUROS AND CANADIAN DOLLARS IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $25,000. IN ADDITION, THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL CAPACITY PERMITTING THE INCURRENCE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $250,000  IN TERM LOANS OR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. LOANS UNDER THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A MARGIN OF (A)  0.125%  TO  0.750%  ABOVE A CERTAIN BASE RATE (  5.50%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ), OR (B)  1.125%  TO  1.750%  ABOVE LIBOR (APPROXIMATELY  2.49%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ), WHICH MARGINS ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS  $198.3 MILLION  AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WE HAD  $1.7 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO, MINIMUM CASH RESERVES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANTS, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ABILITY TO: CREATE, INCUR, ASSUME OR BE LIABLE FOR INDEBTEDNESS; DISPOSE OF ASSETS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE; ACQUIRE, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR INTO ANOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY; CREATE, INCUR OR ALLOW ANY LIEN ON ANY OF ITS PROPERTY; MAKE INVESTMENTS; OR PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT SUCH AS NONPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE THEREUNDER, BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS, ACTS OF INSOLVENCY AND DEFAULT ON INDEBTEDNESS HELD BY THIRD PARTIES (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND CURE PERIODS).  1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018  ON JUNE 18, 2013, WE ISSUED  $250.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  1.00%  CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT  98.5%  OF PAR VALUE FOR PROCEEDS OF  $283.2 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDED A  $37.5 MILLION  OVERALLOTMENT OPTION THAT WAS EXERCISED. INTEREST ON THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WAS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON JULY 1  ST  AND JANUARY 1  ST  OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2014. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES MATURED ON JULY 1, 2018.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISKS, PARTICULARLY IF ANY OF OUR RECEIVABLES REPRESENT A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS OR ARE CONCENTRATED IN FOREIGN MARKETS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS THEY BECOME DUE, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND WORKING CAPITAL POSITION.  GENERALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE DO NOT HOLD ANY COLLATERAL TO SECURE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE TRADE CREDIT INSURANCE ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MITIGATE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RISK.  A MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO MAJOR RETAILERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  70.1%  ,  70.7%  , AND  65.5%  OF NET REVENUE DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , FIVE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  66.6%  AND  65.4%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, RESPECTIVELY. CUSTOMERS THAT INDIVIDUALLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE COMPRISED  55.8%  AND  53.2%  OF SUCH BALANCES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  40.1%  AND  15.7%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  37.7%  , AND  15.5%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  . BASED UPON PERFORMING ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS, MAINTAINING TRADE CREDIT INSURANCE ON A MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK, ALTHOUGH WE ACTIVELY MONITOR EACH CUSTOMER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE ARE MONITORING THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER FACTORS AS IT RELATES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE RISK OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO SATISFY OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND COMMITMENTS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WAS  $292.7 MILLION  . THESE BALANCES ARE DISPERSED ACROSS VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH DISPERSION MEETS  39  THE BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH DOMESTICALLY TO SUPPORT ONGOING OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE \"TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT\u201d (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT US. THE ACT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL PROVISIONS, WHICH GENERALLY ESTABLISH A TERRITORIAL-STYLE SYSTEM FOR TAXING FOREIGN INCOME OF DOMESTIC MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. OUR CURRENT INTENTION IS TO REINVEST INDEFINITELY EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO  14.2 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS. REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF STOCK, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE TRADING PRICE OF THE STOCK, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OTHER CONDITIONS. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , WE REPURCHASED  3.7 MILLION  ,  1.5 MILLION  , AND  0.0 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR  $362.4 MILLION  ,  $154.8 MILLION  , AND  $0.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AS PART OF THE PROGRAM. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF  10.4 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM, AND  3.8 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OUR CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,  (THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS)  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $843,515  $493,527  $407,903  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (223,576  )  (271,827  )  (129,030  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (463,685  )  (281,467  )  (49,772  )  EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (10,639  )  24,924  (7,798  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $145,615  $(34,843  )  $221,303  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  1,392.0 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH, COMPARED TO  1,246.4 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH FROM  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM SALES, PRIMARILY OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSES AS WELL AS ROYALTY PAYMENTS.

WE HAVE APPROPRIATELY ACCRUED AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN OF THESE CLAIMS AND LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH LOSSES, UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED, WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.  ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, ALL OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, AND COUNTERCLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN PENDING SINCE APRIL 2016 WITH MR. LESLIE BENZIES, THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WERE RESOLVED.

AS SUCH, WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS.  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IS PRINCIPALLY GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA. FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  ,  46.5%  ,  41.3%  AND  43.9%  , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR NET REVENUE WAS EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS AND SEASONALITY  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TITLES; VARIATIONS IN SALES OF TITLES DEVELOPED FOR PARTICULAR PLATFORMS; MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TITLES; DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TITLES; SEQUELS OR ENHANCEMENTS OF EXISTING TITLES; PROJECTED AND ACTUAL CHANGES IN PLATFORMS; THE TIMING AND SUCCESS OF TITLE INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS; PRODUCT RETURNS; CHANGES IN PRICING POLICIES BY US AND OUR COMPETITORS; THE ACCURACY OF RETAILERS' FORECASTS OF CONSUMER DEMAND; THE SIZE AND TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS; THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM MAJOR CUSTOMERS; AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SEASONAL, WITH PEAK SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY OCCURRING IN THE FOURTH CALENDAR QUARTER AS A RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FOR CERTAIN OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, WE DEFER THE RECOGNITION OF OUR NET REVENUE OVER AN ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM 9 TO 15 MONTHS. AS A RESULT, THE QUARTER IN WHICH WE GENERATE THE HIGHEST NET SALES VOLUME MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE QUARTER IN WHICH WE RECOGNIZE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF NET REVENUE.

REVENUES INCREASED IN 2019 AND 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET GROWTH, INCLUDING EXPANDED BUSINESS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSS OF CUSTOMERS WITHIN OUR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL AND SPECIALTY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR 2018 WAS ALSO OFFSET BY THE 2017 CONTRIBUTION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR MCKESSON TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES (\u201cCORE MTS BUSINESS\u201d) TO FORM THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE. MARKET GROWTH INCLUDES GROWING DRUG UTILIZATION, PRICE INCREASES AND NEWLY LAUNCHED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE DEFLATION ASSOCIATED WITH BRAND TO GENERIC DRUG CONVERSION.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN INCREASED IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018. GROSS PROFIT INCREASED DUE TO MARKET GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSS OF CUSTOMERS.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2019 WAS ALSO DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF NET CASH PROCEEDS REPRESENTING OUR SHARE OF ANTITRUST LEGAL SETTLEMENTS OF $202 MILLION, HIGHER LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cLIFO\u201d) CREDITS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  THESE INCREASES IN 2019 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREMENTAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), GOVERNMENT IMPOSED GENERIC PRICE CUTS IN CANADA AND THE 2018 THIRD QUARTER SALE OF OUR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS (\u201cEIS\u201d) BUSINESS.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2017 CONTRIBUTION OF THE CORE MTS BUSINESS TO THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE, SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN THE U.K., THE COMPETITIVE SELL-SIDE ENVIRONMENT AND WEAKER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER PRICING TRENDS.  THESE DECREASES IN 2018 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET GROWTH, PROCUREMENT BENEFITS REALIZED THROUGH THE JOINT SOURCING ENTITY, CLARUSONE SOURCING SERVICES LLP (\u201cCLARUSONE\u201d), HIGHER LIFO CREDITS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  GROSS PROFIT FOR 2019, 2018 AND 2017 INCLUDED LIFO CREDITS OF  $210 MILLION  , $99 MILLION AND $7 MILLION. GROSS PROFIT FOR 2017 BENEFITED FROM $144 MILLION OF CASH RECEIPTS REPRESENTING OUR SHARE OF ANTITRUST LEGAL SETTLEMENTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OPERATING EXPENSES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED IN 2019 AND 2018.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WERE AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  2019  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $1,776 MILLION  (  $1,756 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) IN OUR CONSUMER SOLUTIONS (\u201cCS\u201d) AND PHARMACY SOLUTIONS (\u201cPS\u201d) REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. OF THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES,  $238 MILLION  WAS RECOGNIZED UPON THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT CHANGES, WHICH RESULTED IN TWO NEW REPORTING UNITS.  THE REMAINING CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE SELECTION OF HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE DECLINES IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WITHIN THE U.K. THE RISK OF SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES WAS THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE USE OF A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, BOTH CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS HAD NO REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCES;  \u2022  PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $331 MILLION  (  $273 MILLION  AFTER-TAX), PRIMARILY REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND EXIT-RELATED COSTS RELATED TO THE 2019 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW;  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $245 MILLION ($207 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY FOR OUR U.K. BUSINESS (MAINLY PHARMACY LICENSES) DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THE U.K.;  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  \u2022  HIGHER OPIOID-RELATED COSTS OF $151 MILLION ($122 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY RELATED TO LITIGATION EXPENSES. THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT IN MANY CASES ALLEGING CLAIMS RELATED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES TO PHARMACIES, OFTEN TOGETHER WITH OTHER PHARMACEUTICAL WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS AND PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS AND RETAIL PHARMACY CHAINS NAMED AS DEFENDANTS.  IN ADDITION, THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS RECENTLY ADOPTED A TAX ON SALES OF OPIOIDS IN THE STATE, AND OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING LEGISLATION THAT COULD REQUIRE US TO PAY TAXES, LICENSING FEES, OR ASSESSMENTS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF OPIOID MEDICATIONS IN THOSE STATES. LIABILITIES FOR TAXES OR ASSESSMENTS UNDER ANY SUCH LAWS WILL LIKELY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE THEM THROUGH OPERATIONAL CHANGES OR COMMERCIAL ARRANGEMENTS WHERE PERMITTED.

THERE WERE NO TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR EUROPE WERE TRIGGERED PRIMARILY BY GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS IN THE U.K. AND A MORE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN FRANCE. THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR REXALL HEALTH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GENERICS REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS ACROSS CANADA AND MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES IN MULTIPLE PROVINCES.  AT MARCH 31, 2018, THE REXALL HEALTH REPORTING UNIT HAD NO REMAINING GOODWILL RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF REXALL HEALTH;  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $446 MILLION  (  $410 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN OUR EUROPEAN BUSINESS INCLUDING THOSE DECLINES IN OUR U.K. RETAIL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS;  \u2022  PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $74 MILLION ($67 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND LEASE EXIT COSTS RELATED TO THE 2018 RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR OUR MCKESSON EUROPE BUSINESS.

THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.  AS A RESULT OF THE 2019 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCLUDING THE CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  HOWEVER, OTHER RISKS, EXPENSES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, INCREASED REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY MARKET ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AS OF THE TESTING DATE MAY REQUIRE US TO FURTHER REVISE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MCKESSON CANADA REPORTING UNIT IN OTHER IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REPORTED INCOME TAX RATES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE IMPACT OF NONDEDUCTIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND VARYING PROPORTIONS OF INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE INCOME TAX RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE U.S. RATE.  OUR REPORTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATE FOR 2019 WAS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY NON-CASH PRE-TAX CHARGES OF  $1,776 MILLION  (  $1,756 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) TO IMPAIR THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL FOR OUR EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, GIVEN THAT THESE CHARGES ARE GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE 2018 INCOME TAX BENEFIT RATE INCLUDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $1,324 MILLION FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN DEFERRED TAXES TO THE LOWER U.S. FEDERAL TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A TAX EXPENSE OF $457 MILLION REPRESENTING THE ONE-TIME TAX IMPOSED ON CERTAIN ACCUMULATED EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE REPORTED INCOME TAX BENEFIT AND EXPENSE RATES FOR 2018 AND 2017 WERE ALSO UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $1,738 MILLION  (PRE-TAX AND AFTER-TAX) AND  $290 MILLION  (  $282 MILLION  AFTER-TAX), GIVEN THAT THESE CHARGES ARE GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  WE MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND ADOPT STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS WORLDWIDE IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INCLUDING EURO, BRITISH POUND STERLING AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  IN DISCUSSING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, WE MAY USE THE TERM \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT\u201d, WHICH REFERS TO THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED TO CONVERT THE LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR.  WE PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR BUSINESS PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  IN COMPUTING FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT, WE TRANSLATE OUR CURRENT YEAR RESULTS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S DOLLARS BY APPLYING AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OF THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, AND WE SUBSEQUENTLY COMPARE THOSE RESULTS TO THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS IN U.S. DOLLARS.

WE PROVIDE SHORT-TERM CREDIT AND OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING PRIMARILY RELATES TO GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OR THEIR CREDITORS, REGARDING THE REPURCHASE OF INVENTORIES.  WE ALSO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF PHARMACIES, WHICH SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANS.  WE ESTIMATE THE RECEIVABLES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT EXPECT FULL COLLECTION BASED ON HISTORICAL COLLECTION RATES AND SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE CURRENT CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND RECORD AN ALLOWANCE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THESE AMOUNTS.  IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH INCLUDES GENERAL AND SPECIFIC RESERVES, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AGING, INDUSTRY TRENDS, CUSTOMER FINANCIAL STRENGTH, CREDIT STANDING, HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF TRENDS AND PAYMENT HISTORY TO ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF COLLECTION.  IF THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CUSTOMER DEFAULTS DUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION OR GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGE, OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT.  AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING AND ADJUST ALLOWANCES FOR ACCOUNTS WHERE COLLECTION MAY BE IN DOUBT.  DURING  2019  , SALES TO OUR  TEN  LARGEST CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cGPOS\u201d) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  49.9%  OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.  SALES TO OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER, CVS HEALTH (\u201cCVS\u201d), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  19.4%  OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.  AT MARCH 31,  2019  , TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM OUR  TEN  LARGEST CUSTOMERS WERE APPROXIMATELY  31.9%  OF TOTAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM  CVS  WERE APPROXIMATELY  18.4%  OF TOTAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  AS A RESULT, OUR SALES AND CREDIT CONCENTRATION IS SIGNIFICANT.  WE ALSO HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH GPOS, EACH OF WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A PURCHASING AGENT ON BEHALF OF MEMBER HOSPITALS, PHARMACIES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AS WELL AS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND AGENCIES.  THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES BALANCES ARE WITH INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE GPOS, AND THEREFORE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK EXISTS.  A MATERIAL DEFAULT IN PAYMENT, A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN PURCHASES FROM THESE OR ANY OTHER LARGE CUSTOMERS, OR THE LOSS OF A LARGE CUSTOMER OR GPO COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY.  RESERVE METHODOLOGIES ARE ASSESSED ANNUALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSSES AND ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND MARKET TRENDS.  IN ADDITION, RESERVES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY AND UPDATED IF UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TRENDS ARE PRESENT.  WE BELIEVE THE RESERVES MAINTAINED AND EXPENSES RECORDED IN  2019  ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY INTERNAL PROCESS OR CUSTOMER ISSUES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  AT MARCH 31,  2019  , TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WERE $15,329 MILLION PRIOR TO ALLOWANCES OF $273 MILLION.  IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , OUR PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS WAS  $132 MILLION  ,  $44 MILLION  AND  $93 MILLION  .  AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  , THE ALLOWANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WAS 1.8% AND 1.3%.  AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF A HYPOTHETICAL 0.1% IN THE  2019  ALLOWANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION.  THE SELECTED 0.1% HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED THE BEST OR WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MAY BE FOUND IN SCHEDULE II INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  INVENTORIES.  INVENTORIES CONSIST OF MERCHANDISE HELD FOR RESALE.  PRIOR TO 2018, WE REPORTED INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET (\u201cLCM\u201d). EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPORT INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES DETERMINED USING THE LIFO METHOD.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF DOMESTIC INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING THE LIFO METHOD.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF INVENTORIES HELD IN FOREIGN LOCATIONS IS BASED ON FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE PURCHASE PRICES.  REBATES, CASH DISCOUNTS AND OTHER INCENTIVES RECEIVED FROM VENDORS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE OR DISTRIBUTION OF INVENTORY ARE CONSIDERED AS PRODUCT DISCOUNTS AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF INVENTORY AND ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE INVENTORY IS SOLD.  TOTAL INVENTORIES, NET WERE  $16,709 MILLION  AND  $16,310 MILLION  AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018.  THE LIFO METHOD WAS USED TO VALUE APPROXIMATELY  62%  AND  63%  OF OUR INVENTORIES AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  IF WE HAD USED THE MOVING AVERAGE METHOD OF INVENTORY VALUATION, INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY  $696 MILLION  AND  $906 MILLION  HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  THESE AMOUNTS ARE EQUIVALENT TO OUR LIFO RESERVES.  OUR LIFO VALUATION AMOUNT INCLUDES BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  WE RECOGNIZED LIFO CREDITS OF  $210 MILLION  ,  $99 MILLION  AND  $7 MILLION  IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  A LIFO CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE NET EFFECT OF PRICE INCREASES ON PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HELD IN INVENTORY EXCEEDS THE IMPACT OF PRICE DECLINES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.  A LIFO CREDIT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE NET EFFECT OF PRICE DECLINES EXCEEDS THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ON PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HELD IN INVENTORY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING AVERAGE INVENTORY COSTING METHOD PROVIDES A REASONABLE ESTIMATION OF THE CURRENT COST OF REPLACING INVENTORY (I.E., \u201cMARKET\u201d).  AS SUCH, OUR LIFO INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF LIFO OR MARKET.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, INVENTORIES AT LIFO DID NOT EXCEED MARKET.  IN DETERMINING WHETHER INVENTORY VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS REQUIRED, WE CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY BY REVIEWING ON-HAND QUANTITIES, OUTSTANDING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND FORECASTED SALES.  SHIFTS IN MARKET TRENDS AND CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERIC DRUGS OR NEW PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS OR THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS ARE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORIES.  WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED EXCESS AND OBSOLETE AS A RESULT OF THESE REVIEWS.  THESE FACTORS COULD MAKE OUR ESTIMATES OF INVENTORY VALUATION DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ONCE CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED, 100% OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES.  ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES AND RELATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  SEVERAL VALUATION METHODS MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED.  FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE TYPICALLY USE A METHOD BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH.  METHODS UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH START WITH A FORECAST OF ALL OF THE EXPECTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ASSET.  THESE CASH FLOWS ARE THEN ADJUSTED TO PRESENT VALUE BY APPLYING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT REFLECTS THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASH FLOW STREAMS.  SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN METHODS BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE DISCOUNT RATE SELECTED TO MEASURE THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE ASSET\u2019S LIFE CYCLE AND THE COMPETITIVE TRENDS IMPACTING THE ASSET, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF ANY TECHNICAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO ENTRY.  DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ALSO REQUIRES JUDGMENT AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL HAVE DIFFERENT USEFUL LIVES.  REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 4, \u201cBUSINESS COMBINATIONS,\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ACQUISITIONS.  GOODWILL AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  AS A RESULT OF ACQUIRING BUSINESSES, WE HAVE  $9,358 MILLION  AND  $10,924 MILLION  OF GOODWILL AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  ,  $3,689 MILLION  AND  $4,102 MILLION  OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL BALANCES ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  INDICATORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE ASSETS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND/OR MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS CONDUCTED AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WHICH IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR A COMPONENT, ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND SEGMENT MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THAT REPORTING UNIT.  IN 2018, WE ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS, THE AMENDED GUIDANCE THAT SIMPLIFIES GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING BY ELIMINATING THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST. THE ONE-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST UNDER THE AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE, IF ANY.  TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH.  UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE BY COMPARING THE BUSINESS TO SIMILAR BUSINESSES, OR GUIDELINE COMPANIES WHOSE SECURITIES ARE ACTIVELY TRADED IN PUBLIC MARKETS.  UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE USE A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (\u201cDCF\u201d) MODEL IN WHICH CASH FLOWS ANTICIPATED OVER SEVERAL PERIODS, PLUS A TERMINAL VALUE AT THE END OF THAT TIME HORIZON, ARE DISCOUNTED TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING AN APPROPRIATE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN.  IN ADDITION, WE COMPARE THE AGGREGATE OF THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 FAIR VALUES TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS FURTHER CORROBORATION OF THE FAIR VALUES.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE RESULT FROM A COMPLEX SERIES OF JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AT A POINT IN TIME. JUDGMENTS MADE IN DETERMINING AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW DATE AND ARE BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT. ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING FAILURE TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS, NEGATIVE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT RATES, DETERIORATION IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES OR AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY OR OTHER UNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY DECREASE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OR INCREASE THE DISCOUNT RATES AND COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ESTIMATION PROCESS USING THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDE THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE GUIDELINE COMPANIES, THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE MULTIPLES FOR BOTH THE GUIDELINE COMPANIES AND THE REPORTING UNIT, THE DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS BASED ON ANY DIFFERENCES IN MARKETABILITY BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THE GUIDELINE COMPANIES AND FOR THE INCOME APPROACH, THE REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN USED IN THE DCF METHOD, WHICH REFLECTS CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS.  UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REPORTING UNITS.  THE DISCOUNT RATES ARE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL MEASURING THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S COST OF DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING WEIGHTED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF DEBT AND PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY IN A COMPANY\u2019S TARGET CAPITAL. THE UNSYSTEMATIC RISK PREMIUM IS AN INPUT FACTOR USED IN CALCULATING DISCOUNT RATE THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 FUTURE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. INCREASES IN THE UNSYSTEMATIC RISK PREMIUM INCREASE THE DISCOUNT RATE.  AS A RESULT OF THE 2019 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCLUDING THE CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  HOWEVER, OTHER RISKS, EXPENSES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, INCREASED REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY MARKET ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AS OF THE TESTING DATE MAY REQUIRE US TO FURTHER REVISE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR MCKESSON CANADA REPORTING UNIT WITHIN OTHER EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS REPORTING UNIT BY 8% IN 2019.  THE GOODWILL BALANCE OF THIS REPORTING UNIT WAS $1,444 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 OR APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CONSOLIDATED GOODWILL BALANCE. GENERALLY, A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF 12% OR AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE IN EXCESS OF 1.0% COULD RESULT IN AN INDICATION OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR THIS REPORTING UNIT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS. REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 2, \u201cGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  CURRENTLY, ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OR DEPRECIATED BASED ON THE PATTERN OF THEIR ECONOMIC CONSUMPTION OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, RANGING FROM ONE TO 38 YEARS.  WE REVIEW INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AT AN ASSET GROUP LEVEL WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION.  MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.  ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE.  THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS.  OUR ONGOING CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE FACTORS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY COULD RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME. REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 3, \u201cRESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  WE HAVE CERTAIN RESTRUCTURING RESERVES WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS TO BE INCURRED WHEN THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TAKE PLACE. WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS WHEN PAYMENTS ARE PROBABLE AND AMOUNTS ARE ESTIMABLE. COSTS RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITHOUT FUTURE BENEFIT OR CONTRACT TERMINATION ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE EARLIER OF THE CONTRACT TERMINATION OR THE CEASE-USE DATES. OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE ALSO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS USED IN THE BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY RECOGNIZE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION REFLECTING SHORTENED USEFUL LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  SUPPLIER RESERVES.  WE ESTABLISH RESERVES AGAINST AMOUNTS DUE FROM SUPPLIERS RELATING TO VARIOUS PRICE AND REBATE INCENTIVES, INCLUDING DEDUCTIONS OR BILLINGS TAKEN AGAINST PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO THEM.  THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON JUDGMENT AFTER CONSIDERING THE STATUS OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING CLAIMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUPPLIERS, THE SPECIFIC INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND ANY OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE.  WE EVALUATE THE AMOUNTS DUE FROM SUPPLIERS ON A CONTINUAL BASIS AND ADJUST THE RESERVE ESTIMATES WHEN APPROPRIATE BASED ON CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE FINAL OUTCOME OF ANY OUTSTANDING CLAIMS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE.  THE SUPPLIER RESERVES PRIMARILY PERTAIN TO OUR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL AND SPECIALTY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT.  INCOME TAXES.  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX PROVISION AND IN EVALUATING INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.  WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE INCLUDING OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF CUMULATIVE NET OPERATING LOSSES IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  IN ESTIMATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WE DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME, THE REVERSAL OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEASIBLE AND PRUDENT TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ABOUT THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES WE USE TO MANAGE THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES.  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD ALSO AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  SHOULD TAX LAWS CHANGE, INCLUDING THOSE LAWS PERTAINING TO LIFO, OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.  IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INCLUDES ESTIMATES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX NEW TAX REGULATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE GLOBAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE NEW TAX LEGISLATION REFERRED TO AS THE 2017 TAX ACT. THE 2017 TAX ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE.  REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 10, \u201cINCOME TAXES,\u201d TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR TAX AND RELATED INTEREST FOR ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND RELATED INTEREST WILL BE DUE.  IF OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF TAX AND INTEREST LIABILITIES IS LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT, AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY RESULT.  IF OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF TAX AND INTEREST LIABILITIES IS MORE THAN THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT, A REDUCTION TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY BE RECOGNIZED.  LOSS CONTINGENCIES.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS WITH CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS, PENDING AND POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES, INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.  WHEN A LOSS IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE ULTIMATE LOSS.  HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CONTINGENCY IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR A RANGE OF LOSS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FUTURE EVENTS AND DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONTINGENCY.  MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED OVER MANY YEARS, DURING WHICH TIME RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION MUST BE REEVALUATED AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS.  WHEN A MATERIAL LOSS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, DISCLOSURE OF THE PROCEEDING IS PROVIDED.  WE REVIEW ALL CONTINGENCIES AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS HAS CHANGED AND TO ASSESS WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF THE LOSS CAN BE MADE.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEVELOPMENT OF A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF LOSS OR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS IS COMPLEX WHEN THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH OR DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE COURT SYSTEM AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT OUR AVAILABLE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE MAY ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME TO TIME.  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $4,036 MILLION  IN  2019  COMPARED TO  $4,345 MILLION  IN  2018  AND $4,744 MILLION  IN  2017  . OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN RECEIVABLES DUE TO OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME AND TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2018 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE REFLECTING LONGER PAYMENT TERMS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE REFLECTING LONGER PAYMENT TERMS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES AND INCREASES IN RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REVENUE GROWTH. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. ADDITIONALLY, WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF SALES AND PURCHASE VOLUMES, INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS AND VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDED CASH GENERATED FROM OUR CORE MTS BUSINESS. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 WERE ALSO AFFECTED BY  $150 MILLION  OF A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1,381 MILLION  IN  2019  COMPARED TO  $2,993 MILLION  IN  2018  AND  $3,269 MILLION  IN  2017  .  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 INCLUDE  $905 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING  $784 MILLION  FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF MSD,  $426 MILLION  AND  $131 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, AND  $101 MILLION  OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2018 INCLUDE  $2,893 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING  $1.3 BILLION  AND  $720 MILLION  FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS OF COVERMYMEDS, LLC AND RXCROSSROADS,  $405 MILLION  AND  $175 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE,  $374 MILLION  OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS AND  $126 MILLION  CASH PAYMENT RECEIVED RELATED TO THE HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY NET ASSET EXCHANGE.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDED  $4,212 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING  $2.1 BILLION  FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF REXALL HEALTH,  $1,226 MILLION  OF NET PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON THE HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY NET ASSET EXCHANGE,  $404 MILLION  AND  $158 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, AND  $206 MILLION  OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES UTILIZED  $2,227 MILLION  ,  $3,084 MILLION  AND  $2,069 MILLION  OF CASH IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  .  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 INCLUDE CASH RECEIPTS OF  $37,265 MILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF  $37,268 MILLION  FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER).  WE RECEIVED CASH FROM LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES OF  $1,099 MILLION  AND MADE REPAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $1,112 MILLION  IN 2019. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2019 ALSO INCLUDE  $1,627 MILLION  OF CASH PAID FOR STOCK REPURCHASES AND  $292 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2018 INCLUDE CASH RECEIPTS OF  $20,542 MILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF  $20,725 MILLION  FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER). WE RECEIVED CASH FROM LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES OF  $1,522 MILLION  AND MADE REPAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $2,287 MILLION  IN 2018. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2018 ALSO INCLUDE  $1,650 MILLION  OF CASH PAID FOR STOCK REPURCHASES  $262 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID AND  $112 MILLION  OF PAYMENTS FOR DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDE CASH RECEIPTS OF  $8,294 MILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF  $8,124 MILLION  FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE RECEIVED CASH FROM LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES OF  $1,824 MILLION  AND MADE REPAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $1,601 MILLION  IN 2017. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2017 ALSO INCLUDE  $2,250 MILLION  OF CASH PAID FOR STOCK REPURCHASES AND  $253 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF MCKESSON\u2019S COMMON STOCK FROM TIME-TO-TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (\u201cASR\u201d) PROGRAMS, OR BY ANY COMBINATION OF SUCH METHODS.  THE TIMING OF ANY REPURCHASES AND THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS UNDER OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  IN 2017, WE REPURCHASED  14.1 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND  1.4 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH AN ASR PROGRAM.  WE RECEIVED  0.3 MILLION  ADDITIONAL SHARES IN APRIL 2017 FOR THE 2017 ASR PROGRAM.  IN 2018, WE REPURCHASED  3.5 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND 6.7 MILLION OF OUR SHARES THROUGH ASR PROGRAMS. WE RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL  1.0 MILLION  SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 UNDER THE MARCH 2018 ASR PROGRAM. IN 2019, WE REPURCHASED  10.4 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND  2.1 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH THE DECEMBER 2018 ASR PROGRAM.  IN 2019, WE RETIRED  5.0 MILLION  OR  $542 MILLION  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TREASURY SHARES PREVIOUSLY REPURCHASED. UNDER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THESE SHARES RESUME THE STATUS OF AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES UPON RETIREMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY, WE ALLOCATE ANY EXCESS OF SHARE REPURCHASE PRICE OVER PAR VALUE BETWEEN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AND RETAINED EARNINGS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RETAINED EARNINGS AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL WERE REDUCED BY  $472 MILLION  AND  $70 MILLION  DURING 2019.

THE TOTAL AUTHORIZATION OUTSTANDING FOR REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK WAS  $3.5 BILLION  AT MARCH 31, 2019.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CURRENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCING NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CONTINUED OR INCREASED VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WILL NOT IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY OR INCREASE OUR COSTS OF BORROWING.

CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.  CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN AAA RATED PRIME AND U.S. GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUNDS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND/OR SECURITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AN AAA RATED PRIME MONEY MARKET FUND DENOMINATED IN BRITISH POUND STERLING.  THE REMAINING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE DEPOSITED WITH SEVERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE MITIGATE THE RISK OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MONITORING RISK PROFILES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1,450 MILLION OF CASH HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. OUR PRIMARY INTENT IS TO UTILIZE THIS CASH FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION, DOING SO COULD SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES AND STATE INCOME TAXES.  FOLLOWING ENACTMENT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE REPATRIATION OF CASH TO THE UNITED STATES IS GENERALLY NO LONGER TAXABLE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY INCLUDES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES NET OF DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LARGE VARIATIONS DURING THE YEAR AS A RESULT OF INVENTORY PURCHASE PATTERNS AND SEASONAL DEMANDS.  INVENTORY PURCHASE ACTIVITY IS A FUNCTION OF SALES ACTIVITY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  CONSOLIDATED WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED AT MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, INVENTORIES AND A DECREASE IN CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A INCREASE IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  CONSOLIDATED WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED AT MARCH 31, 2018 COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND A DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES.  OUR DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO INCREASED FOR 2019 AND 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  IN JULY 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S QUARTERLY DIVIDEND WAS RAISED FROM  $0.34  TO  $0.39  PER COMMON SHARE FOR DIVIDENDS DECLARED ON OR AFTER SUCH DATE BY THE BOARD.  DIVIDENDS WERE  $1.51  PER SHARE IN  2019  ,  $1.30  PER SHARE IN  2018  AND  $1.12  PER SHARE IN  2017  .  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, THE PAYMENT AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS REMAIN WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD AND WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , WE PAID TOTAL CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $292 MILLION  ,  $262 MILLION  AND $253 MILLION  .

AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, EXCLUDING ASSOCIATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, WAS APPROXIMATELY  $810 MILLION  . THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY RELATED FUTURE CASH SETTLEMENTS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  DURING 2019, WE RENEGOTIATED THE TERMS OF THE TRA WHICH RESULTED IN THE EXTINGUISHMENT AND DERECOGNITION OF THE  $90 MILLION  NONCURRENT LIABILITY.  IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS OF CHANGE AGREEING TO EXTINGUISH THE LIABILITY, WE AGREED TO AN ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN TAX AMORTIZATION THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF A DISTRIBUTION FROM THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF CHANGE.  AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION, MCKESSON WAS RELIEVED FROM ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NONCURRENT LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX CREDIT OF  $90 MILLION  (  $66 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) IN OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2019.  OUR BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE ISSUED  $165 MILLION  OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY BONDS AT MARCH 31, 2019.  THESE WERE ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF AND ARE MOSTLY RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND TO MEET THE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR STATUTORY LICENSES AND PERMITS, COURT AND FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS AND OUR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOTIVE LIABILITY PROGRAMS.  THE CARRYING VALUE OF REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATED TO MCKESSON EUROPE WAS  $1.39 BILLION  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WHICH EXCEEDED THE MAXIMUM REDEMPTION VALUE OF  $1.23 BILLION  .  THE BALANCE OF REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS REPORTED AT THE GREATER OF ITS CARRYING VALUE OR ITS MAXIMUM REDEMPTION VALUE AT EACH REPORTING DATE.  UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT ON DECEMBER 2, 2014, THE NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OF MCKESSON EUROPE RECEIVED A PUT RIGHT THAT ENABLES THEM TO PUT THEIR MCKESSON EUROPE SHARES TO MCKESSON AT \u20ac22.99 PER SHARE, WHICH PRICE IS INCREASED ANNUALLY FOR INTEREST IN THE AMOUNT OF 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE A BASE RATE PUBLISHED SEMIANNUALLY BY THE GERMAN BUNDESBANK, LESS ANY COMPENSATION AMOUNT OR GUARANTEED DIVIDEND ALREADY PAID (\u201cPUT AMOUNT\u201d).  THE REDEMPTION VALUE IS THE PUT AMOUNT ADJUSTED FOR EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS EACH PERIOD.  THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE PUT AMOUNT ARE UNCERTAIN. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY AN ANNUAL RECURRING COMPENSATION OF \u20ac0.83 PER MCKESSON EUROPE SHARE (THE \u201cCOMPENSATION AMOUNT\u201d) TO THE NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OF MCKESSON EUROPE UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION  (A) PLAN OF OPERATION & LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN PROFITABLE AND SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN MARCH 1999 HAS HAD NO REVENUE UNTIL THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. IN APRIL, 2018, THE BOARD ADOPTED A NEW BUSINESS PLAN FOCUSSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE BUSINESSES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SMALL INVESTMENT FUNDING AND A RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY BUSINESS SERVICES. IN ORDER TO FUND THE NEW BUSINESS PLAN, THE COMPANY CONVERTED $320,000 OF RELATED PARTY DEBT AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND RAISED $1,770,000 IN CASH FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENT UNITS UNDER THE TERMS OF A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERED TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS.  THE COMPANY HAS CREATED A PORTFOLIO OF MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE START-UP COMPANIES AND DERIVES ITS REVENUE OPPORTUNITY FROM THE SALE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. SUCH SALES ARE OUTSIDE ITS CONTROL AND DEPEND ON M&A TRANSACTIONS WHICH MAY RESULT IN CASH OR EQUITY PROCEEDS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS $388,000 IN THE BANK AND EXPECTS TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL $300,000 WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS AS A FINAL CALL ON SALES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK UNITS, AS THE MARKETING OF A $3 MILLION HIGHER-VALUED SERIES B ROUND IS COMMENCED WITH A TARGET CLOSE DATE OF OCTOBER 2019. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $22,000 PER MONTH SO THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF ITS FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 IF IT SIMPLY MANAGES ITS EXISTING INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, IT PLANS TO RAMP UP MONTHLY EXPENDITURE TO AN AVERAGE OF $48,000 PER MONTH TO MARKET AND ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE SERIES B ROUND, WHEREUPON, IF SUCCESSFUL IT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR FURTHER INVESTMENTS AND ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SERIES B CLOSE IS DELAYED, MANAGEMENT HAS TWO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF LIQUIDITY AND ONGOING OPERATIONS: THE ABILITY TO SLOW DOWN EXPENDITURE OR DEFER FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO BALANCE ITS CASH FLOW ACCORDINGLY.  (B) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE: THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE EMERGENCE OF LIQUIDITY SITUATIONS TO REALIZE ITS INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES BUT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SUCH EVENTS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THERE WERE NO LIQUIDATION TRANSACTIONS AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY DID NOT GENERATE ANY REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES ADVISORY SERVICES TO CERTAIN OF ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $9,000 REVENUE FROM ADVISORY FEES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES: GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL FEES INCURRED IN THE COURSE OF SEC FILING AND COMPLIANCE, AND TRAVEL AND CONFERENCE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH FUND RAISING AND REVIEW OF INVESTMENT DEAL-FLOW. THE COMPANY INCURRED EXPENSES OF $239,082 AND $90,827 IN THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE OF 163% REFLECTS THE INCREASED LEVEL OF NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS THE COMPANY RAISED FUNDING FROM PRIVATE PLACEMENTS, AND RESEARCHED AND EVALUATED INVESTMENT CANDIDATES DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LOSS WAS $230,107 AND $90,827, RESPECTIVELY.  5  (C) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WORKING CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL SURPLUS OF $65,684 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $(316,956) AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. CASH WAS $93,634 AND $4 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH OUTFLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $205,225 AND $31,319, RESPECTIVELY.  CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $1,796,903 AND $31,323, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RAISED $1,770,000 FROM PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF PREFERRED INVESTMENT UNITS FROM ACCREDITED INVESTORS.  THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A NEW BUSINESS PLAN TO ASSIST EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES BY LEVERAGING ITS NETWORK OF EXPERIENCED INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS TO PROVIDE A COMBINATION OF PROFESSIONAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND INVESTMENT, AND THEREBY ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED UNDER LEGACY GUIDANCE AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS ON THE MARCH 1, 2018 ADOPTION DATE. ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION, WE RECORDED OPERATING LEASE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS OF $42.1 MILLION AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF $42.8 MILLION TO REFLECT OUR PORTFOLIO OF OPERATING LEASES, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNRECORDED UNDER LEGACY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR CASH FLOWS. WE HAVE ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE NEW STANDARD, WHICH AMONG SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO CARRY-FORWARD THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION FROM LEGACY GUIDANCE FOR LEASES THAT EXISTED ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE RECORDED NET SALES OF  $927.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $810.4 MILLION  . OF THE TOTAL NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  52.5%  OF OUR NET SALES WERE GENERATED FROM THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  47.5%  WERE GENERATED FROM THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. NET INCOME FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $51.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $45.2 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . NET INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  5.5%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  5.6%  FOR FISCAL  2018  .

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVED TURNAROUNDS IN THE U.S. REFINERY MARKET, INCREASED INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS AND AN UPTICK IN OUR ELECTRICAL BUSINESS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE NUCLEAR MARKET, WHICH IS DUE IN PART TO THE WESTINGHOUSE BANKRUPTCY DISCUSSED BELOW.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, WHICH CONSISTED OF FORTY-TWO METAL COATING FACILITIES AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, GENERATED NET SALES OF  $440.3 MILLION  , A  13.1%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $389.4 MILLION  . THE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER VOLUMES OF STEEL PROCESSED DURING THE PERIODS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR FISCAL 2018 ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATING INCOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).  ENERGY  $31,332  $(1,766  )  METAL COATINGS  83,591  84,332  CORPORATE  (37,967  )  (34,318  )  TOTAL OPERATING INCOME  $76,956  $48,248  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE ENERGY SEGMENT INCREASED  $33.1 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2019  , TO  $31.3 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF  $1.8 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . OPERATING MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT WERE  6.4%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  (0.4)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POSITIVE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PROJECT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.5 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN COST OF SALES, RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS RETIRED AND A PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $2.9 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION RELATED TO CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. NO SUCH CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT DECREASED  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  0.9%  , FOR FISCAL  2019  TO  $83.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $84.3 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING MARGINS WERE  19.0%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  21.7%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ZINC AND LABOR COSTS, WHICH WERE NOT FULLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING PRICES, AND A CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION INCURRED DURING FISCAL 2019 FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND OTHER DISPOSAL COSTS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF TWO GALVANIZING FACILITIES IN THE GULF COAST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE  $38.0 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2019  AND  $34.3 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPEND ON OUTSIDE SERVICES AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE COSTS IN FISCAL  2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT GRANTS THAT WERE FORFEITED WHEN VARIOUS VESTING CONDITIONS WERE NOT SATISFIED DURING FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  8.0%  TO  $15.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $13.9 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES DURING FISCAL 2019. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD GROSS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF  $241.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $301.3 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018  . AZZ'S DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS  0.40  TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  0.53  TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018.  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  FOR FISCAL  2019  , WE RECORDED OTHER INCOME, NET OF  $1.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE, NET OF  $3.5 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A DOWNWARD REVISION TO ESTIMATED LOSSES ON THE IMPAIRMENT OF A NON-TRADE NOTE RECEIVABLE, WHICH WAS INITIALLY RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018 UPON THE BANKRUPTCY DECLARATION OF THE NOTE DEBTOR. THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS PROGRESSED BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF ITS INITIAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE OUTSTANDING NOTE, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM A NON-COMPETE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT WITH A COMPETITOR IN A PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES THAT WERE REALIZED DURING FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EXCHANGE RATES.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES REFLECTED AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  18.7%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AND  (46.2)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cU.S. TAX ACT\u201d), WHICH RESULTED IN A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT FOR FISCAL  2018  RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES AT A LOWER CORPORATE RATE THAT WAS OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES  THE U.S. TAX ACT REQUIRES COMPLEX COMPUTATIONS TO BE PERFORMED THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED BY U.S. TAX LAW, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE IN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT, SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS, AND THE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY RELEVANT.  THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, THE IRS, AND OTHER STANDARD-SETTING BODIES WILL CONTINUE TO INTERPRET OR ISSUE GUIDANCE ON HOW PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT WILL BE APPLIED OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTERED.  AS FUTURE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED, WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE TAX ACT UNDER SAB 118, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.1 MILLION RESULTING FROM REVISED ESTIMATES OF THE MANDATORY DEEMED REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, AND BONUS DEPRECIATION ELECTIONS BASED ON THE FINALIZATION OF OUR 2017 US FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THE CHANGE IN BONUS DEPRECIATION ELECTIONS AND OTHER TEMPORARY RETURN TO PROVISIONS ITEMS RESULTED IN $0.8 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE FINALIZATION OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FINALIZATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS RESULTED IN A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT.  WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY CASE  WE HAD EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY (\u201cWEC\u201d). WEC AND THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"DEBTORS\") FILED RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ON MARCH 29, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, JOINTLY ADMINISTERED AS IN RE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY, ET AL., CASE NO. 17-10751 (THE \"BANKRUPTCY CASE\"). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLECTING ON POST-PETITION AMOUNTS DUE AND OWED. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2018, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE DEBTORS\u2019 MODIFIED FIRST AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS ESTIMATED A 98.9% TO 100% DISTRIBUTION ON ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF SUCH CLAIMS FILED WITH THE COURT, WHICH INCLUDES 100% OF OUR PRE-PETITION CLAIMS. THE TOTAL CLAIMS FILED EXCEED THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR EXPOSURE AND WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE ALL AMOUNTS DUE. IN APRIL 2019, FOR ONE OF OUR PLANTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR RELATED TO OUTSTANDING CLAIMS. THE AGREEMENT AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION REPRESENTED 100% OF THOSE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS FOR SUCH PLANT. THE BALANCE OF THE $12 MILLION CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE ARE STILL OUTSTANDING.  AT TIME OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE, WE WERE SUBCONTRACTORS ON VARIOUS WEC ENGAGEMENTS, INCLUDING ONE IN GEORGIA (\"V.C. SUMMER\") AND ONE IN SOUTH CAROLINA (\"PLANT VOGTLE\"). THE OWNERSHIP OF V.C. SUMMER HALTED WORK EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE DE-BOOKED $11.0 MILLION FROM BACKLOG RELATED TO THIS PROJECT. ALSO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF CANCELLATION FROM WEC FOR THE PLANT VOGTLE PROJECT, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SALES AND MARGIN FOR THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $6.1 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2017  BACKLOG  WE ENDED FISCAL  2018  WITH A BACKLOG OF  $265.4 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $52.5 MILLION  OR  16.5%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2017  . THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG AS OF YEAR END PERTAINS TO THE ENERGY SEGMENT'S OPERATIONS. THE BOOK TO REVENUE RATIO DECLINED IN FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2017  . THE BOOK TO REVENUE RATIO WAS  0.92  TO 1 FOR FISCAL  2018  AND  0.99  TO 1 FOR FISCAL  2017.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS BOOKINGS AND SHIPMENTS FOR FISCAL  2018  AND  2017.

THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2018 WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING REDUCED TURNAROUNDS IN THE U.S. REFINERY MARKET, CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE PETROCHEMICAL MARKET, NEGATIVE IMPACTS FROM THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE ACTIVITY, CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL LARGE PROJECTS IN THE U.S. AND OVERSEAS. IN ADDITION, NET SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS ON THE NUCLEAR MARKET FROM THE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY FILED ON MARCH 29, 2017.  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, WHICH CONSISTED OF FORTY-FIVE METAL COATING FACILITIES AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , GENERATED NET SALES OF  $389.4 MILLION  , A  3.7%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $375.5 MILLION  . THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS DURING THE YEAR AND INCREASED PRICES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED VOLUMES IN STEEL PROCESSED AS A RESULT OF SOFTNESS IN THE SOLAR, PETROCHEMICAL, AND THE OIL AND GAS MARKETS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  FEBRUARY 28, 2017  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).  ENERGY  $(1,766  )  $52,577  METAL COATINGS  84,332  79,033  CORPORATE  (34,318  )  (32,702  )  TOTAL OPERATING INCOME  $48,248  $98,908  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE ENERGY SEGMENT DECREASED  $54.3 MILLION  , OR  103.4%  , FOR FISCAL  2018  , TO A LOSS OF  $(1.8) MILLION  AS COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $52.6 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2017  . OPERATING MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT WERE  (0.4)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED TO  10.8%  FOR FISCAL  2017  . THIS DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCTION IN REFINERY TURNAROUNDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH TYPICALLY CARRY A HIGHER MARGIN, CANCELLATIONS, MARGIN DEGRADATIONS ON CERTAIN LARGE PROJECTS IN THE U.S. AND OVERSEAS AND THE WESTINGHOUSE BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.5 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS RETIRED AND A PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $2.9 MILLION RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION RELATED TO CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. NO SUCH CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT INCREASED  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  6.7%  , FOR FISCAL  2018  TO  $84.3 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $79.0 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING MARGINS WERE  21.7%  FOR FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED TO  21.0%  FOR FISCAL  2017  . EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF REALIGNMENT CHARGES OF $7.3 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL  2017  , OVERALL MARGINS DECREASED IN FISCAL  2018  AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUMES AND INCREASED COSTS FOR ZINC, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL MARGIN EARNED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE YEAR.  CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE  $34.3 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  AND  $32.7 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2017  . THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPEND ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE COSTS IN FISCAL  2018.  INTEREST  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL  2018  DECREASED  5.9%  TO  $13.9 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $14.7 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2017  . THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO MORE FAVORABLE INTEREST RATES DURING FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTIAL OR FULL REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE REPLACED WITH BORROWINGS THAT CARRIED LOWER INTEREST RATES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , WE HAD GROSS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF $301.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $272.3 MILLION AT THE END OF FISCAL 2017. AZZ'S DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS 0.53 TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO 0.51 TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2017.  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  FOR FISCAL 2018, A TOTAL OF  $3.5 MILLION  IN EXPENSE WAS RECORDED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE NON-TRADE NOTE RECEIVABLE DESCRIBED ABOVE UPON THE BANKRUPTCY DECLARATION OF THE NOTE DEBTOR. FOR FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED  $1.1 MILLION  OF INCOME TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES OF $0.6 MILLION FROM A LAWSUIT IN FISCAL 2016 AND NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS.  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES REFLECTED AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF (46.2)% FOR FISCAL 2018 AND 28.2% FOR FISCAL 2017. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017, WHICH RESULTED IN A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES AT A LOWER CORPORATE RATE THAT WAS OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH BANK AND BOND MARKET DEBT. OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ACQUISITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH POSITION, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING AVAILABILITY TO DRAW UPON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS BY CATEGORY FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $114,668  $78,909  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (32,073  )  (73,939  )  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (78,004  )  3,800  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $114.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $78.9 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2018  IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND POSITIVE IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECLINE IN NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT ACCRUALS WHICH WERE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018 RESULTING FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES DUE TO THE DECREASE OF U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATES AS PART OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017. THIS DECLINE IN NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT ACCRUALS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $32.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $73.9 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE DECLINE IN CASH USED DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE BREAKDOWN OF CAPITAL SPENDING BY SEGMENT FOR FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $78.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $3.8 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED NET REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER OUR OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AGREEMENTS.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL  2017 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON MARCH 27, 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND OTHER LENDERS.

THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BY THE FOLLOWING: (I) EXTENDING THE MATURITY DATE UNTIL MARCH 21, 2022, (II) PROVIDING FOR A SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $450 MILLION, WITH AN ADDITIONAL $150 MILLION ACCORDION, (III) INCLUDING A $75 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT, (IV) INCLUDING A $30 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING LINE LOANS, (V) RESTRICTING INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED IN RESPECT OF CAPITAL LEASES, SYNTHETIC LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND PURCHASE MONEY OBLIGATIONS NOT TO EXCEED $20 MILLION, (VI) RESTRICTING INVESTMENTS IN ANY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES NOT TO EXCEED $50 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, AND (VII) INCLUDING VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS RELATING TO DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE BALANCE DUE ON THE $75.0 MILLION TERM FACILITY UNDER THE PREVIOUS CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS PAID IN FULL AS A RESULT OF THE EXECUTION OF THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS A LEVERAGE RATIO NOT TO EXCEED 3.25:1.0 AND AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 3.00:1.0. THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE USED TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DIVIDENDS, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, LETTER OF CREDIT NEEDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST RATES FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BASED ON EITHER A EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE PLUS A MARGIN RANGING FROM 0.875% TO 1.875% DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT). THE EURODOLLAR RATE IS DEFINED AS LIBOR FOR A TERM EQUIVALENT TO THE BORROWING TERM (OR OTHER SIMILAR INTERBANK RATES IF LIBOR IS UNAVAILABLE). THE BASE RATE IS DEFINED AS THE HIGHEST OF THE APPLICABLE FED FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50%, THE PRIME RATE, OR THE EURODOLLAR RATE PLUS 1.0% AT THE TIME OF BORROWING. THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CARRIES A COMMITMENT FEE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION RANGING FROM 0.175% TO 0.30% PER ANNUM, DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 4.06% AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD $116.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT AGAINST THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING IN THE AMOUNT OF $18.7 MILLION, WHICH LEFT APPROXIMATELY $315.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CREDIT AVAILABLE UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  2011 SENIOR NOTES  ON JANUARY 21, 2011, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2011 AGREEMENT\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED $125.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ITS 5.42% UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES (THE \u201c2011 NOTES\u201d), THROUGH A PRIVATE PLACEMENT (THE \u201c2011 NOTE OFFERING\u201d). AMOUNTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT ARE DUE IN A BALLOON PAYMENT ON THE JANUARY 2021 MATURITY DATE. PURSUANT TO THE 2011 AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 2011 NOTES MAY BE ACCELERATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF ITS DEBT COVENANTS.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN JANUARY OF 2012, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, AND THE AMOUNT AND PRICES PAID FOR ANY FUTURE SHARE PURCHASES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. REPURCHASES UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON SHARES DURING THE  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  OTHER EXPOSURES  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES IN BOTH SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS IN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND ZINC AND NATURAL GAS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE INCREASES THROUGH ESCALATION CLAUSES IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS FOR COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS, WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW AND THROUGH FIXED COST CONTRACT PURCHASES ON ZINC. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER OTHER COST INCREASES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND THROUGH INCREASES IN PRICES WHERE COMPETITIVELY FEASIBLE.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED UNDER SEC RULES.

THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE ISSUED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, BUT ARE MOST COMMONLY ISSUED IN LIEU OF CUSTOMER RETENTION WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS COVERING WARRANTY OR PERFORMANCE PERIODS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED VALUE OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSIONS. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE INFORMATION USED TO MAKE THESE ESTIMATES AS BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGE. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES CONSIDERED MOST CRITICAL ARE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES BELOW HAVE BEEN REVIEWED WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. MORE INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION. AN ALLOWANCE IS MAINTAINED FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INABILITY TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF UNCOLLECTED ACCOUNTS, THE LEVEL OF PAST DUE ACCOUNTS, OVERALL LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES COULD BE REQUIRED.  ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  THE AMOUNTS WE RECORD FOR ESTIMATED CLAIMS, SUCH AS SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS, WARRANTY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, REQUIRES US TO MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE INCURRED. WE USE PAST HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AND OTHER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THESE CLAIMS IN EVALUATING THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT SHOULD BE RECORDED. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATE.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE DETERMINE REVENUE RECOGNITION THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  1)  IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER,  2)  IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT,  3)  DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE,  4)  ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AND  5)  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION VARIES BY SEGMENT BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER CONTRACT.  ENERGY SEGMENT  OUR ENERGY SEGMENT IS A PROVIDER OF SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL, NUCLEAR AND ELECTRICAL APPLICATIONS. WITHIN THIS SEGMENT, THE CONTRACT IS GOVERNED BY A CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDER AND AN EXECUTED PRODUCT OR SERVICES AGREEMENT. THE CONTRACT GENERALLY SPECIFIES THE DELIVERY OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSISTING OF EITHER CUSTOM BUILT PRODUCTS, CUSTOM SERVICES, OR OFF-THE-SHELF PRODUCTS. WHEN WE ENTER INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE CUSTOMER AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UPON THE SATISFACTION OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES THAT ARE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT PURPORT TO BE FOR A SINGLE COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVE.  FOR CUSTOM BUILT PRODUCTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER TIME PROVIDED THAT THE GOODS DO NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE USE TO THE COMPANY AND WE HAVE AN UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO PAYMENT FOR WORK COMPLETED TO DATE PLUS A REASONABLE MARGIN. FOR CUSTOM SERVICES, WHICH CONSIST OF SPECIALIZED WELDING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SERVICES ENHANCE A CUSTOMER OWNED ASSET. FOR OFF-THE-SHELF PRODUCTS, WHICH CONSIST OF TUBING AND LIGHTING PRODUCTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT A POINT-IN-TIME UPON THE TRANSFER OF THE GOODS TO THE CUSTOMER.  FOR REVENUES RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, WE GENERALLY USE THE COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THIS APPROACH, THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE RATIO OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE VERSUS THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. THIS REQUIRES THAT WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL CONTRACT REVENUES, PROJECT COSTS AND MARGIN, WHICH CAN INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE ESTIMATES COULD AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND UPDATES ITS CONTRACT RELATED ESTIMATES REGULARLY. WE RECOGNIZE ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATED MARGIN ON CONTRACTS UNDER A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS AND SUBSEQUENT REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE ADJUSTED ESTIMATE. IF THE ESTIMATE OF CONTRACT MARGIN INDICATES AN ANTICIPATED LOSS ON THE CONTRACT, WE RECOGNIZE THE TOTAL ESTIMATED LOSS IN THE PERIOD IT IS IDENTIFIED.  DUE TO THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, CONTRACTS WITHIN THE ENERGY SEGMENT ARE OFTEN MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. A CONTRACT MODIFICATION EXISTS WHEN THE MODIFICATION EITHER CREATES NEW, OR CHANGES THE EXISTING, ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT. FOR US, MOST CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS ARE RELATED TO GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT DISTINCT FROM THOSE IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INTERRELATIONSHIP OR INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN THE DELIVERABLES. SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THEY WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. AS A RESULT, THE TRANSACTION PRICE AND THE MEASURE OF PROGRESS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO WHICH IT RELATES, IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO REVENUE ON A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS.  IN ADDITION TO FIXED CONSIDERATION, THE CONTRACTS WITHIN OUR ENERGY SEGMENT CAN INCLUDE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING CLAIMS, INCENTIVE FEES, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES OR OTHER PENALTIES. WE RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR VARIABLE CONSIDERATION WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR. WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED ON VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING THE EXPECTED VALUE OR THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD, WHICHEVER IS EXPECTED TO BETTER PREDICT THE AMOUNT.  METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT IS A PROVIDER OF HOT DIP GALVANIZING, POWDER COATING AND OTHER METAL COATING APPLICATIONS TO THE STEEL FABRICATION INDUSTRY. WITHIN THIS SEGMENT, THE CONTRACT IS GOVERNED BY A CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDER OR WORK ORDER. THE CONTRACT GENERALLY SPECIFIES THE DELIVERY OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSISTING OF METAL COATING SERVICES.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES THAT ARE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT PURPORT TO BE FOR A SINGLE COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVE.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME AS THE METAL COATING IS APPLIED TO THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED MATERIAL AS THE PROCESS ENHANCES A CUSTOMER CONTROLLED ASSET. CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS ARE RARE WITHIN THIS SEGMENT AND MOST CONTRACTS ARE ON A FIXED PRICE BASIS WITH NO VARIABLE CONSIDERATION.  CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BILLINGS AND CASH COLLECTIONS RESULTS IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CONTRACT ASSETS (UNBILLED RECEIVABLES), AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES (CUSTOMER ADVANCES AND DEPOSITS) ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ENERGY SEGMENT. AMOUNTS ARE BILLED AS WORK PROGRESSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON CONTRACTUAL TERMS, EITHER AT PERIODIC INTERVALS (E.G., WEEKLY OR MONTHLY) OR UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES. BILLING CAN OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, RESULTING IN CONTRACT ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE CAN RECEIVE ADVANCES OR DEPOSITS FROM ITS CUSTOMERS, BEFORE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, RESULTING IN CONTRACT LIABILITIES. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  OTHER  NO GENERAL RIGHTS OF RETURN EXIST FOR CUSTOMERS AND WE ESTABLISH PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED WARRANTIES. WE GENERALLY DO NOT SELL EXTENDED WARRANTIES. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED NET OF APPLICABLE SALES AND OTHER TAXES. WE DO NOT ADJUST THE CONTRACT PRICE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT IF WE EXPECT, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN WE TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR THAT GOOD OR SERVICE WILL BE ONE YEAR OR LESS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE. SALES COMMISSIONS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED REVENUES. SHIPPING AND HANDLING IS TREATED AS A FULFILLMENT OBLIGATION INSTEAD OF A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND SUCH COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL  WE RECORD IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED AND THE UNDISCOUNTED PROJECTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ASSETS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THOSE ASSETS. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE ASSET\u2019S FAIR VALUE, GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED UPON DISCOUNTED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR PROJECTED CASH FLOWS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL IS PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. THE TEST IS CALCULATED USING THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AFTER TAX FROM OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OR COST OF CAPITAL FOR FUTURE YEARS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN FUTURE YEARS. VARIABLES IMPACTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND RESPONSE TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER TO THE POWER GENERATION MARKET, THE ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION MARKETS, THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL MARKET AND THE HOT DIP GALVANIZING MARKET, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THESE VARIOUS MARKETS, RAW MATERIAL AND NATURAL GAS COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF EXPERIENCED LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES. OUR TESTING CONCLUDED THAT NONE OF OUR GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID. WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WILL RESULT IN TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN THE FUTURE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION FROM WHICH THEY ARISE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX-PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND RESULTS OF RECENT OPERATIONS. IN PROJECTING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WE BEGIN WITH HISTORICAL RESULTS ADJUSTED FOR THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE STATE, FEDERAL, AND FOREIGN PRETAX OPERATING INCOME ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES. THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES WE ARE USING TO MANAGE THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS ACROSS OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"GAAP\") STATES THAT A TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION MAY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNICAL MERITS. WE MAY (1) RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND (2) ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES WHEN OUR JUDGMENT CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF NEW INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT LIABILITIES. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BE REFLECTED AS INCREASES OR DECREASES TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH NEW INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR, FOREIGN TAX EXPOSURE. WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR TAX EXPOSURE FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT NEED TO RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE FUTURE.  THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cU.S. TAX ACT\u201d) REQUIRES COMPLEX COMPUTATIONS TO BE PERFORMED THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED BY U.S. TAX LAW, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE IN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT, SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS, AND THE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY RELEVANT.  THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, THE IRS, AND OTHER STANDARD-SETTING BODIES WILL CONTINUE TO INTERPRET OR ISSUE GUIDANCE ON HOW PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT WILL BE APPLIED OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTERED.  AS FUTURE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED, WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSISTS OF THE EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (\"RSUS\"), PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (\"PSUS\"), STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (\"SARS\") AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (\"ESPP\") SHARES GRANTED TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS. THE COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AWARDS AND IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE RESPECTIVE VESTING PERIODS OF THE AWARDS.  FOR SARS AND ESPP AWARDS, WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE USING A BLACK-SCHOLES PRICING MODEL. FOR PSUS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE PERFORMANCE-BASED AND MARKET-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION. THE INPUTS REQUIRED FOR THESE VALUATION MODELS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. FOR RSUS WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE CLOSE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE PART II, ITEM 8.

ON DECEMBER 4, 2018, PARK COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SALE OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SINGAPORE, FRANCE, CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA AND R&D FACILITIES IN SINGAPORE AND ARIZONA, TO AGC INC. FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $145 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL COMPARED TO TARGET NET WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH IN CERTAIN ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN ACCRUED AND UNPAID TAXES OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES. SEE NOTE 13, \u201cDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\u201d, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SALE.  AS A RESULT, THE DISCUSSION BELOW IS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE OFFICE.  THE COMPANY PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 5, 2019. THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND WAS FUNDED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES. THIS SPECIAL DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER SHARE PAID FEBRUARY 5, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON JANUARY 2, 2019, BRINGS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TO $24.75 PER SHARE, A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $506 MILLION, SINCE THE COMPANY\u2019S 2005 FISCAL YEAR.  22  IN 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE MAJOR EXPANSION OF ITS AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN FACILITIES LOCATED AT THE NEWTON CITY-COUNTY AIRPORT IN NEWTON, KANSAS.  THIS EXPANSION WILL INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A REDUNDANT MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED ADJACENT TO PARK\u2019S EXISTING NEWTON, KANSAS FACILITIES.  THIS REDUNDANT FACILITY, WHICH IS BEING CONSTRUCTED IN PART TO SUPPORT A MAJOR AEROSPACE CUSTOMER, WILL INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY 90,000 SQUARE FEET OF MANUFACTURING AND OFFICE SPACE, AND WILL ESSENTIALLY DOUBLE THE SIZE OF PARK\u2019S EXISTING NEWTON, KANSAS FACILITIES.  THE TOTAL COST OF THE EXPANSION IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, AND THE EXPANSION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 2020 CALENDAR YEAR.  THE EXPANSION INCLUDES NEW RESIN MIXING AND DELIVERY SYSTEMS, NEW HOT-MELT FILM AND TAPE MANUFACTURING LINES, SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE AN ADDITIONAL HOT-MELT TAPE LINE OR SOLUTION TREATING LINE, SPACE TO ACCOMMODATE A CONFIDENTIAL JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT WITH A MAJOR AEROSPACE CUSTOMER, ADDITIONAL SLITTING CAPABILITY, SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FREEZER AND STORAGE SPACE, AN EXPANDED PRODUCTION LAB, A NEW R&D LAB AND ADDITIONAL OFFICE SPACE.  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS RESULTING FROM THE $4.25 PER SHARE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND PAID BY THE COMPANY IN FEBRUARY 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2019 INCLUDED $1.2 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSE.  IN ORDER TO RAISE THE APPROXIMATELY $87 MILLION TO FUND THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE COMPANY LIQUIDATED MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION.  THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES WORLDWIDE IN 2019 WERE 27% HIGHER THAN IN 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE \u201cEND CUSTOMER\u201d OF A MAJOR COMPANY CUSTOMER RAMPING UP COMMERCIAL JET PRODUCTION AND THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMER RESTOCKING DEPLETED INVENTORY, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND TO AN INCREASE IN MILITARY SALES DURING 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 31.7% IN 2019 FROM 28.1% IN 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS COMBINED WITH THE FIXED NATURE OF CERTAIN OVERHEAD COSTS AND COST REDUCTION EFFORTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 WERE 464% HIGHER THAN IN 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED INCREASES IN SALES AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND A 9% REDUCTION IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED THE ADDITIONAL STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION. THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 WERE 65% LOWER THAN IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $17.8 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE 2018 YEAR RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 AND TO A LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION INCURRED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019.  THE COMPANY HAS A NUMBER OF LONG-TERM CONTRACTS PURSUANT TO WHICH CERTAIN OF ITS CUSTOMERS, SOME OF WHICH REPRESENT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUE, PLACE ORDERS. LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY REQUIREMENTS BASED AND DO NOT GUARANTEE QUANTITIES. AN ORDER FORECAST IS GENERALLY AGREED CONCURRENTLY WITH PRICING FOR ANY APPLICABLE LONG-TERM CONTRACT. THIS ORDER FORECAST IS THEN TYPICALLY UPDATED PERIODICALLY DURING THE TERM OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT. PURCHASE ORDERS GENERALLY ARE RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY.  THE MARKETS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO BE STRONG, AND THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES SALES WILL INCREASE IN 2020 FROM 2019.  23  RESULTS  O  F OPERATIONS  .  2019  COMPARED TO 201  8  YEAR ENDED  MARCH 3,  FEBRUARY 25,  (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  2019  2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  NET SALES  $51,116  $40,230  $10,886  27%  COST OF SALES  34,932  28,942  5,990  21%  GROSS PROFIT  16,184  11,288  4,896  43%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  8,968  9,862  (894  )  -9%  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  -  146  (146  )  -100%  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  7,216  1,280  5,936  464%  INTEREST EXPENSE  -  2,269  (2,269  )  -100%  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  2,379  2,641  (262  )  -10%  LOSS ON SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES  (1,498  )  (1,342  )  (156  )  12%  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  8,097  310  7,787  2512%  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) PROVISION  1,791  (18,162  )  19,953  -110%  NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  6,306  18,472  (12,166  )  -66%  EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX  107,239  2,123  105,116  4951%  NET EARNINGS  $113,545  $20,595  $92,950  451%  EARNINGS PER SHARE.

GROSS PROFIT  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 31.7% IN 2019, FROM 28.1% IN 2018, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND THE PARTIALLY FIXED NATURE OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $0.9 MILLION, OR 9%, DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 2018. SUCH EXPENSES, MEASURED AS PERCENTAGES OF SALES, WERE 17.5% DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 24.5% DURING 2018. THE DECREASE IN SUCH EXPENSES IN 2019 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN SALARY AND RELATED EXPENSES, LOWER TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES, LOWER LEGAL FEES AND LOWER STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, EXCLUDING THE STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGES IN EACH PERIOD.  24  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2019 INCLUDED $1.2 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO $1.4 MILLION OF SUCH EXPENSES IN 2018, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS.  EARNINGS FROM  CONTINUING  OPERATIONS  FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $7.2 MILLION FOR 2019, INCLUDING A PRE-TAX STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.3 MILLION IN 2018, INCLUDING A PRE-TAX STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019.  LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES  THE COMPANY RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE LIQUIDATION OF SECURITIES TO FUND THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPATRIATION OF CASH AND THE PREPAYMENT OF ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND THE FUNDING OF A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS $0, COMPARED TO $2.3 MILLION IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JANUARY 16, 2016, BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND HSBC BANK USA (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) IN 2018. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY PREPAID THE REMAINING LOAN BALANCE OF $68.5 MILLION WITH HSBC BANK AND TERMINATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE PREPAYMENT WAS MADE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RESTRICTED CASH. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY EXPENSED THE REMAINING DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d ELSEWHERE IN THIS ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WERE $2.4 MILLION AND $2.6 MILLION FOR 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE FROM 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE INVESTED CASH DURING THE PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY PREPAID ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE IN FEBRUARY 2018. DURING 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY EARNED INTEREST INCOME PRINCIPALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY IN SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 22.1% FOR 2019 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE AND STATE INCOME TAXES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON STATE TAX CREDITS AND A DECREASE IN STATE APPORTIONMENT PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FOR 2018, DUE TO THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $17.8 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 PERTAINING TO U.S. TAX LAW CHANGES ENABLING THE REDUCTION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. SEE \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 \u2013 INCOME TAX PROVISION\u201d ELSEWHERE IN THIS ITEM 7.  25  NET EARNINGS  FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR 2019 WERE $6.3 MILLION, INCLUDING THE STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019 AND THE PRE-TAX LOSS OF $1.5 MILLION ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR 2018 WERE $18.5 MILLION, INCLUDING THE TAX BENEFIT OF $17.8 MILLION RELATED TO THE TAX ACT, THE STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE PRE-TAX LOSS OF $1.3 MILLION ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND THE PRE-TAX DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN 2018. THE NET IMPACT OF THE ITEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE WAS TO DECREASE NET EARNINGS BY $2.0 MILLION IN 2019 AND TO INCREASE NET EARNINGS BY $16.0 MILLION IN 2018.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  ON DECEMBER 4, 2018, PARK COMPLETED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SALE OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SINGAPORE, FRANCE, CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA AND R&D FACILITIES IN SINGAPORE AND ARIZONA, TO AGC INC. FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $145 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL COMPARED TO THE TARGET NET WORKING CAPITAL, EXCLUDING CASH IN CERTAIN ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN ACCRUED AND UNPAID TAXES OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES. SEE NOTE 13, \u201cDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\u201d, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE SALE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ELECTRONICS BUSINESS ARE CLASSIFIED, TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE, AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX, IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WERE HIGHER IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE GAIN RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF THE ELECTRONICS BUSINESS OF $102,145 AND THE GAIN OF $2,945 RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF ITS NEW ENGLAND LAMINATES CO., INC.

THE INCREASE IN SALES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES TO A MAJOR CUSTOMER FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THAT CUSTOMER\u2019S INVENTORY CORRECTION.  GROSS PROFIT  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 28.1% IN 2018 FROM 26.1% IN 2017 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AEROSPACE PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH THE FIXED NATURE OF CERTAIN OVERHEAD COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $0.4 MILLION, OR 4%, DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 2017. SUCH EXPENSES MEASURED AS PERCENTAGES OF SALES WERE 24.5% DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 32.3% DURING 2017. THE DECREASE IN SUCH EXPENSES IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALARY, INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSES AND LOWER PROFESSIONAL FEES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2018 INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO $1.2 MILLION OF SUCH EXPENSES IN 2017.  27  EARNINGS FROM  CONTINUING  OPERATIONS  FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.3 MILLION FOR 2018, INCLUDING PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $0.5 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODIFICATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO NEGATIVE $2.0 MILLION FOR 2017.  LOSS ON SALE  S  OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES  THE CHANGES IN THE U.S. TAX CODE, ENACTED BY THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO REPATRIATE ITS FOREIGN ACCUMULATED INCOME AT A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. IN RESPONSE TO THE TAX ACT, THE COMPANY LIQUIDATED CERTAIN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND REPATRIATED CASH HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 25, 2018. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPATRIATION OF CASH AND THE PREPAYMENT OF ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND THE FUNDING OF A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2018 WAS $2.3 MILLION, COMPARED TO $1.4 MILLION IN 2017. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND THE PRE-TAX DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY PREPAID THE REMAINING LOAN BALANCE OF $68.5 MILLION WITH HSBC BANK AND TERMINATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE PREPAYMENT WAS MADE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RESTRICTED CASH. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY EXPENSED THE REMAINING DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d ELSEWHERE IN THIS ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WERE $2.6 MILLION AND $1.6 MILLION FOR 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE 61% INCREASE IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BASED ON LONGER AVERAGE MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD BY THE COMPANY IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017'S COMPARABLE PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE INVESTED CASH DURING THE PERIOD. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY PREPAID ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE IN FEBRUARY 2018. DURING 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY EARNED INTEREST INCOME PRINCIPALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY IN SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES, IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $17.8 MILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF LIABILITIES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX AND THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S POST-1986 EARNINGS AND PROFITS (\u201cE&P\u201d) NOT PREVIOUSLY SUBJECTED TO U.S. TAXATION.  28  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $0.2 MILLION DUE TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY REMEASURED CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE RATES AT WHICH THEY WERE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS GENERALLY 21% FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 9.5% FOR 2017.  NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR 2018 WAS $18.5 MILLION, INCLUDING PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO FACILITY CLOSURE, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $1.1 MILLION FOR 2017.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES WAS $2.1 MILLION IN 2018 COMPARED TO $10.4 MILLION IN 2017. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES WERE LOWER IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. DURING 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $5.0 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS UNITS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA, THE CLOSURE, IN 2009, OF ITS FACILITY IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK AND THE CLOSURE, IN 2012, OF ITS FACILITY IN WATERBURY, CONNECTICUT, COMPARED TO PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $0.3 MILLION IN 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED FACILITY CLOSURE IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK.  BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2018 WERE $0.91, INCLUDING THE FACILITY CLOSURE MENTIONED ABOVE, COMPARED TO BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF NEGATIVE $0.05 FOR 2017.

THE CHANGE IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRONICS BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID BY THE COMPANY TO ITS SHAREHOLDER IN FEBRUARY 2019 AND A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY 34% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES IN THE LAST MONTH OF 2019;  \u25cf  INVENTORY INCREASED 33% DUE PRIMARILY TO RAW MATERIAL PURCHASED AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2019 FOR USE IN FUTURE PRODUCTION;  \u25cf  PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED 15% DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASE IN OTHER RECEIVABLES OFFSET BY A DECREASE TO PREPAID MARKETABLE SECURITIES;  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED 74% DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2019;  \u25cf  ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCREASED 186% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ACCRUALS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND BONUSES; AND  \u25cf  INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED 248% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $145 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, NET OF TAXES AND TRANSACTION EXPENSES, AND PAID $95.0 MILLION AND $68.8 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING SPECIAL DIVIDENDS OF $86.8 MILLION AND $60.7 MILLION PAID IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY INCURRED $1.5 MILLION OF LOSSES ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN ORDER TO PAY THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND.  WORKING CAPITAL  WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 3, 2019 WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018. INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND TAXES PAYABLE.  THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RATIO (THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS 15.1 TO 1 AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO 11.6 TO 1 AT FEBRUARY 25, 2018.  CASH FLOWS  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY'S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF BOND PREMIUM AND GAIN ON SALE OF FIXED ASSETS, WERE $9.6 MILLION. SUCH EARNINGS REFLECTED A LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION AND WERE DECREASED BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $1.6 MILLION, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $2.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGH SALES IN THE LAST MONTH OF THE FISCAL YEAR, RESULTING IN $8.1 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. DURING 2019, THE COMPANY EXPENDED $2.8 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT COMPARED TO $571,000 DURING 2018, AND THE COMPANY PAID $95.1 MILLION AND $68.8 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  30  OTHER LIQUIDITY FACTORS  IN DECEMBER 2018, PATC ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF NEWTON, KANSAS AND THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS OF HARVEY COUNTY, KANSAS.  PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, PATC AGREED TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE AN ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY APPROXIMATELY 90,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND PARTS, STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AEROSPACE. PATC FURTHER AGREED TO EQUIP THE FACILITY THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS AND TO CREATE ADDITIONAL NEW FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT OF SPECIFIED LEVELS DURING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.  IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE AGREEMENTS, THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AGREED TO LEASE TO PATC THREE ACRES OF LAND AT THE NEWTON CITY/COUNTY AIRPORT, IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHT ACRES PREVIOUSLY LEASED TO PATC BY THE CITY AND COUNTY.  THE CITY AND THE COUNTY FURTHER AGREED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY AS SET FORTH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE TOTAL COST OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY TO BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 2020 CALENDAR YEAR.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES, IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM. AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, THE COMPANY RECORDED TAX PAYABLE TO BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS, AS OF MARCH 3, 2019, WAS APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION TO BE PAID OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT, FOR THE 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER, TO PROVIDE FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER EXPANSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS, SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, CONSIST ONLY OF OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THE COMPANY HAS NO OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS, UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, GUARANTEES, STANDBY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS OR CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS, OTHER THAN TWO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $.3 MILLION TO SECURE THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE PROGRAM.  31  AS OF MARCH 3, 2019 THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS DUE BY FISCAL YEAR, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT POSSIBLE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE USE OF, AND THE COMPANY IS NOT ENGAGED IN, ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS SECURITIZATION OF RECEIVABLES OR OBTAINING ACCESS TO ASSETS THROUGH SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, AS A GENERAL MATTER, ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES ARE PROPERLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND THAT ITS HANDLING, MANUFACTURE, USE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES ARE IN ACCORD WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, MAINLY BECAUSE OF PAST OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRONICS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF PREDECESSOR COMPANIES, WHICH WERE GENERALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AT THE TIME OF THE OPERATIONS IN QUESTION, THE COMPANY, LIKE OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, IS A PARTY TO CLAIMS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THIRD PARTIES AND HAS INCURRED REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AND COSTS INVOLVING PAST ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY CONTINUE TO ARISE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO RECORD APPROPRIATE LIABILITIES FOR SUCH MATTERS WHEN REMEDIAL EFFORTS ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $70,000, $99,000 AND $84,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP COSTS AND RELATED LEGAL FEES, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED, OR EXPECTS TO RECEIVE, REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR APPROXIMATELY $68,000, $92,000 AND $84,000, RESPECTIVELY, OF SUCH AMOUNTS. WHILE ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN CONSTANT FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND MAY INCREASE OVER TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL BE ABLE TO FUND SUCH EXPENDITURES FROM CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. THE TIMING OF EXPENDITURES DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CLEANUP PROJECTS, REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES TO BE UTILIZED AND AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PARTIES. AT MARCH 3, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 25, 2018, THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY. SEE NOTE 12 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  32  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED REGARDING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THAT ENTAIL, TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT, THE USE OF ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT.  GENERAL  THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO SALES ALLOWANCES, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORIES, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT ITS MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT  SEE NOTE 16 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE PROVIDING ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: (1) WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT, (2) THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, (3) THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN DETERMINED, (4) THE TRANSACTION PRICE HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AND (5) THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SHIPPING TERMS PERMIT IT TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT POINT OF SHIPMENT. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE TREATED AS FULFILLMENT COSTS.  SALES ALLOWANCES AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES  THE COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER RETURNS, ALLOWANCES, AND WARRANTY CLAIMS. PROVISIONS FOR SUCH REDUCTIONS ARE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THE SALE IS RECORDED AND ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MADE TO CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS AND TESTED FOR ADHERENCE TO SUCH SPECIFICATIONS BEFORE SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS. COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO \u201cAIRWORTHINESS\u201d ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS AFTER RECEIPT AT THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 LOCATIONS. THERE ARE NO FUTURE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN THE PRODUCTS\u2019 MEETING THE AGREED SPECIFICATIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S BASIS FOR PROVIDING SALES ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS ARE KNOWN SITUATIONS IN WHICH PRODUCTS MAY HAVE FAILED DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCTS SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON MANUFACTURING THE HIGHEST QUALITY ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES AND TOOLING POSSIBLE AND EMPLOYS STRINGENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTROLS AND WORKS WITH RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO COMPLYING WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNTS OF RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE OR DAMAGED PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 1.0% OF SALES FOR EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  33  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE DUE FROM PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS. CREDIT IS EXTENDED BASED ON EVALUATION OF A CUSTOMER\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND, GENERALLY, COLLATERAL IS NOT REQUIRED. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE DUE WITHIN ESTABLISHED PAYMENT TERMS AND ARE STATED AT AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. ACCOUNTS OUTSTANDING LONGER THAN ESTABLISHED PAYMENT TERMS ARE CONSIDERED PAST DUE. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ITS ALLOWANCE BY CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE PAST DUE, THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOSS HISTORY, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CURRENT ABILITY TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION TO THE COMPANY, AND THE CONDITIONS OF THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY WRITES OFF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHEN THEY BECOME UNCOLLECTIBLE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD) OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY WRITES DOWN ITS INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED OBSOLESCENCE OR UNMARKETABILITY BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE INVENTORY AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD TRIGGER AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS OR STRATEGY OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS.  INCOME TAXES  AS PART OF THE PROCESSES OF PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPENSE TOGETHER WITH ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE REPORTING OF CERTAIN ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES COMPARED TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION FROM WHICH THEY ARISE, ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING THE SCHEDULED REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND RESULTS OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS. IF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CONVERSELY TO FURTHER REDUCE THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE, RESULTING IN LESS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND ASSESSES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES QUARTERLY.  34  TAX BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION WHEN, IN THE COMPANY\u2019S JUDGMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY A TAXING AUTHORITY. FOR A TAX POSITION THAT MEETS THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE TAX BENEFIT IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS JUDGED TO HAVE A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH A TAXING AUTHORITY. THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY DUE TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ENTIRELY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS AS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMPANY. WHILE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME OR THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION OF ANY PARTICULAR TAX MATTER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS ADEQUATE. INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECOGNIZED ON THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE RECORDED AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUITS AND OTHER CLAIMS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCT AND OTHER MATTERS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OR OUTCOMES IN THESE MATTERS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL RANGES OF PROBABLE LOSSES. A DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES REQUIRED, IF ANY, FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IS MADE AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ISSUE. THE REQUIRED RESERVES MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH MATTER OR CHANGES IN APPROACH, SUCH AS A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY IN DEALING WITH THESE MATTERS.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS  THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 ARE EFFECTIVELY SELF-INSURED, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INDIVIDUAL AND AGGREGATE STOP-LOSS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH CLAIMS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES ITS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION LIABILITY BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL EXPOSURE OF KNOWN CLAIMS USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS LESS AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID OUT.  THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE A NON-CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN COVERING THEIR REGULAR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS BONUS AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, MOST OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED AT MANAGEMENT'S DISCRETION.  THE COMPANY'S RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SELF-INSURED LIABILITIES AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT FOR ADEQUACY AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  35", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "PARK ELECTROCHEMICAL CORP", "CIK": 76267, "Date": "2019-05-20T00:00:00", "Ticker": "PKE", "Name": "Park Electrochemical Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3672.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "NY", "IRS": 111734643.0, "key": "20190520PKE", "labelr1": -3.1464530892448552, "labelr2": -2.067336089781461, "labelr3": -2.412545235223152, "labelr4": -0.3708281829418957, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5168527, "prof1": 0.4831473, "return1&2": 1.0527883693928832, "return1&2&3": 1.0781873650356548, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0821855876501256, "return2": 1.020673360897815, "return1": 1.0314645308924486, "return3": 1.0241254523522316, "return4": 1.0037082818294192, "4_day_return": -7.780320366132719, "cumulative_return1": 0.07588770737881112, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0016218966756227904, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.673799053590753e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0675435894886753e-07, "indexx": 2370, "cumreturn1b": 0.817503877780059, "cumreturndow": 0.9796937906694109, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9790840860499582}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2372, "level_0": 2397, "index": 5745, "text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING CLOUD PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS, THAT ENABLE BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES TO COMMUNICATE FASTER AND SMARTER ACROSS VOICE, VIDEO MEETINGS, CHAT AND CONTACT CENTERS, TRANSFORMING BOTH EMPLOYEE AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES WITH COMMUNICATIONS THAT WORK SIMPLY, INTEGRATE SEAMLESSLY, AND PERFORM RELIABLY. FROM ONE PROPRIETARY CLOUD TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, TEAM COLLABORATION, VIDEO CONFERENCING, CONTACT CENTER, DATA AND ANALYTICS AND OTHER SERVICES.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SPREAD ACROSS MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES AND RANGE FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO LARGE ENTERPRISES WITH MORE THAN 10,000 EMPLOYEES. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON THE MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER SECTORS, AND IN FISCAL 2019, WE GENERATED A MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE BUSINESS SECTORS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR SOFTWARE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR REVENUES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN COMPRISED OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE AND PRODUCT REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OFFICE PHONES AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. WE DEFINE A \u201cCUSTOMER\u201d AS ONE OR MORE LEGAL ENTITIES TO WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES PURSUANT TO A SINGLE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT. IN SOME CASES, WE MAY HAVE MULTIPLE BILLING RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SINGLE CUSTOMER (FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE WE ESTABLISH SEPARATE BILLING ACCOUNTS FOR A PARENT COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES).  HISTORICALLY, OUR FLAGSHIP SERVICES HAVE BEEN VIRTUAL OFFICE, A UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTION, AND VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER, A CONTACT CENTER SOLUTION.  IN 2018, WE BEGAN SELLING OUR 8X8 X SERIES SUITE OF SERVICES, WHICH CONSIST OF SERVICE PLANS DESIGNATED X1, X2, ETC., THROUGH X8. WITH 8X8 X SERIES, WE PROVIDE BOTH UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT CENTER FUNCTIONALITY FROM A SINGLE PLATFORM, WITH A SINGLE INTERFACE, IN THE HIGH-END SET OF OUR SERVICE PLANS (X5 THROUGH X8).  WE ALSO OFFER MORE BASIC, COST-EFFICIENT UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN X1 THROUGH X4. DURING THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NEARLY ALL OF OUR NEW CUSTOMERS PURCHASED SERVICE PLANS FOR 8X8 X SERIES, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBED TO OUR VIRTUAL OFFICE AND VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER PLATFORMS.  WE HAVE BEGUN MIGRATING THESE CUSTOMERS FROM OUR LEGACY PLATFORMS TO 8X8 X SERIES, AND WE INTEND TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF MIGRATIONS DURING FISCAL YEARS 2020 AND 2021.  THESE MIGRATIONS WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COSTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN CHURN.  RECLASSIFICATION  EFFECTIVE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THESE CLASSIFICATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND INSIGHTS INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S GO-TO-MARKET, DEMAND GENERATION AND SALES EXECUTION ACTIVITIES, AND HOW THE TOTAL SALES AND MARKETING SPEND DRIVES REVENUE GENERATION, IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT STRATEGIC AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IMPACTING OUR CHANNEL, MARKETING AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. THESE CHANGES IN CLASSIFICATION ALSO ALIGN OUR EXTERNAL PRESENTATION OF OPERATING-RELATED EXPENSES WITH THE WAY THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) EXPECTS TO ASSESS SPEND AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS AROUND THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND MARKETING DEMAND  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERATION EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. WE RECLASSIFIED THESE EXPENSES FOR THE PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE COMPARABLE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  THE RECLASSIFICATIONS DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT TO CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), NET INCOME (LOSS) OR CASH FLOWS.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT ON THE VARIOUS LINE ITEMS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COST OF REVENUES: CERTAIN EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING TRAINING TO CUSTOMERS, DEPLOYMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, CUSTOMER SUPPORT, AND RELATED EXPENSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF REVENUES.  \u2022  SALES & MARKETING EXPENSES: CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHICH INCLUDES CUSTOMER DEPLOYMENT, TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND OTHER COSTS WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM SALES & MARKETING EXPENSE TO COST OF REVENUES, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND/OR GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  \u2022  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO CUSTOMER DEPLOYMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING EXPENSES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  \u2022  GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: CERTAIN PERSONNEL EXPENSES THAT SUPPORT BILLING AND COLLECTION EFFORTS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS COSTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING WERE RECLASSIFIED TO GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  ALSO BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO RECRUITING ACTIVITIES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE REPORTED IN GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  TABLES SHOWING THE RECLASSIFICATIONS AND FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE AFFECTED LINE ITEMS ARE SET FORTH BELOW UNDER NOTE 14 IN PART II, ITEM 8, NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK  OUR 2019 FISCAL YEAR WAS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE YEAR FOR 8X8.  WE LAUNCHED 8X8 X SERIES, OUR SINGLE-TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM.  WE RE-ALIGNED OUR CHANNEL AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT A MORE SCALABLE, HIGH-GROWTH, GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY.   WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR BELIEF THAT OWNERSHIP OF THE CORE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND OUR PLATFORM IS AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATOR.  IN FISCAL 2019, OUR TOTAL SERVICE REVENUE GREW  19%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO  $334.4 MILLION  , ROUGHLY IN-LINE WITH OUR FISCAL 2018 GROWTH RATE. WE CONTINUED TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER (ARPU), WHICH GREW TO $498, COMPARED WITH $450 IN FISCAL  2018  , AS WE ARE SELLING MORE TO MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. SERVICE REVENUE FROM MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 62% OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUE AND GREW 30% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. WE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF DEALS WHERE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE OUR INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT CENTER SOLUTION, WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED TO AS BUNDLED DEALS.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018, WE HAVE DE-EMPHASIZED PROFITABILITY AS A SHORT-TERM CORPORATE GOAL AND HAVE FOCUSED INSTEAD ON MAKING INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE GROWTH.  THIS DECISION WAS BASED, IN PART, ON OUR BELIEF THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET WAS AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE SHIFT OF BUSINESSES FROM LEGACY ON-PREMISE SOLUTIONS TO CLOUD SERVICES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY TREND WILL CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND.  ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IN THE COMPANY'S INTEREST TO CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN OUR BUSINESS--IN PARTICULAR, TO BUILD OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FURTHER AND EXPAND OUR SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CHANNEL--IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO SCALE EFFICIENTLY AND CAPTURE MARKET SHARE DURING THIS PHASE OF INDUSTRY DISRUPTION.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT INVESTMENTS IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS, WHICH INCLUDES OUR SALES FORCE AND DIGITAL MARKETING SPEND. WE ALSO INTEND TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL TO MARKET TO SELL OUR SOLUTIONS. SHOULD THESE UPFRONT INVESTMENTS NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM NEW OR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, SEE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MAY 30, 2018.  WE HAVE MINIMAL SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, BUT TYPICALLY SALES OF NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER ARE GREATER THAN IN ANY OF THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. WE BELIEVE THIS OCCURS BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS WE TARGET TEND TO SPEND A RELATIVELY GREATER PORTION OF THEIR ANNUAL CAPITAL BUDGETS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR YEAR COMPARED WITH EACH OF THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THE YEAR.  REVENUE  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  YEAR-OVER-YEAR  2019  2018  CHANGE  (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  SERVICE REVENUE  $334,438  $280,430  $54,008  19.3%  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE  94.9%  94.6%  SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROVISION OF OUR 8X8 CLOUD COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS, ALONG WITH REVENUES FROM PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2018  , WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMER SUBSCRIBER BASE (NET OF CUSTOMER CHURN), WITH THE LARGEST PART OF THE INCREASE COMING FROM OUR MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE OUR FASTEST GROWING CUSTOMER SECTOR, CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER. OUR BUSINESS SERVICE SUBSCRIBER BASE GREW FROM APPROXIMATELY 49,000 CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018  TO APPROXIMATELY 52,000 CUSTOMERS ON  MARCH 31, 2019  . AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER FOR THE FISCAL YEAR INCREASED FROM $450 FOR FISCAL  2018  TO $498 FOR FISCAL  2019  . WE EXPECT THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN FISCAL  2020.

PRODUCT REVENUE IS DEPENDENT ON THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE AN IP TELEPHONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SERVICE INSTEAD OF USING THE SOLUTION ON THEIR CELL PHONE, COMPUTER OR OTHER COMPATIBLE DEVICE. WE EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE TO ADOPT OUR MOBILE AND DESKTOP SOLUTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  NO SINGLE CUSTOMER REPRESENTED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES DURING FISCAL  2019  OR  2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES OUR REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA. REVENUES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO COUNTRIES BASED ON THE DESTINATION OF SHIPMENT AND THE CUSTOMER'S SERVICE ADDRESS.

OTHER COSTS SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHICH INCLUDES DEPLOYMENT ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE.  THE INCREASE IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE FOR FISCAL  2019  FROM FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $5.5 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, A $4.7 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES, A $2.3 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, A $1.5 MILLION INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, A $1.4 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES, A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY NETWORK SERVICE EXPENSES (DUE TO INCREASED CALL VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GROWTH), AND A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN LICENSES AND FEES.  THE INCREASE IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE FOR FISCAL  2018  FROM FISCAL  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $7.0 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES, A $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY NETWORK SERVICE EXPENSES (DUE TO INCREASED CALL VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GROWTH), A $1.7 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, A $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES, A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN LICENSES AND FEES, AND A $0.7 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

THE INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR FISCAL  2019  FROM FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $20.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES FROM AN INCREASE IN OUR SALES FORCE, A $10.5 MILLION INCREASE IN ADVERTISING, A $5.3 MILLION INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, A $3.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES AND A $3.0 MILLION INCREASE IN TRAVEL EXPENSES.

FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $66.3 MILLION  , MOSTLY RELATED TO THE RECORDING OF A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ESTABLISHED AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE RECORD DEFERRED TAXES BASED ON DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT BASIS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND AVAILABLE TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, IN DETERMINING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS. WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A SIGNIFICANT ITEM OF OBJECTIVE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED WAS THE HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE PRETAX LOSS REACHED IN FISCAL 2018. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"THE ACT\") THAT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, SIGNIFICANTLY REFORMED THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. THE ACT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CORPORATE TAXATION, INCLUDING REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, LIMITATION OF THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR INTEREST EXPENSE TO 30% OF EARNINGS, LIMITATION OF THE DEDUCTION FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES TO 80% OF CURRENT YEAR TAXABLE INCOME AND ELIMINATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYBACKS, ONE TIME TAXATION OF OFFSHORE EARNINGS AT REDUCED RATES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE REPATRIATED, ELIMINATION OF U.S. TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS), IMMEDIATE DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN NEW INVESTMENTS INSTEAD OF DEDUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER TIME, AND MODIFYING OR REPEALING MANY BUSINESS DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE RATES AT WHICH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS GENERALLY 21%. WE RECORDED NO ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY FOR OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OUR PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS CONCLUDED WE DO NOT HAVE ANY UNTAXED FOREIGN ACCUMULATED EARNINGS.  WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. IN ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANNUAL PRE-TAX INCOME, PERMANENT TAX DIFFERENCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AND THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS. WE RECORD THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS, WHICH ARE UNUSUAL OR OCCUR INFREQUENTLY, IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, INCLUDING CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ABOUT DEFERRED TAX VALUATION  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALLOWANCES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFIT GENERATED IN CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, JURISDICTIONS WITH A YEAR-TO-DATE LOSS WHERE NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $346.5 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAD  $8.1 MILLION  IN DEPOSITS AS RESTRICTED CASH IN SUPPORT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT, SECURING A LEASE FOR A NEW FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. BY COMPARISON, AT  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE HAD  $152.3 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE  $8.1 MILLION  IN DEPOSIT AS RESTRICTED CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND OUR ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $14.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $22.0 MILLION  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2018  .

THE CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $51.2 MILLION  OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $9.1 MILLION  OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT INVESTMENTS AND CAPITALIZED INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $25.6 MILLION.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $249.2 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED WITH  $16.4 MILLION  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2018  .

THE COMPANY LEASES ITS CURRENT HEADQUARTERS FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA UNDER AN OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES IN OCTOBER 2019.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A 132-MONTH LEASE TO RENT APPROXIMATELY 162,000 SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE IN A NEW BUILDING IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. THE LEASE TERM BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2019. ON APRIL 30, 2019, DUE TO OUR RAPID GROWTH OVER THE LAST YEAR AND OUR GREATER THAN ANTICIPATED FUTURE SPACE NEEDS, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ASSIGN THE LEASE. WE  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXPECT TO BE RELEASED FROM ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE AND RELATED STANDBY LETTER OF CREDIT BY THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2022 OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES & ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE POLICIES MAY INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY IN THEIR APPLICATION AND REPRESENT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE APPROPRIATE, ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS WERE TO PREVAIL, THE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR REPORTED RESULTS. THE IMPACT AND ANY ASSOCIATED RISKS RELATED TO THESE POLICIES ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IS DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHERE SUCH POLICIES AFFECT OUR REPORTED AND EXPECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND EQUITY AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE SUCH ESTIMATES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RELATED TO, REVENUE RECOGNITION, BAD DEBTS, RETURNS RESERVE FOR EXPECTED CANCELLATIONS, INCOME AND SALES TAX, AND LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND EQUITY THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING RISK FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED ABOVE UNDER PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS.\"  REVENUE RECOGNITION  OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MUST BE MADE AND USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN ANY ACCOUNTING PERIOD. MATERIAL DIFFERENCES MAY RESULT IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE FOR ANY PERIOD IF OUR MANAGEMENT MADE DIFFERENT JUDGMENTS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT ESTIMATES.  WE RECOGNIZE SERVICE REVENUE, MAINLY FROM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES TO ITS CLOUD-BASED VOICE, CALL CENTER, VIDEO AND COLLABORATION SOLUTIONS USING THE FIVE-STEP MODEL AS PRESCRIBED BY ASU NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (ASC 606), AS AMENDED.  TOPIC 606.  \u2022 IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTRACT, OR CONTRACTS, WITH A CUSTOMER;  \u2022 IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  \u2022 DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  \u2022 ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; AND  \u2022 RECOGNITION OF REVENUE WHEN OR AS, THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  WE IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND RELATED USAGE, PRODUCT REVENUE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED SERVICES OR PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMER. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN THE CONTRACT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN AN AMOUNT THAT REPRESENTS THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR SATISFYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED. REVENUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE TRANSACTION PRICE EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS SALES AND TELECOMMUNICATION TAXES, WHICH ARE COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE USUALLY BILL OUR CUSTOMERS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. CONTRACTS TYPICALLY RANGE FROM ANNUAL TO MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS WITH PAYMENT TERMS OF NET 30 DAYS OR LESS. WE OCCASIONALLY ALLOW A 30-DAY PERIOD TO CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION AND RETURN PRODUCTS SHIPPED FOR A FULL REFUND.  SERVICE REVENUE  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SERVICE REVENUE FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME ON A RATABLE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACTUAL SUBSCRIPTION TERM BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT THE PLATFORM IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER TILL THE END OF THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD. PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES BEING RENDERED ARE RECORDED AS A DEFERRED REVENUE. USAGE FEES, EITHER BUNDLED OR NOT BUNDLED, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE HAVE A RIGHT TO INVOICE. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR CONFIGURATION, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, OPTIMIZATION, CUSTOMER TRAINING OR EDUCATION ARE PRIMARILY BILLED ON A FIXED-FEE BASIS AND ARE PERFORMED BY US DIRECTLY OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES THEMSELVES OR ENGAGE THEIR OWN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED. WHEN A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER IS SIGNED, WE ASSESS WHETHER COLLECTION OF THE FEES UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT IS PROBABLE. WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT TO RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS BASED ON THE AGING OF THE CONTRACT BALANCE, CURRENT AND HISTORICAL CUSTOMER TRENDS, AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AGAINST THE CONTRACT ASSET (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE). IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE RECORD REVENUE REDUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS.  PRODUCT REVENUE  WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUE FOR TELEPHONY EQUIPMENT AT A POINT IN TIME, WHEN TRANSFER OF CONTROL HAS OCCURRED, WHICH IS GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT. SALES RETURNS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.  COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY ANALYZES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL BAD DEBTS, CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS, CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS WHEN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS DETERIORATES, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED OUR ESTIMATES, AND ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES WOULD BE REQUIRED.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AND MORE OFTEN IF THERE IS AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT.  WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST ON JANUARY 1 OF EACH YEAR AND DURING THE YEAR, WHENEVER A TRIGGERING EVENT FOR SUCH AN ASSESSMENT IS IDENTIFIED. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE CHANGED OUR PRODUCT AND MARKETING STRATEGY FOR THE USE OF DXI'S TECHNOLOGY AND RE-ASSESSED THE PROFITABILITY OUTLOOK WHICH TRIGGERED US TESTING THE RECORDED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. FIRST, WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR THREE REPORTING UNITS AT THE TIME USING THE MARKET APPROACH. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZED THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED SHARES AND COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE MULTIPLES WHICH WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THIS APPROACH, WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ONLY FOR OUR DXI REPORTING UNIT IN THE UK AS THE CARRYING VALUE INCLUDING GOODWILL EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. AS LARGELY INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS COULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ASSETS INDIVIDUALLY WE EVALUATED DXI'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS ONE ASSET GROUP. THEN WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF DXI'S USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODS TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE WAS RECORDED AS IMPAIRMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE ANALYSIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL OF $0.3 MILLION, $1.2 MILLION AND $8.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS RECORDED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD THREE REPORTING UNITS AND ALLOCATED GOODWILL TO THE REPORTING UNITS FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE DETERMINED WE HAD ONE REPORTING UNIT. THE CHANGE IN REPORTING UNITS RESULTED FROM THE FOLLOWING EVENTS.  \u2022  AS OF APRIL 1, 2018, THE COMPANY'S DXI OPERATIONS NO LONGER OPERATED ON A STAND ALONE BASIS AND WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING UNITED KINGDOM OPERATIONS, AND  \u2022  DURING THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY ASSESSED IT HAD ONLY ONE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, WHO REVIEWED FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE EARLY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-04,  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  . SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INTERNAL - USE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ACCOUNT FOR COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350-40,  INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE  (ASC 350-40), WHICH REQUIRES CAPITALIZATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED DURING THE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT STAGE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE, WE BEGIN TO CAPITALIZE OUR COSTS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE WHEN PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, MANAGEMENT HAS AUTHORIZED AND COMMITTED PROJECT FUNDING, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED AS INTENDED. ONCE THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSET, GENERALLY ESTIMATED TO BE THREE YEARS. COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO MEETING THESE CRITERIA TOGETHER WITH COSTS INCURRED FOR TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  INCOME AND OTHER TAXES  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPENSE AND TO ASSESS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM BOOK-TAX ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS ACCRUED VACATION. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE MUST THEN ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF TAXABLE INCOME BY JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THE PERIOD OVER WHICH OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERABLE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, IN DETERMINING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS. WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A SIGNIFICANT ITEM OF OBJECTIVE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED WAS THE HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE PRETAX LOSS AS OF THE END OF OUR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DURING THAT PERIOD. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. IN ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANNUAL PRE-TAX INCOME, PERMANENT TAX DIFFERENCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AND THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS. WE RECORD THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS, WHICH ARE UNUSUAL OR OCCUR INFREQUENTLY, IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, INCLUDING CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ABOUT DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFIT GENERATED IN CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, JURISDICTIONS WITH A YEAR-TO-DATE LOSS WHERE NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO SALES, USE AND UTILITY TAXES AND OTHER FEES IN MANY JURISDICTIONS. WE ASSESS, COLLECT AND REMIT THESE TAXES AND REPORT THEM TO MUNICIPAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS. WE REGULARLY RECEIVE INQUIRIES, DEMANDS OR AUDIT REQUESTS FROM THESE MUNICIPAL AND STATE TAX AGENCIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH, 31, 2019, WE DETERMINED THAT ADDITIONAL SALES TAXES WERE PROBABLE OF BEING ASSESSED AND ESTIMABLE IN MULTIPLE STATES AS A RESULT OF FINDINGS FROM SALES AND USE TAX AUDITS. AS OF MARCH 31. 2019 WE ESTIMATED THIS INCREMENTAL SALES TAX LIABILITY TO BE $8.0 MILLION.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS GRANTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 718 -  STOCK COMPENSATION  . UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 718, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD, AND IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEE'S REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE EQUITY GRANT), NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES.  COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD AND INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES.  TO VALUE OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, WE USED THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL. FAIR VALUE DETERMINED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL VARIES BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICES VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES AND FUTURE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. WE USED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK OVER A PERIOD EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTIONS. THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTIONS REPRESENT THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PERIOD STOCK-BASED AWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN OUTSTANDING. WE ESTABLISHED EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTIONS THROUGH THE REVIEW OF HISTORICAL EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OF STOCK-BASED AWARD GRANTS WITH SIMILAR VESTING PERIODS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET BID YIELDS ON ACTIVELY TRADED U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MARKET FOR THE EXPECTED TERM EQUAL TO THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTION. THE DIVIDEND YIELD ASSUMPTION WAS BASED ON OUR HISTORY AND EXPECTATION OF FUTURE DIVIDEND PAYOUT.  TO VALUE RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS UNDER THE EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, WE USED A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL.  FAIR VALUE DETERMINED USING THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL VARIES BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, THE CORRELATION COEFFICIENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, AND FUTURE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. WE USED THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY AND CORRELATION OF OUR STOCK AND THE INDEX OVER A PERIOD EQUAL TO THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE PERIOD AS OF THE GRANT DATE. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET BID YIELDS OF ACTIVELY TRADED U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE OVER-THE-COUNTER MARKET FOR THE EXPECTED TERM EQUAL TO THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE PERIOD AS OF THE GRANT DATE. THE DIVIDEND YIELD ASSUMPTION WAS BASED ON OUR HISTORY OF NOT PAYING DIVIDENDS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR BUSINESS  HAEMONETICS IS A GLOBAL HEALTHCARE COMPANY DEDICATED TO PROVIDING A SUITE OF INNOVATIVE HEMATOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS TO HELP IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. OUR TECHNOLOGY ADDRESSES IMPORTANT MEDICAL MARKETS INCLUDING BLOOD AND PLASMA COMPONENT COLLECTION, THE SURGICAL SUITE, AND HOSPITAL TRANSFUSION SERVICES. WHEN USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d MEAN HAEMONETICS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE CATEGORIES FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND DEVELOPING THEIR GROWTH POTENTIAL: PLASMA, BLOOD CENTER AND HOSPITAL. FOR THAT PURPOSE, \u201cPLASMA\u201d INCLUDES PLASMA COLLECTION DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES, PLASMA DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND ANTICOAGULANT AND SALINE SOLD TO PLASMA CUSTOMERS. \u201cBLOOD CENTER\u201d INCLUDES BLOOD COLLECTION AND PROCESSING DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES FOR RED CELLS, PLATELETS AND WHOLE BLOOD AS WELL AS RELATED DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. \"HOSPITAL\", WHICH IS COMPRISED OF HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT AND CELL PROCESSING PRODUCTS, INCLUDES DEVICES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING COAGULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF BLOOD, SURGICAL BLOOD SALVAGE SYSTEMS, SPECIALIZED BLOOD CELL PROCESSING SYSTEMS, DISPOSABLES AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE.  WE BELIEVE THAT PLASMA AND HOSPITAL HAVE GROWTH POTENTIAL, WHILE BLOOD CENTER COMPETES IN CHALLENGING MARKETS WHICH REQUIRE US TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY, INCLUDING REDUCING COSTS, SHRINKING THE SCOPE OF THE CURRENT PRODUCT LINE, AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXIT UNFAVORABLE CUSTOMER CONTRACTS.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  DIVESTITURE  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL PLASMA INC. (\u201cCSL\u201d) SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY AND CSL ASSUMED CERTAIN RELATED LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT, RELEASE AND ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES DATED MAY 13, 2019. AT THE CLOSING, WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION OF PROCEEDS AND WERE CONCURRENTLY RELEASED FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS UNDER A 2014 SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH CSL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING THE ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO OUR SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. WE EXPECT THAT COST SAVINGS GENERATED FROM THE ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE RELEASE FROM OUR LIQUID SOLUTIONS SUPPLY OBLIGATIONS, WILL BE REALLOCATED TO GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF APPROXIMATELY $49 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  IN MAY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $500 MILLION OF HAEMONETICS COMMON SHARES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THIS NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL HELP TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF RECENT AND FUTURE EMPLOYEE EQUITY GRANTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE AT MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCRETION WITH THE INTENT OF BEGINNING ACTIVITY UNDER THE PROGRAM DURING FISCAL 2020.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $260 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH MARCH 30, 2019. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD UTILIZED THE FULL $260 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION TOTAL SHARES REPURCHASED AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $86.58 PER SHARE.  TEG 6S TRAUMA INDICATION  IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS.  NEXSYS PCS  \u00ae  AND NEXLYNK DMS  TM  IN FISCAL 2018, WE RECEIVED FDA 510(K) CLEARANCE FOR OUR NEXSYS PCS  PLASMAPHERESIS SYSTEM, INCLUDING OUR EMBEDDED SOFTWARE THAT ACTIVATES YES  TM  TECHNOLOGY, A YIELD-ENHANCING SOLUTION. WE EXPECT TO PURSUE FURTHER REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OVERALL PRODUCT OFFERING.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR PLANNED ROLL OUT OF THIS NEW PLATFORM INCLUDES THE PLACEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW DEVICES. SUCH PLACEMENTS WILL REQUIRE MEANINGFUL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW CUSTOMER CONTRACTS THAT REFLECT PRICING AND VOLUMES APPROPRIATE TO THESE INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS FOR NEXSYS PCS DEVICES AND NEXLYNK DMS DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS FROM OUR OTHER PLASMA CUSTOMERS.  RELOCATION OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A LEASE FOR OFFICE SPACE IN BOSTON, MA THAT WILL SERVE AS OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND REPLACE OUR EXISTING LOCATION IN BRAINTREE, MA. WE BELIEVE OUR MOVE TO BOSTON, WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WILL ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TALENT AND PROVIDE A DYNAMIC SPACE TO ENGAGE OUR EMPLOYEES.  DEBT ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT  ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN LENDERS WHICH PROVIDED FOR A $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN (THE \"TERM LOAN\") AND A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING LOAN (THE \"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\" AND TOGETHER WITH THE TERM LOAN, THE \"CREDIT FACILITIES\"). A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF $347.8 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DOWN THE $253.7 MILLION REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014. THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. ON AUGUST 21, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT $241.9 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES FROM A VARIABLE RATE TO A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST.  LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT  AS PART OF OUR ACQUISITION OF THE WHOLE BLOOD BUSINESS FROM PALL CORPORATION (\u201cPALL\u201d) IN FISCAL 2012, PALL AGREED TO MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL IN ONE OF OUR FACILITIES A FILTER MEDIA MANUFACTURING LINE (THE \u201cHDC LINE\u201d) FOR WHICH WE AGREED TO PAY PALL APPROXIMATELY $15.0 MILLION (PLUS PRE-APPROVED OVERAGES). PALL ALSO AGREED TO SUPPLY MEDIA TO US FOR USE IN LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE ACCEPTED THE HDC LINE.  IN MAY 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH PALL UNDER WHICH PALL WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY MEDIA TO US FOR USE IN LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS. AS A CONDITION OF THE SUPPLY AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE HDC LINE AND TO MAKE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $9.0 MILLION TO PALL FOR THE HDC LINE.  AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO CONTINUE TO SOURCE MEDIA FOR OUR LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS FROM PALL RATHER THAN PRODUCING THEM INTERNALLY, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO UTILIZE THE HDC LINE FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION AND EXPECT THAT THE ASSET\u2019S FUTURE CASH FLOWS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER ITS CARRYING VALUE OF $19.8 MILLION. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $19.8 MILLION FOR THE HDC LINE.  PRODUCT RECALLS  IN MARCH 2018, WE ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL OF SPECIFIC LOTS OF OUR ACRODOSE  TM  PLUS AND PL SYSTEMS SOLD TO OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. THE RECALL RESULTED FROM REPORTS OF LOW PH READINGS FOR PLATELETS STORED IN THE CLX HP BAG AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, AN ACCOMPANYING YELLOW DISCOLORATION OF THE STORAGE BAG. FOR A PERIOD OF NINE WEEKS, WE WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR ACRODOSE PLUS AND PL SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF THE RECALL, OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE DISCARDED COLLECTED PLATELETS AND INCURRED OTHER DAMAGES. DURING  FISCAL 2019  WE ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AGAINST US. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED CUMULATIVE CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL WHICH CONSISTS OF $1.3 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER RETURNS AND INVENTORY RESERVES AND $0.9 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER CLAIMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN PAID AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL OF CERTAIN WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION KITS SOLD TO OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. THE RECALL RESULTED FROM SOME COLLECTION SETS' FILTERS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REMOVE LEUKOCYTES FROM COLLECTED BLOOD. AS A RESULT OF THE RECALL, OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE CONDUCTED TESTS TO CONFIRM THAT THE COLLECTED BLOOD WAS ADEQUATELY LEUKOREDUCED, SOLD THE COLLECTED BLOOD LABELED AS NON-LEUKOREDUCED AT A LOWER PRICE OR DISCARDED THE COLLECTED BLOOD. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED CUMULATIVE CHARGES OF $1.9 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL WHICH CONSISTS OF $0.1 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER RETURNS AND INVENTORY RESERVES AND $1.8 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER CLAIMS. WE MAY RECORD INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR CUSTOMER CLAIMS IN FUTURE PERIODS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE  IN FISCAL 2018, WE LAUNCHED A COMPLEXITY REDUCTION INITIATIVE (THE \"2018 PROGRAM\"), A COMPANY-WIDE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE COST, FREEING UP RESOURCES TO INVEST IN ACCELERATED GROWTH. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES A REDUCTION OF HEADCOUNT AND OPERATING COSTS TO ENABLE A MORE STREAMLINED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WE EXPECT TO INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $60 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS, OF WHICH WE EXPECT $35 MILLION TO $40 MILLION WILL CONSIST OF SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS AND THE REMAINDER WILL CONSIST OF OTHER EXIT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES. THESE CHARGES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTLAYS, WILL BE INCURRED AS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ON THESE INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH FISCAL 2020. WE EXPECT SAVINGS FROM THIS PROGRAM OF APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS ONCE THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETED. DURING THE  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE INCURRED  $13.7 MILLION  AND  $36.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  MARKET TRENDS  PLASMA MARKET  THERE ARE TWO KEY ASPECTS TO THE MARKET FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS - THE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN THIS MARKET.  CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, PARTICULARLY IMMUNOGLOBULIN, ARE THE KEY DRIVER OF PLASMA COLLECTION VOLUMES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL MARKET. VARIOUS FACTORS RELATED TO THE SUPPLY OF PLASMA AND THE PRODUCTION OF PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS ALSO AFFECT COLLECTION VOLUME, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SEEKING MORE YIELD FROM THE COLLECTED PLASMA TO MEET GROWING DEMAND FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICALS WITHOUT REQUIRING AN EQUIVALENT INCREASE IN PLASMA SUPPLY.  \u2022  NEWLY APPROVED INDICATIONS FOR AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASES TREATED WITH PLASMA-DERIVED THERAPIES; THE GROWING UNDERSTANDING AND DIAGNOSIS OF THESE DISEASES; LONGER LIFESPANS AND A GROWING AGING PATIENT POPULATION INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR PLASMA.  \u2022  GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF BIOPHARMACEUTICALS ALSO INCREASES DEMAND FOR PLASMA.  DEMAND FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS IN  FISCAL 2019  CONTINUED TO GROW IN NORTH AMERICA AS COLLECTION VOLUMES BENEFITED FROM AN EXPANDING END USER MARKET FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS WITH U.S. PRODUCED PLASMA MEETING AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF PLASMA VOLUME DEMAND WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, OUR PLASMA BUSINESS\u2019 REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY FROM THE U.S.  DESPITE THE OVERALL GROWTH IN THE MARKET, THE NUMBER OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT COLLECT AND FRACTIONATE THE MAJORITY OF SOURCE PLASMA IS LOW AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IS ONGOING. SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY EXIST FOR NEW ENTRANTS DUE TO HIGH CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUIREMENTS FOR FRACTIONATION, LONG REGULATORY PATHWAYS TO THE LICENSING OF COLLECTION CENTERS AND FRACTIONATION FACILITIES AND APPROVAL OF PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS. WITH THESE FACTORS, WE DO NOT EXPECT MEANINGFUL NEW ENTRIES OR DIVERSIFICATION. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE U.S. WHERE 80% OF SOURCE PLASMA IS COLLECTED AND ONLY A FEW CUSTOMERS PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF OUR PLASMA REVENUE.  BLOOD CENTER MARKET  IN THE BLOOD CENTER MARKET, WE SELL AUTOMATED BLOOD COMPONENT AND MANUAL WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE BLOOD DRIVE PLANNING, DONOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, BLOOD COLLECTION, COMPONENT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION. WHILE WE SELL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES ARE TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS DUE TO RELATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF BLOOD COLLECTORS.  WITHIN THE BLOOD CENTER MARKET, WE HAVE SEEN THREE TRENDS THAT HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR GROWTH OF THE OVERALL MARKETPLACE DESPITE THE OVERALL INCREASE IN AGING POPULATIONS. OVERALL WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT A DECLINE IN THIS BUSINESS IN THE LOW TO MID SINGLE-DIGITS.  \u2022  DECLINING TRANSFUSION RATES IN MATURE MARKETS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES WITH LOWER ASSOCIATED BLOOD LOSS, AS WELL AS BETTER BLOOD MANAGEMENT.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  COMPETITION IN MULTI-UNIT COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTOMATED BLOOD COMPONENT COLLECTION SYSTEMS HAS INTENSIFIED AND HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SALES IN MARKETS WHERE THESE COLLECTIONS ARE PREVALENT.  \u25aa  INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION THROUGH GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS HAS INTENSIFIED PRICING COMPETITION PARTICULARLY IN THE MANUAL WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS IMPACTING OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS WHERE SWITCHING LARGE CUSTOMERS TO NEW OR EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH COST.  HOSPITAL MARKET  HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT  HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT MARKET -  THE USE OF ROUTINE COAGULATION TESTING IS WELL ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN VARIOUS MEDICAL PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY, ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION, TRAUMA, POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE AND PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION. WHILE STANDARD TESTS LIKE PROTHROMBIN TIME, PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME AND PLATELET COUNT HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO REVEAL A PATIENT\u2019S RISK FOR BLEEDING, THEY DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE PATIENT\u2019S RISK FOR THROMBOSIS. IN ADDITION, THESE ROUTINE TESTS DO NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT CLOT QUALITY OR STABILITY. AS A RESULT OF THESE LIMITATIONS, CLINICIANS ARE INCREASINGLY UTILIZING ADVANCED HEMOSTASIS TESTING TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT\u2019S HEMOSTASIS STATUS, RESULTING IN IMPROVED CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING. IN ADDITION, ADVANCED HEMOSTASIS TESTING SUPPORTS HOSPITAL EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE RISKS, COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNNECESSARY BLOOD COMPONENT TRANSFUSIONS.  HAEMONETICS\u2019 TEG  \u00ae  HEMOSTASIS ANALYZER SYSTEMS ARE ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS THAT PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF A PATIENT\u2019S OVERALL HEMOSTASIS. THIS INFORMATION ENABLES CLINICIANS TO DECIDE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CLINICAL TREATMENT FOR THE PATIENT TO MINIMIZE BLOOD LOSS AND REDUCE CLOTTING RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, TEG ANALYZERS HAVE BEEN USED TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION MAKING IN OPEN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION, BECOMING THE \u201cGOLD STANDARD\u201d IN LIVER TRANSPLANTS. IN MORE RECENT YEARS, INTEREST HAS GROWN INTO THE UTILIZATION OF TEG IN TRAUMA AND OTHER PROCEDURES IN WHICH THE RISK OF HEMORRHAGE AND THROMBOSIS ARE HIGH.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, TEG SYSTEMS HAVE ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST MARKET PENETRATION IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND CHINA. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE AS WELL AS OTHER MARKETS, AS TEG SYSTEMS BECOME MORE ESTABLISHED AS THE STANDARD OF CARE AROUND THE WORLD.  CELL PROCESSING  CELL SALVAGE MARKET -  IN RECENT YEARS, MORE EFFICIENT BLOOD USE AND LESS INVASIVE SURGERIES HAVE REDUCED DEMAND FOR AUTOTRANSFUSION IN THESE PROCEDURES AND CONTRIBUTED TO INTENSE COMPETITION IN MATURE MARKETS, WHILE INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES HAS PROVIDED NEW MARKETS AND SOURCES OF GROWTH.  ORTHOPEDIC PROCEDURES HAVE SEEN SIMILAR CHANGES WITH IMPROVED BLOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE USE OF TRANEXAMIC ACID TO TREAT AND PREVENT POST-OPERATIVE BLEEDING, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TRANSFUSIONS AND AUTOTRANSFUSION.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE CELL SAVER  \u00ae  HAS ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST MARKET PENETRATION IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND JAPAN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN ASIA PACIFIC AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS AS ADDRESSABLE PROCEDURE VOLUMES GROW AND THE USE OF AUTOTRANSFUSION IS BECOMING ACCEPTED AS A STANDARD OF CARE.  TRANSFUSION MANAGEMENT MARKET -  REVENUES FROM BLOODTRACK  \u00ae  HAVE INCREASED IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE RECENTLY AS HOSPITALS SEEK MEANS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND MEET COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES FOR TRACKING AND DISPOSITIONING BLOOD COMPONENTS TO PATIENTS.

NET REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  7.0%  COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS REVENUE INCREASES IN PLASMA AND HOSPITAL WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR BLOOD CENTER BUSINESS UNIT.  NET REVENUES FOR FISCAL  2018  INCREASED  2.0%  COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, NET REVENUES INCREASED 1.1% COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  AS REVENUE INCREASES IN PLASMA AND HOSPITAL WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN BLOOD CENTER.  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED DURING FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE VOLUMES, FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX, LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS AND ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HDC LINE, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION RELATED TO PCS  \u00ae  2 DEVICES, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS DRIVEN BY REVENUE VOLUME GROWTH AND RISING FUEL COSTS AND CARRIER FEES AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR PLASMA AND HOSPITAL BUSINESS UNITS.  WE RECORDED OPERATING INCOME DURING FISCAL  2018  , AS COMPARED WITH AN OPERATING LOSS DURING FISCAL  2017  . OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  , AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT. THIS OPERATING INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SALES AND MARKETING PRIMARILY IN OUR HOSPITAL AND PLASMA BUSINESS UNITS.  MANAGEMENT'S USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"U.S. GAAP\"), TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, MAKE INFORMED BUSINESS DECISIONS, ESTABLISH BUDGETS AND FORECAST FUTURE RESULTS.

WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED  14.8%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN VOLUME OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. AND FAVORABLE NEXSYS PCS PRICING DURING  FISCAL 2019  . INCREASES IN SALES OF LIQUID SOLUTIONS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH DURING  FISCAL 2019  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY.

THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SALES OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES AND SOFTWARE DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN LIQUID SOLUTIONS REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EQUIPMENT REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE, WHICH CONTRIBUTED $6.5 MILLION IN PLASMA REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2017.  BLOOD CENTER  BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DECREASED  5.5%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THERE WAS NO FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT ON BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER WHOLE BLOOD REVENUE DUE TO CONTINUED MARKET DECLINES, THE STRATEGIC EXIT OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, PRODUCTS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING UNFAVORABLE ORDER TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXITS, AS WELL AS PRODUCT RECALLS. DECLINES IN SOFTWARE REVENUE IN THE U.S AND PLATELET REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED SHIFT TOWARD DOUBLE DOSE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES IN JAPAN ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE.

DECREASES IN EQUIPMENT REVENUE DUE TO A ONE-TIME SALE OF EQUIPMENT TO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND DECLINES IN RED CELL REVENUE DUE TO THE LOSS OF A CUSTOMER CONTRACT IN A PRIOR YEAR ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL DECREASE IN BLOOD CENTER.  HOSPITAL  HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.4%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.3%  DURING  FISCAL 2019.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH OF DISPOSABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TEG  \u00ae  DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE TEG 6S SYSTEM AND TEG MANAGER  \u00ae  SOFTWARE ARE APPROVED FOR THE SAME SET OF INDICATIONS AS THE TEG 5000 SYSTEM IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A BROADER SET OF INDICATIONS FOR TEG 6S IN THE U.S. IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS. THE INCREASE DURING  FISCAL 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN ORTHOPAT  \u00ae  REVENUE DUE TO BETTER BLOOD MANAGEMENT WHICH HAS REDUCED ORTHOPEDIC BLOOD LOSS. WE DISCONTINUED THE SALE OF OUR ORTHOPAT PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2019. WE OFFER THE CELL SAVER ELITE + AS AN ALTERNATIVE AUTOTRANSFUSION SYSTEM FOR ORTHOPEDICS OR OTHER MEDIUM TO LOW BLOOD LOSS PROCEDURES.

WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED 5.5% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN  FISCAL 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES IN CLINICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY IN HOSPITAL. THESE INCREASED COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SPENDING ON CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROJECTS AND SEVERAL PROJECTS IN BLOOD CENTER TO BETTER ALIGN WITH OUR LONG-TERM PRODUCT PLANS.

THE DECREASE IN  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS AND ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR PLASMA AND HOSPITAL BUSINESS UNITS, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS DRIVEN BY REVENUE VOLUME GROWTH AND RISING FUEL COSTS AND CARRIER FEES AND AN INCREASE IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 4.9% DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 4.4% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN  FISCAL 2018  WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM, AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN HOSPITAL AND NEXT GENERATION PLASMA COLLECTION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, AND AN INCREASE IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET, INCREASED  5.4 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE TERM LOAN BALANCE AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING FOR THE  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  3.8%.  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET, DECREASED  44.1%  DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  DUE TO A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR TERM LOAN AND A REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT LINE.  INCOME TAXES  FISCAL YEAR  2019  2018  2017% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  19 VS. 18% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  18 VS. 17  REPORTED INCOME TAX RATE  25.3%  23.6%  4.4%  1.7%  19.2%  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REPORTED TAX RATE  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES. OUR REPORTED TAX RATE IS IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AS THE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE TAX RATES THAT DIFFER FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE.  WE HAVE ASSESSED, ON A JURISDICTIONAL BASIS, THE AVAILABLE MEANS OF RECOVERING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO CARRY-BACK NET OPERATING LOSSES, THE EXISTENCE OF REVERSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND AVAILABLE SOURCES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN U.S. STATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT ARE NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT REALIZABLE AND MAINTAINS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $18.6 MILLION ON OUR WORLDWIDE PRE-TAX INCOME OF $73.6 MILLION, RESULTING IN A REPORTED TAX RATE OF 25.3%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  IS HIGHER THAN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 23.6% AND 4.4% FOR THE YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  AND  APRIL 1, 2017  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INCREASE IN TAX RATE FOR  FISCAL 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  , IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. TAX REFORM PROVISIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN  FISCAL 2019  , INCLUDING GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXCESS STOCK COMPENSATION BENEFITS. THE  FISCAL 2018  RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE  FISCAL 2017  TAX RATE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF U.S. TAX REFORM (TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS) CHANGES IN THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS AND THE IMPACT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS IN  FISCAL 2017.  INCOME TAX REFORM  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \"ACT\") WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, REQUIRED COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED AND CREATED NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCED EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED GUIDANCE UNDER STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT THAT DIRECTED TAXPAYERS TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. LEGISLATION AS \u201cPROVISIONAL\u201d WHEN IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AVAILABLE, PREPARED OR ANALYZED (INCLUDING COMPUTATIONS) IN REASONABLE DETAIL TO COMPLETE ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CHANGE IN TAX LAW.  DURING  FISCAL 2018  WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.0 MILLION AS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS). DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT. WE RECOGNIZED A $0.4 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISIONAL TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN  FISCAL 2018.  WE HAVE INCORPORATED THE OTHER IMPACTS OF THE ACT THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN  FISCAL 2019  IN THE CALCULATION OF THE TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d), FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME (\u201cFDII\u201d), BASE EROSION ANTI ABUSE TAX (\u201cBEAT\u201d), AS WELL AS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH LIMIT TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXPENSES. FOR  FISCAL 2019  , THE GILTI PROVISIONS HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO US. UNDER THE NEW LAW, U.S. TAXES ARE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPOSED ON FOREIGN INCOME IN EXCESS OF A DEEMED RETURN ON TANGIBLE ASSETS OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE ABILITY TO BENEFIT A DEDUCTION AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AGAINST A PORTION OF THE GILTI INCOME MAY BE LIMITED UNDER THE GILTI RULES AS A RESULT OF THE UTILIZATION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES, FOREIGN SOURCED INCOME, AND OTHER POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS WITHIN THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CALCULATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE BELIEVE DEPICT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW POSITION.  (IN THOUSANDS)  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $169,351  $180,169  WORKING CAPITAL  $340,362  $136,474  CURRENT RATIO  2.4  1.4  NET DEBT POSITION  (1)  $(180,769  )  $(73,513  )  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (DSO)  67  58  INVENTORY TURNOVER  2.5  3.5  (1)  NET DEBT POSITION IS THE SUM OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LESS TOTAL DEBT.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE LAUNCHED THE 2018 PROGRAM, A RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE. DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND 2018, WE INCURRED  $13.7 MILLION  AND  $36.6 MILLION  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE LAUNCHED A MULTI-YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE (THE \"2017 PROGRAM\") DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE. WE DID NOT INCUR ANY ADDITIONAL CHARGES UNDER THIS PROGRAM DURING  FISCAL 2019  . DURING FISCAL 2018, WE INCURRED  $7.2 MILLION  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND CHARGES UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019  , CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2017 PROGRAM ARE COMPLETE.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. WE BELIEVE THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR EXPECTED CASH OUTLAYS RELATE PRIMARILY TO INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION OF THE NEXSYS PCS AND PLASMA PLANT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT, RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND INITIATIVES AND ACQUISITIONS. THESE ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  BELOW.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $169.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS HELD IN THE U.S. OR IN COUNTRIES FROM WHICH IT CAN BE FREELY REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED FOR A $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITIES EXPIRE ON JUNE 15, 2023. INTEREST ON THE CREDIT FACILITIES IS ESTABLISHED USING LIBOR PLUS 1.13% - 1.75%, DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY NON-FINANCIAL AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS. A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF $347.8 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DOWN THE $253.7 REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014. THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AT  MARCH 30, 2019  ,  $336.9 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND  $15.0 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BOTH, WITH AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF  3.8%  . WE ALSO HAD  $25.1 MILLION  OF UNCOMMITTED OPERATING LINES OF CREDIT TO FUND OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS UNDER WHICH THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE PAID $13.1 MILLION IN SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS FOR THE TERM LOAN. WE HAVE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $336.9 MILLION  REQUIRED THROUGH FISCAL 2024. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER BANK COVENANTS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOW OVERVIEW  FISCAL YEAR  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  19 VS. 18% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  18 VS. 17  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE HAVE ELIMINATED THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY THROUGHOUT OUR CASH FLOW STATEMENT, EXCEPT FOR ITS EFFECT ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $159.3 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $61.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW DRIVEN LARGELY BY AN INCREASE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE GROWTH AND COLLECTIONS TIMING, AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND DECREASES IN ACCRUED PAYROLL DUE TO SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM. NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECREASE IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $220.4 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , AN INCREASE OF $60.6 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND A WORKING CAPITAL INFLOW RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES DUE TO AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DEMAND PLANNING PROCESS. AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, WHICH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND VARIABLE COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE CASH INFLOW.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $116.1 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $53.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD DUE TO THE NEXSYS PCS LAUNCH AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS IN OUR PLASMA BUSINESS AND PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $63.0 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , A DECREASE OF $10.3 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $50.6 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $70.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2018  . CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED THE REPAYMENT OF THE $253.7 REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014, AS WELL AS $160.0 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS USE IN CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS RESULTING FROM THE $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN ENTERED INTO IN JUNE 2018.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $120.6 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , AN INCREASE OF $60.2 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $100.0 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND AN INCREMENTAL $19.0 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE INCREASES IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS ON OUR PREVIOUS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF $50.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2017 AND AN INCREMENTAL $7.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONTRACTUAL AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  IS AS FOLLOWS.

INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE PROJECTED USING INTEREST RATES IN EFFECT AS OF MARCH 30, 2019. CERTAIN OF THESE PROJECTED INTEREST PAYMENTS MAY DIFFER IN THE FUTURE BASED ON CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES.  (2)  INCLUDES AMOUNTS WE ARE COMMITTED TO SPEND ON PURCHASE ORDERS ENTERED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACTORS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF CERTAIN DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS AND EQUIPMENT. THE MAJORITY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSE SPENDING DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY ADVANCE COMMITMENT.  THE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT OUR LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF  $2.9 MILLION  RECORDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 740, INCOME TAXES. WE CANNOT REASONABLY MAKE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE EXPECT TO SETTLE THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES DUE TO FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS TAX EXAMINATIONS.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  WHILE APPROXIMATELY  52%  OF OUR REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2019 WAS GENERATED BY OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY LIMITED DUE TO OUR LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THEIR DIVERSITY ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. CERTAIN MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES, HOWEVER, CAN EXPOSE US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PLASMA BUSINESS UNIT, SALES ARE CONCENTRATED WITH SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXTENDED TO ANY ONE OF THESE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL CUSTOMERS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AT ANY POINT IN TIME. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. INCLUDE SALES TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT DELAYS AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAYMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS OF THOSE COUNTRIES' NATIONAL ECONOMIES.  WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE ALL RECEIVABLES FOR POTENTIAL COLLECTION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CUSTOMERS OR THE COUNTRIES' HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DETERIORATE SUCH THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THESE MATTERS WHEN A LOSS IS KNOWN OR CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT MAY BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACTUAL SETTLEMENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN ESTIMATED AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REFER TO NOTE  15  ,  COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES  ,  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFLATION  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. HISTORICALLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION BY IMPROVING OUR MANUFACTURING AND PURCHASING EFFICIENCIES, BY INCREASING EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND BY ADJUSTING THE SELLING PRICES OF PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR INFLATION PRESSURES GENERALLY AND RAW MATERIALS INDICES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM DERIVATIVES COULD RESULT IN CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN OUR COSTS TO PROCURE PLASTIC RAW MATERIALS.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  DURING FISCAL  2019  ,  37.3%  OF OUR SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., GENERALLY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, YET OUR REPORTING CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE ALSO INCUR CERTAIN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN LOCAL CURRENCY. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATE TO SALES DENOMINATED IN EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CHINESE YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT. THE YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXPOSURE IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SOURCING PRODUCTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  SINCE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXCEED THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND, CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT OUR PRIMARY CASH FLOWS RELATE TO PRODUCT COSTS OR COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LOCAL OPERATIONS. WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THESE CURRENCIES, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MINIMIZE, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THE UNFORESEEN IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE UTILIZE FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY JAPANESE YEN AND EURO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SWISS FRANCS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS. THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE VOLATILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, BUT BECAUSE WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ONE YEAR OUT, RATES ARE FIXED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, THEREBY FACILITATING FINANCIAL PLANNING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THESE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FINAL IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS HEDGED AND THE ACTUAL LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  STANDARDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") UPDATE NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  . ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER CURRENT U.S. GAAP AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLIER ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED AN UPDATE TO THE LEASING GUIDANCE TO ALLOW AN ADDITIONAL TRANSITION OPTION WHICH WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO ADOPT THE STANDARD AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION AS OPPOSED TO THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED. WE ADOPTED THE NEW STANDARD ON MARCH 31, 2019.  UPON TRANSITION, WE PLAN TO APPLY THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 TRANSITION GUIDANCE TO OUR ENTIRE LEASE PORTFOLIO AT MARCH 31, 2019. AS A RESULT, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REASSESS (I) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (II) THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (III) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXISTING LEASES.  AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02, WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES FOR OUR EXISTING LEASE PORTFOLIO ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION TO $25 MILLION, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW LEASE ADMINISTRATION AND LEASE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, AND UPDATING OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR MAINTAINING AND ACCOUNTING FOR OUR LEASE PORTFOLIO UNDER THE NEW STANDARD.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  . ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS TO INTENDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING FORECASTED INFORMATION, TO DEVELOP CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715)  . THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES AS OF THE BEGINNING OF AN ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2017-07 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-07,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718)  . THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING FOR NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS WITH THE EXISTING EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED TRANSACTIONS GUIDANCE. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS, BUT NO EARLIER THAN THE ENTITY'S ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 606. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-07 ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BEING ASSESSED BY MANAGEMENT.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15,  INTANGIBLES, GOODWILL AND OTHER - INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40)  . THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE  2  ,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. WHILE ALL OF THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE VIEW CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES AS CRITICAL. POLICIES DETERMINED TO BE CRITICAL ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO USE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND/OR ESTIMATES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL ARE AS FOLLOWS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES ARE RECORDED AT THE NET SALES PRICE, WHICH INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO REBATES, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VOLUME DISCOUNTS. THESE RESERVES, WHICH ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS EARNED OR TO BE CLAIMED ON THE RELATED SALES, ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AND A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR ESTIMATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONTRACTUAL AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, SPECIFIC KNOWN MARKET EVENTS AND TRENDS, INDUSTRY DATA, AND FORECASTED CUSTOMER BUYING AND PAYMENT PATTERNS. OVERALL, THESE RESERVES REFLECT OUR BEST ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE ARE ENTITLED BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE NET SALES PRICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS PROBABLE NOT TO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN A FUTURE PERIOD. REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED IN PRIOR PERIODS WAS NOT MATERIAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED REBATES REASONABLY, WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL REBATE OR DISCOUNT THAT COULD BE EARNED. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE PROVIDE UPFRONT REBATE PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, WE CAPITALIZE THE REBATE PAYMENTS AND AMORTIZE THE RESULTING ASSET AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE USING A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT.

THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED REVENUE PROJECTIONS, GROWTH RATES, CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT RATES COULD RESULT IN DIFFERENT FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.  FUTURE EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LEVELS OF EXCESS FAIR VALUE OVER CARRYING VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  DECREASES IN ESTIMATED MARKET SIZES OR MARKET GROWTH RATES DUE TO GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED DECLINES IN PROCEDURAL VOLUMES, PRICING PRESSURES, PRODUCT ACTIONS AND/OR COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS,  \u2022  DECLINES IN OUR MARKET SHARE AND PENETRATION ASSUMPTIONS DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, AN INABILITY TO DEVELOP OR LAUNCH NEW AND NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES IN LINE WITH OUR COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGIES AND MARKET AND/OR REGULATORY CONDITIONS THAT MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LAUNCH DELAYS OR PRODUCT RECALLS,  \u2022  DECREASES IN OUR FORECASTED PROFITABILITY DUE TO AN INABILITY TO IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY AND ACHIEVE TIMELY AND SUSTAINABLE COST IMPROVEMENT MEASURES CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS,  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR REPORTING UNITS OR IN THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF FUTURE REORGANIZATIONS, ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES OF ASSETS OR BUSINESSES AND  \u2022  INCREASES IN OUR MARKET-PARTICIPANT RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASES IN OUR MARKET-PARTICIPANT TAX RATE AND/OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE HEREIN.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MAJOR SUPPLIER TO THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY AND HAVE THREE OPERATING SEGMENTS: (I) INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, WHOSE COMPANIES\u2019 REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT OF PROPRIETARY COMPONENTS, SUBSYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX ASSEMBLIES USING EXTERNAL DESIGNS; (II) AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, WHOSE COMPANIES SUPPLY COMMERCIAL, BUSINESS, REGIONAL, AND MILITARY MANUFACTURERS WITH LARGE METALLIC AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AND PRODUCE CLOSE-TOLERANCE PARTS PRIMARILY TO CUSTOMER DESIGNS AND MODEL-BASED DEFINITION, INCLUDING A WIDE RANGE OF ALUMINUM, HARD METAL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURE CAPABILITIES; AND (III) PRODUCT SUPPORT, WHOSE COMPANIES PROVIDE FULL LIFE CYCLE SOLUTIONS FOR COMMERCIAL, REGIONAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DIVESTED OF A NUMBER OF ITS ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, INCLUDING (I) SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH STRUCTURES - EAST TEXAS, INC. AND ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH STRUCTURES - LOS ANGELES, INC. AND TRIUMPH PROCESSING, INC. (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"LONG & LARGE\"), (II)  TRANSITIONING THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE BOMBARDIER GLOBAL 7500 (\"GLOBAL 7500\") WING PROGRAM MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES TO BOMBARDIER, (III)  SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH FABRICATIONS - SAN DIEGO, INC. AND TRIUMPH FABRICATIONS - FT. WORTH, INC. (TOGETHER, \"FABRICATIONS\"),  (IV) SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH STRUCTURES \u2013 KANSAS CITY, INC., TRIUMPH STRUCTURES \u2013 WICHITA, INC., TRIUMPH GEAR SYSTEMS \u2013 TORONTO, ULC AND TRIUMPH NORTHWEST (THE TRIUMPH GROUP OPERATIONS, INC.) (TOGETHER, \"MACHINING\"), AND (V) SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH AVIATION SERVICES - NAAS DIVISION, INC. (\"NAAS\").  COLLECTIVELY, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE \"FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES\".  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED COMBINED NET LOSSES OF  $235.3 MILLION  ASSOCIATED WITH THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN LOSS ON DIVESTITURES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NAAS, THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES ARE INCLUDED IN AEROSPACE STRUCTURES (\"FISCAL 2019 AEROSPACE STRUCTURES DIVESTITURES\") THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE DATES OF DIVESTITURE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR NAAS ARE INCLUDED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT THROUGH THE DATE OF DIVESTITURE.  SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , INCLUDE.  \u2022  NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  5.2%  TO  $3.36 BILLION.  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $274.7 MILLION.  \u2022  INCLUDED IN OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS LOSS ON DIVESTITURES OF  $235.3 MILLION  RELATED TO THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF  $31.1 MILLION.  \u2022  NET LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $321.8 MILLION.  \u2022  BACKLOG  DECREASED  16.7%  OVER THE PRIOR YEAR TO  $3.74 BILLION  DUE TO DIVESTITURES.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , NET SALES TOTALED  $3.36 BILLION  , A  5.2%  INCREASE  FROM FISCAL YEAR  2018  NET SALES OF  $3.20 BILLION  .  THE NET LOSS FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  DECREASED  24.4%  TO  $321.8 MILLION  , OR  $6.47  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, VERSUS THE NET LOSS OF  $425.4 MILLION  , OR  $8.60  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE GENERALLY FUNDED THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE  USED  $174.4 MILLION  OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES,  RECEIVED  $200.5 MILLION  FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND  RECEIVED  $32.5 MILLION  FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  WERE  $(288.9) MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED TO SEVERAL PLANS (WHICH WERE INITIATED IN FISCAL 2016) THAT INCORPORATED THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESSES AS WELL AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO REMAINING FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS TO BE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2020 AND THREE PENDING FACILITY CLOSURES TO BE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2021 OR 2022, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THESE PLANS. AS A RESULT, SINCE FISCAL 2016, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED ITS FOOTPRINT BY APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO DATE, WITH THE REDUCTION OF AN ADDITIONAL 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO BE UPON COMPLETION OF THE 747-8 CONTRACT, AND REDUCED HEADCOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY  2,500  EMPLOYEES.  OVER THE COURSE OF THESE COST-REDUCING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD RECORD AGGREGATE RELATED PRETAX CHARGES OF  $195.0 MILLION  TO  $210.0 MILLION  , WHICH REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS, CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY CLOSURE AND OTHER EXIT COSTS.  FOR THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017  , THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF  $31.1 MILLION  ,  $43.1 MILLION  AND  $53.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE PROGRAMS.  OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES GENERATE ANNUALIZED SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION PER YEAR ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS FROM FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION.  THESE SAVINGS RESULTED FROM OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS - 23%; AEROSPACE STRUCTURES - 72% AND PRODUCT SUPPORT - 5%.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SAVINGS WERE REINVESTED IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH OR TO OFFSET PRICE REDUCTIONS TO CUSTOMERS.  FROM FISCAL 2014 THROUGH FISCAL 2019, OUR AEROSPACE STRUCTURES BUSINESS UNIT HAD BEEN PERFORMING DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL MANUFACTURING ON SEVERAL NEW PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE GLOBAL 7500, THE EMBRAER SECOND GENERATION E-JET (\"E2-JETS\") AND MORE RECENTLY, THE GULFSTREAM G500/G600 PROGRAMS.  HISTORICALLY, LOW-RATE PRODUCTION COMMENCES DURING FLIGHT TESTING, FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASE TO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION, ASSUMING THAT SUCCESSFUL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION ARE ACHIEVED.  WHILE WORK PROGRESSED ON THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING ESTIMATED COST TARGETS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF ENGINEERING AND ESTIMATED RECURRING COSTS WHICH RESULTED IN FORWARD LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, FROM FISCAL 2015 TO FISCAL 2019, OUR AEROSPACE STRUCTURES BUSINESS UNIT EXPERIENCED OPERATING AND FORWARD LOSSES ON ITS PRODUCTION OF THE THE BOEING 747-8 FUSELAGE FOR BOEING, GULFSTREAM G280 WING FOR ISRAEL AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES, LTD (\"IAI\") AND GULFSTREAM G650 WING FOR GULFSTREAM.  FURTHER DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED BELOW REGARDING EACH PROGRAM'S IMPACT ON OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  GLOBAL 7500  THE INITIAL PROVISION FOR FORWARD LOSSES RECORDED IN FISCAL 2016 ON GLOBAL 7500 RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF COST RECOVERY UNCERTAINTY, HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED NONRECURRING COSTS AND INCREASED FORECASTED COSTS ON RECURRING PRODUCTION.  THE INCREASES IN COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING: CHANGING TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS, INCREASED SPENDING ON THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING PHASE OF THE PROGRAM AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING COST REDUCTION AND COST RECOVERY INITIATIVES WITH OUR CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIERS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2016, TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES, LLC, THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY THAT WAS PARTY TO THE GLOBAL 7500 CONTRACT WITH BOMBARDIER (\u201cTRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES\u201d), INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST BOMBARDIER IN THE QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT, DISTRICT OF MONTREAL.  THE LAWSUIT RELATED TO BOMBARDIER\u2019S FAILURE TO PAY TO TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES CERTAIN NONRECURRING EXPENSES INCURRED BY TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE OF A PROGRAM PURSUANT TO WHICH TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES AGREED TO DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SUPPLY THE WING AND RELATED COMPONENTS FOR BOMBARDIER\u2019S GLOBAL 7500 BUSINESS AIRCRAFT.  IN MAY 2017, TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES AND BOMBARDIER ENTERED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT RESOLVED ALL OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM, INCLUDING ALL PENDING LITIGATION, RELATED TO THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF WING COMPONENTS FOR BOMBARDIER\u2019S GLOBAL 7000 BUSINESS AIRCRAFT.  THE SETTLEMENT RESET THE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANIES AND ALLOWED EACH COMPANY TO BETTER ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE INCREASE IN COSTS ON THE COMPLETION OF THE FLIGHT TESTING AND ANTICIPATED ONGOING PRODUCTION COSTS THAT RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS CHARGES OF $60.4 MILLION.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE COMPANY TRANSITIONED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GLOBAL 7500 WING PROGRAM  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES TO BOMBARDIER AT WHICH POINT BOMBARDIER ASSUMED THE PROGRAM\u2019S ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS.  E2-JETS  UNDER OUR CONTRACT WITH EMBRAER, WE HAD THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO DESIGN, DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE CENTER FUSELAGE SECTION III, REAR FUSELAGE SECTION AND VARIOUS TAIL SECTION COMPONENTS (RUDDER AND ELEVATOR) FOR THE E2-JETS OVER THE INITIAL 600 SHIP SETS.  THE CONTRACT PROVIDED FOR FUNDING ON A FIXED AMOUNT OF NONRECURRING COSTS, TO BE PAID OVER A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF PRODUCTION UNITS.  HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SPENDING ON THE E2-JETS PROGRAM RESULTED IN A NEAR BREAK-EVEN ESTIMATED PROFIT MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WITH ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL FUTURE COST PRESSURES AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE.  RISKS RELATED TO ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING AS WELL AS THE RECURRING COST PROFILE REMAIN ON THIS PROGRAM.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGIES OF KOREA INC. (\"ASTK\") TO OPTIMIZE THE SUPPLY CHAIN UNDER OUR PORTION OF THE E2 PROGRAM. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ASTK WILL BUILD AND TRANSPORT FUSELAGE SHIPSETS TO EMBRAER AND ESTABLISH A FACILITY IN BRAZIL TO MANAGE STOCK AND REPAIRS LOCALLY.  AT THE TIME, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED ITS ROLE AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATOR ON THE PROGRAM.  IN APRIL 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO ASSIGN OUR CONTRACT WITH EMBRAER FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS FOR THEIR PROGRAM TO ASTK.  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL REMAIN A SUPPLIER TO ASTK FOR THE RUDDER AND ELEVATOR COMPONENTS.  WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO ASTK IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020.  G500/G600  WE ARE IN THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT STAGES FOR THE GULFSTREAM G500/G600 PROGRAMS, AS THESE AIRCRAFT ARE EXPECTED TO ENTER SERVICE IN FISCAL 2020. TRANSITION OF EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS FROM DEVELOPMENT TO RECURRING PRODUCTION LEVELS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF EACH PROGRAM AT ACHIEVING FLIGHT TESTING AND CERTIFICATION, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF THE OEM TO GENERATE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF AIRCRAFT SALES.  FURTHER COST INCREASES OR AN INABILITY TO MEET REVISED RECURRING COST FORECASTS ON THE G500/G600 PROGRAM MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS RESERVES IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHILE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUTURE COSTS COMPARED TO CURRENT ESTIMATES OR ADDITIONAL COST RECOVERY MAY RESULT IN FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS IF FORWARD LOSS RESERVES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED.  BOEING 747-8  AS DISCLOSED DURING FISCAL 2016, BOEING ANNOUNCED A RATE REDUCTION TO THE 747-8 PROGRAM, WHICH LOWERED PRODUCTION TO ONE PLANE EVERY TWO MONTHS.  THE IMPACT OF THE RATE REDUCTION RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016.  IN MARCH 2017, THE COMPANY SETTLED SEVERAL OUTSTANDING CHANGE ORDERS AND OPEN PRICING ON A NUMBER OF ITS PROGRAMS WITH BOEING.  THE AGREEMENT INCLUDED PRICING SETTLEMENTS, ADVANCED PAYMENTS, DELIVERY SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP ON FUTURE PROGRAMS.  THE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR CONTINUED BUILD AHEAD ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM THROUGH THE END OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM.  THIS PROGRAM HAS STABILIZED WITH NO ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSSES BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OR 2018 AND IS ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION BY MID-FISCAL 2021.  G280  WE ACQUIRED BOTH THE G280 AND G650 WING PROGRAMS IN FISCAL 2015 AND RECEIVED PROCEEDS FOR $160.0 MILLION AS BOTH CONTRACTS WERE OPERATING AT A LOSS. WHILE OPERATIONS HAVE IMPROVED ON THE G650 SINCE ACQUISITION AS NOTED FURTHER BELOW, THE COST PROFILE OF THE G280 WING PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO RESULT IN FORWARD LOSS CHARGES, INCLUDING $29.1 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  IN APRIL 2019, THE COMPANY AND IAI REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO TRANSITION THE MANUFACTURE OF THE G280 WING TO IAI. THE TWO COMPANIES HAVE  DEVELOPED DETAILED TRANSITION PLANS TO ENABLE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF WORK. OUR CONTRACT WITH IAI WILL TERMINATE UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRANSITION OF WORK. OUR FORWARD LOSS RECOGNIZED IN  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NOTED ABOVE INCLUDES THE COST TO TRANSITION,  WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED IN MID-FISCAL 2021.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  G650  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH GULFSTREAM TO OPTIMIZE THE SUPPLY CHAIN ON THE COMPANY'S G650 WORK SCOPE. THE G650 WING BOX AND WING COMPLETION WORK, WHICH HAD BEEN CO-PRODUCED ACROSS THREE FACILITIES AT BOTH COMPANIES, ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED INTO GULFSTREAM\u2019S FACILITIES IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ROLE AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATOR ON THE PROGRAM AND HAS SINCE RETURNED THIS CONTRACT TO MODEST PROFITABILITY.  ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS NOTED ABOVE INDIVIDUALLY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR NET REVENUES, THEY DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, TO MATERIALLY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IF FUTURE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES RESULT IN THE NEED FOR A FORWARD LOSS PROVISION. ABSENT ANY SUCH LOSS PROVISIONS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTE OUR FUTURE CONSOLIDATED MARGINS.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT IN ITS FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS OR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A REPORTING UNIT'S CARRYING VALUE MAY BE LESS THAN ITS FAIR VALUE.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO COMBINE THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRECISION COMPONENTS REPORTING SEGMENTS INTO ONE REPORTING SEGMENT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350-20-35-3C, THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD BE INDICATORS OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.  A CHANGE IN A COMPANY'S REPORTING UNIT STRUCTURE IS ONE OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHEN THIS DOES OCCUR, A COMPANY MUST PERFORM A \"BEFORE AND AFTER\" TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S ENHANCED VISIBILITY INTO ITS FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON ITS ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS WAS ALSO AN INDICATOR.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, IT PERFORMED THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WHICH INCLUDES USING A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT.  AFTER PERFORMING THE \"BEFORE\" PORTION OF THE TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FORMER PRECISION COMPONENTS' REPORTING UNIT HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT OF  $190.2 MILLION  .  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, OF  $190.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY THEN PERFORMED THE \"AFTER\" PORTION OF THE TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE NEW REPORTING UNIT OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES' GOODWILL HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED THE REMAINING GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT. FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OF  $345.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS (SEE NOTE 2 FOR DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE LEVELS).  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL RELATED TO THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED AS OF THE ANNUAL TESTING DATE.  WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2017, OF  $535.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE FOR THE VOUGHT TRADENAME SHOULD BE REDUCED FROM A USEFUL LIFE OF  20  YEARS TO A USEFUL LIFE OF  10  YEARS, AS IT BETTER REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  IN THE EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOUGHT TRADENAME, FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, WE SETTLED A STRIKE AND AGREED TO A NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR UNION EMPLOYEES WITH IAM DISTRICT 751 AT OUR SPOKANE, WASHINGTON FACILITY WHICH HAD EXPIRED DURING THE QUARTER, RESULTING IN A CHARGE OF $15.7 MILLION DUE TO DISRUPTION COSTS.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY RATIFIED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS UNION EMPLOYEES WITH UNITED AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA AND ITS LOCAL UNION 848 AT ITS RED OAK, TEXAS FACILITY.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RATIFIED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS UNION EMPLOYEES WITH UNITED AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA AND ITS LOCAL UNION 952 AT ITS TULSA, OKLAHOMA FACILITY.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE STUART, FLORIDA FACILITY PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES ELECTED THE UNITED  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL #2505, TO REPRESENT THEM IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH THE COMPANY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE UNION AND THE COMPANY WERE STILL ENGAGED IN INITIAL CONTRACT DISCUSSIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , NONE OF THE COMPANY'S COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED WORKFORCE ARE WORKING UNDER CONTRACTS THAT ARE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE WITHIN ONE YEAR.  UPON THE EXPIRATION OF A CONTRACT, WE MAY BECOME UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WITH A WORKFORCE, THEREFORE OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED AND WE MAY BE PREVENTED FROM COMPLETING PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS FROM THOSE FACILITIES, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.  CONTINGENCY PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT WOULD ALLOW PRODUCTION TO CONTINUE IN THE EVENT OF A STRIKE.  DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THE SHARES OF (I) TRIUMPH PROCESSING - EMBEE DIVISION, INC. (\"EMBEE\") AND (II) TRIUMPH STRUCTURES - LONG ISLAND (\"TS-LI\"), (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"FISCAL 2018 DIVESTITURES\") FOR TOTAL CASH PROCEEDS OF $74.5 MILLION AND A COMBINED LOSS OF $28.3 MILLION PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS LOSS ON DIVESTITURES AND IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EMBEE WERE INCLUDED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND THE OPERATING RESULTS OF TS-LI WERE INCLUDED IN AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH THEIR DATES OF DISPOSAL.  DURING FISCAL 2017, THE COMPANY SOLD (I) TRIUMPH AIR REPAIR, THE AUXILIARY POWER UNIT OVERHAUL OPERATIONS OF TRIUMPH AVIATIONS SERVICES - ASIA, LTD. AND TRIUMPH ENGINES - TEMPE (\"ENGINES AND APU\") AND (II) ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH AEROSPACE SYSTEMS-NEWPORT NEWS, INC.

THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ENGINES AND APU WERE INCLUDED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT AND THE OPERATING RESULTS TAS-NEWPORT NEWS WERE INCLUDED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH THEIR DATES OF DISPOSAL.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S DIVERSE STRUCTURE AND CUSTOMER BASE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR PRECISE COMPARISONS OF THE IMPACT OF PRICE AND VOLUME CHANGES TO OUR RESULTS.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCLOSED THE SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE PREPARE AND PUBLICLY RELEASE ANNUAL AUDITED AND QUARTERLY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  U.S. GAAP.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \"SEC\") RULES, WE ALSO DISCLOSE AND DISCUSS CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN OUR PUBLIC FILINGS AND EARNING RELEASES.  CURRENTLY, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE DISCLOSE ARE ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS OUR NET LOSS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, LOSS ON DIVESTITURES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP, WHICH IS ADJUSTED EBITDA, BEFORE PENSION EXPENSE OR BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CURTAILMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, AND OTHER EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES.  WE DISCLOSE ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ON A CONSOLIDATED AND A REPORTABLE SEGMENT BASIS IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASES, INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALLS AND FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE USE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  ALSO, IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY DISCLOSE DIFFERENT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ORDER TO HELP OUR INVESTORS MORE MEANINGFULLY EVALUATE AND COMPARE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WITH OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE VIEW ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP AS OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND, AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SUCH MEASURES IS NET LOSS.  IN CALCULATING ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP, WE EXCLUDE FROM NET LOSS THE FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE OUTLINED BELOW THE TYPE AND SCOPE OF THESE EXCLUSIONS AND THE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS A RESULT OF THESE EXCLUSIONS. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE NOT MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER U.S. GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET LOSS, OR AS AN INDICATOR OF ANY OTHER MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD NOT RELY ON ADJUSTED EBITDA OR ADJUSTED EBITDAP AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, INCLUDING NET LOSS.  IN ADDITION, WE URGE INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP TO NET LOSS SET FORTH BELOW, IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASES AND IN OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC AND TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND OUR ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K THAT ARE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASES, AND COMPARE THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITH OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND  ADJUSTED EBITDAP.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO INTERNALLY MEASURE OUR OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE AND BY INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS THAT, WHEN  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIEWED WITH OUR U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATION, WE BELIEVE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE CAPABILITIES, PARTIALLY THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES.  DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED ACQUISITIONS, OUR NET LOSS HAS INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CHARGES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP EXCLUDE THESE CHARGES AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, APART FROM CHARGES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WE BELIEVE THE DISCLOSURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP HELPS INVESTORS MEANINGFULLY EVALUATE AND COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  WE ALSO BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE MEASURES OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE ISOLATION OF NON-CASH CHARGES, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS, SUCH AS INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COST STRUCTURE AND, OVER TIME, HELPS TRACK OUR OPERATING PROGRESS.  IN ADDITION, INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND OTHERS HAVE REGULARLY RELIED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL MEASURES BY WHICH TO COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OUR NET INCOME TO CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP AND THE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS COMPARED WITH NET LOSS OR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  \u2022  GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURES MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE THEY REFLECT GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALE OF OPERATING UNITS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, WHEN APPLICABLE, MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REFLECTS GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES.

WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS (EXPENSES) NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE NON-CASH EARNINGS ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OFF-MARKET CONTRACTS ACQUIRED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE (INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS) MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED ATTRITION OF OUR ACQUIRED CUSTOMER BASE AND THE DIMINISHING VALUE OF PRODUCT RIGHTS AND LICENSES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CHARGES NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT USED IN OUR OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CHARGES NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.  \u2022  THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER WE INCUR MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER AND MAY RESULT IN CURRENT CASH INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE COMPONENT OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  \u2022  INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE TAXES WHICH MAY BE PAYABLE FOR THE PERIOD AND THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES DURING THE PERIOD AND MAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS OTHERWISE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE COMPONENT OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED LIMITATIONS OF USING NON-GAAP MEASURES ONLY TO SUPPLEMENT OUR U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP RECONCILED TO OUR NET LOSS FOR THE INDICATED PERIODS (IN THOUSANDS).

THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS $36.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, REFLECTING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 7.9%.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERATED FROM THE CURRENT YEAR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017, AND INCREASE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE  WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, AND PRODUCT SUPPORT.  THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\"CODM\") UTILIZES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PRIMARY MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SEGMENTS AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES.  THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AMONG OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, VARY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN COMPETITORS, CUSTOMERS, EXTENT OF PROPRIETARY DELIVERABLES AND PERFORMANCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDES PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND/OR ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE BECOME THE PRIMARY SOURCE OR ONE OF A FEW PRIMARY SOURCES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR UNIQUE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES COMMAND A HIGHER MARGIN.  ALSO OEMS ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSING ON ASSEMBLY ACTIVITIES WHILE OUTSOURCING MORE MANUFACTURING AND REPAIR TO THIRD PARTIES, AND AS A RESULT, ARE LESS OF A COMPETITIVE FORCE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  THIS COMPARES TO AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDES LONG-TERM SOLE-SOURCE OR PREFERRED SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR OUR BUSINESS AND POSITIONS US WELL FOR FUTURE GROWTH ON NEW PROGRAMS AND NEW DERIVATIVES.    IN CONTRAST, PRODUCT SUPPORT PROVIDES MRO SERVICES ON COMPONENTS AND ACCESSORIES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES, WITH MORE DIVERSE COMPETITION, INCLUDING AIRLINES, OEMS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.  IN ADDITION, VARIABILITY IN THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF CUSTOMER REQUESTS PERFORMED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT CAN PROVIDE FOR GREATER VOLATILITY AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN REVENUE AND EARNINGS THAN THAT EXPERIENCED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AND AEROSPACE STRUCTURES SEGMENTS.  INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CONSISTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS THAT PROVIDE INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT OF PROPRIETARY COMPONENTS, SUBSYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX ASSEMBLIES USING EXTERNAL DESIGNS.

ON  MARCH 31, 2019  , AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $215.0 MILLION  IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND APPROXIMATELY  $30.8 MILLION  IN LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, ALL OF WHICH WERE ACCRUING INTEREST AT LIBOR PLUS APPLICABLE BASIS POINTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 6.00% PER ANNUM.  AMOUNTS REPAID UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE REBORROWED.  IN JULY 2018, THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARY CO-BORROWERS AND GUARANTORS ENTERED INTO A TENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTENTH AMENDMENT\u201d AND THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AS AMENDED BY THE TENTH AMENDMENT, THE \"CREDIT AGREEMENT\") AND WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TENTH AMENDMENT MODIFIES CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER TERMS AND LOWERED THE CAPACITY TO  $700.0 MILLION  UPON THE EARLIER OF COMPLETION OF CERTAIN ASSET SALES OR MARCH 31, 2019.  THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 RESULTED IN THIS REDUCTION OCCURRING AS OF MARCH 8, 2019.  PURSUANT TO ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, ADDITIONAL EXCESS PROCEEDS MUST BE REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS OR USED TO FURTHER PERMANENTLY REDUCE OUTSTANDING DEBT WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS OF ASSET SALE.  THE TENTH AMENDMENT ALSO ADDS AN ADDITIONAL MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISION REQUIRING THAT THE COMPANY PREPAY THE OUTSTANDING REVOLVING CREDIT LOANS AS SET FORTH IN THE TENTH AMENDMENT.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE TENTH AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY INCURRED  $1.7 MILLION  OF FINANCING COSTS. THESE COSTS, ALONG WITH THE  $9.0 MILLION  OF UNAMORTIZED FINANCING COSTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE NINTH AMENDMENT, ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE CAPACITY OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF UNAMORTIZED FINANCING FEES EXISTING PRIOR TO THE TENTH AMENDMENT.  IN JULY 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NINTH AMENDMENT TO THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) PERMIT THE COMPANY TO INCUR HIGH YIELD INDEBTEDNESS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO  $500.0 MILLION  , SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S OBLIGATIONS TO APPLY THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING TO REPAY THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOANS IN FULL, (II) LIMIT THE MANDATORY PREPAYMENT PROVISIONS TO ELIMINATE THE REQUIREMENT THAT NET PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INCURRENCE OF PERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), INCLUDING THE HIGH YIELD INDEBTEDNESS, BE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS ONCE THE REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO  $800.0 MILLION  , (III) AMEND CERTAIN COVENANTS AND OTHER TERMS AND (IV) MODIFY THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE AND LETTER OF CREDIT PRICING TIERS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE NINTH AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY INCURRED  $0.6 MILLION  OF FINANCING COSTS.  THESE COSTS, ALONG WITH THE  $13.2 MILLION  OF UNAMORTIZED FINANCING COSTS SUBSEQUENT TO THE AMENDMENT, ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE CAPACITY OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WROTE-OFF A PROPORTIONAL AMOUNT OF UNAMORTIZED FINANCING FEES PRIOR TO THE AMENDMENT.  IN MAY 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN EIGHTH AMENDMENT TO THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AMONG THE COMPANY AND ITS LENDERS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) ELIMINATE THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT, (II) INCREASE THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANT APPLICABLE TO EACH FISCAL QUARTER, COMMENCING WITH THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, AND TO REVISE THE STEP-DOWNS APPLICABLE TO SUCH FINANCIAL COVENANT, (III) REDUCE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT TO  $850.0 MILLION  FROM  $1,000.0 MILLION  , (IV) MODIFY THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOANS SO THAT ALL OF THE TERM LOANS WILL MATURE ON MARCH 31, 2019, AND (V) ESTABLISH A NEW HIGHER PRICING TIER FOR THE INTEREST RATE, COMMITMENT FEE AND LETTER OF CREDIT FEE PRICING PROVISIONS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON MARCH 28, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AGREEMENT (\"RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT\") TO SELL CERTAIN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES TO A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WITHOUT RECOURSE.  THE COMPANY WAS THE SERVICER OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE UNDER THE RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT. INTEREST RATES ARE BASED ON LIBOR PLUS  0.65%  -  0.70%  .  AS OF MARCH 31, 2017, THE COMPANY SOLD  $78.0 MILLION  , WORTH OF ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO CAPACITY UNDER THE RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO SELL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  THE LEVEL OF UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY VARIES FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING IN PART UPON ITS COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS SET FORTH IN THE RELATED AGREEMENT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CERTAIN AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON SPECIFIED LEVELS OF INDEBTEDNESS TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND INTEREST COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS, AND INCLUDES LIMITATIONS ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIENS, MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, SALES OF ASSETS, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND INCURRENCE OF DEBT.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SUCH COVENANTS.  IN NOVEMBER 2017, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY (THE \"SECURITIZATION FACILITY\"), DECREASING THE PURCHASE LIMIT FROM  $225.0 MILLION  TO  $125.0 MILLION  AND EXTENDING THE TERM THROUGH NOVEMBER 2020.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE COMPANY ISSUED $500.0 MILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 7.750% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (THE \"2025 NOTES\").  THE 2025 NOTES WERE SOLD AT 100% OF PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST YIELD OF 7.750%.  INTEREST ON THE 2025 NOTES ACCRUES AT THE RATE OF 7.750% PER ANNUM AND IS PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY IN CASH IN ARREARS ON FEBRUARY 15 AND AUGUST 15 OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING ON FEBRUARY 15, 2018.  WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS TO PAYOFF THE TERM LOAN AND TO REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE REVOLVER. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2025 NOTES, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY  $8.8 MILLION  OF COSTS, WHICH WERE DEFERRED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES.  IN JUNE 2014, THE COMPANY ISSUED THE 2022 NOTES FOR $300.0 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.  THE 2022 NOTES WERE SOLD AT 100% OF PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND HAVE AN EFFECTIVE YIELD OF 5.25%.  INTEREST ON THE 2022 NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY IN CASH IN ARREARS ON JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR.  WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS TO REDEEM THE 2018 NOTES AND PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2022 NOTES, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION OF COSTS, WHICH WERE DEFERRED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES.  IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE COMPANY ISSUED THE 2021 NOTES FOR $375.0 MILLION IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.  THE 2021 NOTES WERE SOLD AT 100% OF PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AND HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST YIELD OF 4.875%.  INTEREST ON THE 2021 NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMIANNUALLY IN CASH IN ARREARS ON APRIL 1 AND OCTOBER 1 OF EACH YEAR.  WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS TO REPAY BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND PAY RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2021 NOTES, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $6.3 MILLION OF COSTS, WHICH WERE DEFERRED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT, SEE NOTE 10 OF \"NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\"  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE HAD A NET CASH OUTFLOW OF $288.9 MILLION FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AN DECREASE OF $570.4 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET CASH INFLOW OF $281.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017. DURING FISCAL 2018, THE NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS ($873.1 MILLION), OFFSET BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES DRIVEN BY DECREASED PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS, AND NET SPENDING ON THE G280 AND G650 PROGRAMS ($407.2 MILLION).  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INVENTORY FOR NEW PROGRAMS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. DURING FISCAL 2018, EXPENDITURES FOR INVENTORY COSTS ON NEW PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING PROGRESS PAYMENTS, INCLUDING THE BOMBARDIER GLOBAL 7000/8000 AND THE EMBRAER E-JET PROGRAMS, WERE $384.9 MILLION AND $35.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, INVENTORY FOR MATURE PROGRAMS DECLINED DUE TO DECREASED PRODUCTION RATES AND THE UTILIZATION OF BUILD AHEAD INVENTORY, BY APPROXIMATELY $144.4 MILLION. UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS NETTED AGAINST INVENTORY INCREASED $162.5 MILLION DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND RESOLUTION OF OPEN ASSERTIONS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, INCREASED $3.9 MILLION FROM THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, INCLUDED CASH FROM THE DIVESTITURES OF TS-LI AND EMBEE OF $83.1 MILLION OFFSET BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $42.1 MILLION. CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, INCLUDED CASH FROM THE DIVESTITURES OF TAS - NEWPORT NEWS AND ENGINES AND APU OF $86.2 MILLION, OFFSET BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $51.8 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $47.1 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  WE FUNDED THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $50.0 MILLION  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO $60.0 MILLION FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020.  THE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED MAINLY TO EXPAND CAPACITY OR REPLACE OLD EQUIPMENT AT SEVERAL FACILITIES.  OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS FOR LONG-TERM DEBT, LEASES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE ABOVE TABLE EXCLUDES UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF  $19.4 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , SINCE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY THE TIMING OF CASH SETTLEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING AUTHORITIES.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS DETAILED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, WE ALSO HAD OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO OUR BENEFIT PLANS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS DETAILED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE FUNDED IN ADVANCE, SO BENEFIT PAYMENTS ARE PAID AS THEY ARE INCURRED.

WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS FOR THE AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  LOANS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, BY REFERENCE TO A BASE RATE OR A RATE BASED ON LIBOR, IN EITHER CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN DETERMINED QUARTERLY BASED ON THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY) AS OF THE LAST DAY OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY COMMITMENT FEE ON THE AVERAGE DAILY UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR EACH FISCAL QUARTER AND FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  ALL OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND COVENANTS CUSTOMARY FOR FINANCINGS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, A CERTAIN MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND MAXIMUM SENIOR LEVERAGE RATIO (IN EACH CASE AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. BELOW ARE THOSE POLICIES APPLIED IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE THE MOST DEPENDENT ON THE APPLICATION OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 2 OF \"NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\"  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE PRESENTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, SUCH AS INDUSTRY TRENDS, OUR CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CREDIT STANDING, AND PAYMENT AND DEFAULT HISTORY. THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED ALLOWANCE REQUIRES A JUDGMENT AS TO THE IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT RESULTED IN MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS WHEN THE ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED TO ACTUAL AMOUNTS.  INVENTORIES  THE COMPANY RECORDS INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST (AVERAGE-COST OR SPECIFIC-IDENTIFICATION METHODS) OR MARKET.  THE COMPANY EXPENSES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED ESSENTIALLY UNDER COMMERCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS INCURRED.  THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE COSTS OF INVENTORIES BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT OR AVERAGE COST METHODS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09, WORK-IN-PROCESS INVENTORY WAS CAPITALIZED AS PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09 CHANGES THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING FOR THESE PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT BALANCES  THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS PRINCIPALLY FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, AND SUPPORT SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC CUSTOMER PROGRAMS.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY ENTERS INTO LONG-TERM MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENTS THAT ESTABLISH GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND MAY DEFINE SPECIFIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.  MANY AGREEMENTS INCLUDE CLAUSES THAT PROVIDE SOLE SUPPLIER STATUS TO THE COMPANY FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM\u2019S LIFE.  PURCHASE ORDERS (OR AUTHORIZATIONS TO PROCEED) ARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS INCLUDE OPTIONS FOR FUTURE PURCHASES.  SUCH OPTIONS PRIMARILY REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT OF ISSUING SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE ORDERS AND DO NOT REPRESENT MATERIAL RIGHTS GRANTED TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH ITS CUSTOMERS AND IS THE PRINCIPAL IN ALL CURRENT CONTRACTS.  THE IDENTIFICATION OF A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIRES AN EVALUATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRESENTLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS EXIST.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN MAKING THIS EVALUATION THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE OF THE BUSINESS EXCHANGE, THE SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THE PROMISED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AS WELL AS THE NATURE AND EXECUTION OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S ORDERING PROCESS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM WORK.  GENERALLY, PRESENTLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT CREATED UNTIL A PURCHASE ORDER IS ISSUED BY A CUSTOMER FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF UNITS OF PRODUCT OR SERVICES.  THEREFORE, THE ISSUANCE OF A PURCHASE ORDER IS GENERALLY THE POINT AT WHICH A CONTRACT IS IDENTIFIED FOR ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.  MANAGEMENT IDENTIFIES THE PROMISES TO THE CUSTOMER.  PROMISES ARE GENERALLY EXPLICITLY STATED IN EACH CONTRACT, BUT MANAGEMENTS ALSO EVALUATES WHETHER ANY PROMISES ARE IMPLIED BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, PAST BUSINESS PRACTICE, OR OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  EACH PROMISE IS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF IT IS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER A PROMISE IS CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, INCLUDING WHETHER THE CUSTOMER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE GOOD OR SERVICE ON ITS OWN OR TOGETHER WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER, WHETHER THE COMPANY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT SERVICE OF INTEGRATING GOODS OR SERVICES TO DELIVER A COMBINED OUTPUT TO THE CUSTOMER, OR WHETHER THE GOODS OR SERVICES ARE HIGHLY INTERDEPENDENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF A WIDE RANGE OF ENGINEERING DESIGN SERVICES AND MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS SPARE PARTS AND REPAIRS FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS).  THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A CONTRACT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FOR FULLY SATISFYING THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT.  TYPICALLY, THE TRANSACTION PRICE CONSISTS SOLELY OF FIXED CONSIDERATION BUT MAY INCLUDE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS SUCH AS UNPRICED CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS, COST-SHARING PROVISIONS, AND OTHER RECEIPTS OR PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, TYPICALLY AT THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FROM ITS CUSTOMERS.  VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS ONLY INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE CONTRACT WILL NOT OCCUR, OR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RESOLVED.  THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT UNDER NORMAL COMMERCIAL TERMS AFTER DELIVERY WITH PAYMENT TYPICALLY REQUIRED WITHIN 30 TO 120 DAYS OF DELIVERY.  HOWEVER, A SUBSET OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENTS BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE TRANSFER OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER CONTRACT ARE AT THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 DISCRETION.  FOR THESE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY IS NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTING SALES TAX AND HAS MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EXCLUDE FROM THE TRANSACTION PRICE ANY SALES AND OTHER SIMILAR TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS.  AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A NET BASIS.  THE TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THE IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS USING THE RELATIVE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ALLOCATION IS TO REFLECT THE CONSIDERATION THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE IS THE PRICE AT WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD SELL A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE SEPARATELY TO A CUSTOMER.  STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES ARE ESTABLISHED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICE ARE ALLOCATED ON THE SAME BASIS AS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION.  WHEN STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE NOT OBSERVABLE, THE COMPANY USES EITHER THE \u201cEXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN\u201d OR \"ADJUSTED MARKET ASSESSMENT\" APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE.  EXPECTED COSTS ARE TYPICALLY DERIVED FROM THE AVAILABLE PERIODIC FORECAST INFORMATION.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TRANSFERS TO A CUSTOMER AND IS RECOGNIZED AT THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFERRED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  SERVICE SALES, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING REPAIR, MAINTENANCE, AND ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. SALES UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME ARE RECOGNIZED USING EITHER AN INPUT OR OUTPUT METHOD.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE OVER TIME AS IT PERFORMS ON THESE CONTRACTS BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER AS REPRESENTED BY CONTRACTUAL TERMS THAT ENTITLE THE COMPANY TO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT FOR WORK PERFORMED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO ALTERNATE USE OR FOR WORK PERFORMED ON A CUSTOMER-OWNED ASSET.  WITH CONTROL TRANSFERRING OVER TIME, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY USES THE COST-TO-COST INPUT METHOD OF PROGRESS FOR OUR CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER THAT OCCURS AS WORK PROGRESSES.  UNDER THE COST-TO-COST METHOD, THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS AT COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS COST ESTIMATES ON SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS ON A PERIODIC BASIS, OR WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND WARRANT A MODIFICATION TO A PREVIOUS ESTIMATE.  COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.  REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY MONITORED AND REVISED BASED ON CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES.  IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS, WHICH RECOGNIZES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGES ON CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS BASED ON A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\u2019S PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION. FORWARD LOSS RESERVES FOR ANTICIPATED LOSSES ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN FULL WHEN SUCH LOSSES BECOME EVIDENT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED, AND ARE INCLUDED IN CONTRACT LIABILITIES ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN CONTRACT VALUES AND ESTIMATED COSTS THAT AROSE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR INCREASED NET SALES,  DECREASED  OPERATING LOSS, NET LOSS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $7.9 MILLION  ,  $(68.7) MILLION  ,  $(68.7) MILLION  AND  $(1.38)  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $46.1 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $114.8 MILLION  .  THESE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE A NON-CASH CHARGE THE COMPANY RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07 OF  $87.2 MILLION  DUE TO A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE FROM A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN COST OF SALES.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES  DECREASED  OPERATING LOSS, NET LOSS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $19.7 MILLION  ,  $13.5 MILLION  AND  $0.27  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.8 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $66.2 MILLION.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES  DECREASED  OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $57.2 MILLION  ,  $52.6 MILLION  AND  $1.07  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $163.3 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $106.1 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDES A REDUCTION TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FORWARD LOSSES OF  $131.4 MILLION  FOR THE 747-8 PROGRAM.  REVENUES FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED OVER TIME ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER.  FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE POINT IN TIME WHEN THE CUSTOMER CAN DIRECT THE USE OF AND OBTAIN THE BENEFITS FROM THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  GENERALLY, THE SHIPPING TERMS DETERMINE THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL TRANSFERS TO CUSTOMERS.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES AS INCURRED.  DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACTUAL BILLING AND PAYMENT TERMS RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  REFER TO NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  THE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS OTHER THAN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS PERTAINS TO THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR PURCHASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") 350,  INTANGIBLES\u2014GOODWILL AND OTHER  .  UNDER ASC 350, PURCHASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED; RATHER, THEY ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES.  UPON ACQUISITION, CRITICAL ESTIMATES ARE MADE IN VALUING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, CUSTOMER LISTS, AND ESTIMATING CASH FLOWS FROM PROJECTS WHEN COMPLETED; TRADENAME AND MARKET POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE; AND DISCOUNT RATES.  MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT ARE ALSO ITS REPORTING UNITS.  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\"CODM\").  THE COMPANY'S CODM EVALUATES PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES BASED UPON REVIEW OF SEGMENT INFORMATION. EACH OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS IS COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF OPERATING UNITS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMPONENTS.  THE COMPONENTS, FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXISTS, ARE AGGREGATED FOR PURPOSES OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING INTO THREE REPORTING UNITS.  THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION STRATEGY IS TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES THAT COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE COMPANY. EACH ACQUISITION IS ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS REPORTING UNIT, THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT OR THE PRODUCT SUPPORT REPORTING UNIT.  THE GOODWILL THAT RESULTS FROM EACH ACQUISITION IS ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT TO WHICH THE ACQUISITION IS ALLOCATED, BECAUSE IT IS THAT REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYNERGIES OF THE ACQUISITION.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS USING BOTH THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS.  THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INVOLVES DETERMINING WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST THAT INDICATE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL.  IF BASED ON THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT OR IF THE COMPANY ELECTS NOT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED AS REQUIRED BY ASC 350 TO DETERMINE WHETHER A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS AT THE REPORTING UNIT.  THE QUANTITATIVE TEST IS USED TO COMPARE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE, NO FURTHER EVALUATION IS REQUIRED AND NO IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED.  IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURS.  THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY USING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE NOT TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF RECORDED GOODWILL.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS BASED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BEING VALUED.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND RECORD ANY RESULTING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AT LEAST ANNUALLY.  CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THESE ESTIMATES AND REQUIRE INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS.  WHEN PERFORMING THE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY INCLUDES THE USE OF AN INCOME APPROACH WHICH DISCOUNTS FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE AT A RATE THAT REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S COST OF CAPITAL, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD (\"DCF\").  THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESSES.  FACTORS AFFECTING THESE FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE THE CONTINUED MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THE BUSINESSES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY THE BUSINESSES AND THE UNDERLYING COST OF DEVELOPMENT, THE FUTURE COST STRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESSES, AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES.  THE COMPANY ALSO INCORPORATES MARKET MULTIPLES FOR COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS.  ANY SUCH IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN FULL IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT IN ITS FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS OR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A REPORTING UNIT'S CARRYING VALUE MAY BE LESS THAN ITS FAIR VALUE.  NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, AS REQUIRED BY ASC 350-20-35-3C, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DECISION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, TO COMBINE THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRECISION COMPONENTS REPORTING SEGMENTS INTO ONE REPORTING SEGMENT.  AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WHICH INCLUDED USING A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT.   AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OF  $190.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN IMPAIRMENT TEST OF THE NEW REPORTING UNIT OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURE AND RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT OF  $345.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM SUSTAINED PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS AND SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE ASSESSMENT FOR THE COMPANY'S INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REPORTING UNITS INDICATED THAT THEIR FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL.  THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL RELATED TO THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED AS OF THE ANNUAL TESTING DATE.  THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED THE REMAINING GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2017, OF  $266.3 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM  7  TO  30  YEARS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MAY WARRANT REVISION OR THAT THE REMAINING BALANCE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  WHEN FACTORS INDICATE THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT, AN ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IS USED TO MEASURE RECOVERABILITY BASED ON THE PRIMARY ASSET OF THE ASSET GROUP.  SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS INCLUDE THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE WAY THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS, NEGATIVE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED, AND NEGATIVE INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.  IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT, MEASUREMENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WILL BE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP, GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE ASSET.  ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET  IN CONNECTION WITH SEVERAL OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, WE ASSUMED EXISTING LONG-TERM CONTRACTS.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THESE CONTRACTS, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS TO BE EITHER MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN COULD BE REALIZED IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AS OF THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION.  AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE OF EACH RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THE EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS HAD THE CONTRACTS BEEN EXECUTED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  THE LIABILITIES PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS THAT WERE INITIALLY EXECUTED AT SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION (SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  THE ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET, ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS NON-CASH REVENUES OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACTS.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET AMORTIZATION OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $67.3 MILLION  ,  $125.1 MILLION  AND  $121.0 MILLION  IN THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017  , RESPECTIVELY, AND SUCH AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN REVENUES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE BALANCE OF THE LIABILITY AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , IS APPROXIMATELY  $184.6 MILLION  AND, BASED ON THE EXPECTED DELIVERY SCHEDULE OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF THE LIABILITY AS FOLLOWS  2020  \u2014  $68.5 MILLION  ;  2021  \u2014  $64.6 MILLION  ;  2022  \u2014  $23.7 MILLION  ;  2023  \u2014  $6.8 MILLION  ;  2024  \u2014  $7.5 MILLION  ;  THEREAFTER  \u2014  $13.4 MILLION.  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  THE LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN AND RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS.  THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE THESE COSTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY OR WHEN A RE-MEASUREMENT IS NECESSARY.  ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES, AFTER CONSULTING WITH OUTSIDE INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND ACTUARIES, AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST OF ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS BY USING THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO DISCOUNT THE CASH FLOWS REFLECTED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS APPROACH PROVIDES A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS DUE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS TO THE CORRESPONDING SPOT YIELD CURVE RATES.  THE COMPANY AMORTIZES ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES OVER THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF INACTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE ALMOST ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE INACTIVE.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE ACCOUNTING CORRIDOR IS A DEFINED RANGE WITHIN WHICH AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS NOT REQUIRED.  THE DISCOUNT RATES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , RANGED FROM  2.54 - 3.88%  COMPARED WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF  2.65 - 4.01%  AT  MARCH 31, 2018.  THE ASSUMED EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE OF EARNINGS EXPECTED ON THE FUNDS INVESTED OR TO BE INVESTED TO PROVIDE FOR THE BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (\"PBO\").  THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IS BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL HISTORICAL MARKET INDEX RETURNS, ANTICIPATED LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE RELATED INVESTMENT STRATEGY, PLAN EXPENSES AND THE POTENTIAL TO OUTPERFORM MARKET INDEX RETURNS.  THIS RATE IS UTILIZED PRINCIPALLY IN CALCULATING THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENT OF THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE.  TO THE EXTENT THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS REALIZED OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR DIFFERS FROM THE ASSUMED RATE, THAT YEAR'S ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE IS NOT AFFECTED.  THE GAIN OR LOSS REDUCES OR INCREASES FUTURE PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE EXPECTANCY OF INACTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS.  THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , WAS  5.00 - 8.00%  .  THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR FISCAL  2020  WILL BE  5.00 - 8.00%.  IN ADDITION TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SOME RETIRED EMPLOYEES.  SUCH BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  EMPLOYEES ACHIEVE ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE CONTRIBUTORY PLANS UPON RETIREMENT FROM ACTIVE SERVICE IF THEY MEET SPECIFIED AGE AND YEARS OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.  ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES MUST BE MADE AT THE DATE OF RETIREMENT.  QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS AT THE DATE OF RETIREMENT ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE.  CURRENT PLAN DOCUMENTS RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO AMEND OR TERMINATE THE PLANS AT ANY TIME, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO VARIOUS GROUPS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS.  PREMIUMS CHARGED TO MOST RETIREES FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE PRIOR TO AGE 65 ARE BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND ARE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY FOR CHANGES IN THE COST OF THE PLANS AS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT ACTUARY. IN ADDITION TO THIS MEDICAL INFLATION COST-SHARING FEATURE, THE PLANS ALSO HAVE PROVISIONS FOR DEDUCTIBLES, CO-PAYMENTS, COINSURANCE PERCENTAGES, OUT-OF-POCKET LIMITS, SCHEDULES OF REASONABLE FEES, PREFERRED PROVIDER NETWORKS, COORDINATION OF BENEFITS WITH OTHER PLANS, AND A MEDICARE CARVE-OUT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 715,  COMPENSATION\u2014RETIREMENT BENEFITS  , WE RECOGNIZED THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR BENEFIT OBLIGATION.  THIS FUNDED STATUS IS REMEASURED AS OF OUR ANNUAL REMEASUREMENT DATE.  THE FUNDED STATUS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN'S ASSETS AND THE PBO OR ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE PLAN. IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDED STATUS, WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR PLAN ASSETS ARE PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE VALUED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE AS OF THE DATE OF REMEASUREMENT.  INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE VALUED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF DATA FROM FUND MANAGERS AND COMPARABLE MARKET DATA.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCES EVENTS OR MAKES CHANGES TO ITS BENEFIT PLANS THAT RESULT IN CURTAILMENT OR SPECIAL CHARGES. CURTAILMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN EVENTS OCCUR THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPECTED YEARS OF FUTURE SERVICE OF PRESENT EMPLOYEES OR ELIMINATES THE BENEFITS FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR SOME OR ALL OF THEIR FUTURE SERVICE.  CURTAILMENT LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE CURTAILMENT WILL OCCUR AND THE EFFECTS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. CURTAILMENT GAINS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RELATED EMPLOYEES ARE TERMINATED OR A PLAN AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE.  AS REQUIRED UNDER ASC 715, THE COMPANY REMEASURES PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD WHENEVER A SIGNIFICANT EVENT OCCURS THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST.  THE DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE IS BASED ON JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERATION OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IMPACTING THE PENSION COSTS.  SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE KEY EVENTS THAT AFFECTED OUR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AND OBLIGATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017.  PENSION INCOME, EXCLUDING CURTAILMENTS, SETTLEMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS (EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES) FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WAS  $51.5 MILLION  COMPARED WITH PENSION INCOME OF  $61.6 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , AND  $66.5 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  .  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31,  2020  , THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE PENSION INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $44.2 MILLION.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT \u2014 REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  (\u201cASU 2018-02\u201d).  THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2018-02 ALLOWS AN ENTITY TO ELECT TO RECLASSIFY THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cACT\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO RETAINED EARNINGS. ASU 2018-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  WE ADOPTED ASU 2018-02 EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2019, AND HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RECLASSIFY ANY AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO ACCUMULATED DEFICIT.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  (\"ASC 842\"), WHICH REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET FOR MOST LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS FOR BOTH LESSEES AND LESSORS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS.  THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WHICH MAKES THE NEW STANDARD EFFECTIVE FOR US ON APRIL 1, 2019.  THE COMPANY MAY APPLY THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF ASU 2016-02, AS AMENDED, EITHER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED IN OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020 FORM 10-K, WHICH WOULD BE APRIL 1, 2018, OR ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION, WHICH WOULD BE APRIL 1, 2019.  AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS REQUIRE THE LESSEE TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LIABILITY FOR MOST EXISTING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ON THE DATE THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS ARE APPLIED.  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON APRIL 1, 2019.  THEREFORE, PERIODS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED USING CURRENT GAAP.  THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED THE KEY TERMS OF ALL OF ITS ACTIVE LEASES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AND HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED THE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS TO COMPLY WITH THE ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 842.  THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING CONTROLS TO COMPLY WITH THE PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 842 AND WILL COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD BY APPLYING THE \"PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\" PROVIDED BY ASC 842 AND DID NOT ELECT TO APPLY THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PERTAINING TO THE USE OF HINDSIGHT.  THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER ASC 842, INCLUDING (I) THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ALL LEASES THAT QUALIFY, MEANING THAT FOR THESE LEASES, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE RIGHT-OF-USE (\"ROU\") ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND (II) THE ELECTION TO USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF ASSETS, MEANING THAT FOR THESE LEASES, THE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE ROU ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY BALANCES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OPERATING LEASES IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.0 MILLION  TO  $95.0 MILLION  , FOR WHICH THE MAJORITY PERTAIN TO REAL ESTATE LEASES.  RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS WILL ALSO BE RECOGNIZED WITH A BALANCE COMPARABLE TO THE LEASE LIABILITIES, ADJUSTED FOR PREPAID AND DEFERRED RENT BALANCES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE.  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10, THE COMPANY HAS A CAPITAL LEASE LIABILITY OF  $31.3 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS TO BE MATERIAL.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASU 2014-09\"). SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB ISSUED SEVERAL UPDATES TO ASU 2014-09, WHICH ARE CODIFIED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 606.  ASC 606 ALSO INCLUDES NEW GUIDANCE ON COSTS RELATED TO A CONTRACT, WHICH IS CODIFIED IN ASC SUBTOPIC 340-40,  OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED COSTS - CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU 2017-07 ON APRIL 1, 2018, AND THE REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT BALANCES ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS STANDARD.  REFER TO NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715).  IMPROVING THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST  (\"ASU 2017-07\").  ASU 2017-07 REQUIRES ENTITIES TO REPORT THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IN THE SAME LINE ITEM OR ITEMS AS OTHER COMPENSATION COSTS ARISING FROM SERVICES RENDERED BY THE PERTINENT EMPLOYEES DURING THE PERIOD. FURTHER, ASU 2017-07 REQUIRES THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TO BE PRESENTED ON THE INCOME STATEMENT SEPARATELY FROM THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT AND OUTSIDE A SUBTOTAL OF INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, IF ONE IS PRESENTED. ADDITIONALLY, ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION, WHEN APPLICABLE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU 2017-07 ON APRIL 1, 2018.  REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-12,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING  (\"ASU 2017-12\"), WHICH INTENDS TO IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY ACCOUNTING RULES AROUND HEDGE ACCOUNTING. ASU 2017-12 REFINES AND EXPANDS HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH FINANCIAL (I.E., INTEREST RATE) AND COMMODITY RISKS. IN ADDITION, IT CREATES MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW ECONOMIC RESULTS ARE PRESENTED, BOTH ON THE FACE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN THE  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOOTNOTES. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON APRIL 1, 2018.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN MAY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): SCOPE OF MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING  (\"ASU 2017-09\"), WHICH PROVIDES CLARITY ON DETERMINING WHICH CHANGES TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS REQUIRE AN ENTITY TO APPLY MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC 718. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017.  THE AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO AN AWARD MODIFIED ON OR AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON APRIL 1, 2018.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-09 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "TRIUMPH GROUP INC", "CIK": 1021162, "Date": "2019-05-23T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TGI", "Name": "Triumph Group Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3720.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 510347963.0, "key": "20190523TGI", "labelr1": 1.1057692307692328, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -0.6657156443176442, "labelr4": -2.20201053135472, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.87410027, "prof1": 0.12589979, "return1&2": 0.9889423076923076, "return1&2&3": 0.9955258513478914, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0174474354369307, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9889423076923076, "return3": 1.0066571564431763, "return4": 1.0220201053135471, "4_day_return": -1.7788461538461475, "cumulative_return1": 0.0744965518329478, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0015847875739846925, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.6639550786860385e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0395500545817464e-07, "indexx": 2374, "cumreturn1b": 0.9171267189074491, "cumreturndow": 0.9665940693333112, "cumreturnsp500": 0.968049690541516}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2385, "level_0": 2410, "index": 37, "text": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR AUDITED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISK, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d OF THIS FORM 10-K.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U. S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS.  WE EVALUATE THE ESTIMATES ON AN ON-GOING BASIS.  WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u25aa  WE REPORT INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING BASIS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX LAWS AND TAX RATES THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE.  WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.  A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LEVEL OF HISTORICAL TAXABLE INCOME AND PROJECTIONS FOR FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE DEDUCTIBLE.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES ASSESSING UNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX RULES.  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS MUST MEET A MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON FINAL SETTLEMENT.  SEE NOTE 15 \u2014 INCOME TAXES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  \u25aa  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  SEE NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -  REVENUE RECOGNITION  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 FOR DISCUSSION ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND DETERMINATION OF TRANSACTION PRICE, INCLUDING TREATMENT OF REBATES, RIGHT OF RETURNS, WARRANTIES, PRICE PROTECTION AND STOCK ROTATION.  \u25aa  INVENTORIES ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST BEING DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.  WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORIES TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON FORECASTED DEMAND WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PRODUCT RELEASE SCHEDULES AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, WHICH MAY DRIVE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.  WE ALSO REVIEW AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, AS APPROPRIATE, BASED ON THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE INVENTORY.  ACTUAL DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  \u25aa  WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS USED IN OPERATIONS WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE PRESENT AND THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ESTIMATED TO BE GENERATED BY THOSE ASSETS ARE LESS THAN THE ASSETS\u2019 CARRYING AMOUNTS.  AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE EVENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE ASSETS.  IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS INVOLVE MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF ASSET USEFUL LIVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  ACTUAL USEFUL LIVES AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. SEE NOTE 6 \u2014 INTANGIBLES, NET AND GOODWILL OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  \u25aa  THE COMPANY EVALUATES GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  GOODWILL IS RECORDED AT THE TIME OF AN ACQUISITION AND IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID FOR AN ACQUISITION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED.  THE COMPANY TESTS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED.  IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, THEN A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED INVOLVING MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF ASSET USEFUL LIVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS THAT ARE USED IN THESE EVALUATIONS.  IF OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, OR THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES USED IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES, ARE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES USED TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN A FUTURE PERIOD.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  .  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017.  \u25aa  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS. SEE NOTE 12 \u2014 LEGAL MATTERS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ACCRUALS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE STATUS OF THE CASE, THE RESULTS OF THE DISCOVERY PROCESS AND OTHER FACTORS.  IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT AN ACCRUAL SHOULD BE MADE FOR A LEGAL MATTER, THIS ACCRUAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATE.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (ASC TOPIC 606). THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASU IS TO CONVERGE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS PER U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (\u201cIFRS\u201d). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE GUIDANCE IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN AUGUST 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-14, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT SUPPORTED A PROPOSAL TO DELAY THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ASU TO ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, INCLUDING INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CONTRACTS IN RESPECT OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IDENTIFICATION AND SATISFACTION, PRICING, WARRANTIES, AND RETURN RIGHTS, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD, THE COMPANY COULD ADOPT BY FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH APPLIES RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR PERIOD PRESENTED, OR BY MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RECOGNIZED IN BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHOD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NO INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT, AND THEREFORE NO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IMPACT.  SEE NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - REVENUE RECOGNITION AS WELL AS NOTE 8 - REVENUES FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  THE EFFECTS OF THE CHANGES MADE TO OUR BALANCE SHEET AT ADOPTION WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  BALANCE AT MARCH 31, 2018  IMPACT FROM ASU 2014-09 ADOPTION  BALANCE AT APRIL 1, 2018  FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  $100,801  $5,539  $106,340  INVENTORIES  205,760  (391)  205,369  OTHER CURRENT ASSETS  13,877  391  14,268  OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES  $(12,657  )  $(5,539  )  $(18,196  )  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  . THE FASB ISSUED THIS UPDATE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY LEASING ARRANGEMENT DETAILS.  LESSEES WOULD RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASES ON THE BALANCE SHEET UNDER THIS ASU - WITH THE FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY, MEASURED AT PRESENT VALUE, AND THE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSET RECOGNIZED FOR THE LEASE TERM. A SINGLE LEASE COST WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE TERM.  FOR INITIAL TERMS OF LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS, A LESSEE WOULD BE PERMITTED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR SUCH LEASES GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH WAS PREVIOUSLY THE ONLY ALLOWED ADOPTION METHOD.  IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED THE RELATED ASU 2018-10 -  LEASES (TOPIC 842): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS  . THIS ASU OFFERS A NEW TRANSITION ADOPTION METHOD, WHICH WILL NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPARATIVE PERIODS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED USING THE LATTER METHOD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS IN TRANSITION.  WE ELECTED THE USE-OF-HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND THE \u2018PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\u2019 WHICH PERMITS US NOT TO REASSESS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD OUR PRIOR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS.  THE NEW STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS FOR AN ENTITY\u2019S ONGOING ACCOUNTING.  WE ELECTED THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ALL LEASES THAT QUALIFY.  THIS MEANS, FOR QUALIFYING LEASES, TYPICALLY THOSE WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS, WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES.  WE ALSO DO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR ALL CLASSES OF ASSETS.  MOST OF OUR OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS WERE SUBJECT TO THE NEW STANDARD AND RECOGNIZED AS RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES UPON ADOPTION, WHICH WILL MATERIALLY INCREASE THE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES THAT WE REPORT RELATIVE TO SUCH AMOUNTS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THIS ASU.  ON ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL OPERATING LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $158.0 MILLION  , WITH CORRESPONDING ROU ASSETS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT LEASING CONTRACTS FOR EXISTING OPERATING LEASES.  IN ADDITION, EXISTING CAPITALIZED INITIAL DIRECT COSTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AND ACCRUED LEASE PAYMENTS OF  $11.1 MILLION  WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM PREPAYMENTS AND ACCRUALS TO THE ROU ASSET, RESULTING IN A ROU ASSET OF  $149.7 MILLION  .  THERE WAS NO INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT ON ADOPTION.  IN APPLYING THE USE-OF-HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, WE RE-ASSESSED WHETHER WE WERE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE EXTENSION OPTIONS WITHIN OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS.  THIS RESULTED IN THE LEASE TERM BEING EXTENDED ON A NUMBER OF LEASES.  THE  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED INITIAL DIRECT COSTS AND LEASE CREDITOR WERE RECALCULATED ASSUMING THESE EXTENDED LEASE TERMS HAD ALWAYS APPLIED, RESULTING IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF  $1.0 MILLION  TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS ON TRANSITION.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2014 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  .  THIS ASU REQUIRES CREDIT LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES TO BE PRESENTED AS AN ALLOWANCE RATHER THAN A WRITE-DOWN.  UNLIKE CURRENT U.S. GAAP, THE CREDIT LOSSES COULD BE REVERSED WITH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, AND RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT YEAR EARNINGS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04,  INTANGIBLES \u2014 GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  .

THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017 AND SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.  AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF AND REASON FOR THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE UPON TRANSITION.  THAT DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL PERIOD AND IN THE INTERIM PERIOD WITHIN THE FIRST ANNUAL PERIOD WHEN THE ENTITY INITIALLY ADOPTS THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715): IMPROVING THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST  .  THIS ASU REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO DISAGGREGATE THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT FROM THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST.  IT ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION FOR SERVICE COST AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION INCLUDED THE BUY-OUT SETTLEMENT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 9.  IN MAY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): SCOPE OF MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING  .  THIS ASU APPLIES TO ANY COMPANY THAT CHANGES THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF A SHARE-BASED AWARD, CONSIDERED A MODIFICATION.

THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO AN AWARD MODIFIED ON OR AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NO FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT AS NO AWARDS WERE MODIFIED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT - REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  .  THIS ASU ALLOWS FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PERIOD (OR PERIODS) IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  .

THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ADOPT THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK-CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  .  THIS ASU ADJUSTS CURRENT REQUIRED DISCLOSURES RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE COMMISSION ADOPTED THE FINAL RULE UNDER SEC RELEASE NO. 33-10532, DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION, AMENDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED OR SUPERSEDED.  IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENTS EXPANDED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE ANALYSIS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  UNDER THE AMENDMENTS, AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN EACH CAPTION OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY PRESENTED  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE BALANCE SHEET MUST BE PROVIDED IN A NOTE OR SEPARATE STATEMENT.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0 PERCENT  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROVISIONAL ENACTMENT-DATE EFFECTS OF THE LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), AS WELL AS THE U.S. FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT AND THE EFFECT OF INCOME EARNED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT IS TAXED BELOW THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE.  THIS OVERALL DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND STATE TAX ATTRIBUTES DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL EXPIRE OR GO UNUTILIZED.  THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017.  THE TAX ACT REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, RESTRICTS THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN BUSINESS EXPENSES, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX-DEFERRED, AND CREATES NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCED EARNINGS, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS.  WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AMOUNT OF $60.1 MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENACTMENT-DATE EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT WAS COMPLETED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  WE RECOGNIZED AN  $11.1 MILLION  ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AT MARCH 31, 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $103.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  ON A PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $265.1 MILLION  , YIELDING AN EFFECTIVE TAX PROVISION RATE OF  38.9 PERCENT  .  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE BLENDED U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 31.6 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME EARNED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT IS TAXED BELOW THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND EXCESS BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THE RATE CHANGE WAS ADMINISTRATIVELY EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2018, RESULTING IN A BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF 31.6% FOR THE ANNUAL PERIOD.  WE RECORDED $60.1 MILLION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE OF THE DISCRETE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $53.8 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 ON A PRE-TAX INCOME OF $315.0 MILLION, YIELDING AN EFFECTIVE TAX PROVISION RATE OF 17.1 PERCENT.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE THEN CURRENT U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 35 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCOME EARNED IN JURISDICTIONS WITH A LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATE, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK BASED COMPENSATION DUE TO THE EARLY ADOPTION OF THE ASU 2016-09 ACCOUNTING STANDARD, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS IN THE U.S.  FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE TAX ACT, SEE NOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD, WE ANTICIPATE GROSS MARGIN TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OPERATING EXPENSE TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IMPORTANT R&D PROJECTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH.  GIVEN THE WIDE ARRAY OF UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR UNKNOWN IMPACT ON SMARTPHONE VOLUMES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OUR REVENUE OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020.  CIRRUS LOGIC MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NUMEROUS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES THAT WE BELIEVE POSITION THE COMPANY FOR GROWTH IN THE COMING YEARS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $206.7 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2019  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET INCOME, OFFSET BY A  $23.4 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN PAYABLES AND AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $318.7 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2018  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET INCOME AND A  $29.1 MILLION  FAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES DURING THE PERIOD.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $369.8 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCOME, OFFSET BY A  $24.9 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES DURING THE PERIOD.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , THE COMPANY USED  $54.7 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $28.0 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $35.8 MILLION  .  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , THE COMPANY USED APPROXIMATELY  $184.7 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO  $100.2 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $59.3 MILLION  .  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PURCHASED CERTAIN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR  $25.2 MILLION  AS PART OF A TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , THE COMPANY USED APPROXIMATELY  $69.9 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $18.6 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $51.3 MILLION.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , THE COMPANY USED  $171.5 MILLION  RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , THE COMPANY USED  $249.6 MILLION  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , THE COMPANY USED  $117.5 MILLION  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  PAYMENTS AGAINST REVOLVER BALANCES IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  WERE  ZERO  ,  $60.0 MILLION  AND  $100.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  SEE NOTE 7 AND  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO DEBT AGREEMENTS AND TERMS THAT EXISTED DURING THE PERIODS.  ADDITIONALLY, IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , THE COMPANY UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY  $160.0 MILLION  ,  $175.8 MILLION  , AND  $15.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN CASH TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE PORTIONS OF ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  SEE NOTE 13 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RATE OF SALES GROWTH, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES OR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  WE BELIEVE OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH EARNINGS, EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, ALTHOUGH WE COULD BE REQUIRED, OR COULD ELECT, TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING PRIOR TO THAT TIME.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON JULY 12, 2016, CIRRUS LOGIC ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO, FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFINANCING AN EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROVIDING ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A $300 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d).  THE FACILITY MATURES ON JULY 12, 2021.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND THE NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. \"RISK FACTORS  \"  AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. SEE THE SECTION TITLED \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\" THAT APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN PROVIDING SERVICE ASSURANCE AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS THAT ARE USED BY CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE TO ASSURE THEIR DIGITAL BUSINESS SERVICES AGAINST DISRUPTION.  SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, RELY ON OUR SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE VISIBILITY NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE NETWORK PERFORMANCE, ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF HIGH-QUALITY, MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES, GAIN TIMELY INSIGHT INTO THE END USER EXPERIENCE AND PROTECT THE NETWORK FROM ATTACK. WITH OUR OFFERINGS, CUSTOMERS CAN QUICKLY, EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE ISSUES THAT RESULT IN DOWNTIME, INTERRUPTIONS TO SERVICES, POOR SERVICE QUALITY OR COMPROMISED SECURITY, THEREBY DRIVING COMPELLING RETURNS ON THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THEIR NETWORK AND BROADER TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MIX AND QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD, PRICING, COSTS OF MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, GROWTH IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS, CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, COMPETITION, SUCCESSFUL ACQUISITION INTEGRATION EFFORTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE EXPENSE REDUCTIONS AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY.  RESULTS OVERVIEW  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY LOWER SPENDING BY CUSTOMERS IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMER SEGMENT FOR BOTH SERVICE ASSURANCE AND DDOS SOLUTIONS, AND THE TIMING OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2018.  OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE REMAINED FLAT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET LOSS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $73.3 MILLION  , AS COMPARED WITH NET INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  OF  $79.8 MILLION  , RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF $153.1 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $78.9 MILLION DECREASE IN THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT, A $35.9 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS, A $13.5 MILLION INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DUE TO THE VOLUNTARY SEPARATION PROGRAM, A $13.5 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS DRAWN DOWN ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND A $9.5 MILLION LOSS ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS  DURING THE  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET $9.0 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN HEADCOUNT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $487.0 MILLION  . THIS REPRESENTS AN  INCREASE  OF  $39.2 MILLION  OVER THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $149.8 MILLION IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $50.0 MILLION USED TO REPAY LONG-TERM DEBT, $23.4 MILLION USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, $14.5 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND $11.9 MILLION USED FOR TAX WITHHOLDINGS ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE SUPPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) FINANCIAL MEASURES WE REPORT IN QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS, INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS AND OTHER INVESTOR COMMUNICATIONS BY REPORTING THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP MEASURES: NON-GAAP TOTAL REVENUE, NON-GAAP PRODUCT REVENUE, NON-GAAP SERVICE REVENUE, NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT, NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN, NON-GAAP EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) FROM OPERATIONS, NON-GAAP NET INCOME, AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER SHARE (DILUTED). NON-GAAP REVENUE (TOTAL, PRODUCT AND SERVICE) ELIMINATES THE GAAP EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS BY ADDING BACK REVENUE RELATED TO DEFERRED REVENUE REVALUATION, AS WELL AS REVENUE IMPACTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS AND ALSO REMOVES EXPENSES RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING DEPRECIATION COSTS, COMPENSATION FOR POST-COMBINATION SERVICES AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION COSTS AND ADDS BACK TRANSITIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENT INCOME. NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED ADJUSTMENTS AND ALSO REMOVES RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LOSS ON DIVESTITURE AND COSTS RELATED TO NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION. NON-GAAP EBITDA FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED ITEMS RELATED TO NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND ALSO REMOVES NON-ACQUISITION-RELATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. NON-GAAP NET INCOME INCLUDES THE FOREGOING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, NET OF RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECTS IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISIONAL ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (TCJA) WHILE REMOVING TRANSITIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENT INCOME AND CHANGES IN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. NON-GAAP DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE ALSO EXCLUDES THESE EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE RELATED IMPACT OF ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE FOR MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP (REVENUE, GROSS PROFIT, OPERATING PROFIT, NET INCOME (LOSS) AND DILUTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE), AND MAY HAVE LIMITATIONS IN THAT THEY DO NOT REFLECT ALL OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO EVALUATE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURES. THE PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, IN ISOLATION FROM, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ENHANCE THE READER'S OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE BY PROVIDING A HIGHER DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES AND PROVIDING A LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND HOW WE PLAN AND MEASURE OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AFFORDS INVESTORS A VIEW OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS THAT MAY BE MORE EASILY COMPARED WITH OUR PEER COMPANIES AND ALSO ENABLES INVESTORS TO CONSIDER OUR OPERATING RESULTS ON BOTH A GAAP AND NON-GAAP BASIS DURING AND FOLLOWING THE INTEGRATION PERIOD OF OUR ACQUISITIONS.

WE APPLY SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND CREATE ESTIMATES WHEN APPLYING THESE POLICIES.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT AND SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.  WE DERIVE REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS FOR SERVICE PROVIDER AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, WHICH INCLUDE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT SALES CONSIST OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS WITH EMBEDDED SOFTWARE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING CUSTOMERS THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO SELL SOFTWARE OFFERINGS DECOUPLED FROM THE UNDERLYING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY.  WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE ONCE A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE PARTIES AND THE RELATED PROMISES TO TRANSFER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. A CONTRACT IS DEFINED TO US AS AN ARRANGEMENT WITH COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE IDENTIFYING PAYMENT TERMS, EACH PARTY\u2019S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO BE TRANSFERRED AND THE AMOUNT WE DEEM PROBABLE OF COLLECTION. CUSTOMER CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE PROMISES TO TRANSFER MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER. DETERMINING WHETHER THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY OR AS ONE COMBINED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  PRODUCT REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT, PROVIDED A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT EXISTS, CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND IN THE CASE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHTS AND ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE, AND COLLECTION OF THE RELATED RECEIVABLE IS PROBABLE. IF ANY SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER REMAIN POST-DELIVERY, TYPICALLY INVOLVING OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO INSTALLATION AND ACCEPTANCE BY THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED. OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS INCLUDE INSTALLATION, INTEGRATION, EXTENDED WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES, POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT, STAND-READY SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING AND TRAINING. WE GENERALLY PROVIDE SOFTWARE AND/OR HARDWARE SUPPORT AS PART OF PRODUCT SALES. REVENUE RELATED TO THE INITIAL BUNDLED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SUPPORT IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SUPPORT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS CAN ELECT TO PURCHASE EXTENDED SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR PERIODS AFTER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE/HARDWARE WARRANTY EXPIRATION. SUPPORT SERVICES GENERALLY INCLUDE RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES (WHEN AND IF AVAILABLE), TELEPHONE AND INTERNET-BASED SUPPORT, UPDATES, BUG FIXES AND HARDWARE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT. CONSULTING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OR COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT. REIMBURSEMENTS OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING CONSULTING SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES REVENUE, WITH THE OFFSETTING EXPENSE RECORDED IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE. TRAINING SERVICES INCLUDE ON-SITE AND CLASSROOM TRAINING. TRAINING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE TRAINING.  GENERALLY, OUR CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR INDIVIDUALLY. HOWEVER, WHEN CONTRACTS ARE CLOSELY INTERRELATED AND DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO OR MORE CONTRACTS AS ONE TO REFLECT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE GROUP OF CONTRACTS.  BUNDLED ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONCURRENT CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT MAY BE DELIVERED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME. WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN AN AMOUNT THAT DEPICTS THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES (SSP) OF EACH OBLIGATION. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE SSP FOR EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE USE A RANGE OF AMOUNTS TO ESTIMATE SSP WHEN WE SELL EACH OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SEPARATELY BASED ON THE ELEMENT\u2019S HISTORICAL PRICING. WE ALSO CONSIDER OUR OVERALL PRICING OBJECTIVES AND PRACTICES ACROSS DIFFERENT SALES CHANNELS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SSP FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR SERVICE ELEMENTS BASED ON HISTORICAL STANDALONE SALES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SSP FOR SERVICES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF PROFITABILITY AND THE UNDERLYING COST TO FULFILL THOSE SERVICES. FURTHER, FOR CERTAIN SERVICE ENGAGEMENTS, WE CONSIDER QUOTED PRICES AS PART OF MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS OF THOSE ENGAGEMENTS AS A BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING SSP. SSP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PRODUCT ELEMENTS AS THE AVERAGE OR MEDIAN SELLING PRICE THE ELEMENT WAS RECENTLY SOLD FOR, WHETHER SOLD ALONE OR SOLD AS PART OF A MULTIPLE ELEMENT TRANSACTION. WE REVIEW SALES OF THE PRODUCT ELEMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND UPDATE, WHEN APPROPRIATE, SSP FOR SUCH ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS RECENT PRICING EXPERIENCE. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THROUGH ALLIANCES WITH RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A SELL-IN BASIS; THAT IS, WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT TRANSFERS TO THE RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR. WE RECORD CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO A RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE RECORDED REVENUE FROM THE RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, OUR RETURN POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW PRODUCT RETURNS FOR A REFUND. RETURNS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT TO DATE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A HISTORY OF SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTING RECEIVABLES FROM OUR RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 OR 2 WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BY LEVEL 1 INPUTS UTILIZE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACCESSIBLE ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BY LEVEL 2 INPUTS UTILIZE DATA POINTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELD CURVES.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACCOUNTING ITEMS  WE AMORTIZE ACQUIRED DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT SUBJECT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS; MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL DECLINE IN THEIR FAIR VALUE. WE PERFORM THE ASSESSMENT ANNUALLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS IF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARISE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTING UNITS: (1) SERVICE ASSURANCE AND (2) SECURITY.  TO TEST IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTENCE OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. IF BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, IF WE CONCLUDE OTHERWISE, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NOT REQUIRED. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS FOR GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL USING ESTABLISHED INCOME AND MARKET VALUATION APPROACHES. GOODWILL WAS ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR ON AN INTERIM BASIS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. TO TEST IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTENCE OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE IS IMPAIRED. IF BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NOT REQUIRED. WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AT JANUARY 31, 2019 USING THE QUALITATIVE STEP 0 ASSESSMENT. NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS WERE OBSERVED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMPLETED TWO ACQUISITIONS AND ONE DIVESTITURE DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING REQUIRES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE USE A RELIEF FROM ROYALTY MODEL WHICH REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE: FUTURE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, A ROYALTY RATE WHICH A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD PAY RELATED TO THE PROJECTED REVENUE STREAM, A PRESENT VALUE FACTOR WHICH APPROXIMATES A RISK ADJUSTED RATE OF RETURN FOR A MARKET PARTICIPANT PURCHASING THE ASSETS, AND A TECHNOLOGY MIGRATION CURVE REPRESENTING A PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY ASSETS OR SOME PORTION THEREOF ARE STILL BEING USED. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE FAIR VALUE FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WHICH REQUIRES THAT WE CREATE ESTIMATES FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: A PROJECTION OF FUTURE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S EXISTING CUSTOMERS, A TURNOVER RATE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS, A MARGIN RELATED TO THOSE SALES, AND A RISK ADJUSTED RATE OF RETURN FOR A MARKET PARTICIPANT PURCHASING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.  WE HAVE A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR HANDHELD NETWORK TEST (HNT) TOOLS BUSINESS IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET REPRESENTS POTENTIAL FUTURE EARNOUT PAYMENTS TO US OF UP TO $4.0 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS THAT ARE CONTINGENT ON THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OF $2.3 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE ACQUISITION DATE AND WAS MEASURED USING OBSERVABLE (LEVEL 3) INPUTS. THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $0.8 MILLION.  WE HAD A CONTINGENT LIABILITY AT MARCH 31, 2018 FOR $523 THOUSAND RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EFFLUX SYSTEMS, INC. (EFFLUX) IN JULY 2017 FOR WHICH AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER DAMAGES WE MAY HAVE SUFFERED RELATED TO ANY LIABILITIES THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO ASSUME OR AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER AS DESCRIBED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE $523 THOUSAND WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN JULY 2018.  WE HAD A CONTINGENT LIABILITY AT MARCH 31, 2018 FOR $4.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF SIMENA LLC (SIMENA) IN NOVEMBER 2011, WHICH WAS BASED ON THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION, AND THE FORMER OWNERS' FUTURE PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT WITH US. THE CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF $5.0 MILLION WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN NOVEMBER 2018.  WE HAD $660 THOUSAND OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AVVASI INCORPORATED (AVVASI) IN AUGUST 2016 FOR WHICH AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER DAMAGES WE MAY HAVE SUFFERED RELATED TO ANY LIABILITIES THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO ASSUME OR AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER AS DESCRIBED IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE $660 THOUSAND WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN AUGUST 2017.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS, WE RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATE, THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE ASSUMED AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF 0% FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR DIRECTORS, AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 2% FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES, AND AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR ALL REMAINING EMPLOYEES. WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE LOWER THAN ESTIMATED AND WILL RECORD A RECOVERY OF PRIOR EXPENSE IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  REVENUE  PRODUCT REVENUE CONSISTS OF SALES OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND LICENSING OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, CONSULTING, TRAINING AND STAND-READY SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE OFFERINGS.

IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS ON CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $35.9 MILLION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRUCTURING.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJA THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR 2019 TAX RATE INCLUDE THE BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT), THE DEDUCTION FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME (FDII) AND THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI) INCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT, WE RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT TAX BENEFIT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THIS BENEFIT HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE TAX RATE DUE TO LOSSES GENERATED IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS UNDER THE TCJA, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THAT IMPACT US. THE FINAL IMPACT OF THE TCJA, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE KEY CHANGES FROM THE TCJA THAT WERE REPORTED AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 ARE THE IMPACT DUE TO THE REDUCED U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%, A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS ON WHICH U.S. INCOME TAX WAS DEFERRED, ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE UNDER BEAT, A DEDUCTION FOR FDII, AN INCOME INCLUSION UNDER GILTI AND THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ENACTED TAX RATE WHICH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, ANY U.S. RELATED DEFERRED TAXES WERE RE-MEASURED FROM 35.0% DOWN TO 21.0% BASED ON THE RECORDED BALANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATE RELATED TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES, WHICH WAS A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $87 MILLION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE FINALIZED OUR CALCULATION AND DID NOT ADJUST OUR ESTIMATE RECORDED.  ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX BASED ON OUR TOTAL POST-1986 FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' EARNINGS AND PROFITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FROM U.S. INCOME TAXES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATE RELATED TO THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE FINALIZED OUR CALCULATION AND DID NOT ADJUST OUR ESTIMATE RECORDED.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TAX ON THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI). WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION OF EITHER (1) TREATING TAXES DUE ON FUTURE U.S. INCLUSIONS IN TAXABLE INCOME RELATED TO GILTI AS A CURRENT PERIOD  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (THE \"PERIOD COST METHOD\") OR (2) FACTORING SUCH AMOUNTS INTO OUR MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAXES (THE \"DEFERRED METHOD\"). WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT TAXES DUE ON FUTURE U.S. INCLUSIONS IN TAXABLE INCOME RELATED TO GILTI AS A CURRENT PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (THE \"PERIOD COST METHOD\").  AS A RESULT OF TCJA WE EXPECT THAT CURRENT AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS MAY BE REPATRIATED TAX EFFICIENTLY. AFTER FULLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE TCJA, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL NOT BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED WHERE WE CAN REPATRIATE THOSE EARNINGS IN A TAX EFFICIENT MANNER ACCEPTABLE TO MANAGEMENT AND WHICH COMPLY WITH LOCAL STATUTORY AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE INTEND A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY TAXED HISTORICAL EARNINGS BECAUSE OF TCJA WHICH CAN BE REPATRIATED IN A TAX EFFICIENT MANNER. WE CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT ANY REMAINDER OF ITS HISTORICAL BOOK BASIS IN EXCESS OF TAX BASIS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. TAXES ON THESE DIFFERENCES.

THE JUDGMENT ALSO AWARDS PRE- AND POST- JUDGMENT INTEREST, AND A RUNNING ROYALTY ON THE G10 AND GEOBLADE PRODUCTS UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE PATENTS AT ISSUE, THE LAST DATE BEING JUNE 2022. THE COURT DENIED THE PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR FEES. FOLLOWING THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, WE FILED MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, SEEKING TO BOTH OVERTURN THE VERDICT AND TO REDUCE DAMAGES. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RISK OF LOSS FROM THIS MATTER IS CURRENTLY NEITHER REMOTE NOR PROBABLE, AND THEREFORE, UNDER GAAP DEFINITIONS, THE RISK OF LOSS IS TERMED \"REASONABLY POSSIBLE\".

ADDITIONALLY, A PORTION OF OUR CASH MAY BE USED TO ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR PRODUCTS OR TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF SUCH BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES. IF OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES. THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.

WE THEN DISCUSS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. NEXT, WE DISCUSS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, AND FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017, WHICH ARE FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY CHANGES IN OUR BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS, AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS IN THE SECTIONS ENTITLED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS. WE CONCLUDE THIS MD&A BY DISCUSSING OUR OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020.  THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING ITEM 1: BUSINESS, ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA AND ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS MD&A CONTAIN A NUMBER OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION, CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS ANNUAL REPORT AND PARTICULARLY UNDER THE SECTION ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  AMERCO HAS A FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE 31  ST  OF MARCH FOR EACH YEAR THAT IS REFERENCED. OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES HAVE FISCAL YEARS THAT END ON THE 31  ST  OF DECEMBER FOR EACH YEAR THAT IS REFERENCED. THEY HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED ON THAT BASIS. OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES\u2019 FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES CONFORM TO CALENDAR YEAR REPORTING AS REQUIRED BY STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CONSOLIDATING THEIR CALENDAR YEAR INTO OUR FISCAL YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DOES NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL EVENTS, IF ANY, OCCURRING DURING THE INTERVENING PERIOD. CONSEQUENTLY, ALL REFERENCES TO OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016 CORRESPOND TO FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017 FOR AMERCO.  OVERALL STRATEGY  OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN \u201cDO-IT-YOURSELF\u201d MOVING AND STORAGE INDUSTRY. WE ACCOMPLISH THIS BY PROVIDING A SEAMLESS AND INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN TO THE \u201cDO-IT-YOURSELF\u201d MOVING AND STORAGE MARKET. AS PART OF EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY, WE LEVERAGE THE BRAND RECOGNITION OF U-HAUL  WITH OUR FULL LINE OF MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE CONVENIENCE OF OUR BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A WIDE SELECTION OF MOVING RENTAL EQUIPMENT, CONVENIENT SELF-STORAGE RENTAL FACILITIES AND PORTABLE MOVING AND STORAGE UNITS AND RELATED MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING SEGMENT  LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO THE SENIOR MARKET THROUGH THE DIRECT WRITING AND REINSURING OF LIFE INSURANCE, MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND ANNUITY POLICIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE UNITED STATES. THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NOTE 3, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARIZES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO ESTIMATE MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  FOLLOWING IS A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE DEEM MOST CRITICAL TO US AND THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OBSERVANCE OF TRENDS IN PARTICULAR AREAS, INFORMATION AND VALUATIONS AVAILABLE FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL AMOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.  17  WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE DEEM MOST CRITICAL TO US, AND INVOLVE THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  WE APPLY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 810 -  CONSOLIDATION  (\u201cASC 810\u201d) IN OUR PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. ASC 810 ADDRESSES ARRANGEMENTS WHERE A COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING OR SIMILAR INTERESTS OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVIE\u201d). A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE A VIE IF IT HAS DETERMINED IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ASC 810 ALSO ADDRESSES THE POLICY WHEN A COMPANY OWNS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING OR SIMILAR RIGHTS AND EXERCISES EFFECTIVE CONTROL.  A VIE IS NOT SELF-SUPPORTIVE DUE TO HAVING ONE OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: (I) IT HAS AN INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF EQUITY FOR IT TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR (II) ITS OWNERS DO NOT HOLD THE TYPICAL RISKS AND RIGHTS OF EQUITY OWNERS. THIS DETERMINATION IS MADE UPON THE CREATION OF A VARIABLE INTEREST AND IS RE-ASSESSED ON AN ON-GOING BASIS SHOULD CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE OPERATIONS OF A VIE, OR ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY TRIGGER A RECONSIDERATION. AFTER A RECONSIDERATION EVENT OCCURS THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UTILIZED IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY IS A VIE, WHICH OTHER COMPANY(IES) HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST IS SUCH THAT IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. DETERMINATION OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, IF ANY, IS BASED ON A) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE\u2019S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, AND B) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER ENTITIES REGARDING WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, WHICH COULD CHANGE BASED ON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANY RECONSIDERATION EVENTS.  RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST. INTEREST EXPENSE, IF ANY, INCURRED DURING THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS IS CONSIDERED PART OF COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE OR AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON A DECLINING BALANCE FORMULA OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: RENTAL EQUIPMENT 2-20 YEARS AND BUILDINGS AND NON-RENTAL EQUIPMENT 3-55 YEARS. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATING EXPENSE AS THEY ARE INCURRED. GAINS AND LOSSES ON DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER THAN REAL ESTATE (\u201cPERSONAL PROPERTY\u201d), ARE NETTED AGAINST DEPRECIATION EXPENSE WHEN REALIZED. EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION IS RECOGNIZED IN AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE RECOVERY OF ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES UPON DISPOSAL, I.E., MINIMIZE GAINS OR LOSSES. IN DETERMINING THE DEPRECIATION RATE, HISTORICAL DISPOSAL EXPERIENCE, HOLDING PERIODS AND TRENDS IN THE MARKET FOR VEHICLES ARE REVIEWED. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN IRS REGULATIONS REGARDING THE CAPITALIZATION OF ASSETS, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017, WE RAISED THE VALUE THRESHOLD BEFORE CERTAIN ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED WITHIN OUR DEPRECIATION POLICY. THIS CHANGE IN THRESHOLD, RESULTS IN THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF REPORTED OPERATING COSTS WITH A LAGGING DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE TERM THAT THESE ASSETS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRECIATED. THIS CHANGE IN THRESHOLD BENEFITED US THROUGH THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE COSTS.  WE REGULARLY PERFORM REVIEWS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHICH INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL VALUE, MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER OR LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. REDUCTIONS IN RESIDUAL VALUES (I.E., THE PRICE AT WHICH WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO DISPOSE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT) OR USEFUL LIVES WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT. REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED BASED ON VEHICLE CLASS, GENERALLY SUBCATEGORIES OF TRUCKS AND TRAILERS. WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET PRICE TRENDS ON USED VEHICLES AND THE EXPECTED LIFE OF VEHICLES INCLUDED IN THE FLEET. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF ASSET RESIDUAL VALUES ARE DETERMINED TO BE RECOVERABLE, BUT THE USEFUL LIVES ARE SHORTER OR LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.  18  FOR OUR BOX TRUCK FLEET WE UTILIZE AN ACCELERATED METHOD OF DEPRECIATION BASED UPON A DECLINING FORMULA. UNDER THE DECLINING BALANCES METHOD (2.4 TIMES DECLINING BALANCE), THE BOOK VALUE OF A RENTAL TRUCK IS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 16%, 13%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, AND 6% OF COST DURING YEARS ONE THROUGH SEVEN, RESPECTIVELY, AND THEN REDUCED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS TO A SALVAGE VALUE OF 15% BY THE END OF YEAR FIFTEEN. COMPARATIVELY, A STANDARD STRAIGHT LINE APPROACH WOULD REDUCE THE BOOK VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 5.7% PER YEAR OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUCK.  ALTHOUGH WE INTEND TO SELL OUR USED VEHICLES FOR PRICES APPROXIMATING BOOK VALUE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REALIZE A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE SALE OF USED VEHICLES IS DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE GENERAL STATE OF THE USED VEHICLE MARKET, THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF ITS DISPOSAL AND THE DEPRECIATION RATES WITH RESPECT TO THE VEHICLE.  WE TYPICALLY SELL OUR USED VEHICLES AT OUR SALES CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, ON OUR WEBSITE AT UHAUL.COM/TRUCKSALES OR BY PHONE AT 1-866-404-0355. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL A LARGE PORTION OF OUR PICKUP AND CARGO VAN FLEET AT AUTOMOBILE DEALER AUCTIONS.  INSURANCE RESERVES  LIABILITIES FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND CERTAIN ANNUITY AND HEALTH POLICIES ARE ESTABLISHED TO MEET THE ESTIMATED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS OF POLICIES IN FORCE, AND ARE BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY AND WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS FROM RECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL TABLES WHICH CONTAIN MARGINS FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION. IN ADDITION, LIABILITIES FOR HEALTH, DISABILITY AND OTHER POLICIES INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR REPORTED LOSSES AND ESTIMATES OF LOSSES INCURRED, BUT NOT YET REPORTED (\u201cIBNR\u201d). LIABILITIES FOR ANNUITY CONTRACTS CONSIST OF CONTRACT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS.  INSURANCE RESERVES FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND U-HAUL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOSSES INCURRED BASED UPON ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES AND ARE MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST APPROXIMATION OF FUTURE PAYMENTS.  THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON PAST CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT CLAIM TRENDS AS WELL AS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS CHANGES IN LEGAL THEORIES AND INFLATION.  THESE RESERVES CONSIST OF CASE RESERVES FOR REPORTED LOSSES AND A PROVISION FOR IBNR LOSSES, BOTH REDUCED BY APPLICABLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, RESULTING IN A NET LIABILITY.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS AND HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE LIABILITY FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CLAIMS, THE AMOUNTS TO BE ULTIMATELY PAID TO SETTLE THESE LIABILITIES CANNOT BE PRECISELY DETERMINED AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, ESPECIALLY FOR LONG-TAILED CASUALTY LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS EXCESS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE EXCESS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION POLICIES WRITTEN BY REPWEST FROM 1983 THROUGH 2001, IT MAY TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR CLAIMS TO BE FULLY REPORTED AND FINALLY SETTLED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS INSURANCE RESERVE ADEQUACY IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE IF EXISTING ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED. IN DETERMINING THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CALCULATING WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RESERVES, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  CLAIMANT LONGEVITY,  COST TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH CLAIMANT TREATMENTS,  CHANGES IN CEDING ENTITY AND THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR REPORTING PRACTICES,  CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INCLUDING LEGAL AND REGULATORY,  CURRENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS, AND  FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING INFLATION.  WE HAVE RESERVED EACH CLAIM BASED UPON THE ACCUMULATION OF CURRENT CLAIM COSTS PROJECTED THROUGH EACH CLAIMANT\u2019S LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR APPLICABLE REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.  MANAGEMENT REVIEWS EACH CLAIM BI-ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY, IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATED LIFE-TIME CLAIM COSTS HAVE INCREASED AND THEN ADJUSTS THE RESERVE ESTIMATE ACCORDINGLY AT THAT TIME.  WE HAVE FACTORED IN AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST INCREASES COULD BE IN OUR IBNR LIABILITY.  WE HAVE NOT ASSUMED SETTLEMENT OF THE EXISTING CLAIMS IN CALCULATING THE RESERVE AMOUNT, UNLESS IT IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF COMPLETION.  19  CONTINUED INCREASES IN CLAIM COSTS, INCLUDING MEDICAL INFLATION AND NEW TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS COULD LEAD TO FUTURE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL RESERVE STRENGTHENING.  CONVERSELY, SETTLEMENT OF EXISTING CLAIMS OR IF INJURED WORKERS RETURN TO WORK OR EXPIRE PREMATURELY, COULD LEAD TO FUTURE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.  IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS  INVESTMENTS ARE EVALUATED PURSUANT TO GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 320 -  INVESTMENTS - DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES  TO DETERMINE IF AND WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE BELOW AMORTIZED COST IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT MAKES CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS IN ITS ASSESSMENT INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY, QUOTED MARKET PRICES, DEALER QUOTES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INDUSTRY FACTORS, FINANCIAL FACTORS, AND ISSUER SPECIFIC INFORMATION SUCH AS CREDIT STRENGTH. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OPERATING RESULTS. THERE WERE NO WRITE DOWNS IN FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017.  INCOME TAXES  WE FILE A CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURN WITH ALL OF OUR LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR TAX RETURNS ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED BY VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS MAY CAUSE CHANGES THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. PLEASE SEE NOTE 13, PROVISION FOR TAXES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION.  FAIR VALUES  FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE CARRYING VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MORTGAGE LOANS AND NOTES ON REAL ESTATE, AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, DEALER QUOTES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FAIR VALUES OF TRADE RECEIVABLES APPROXIMATE THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS, TRADE RECEIVABLES, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND NOTES RECEIVABLE. LIMITED CREDIT RISK EXISTS ON TRADE RECEIVABLES DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS BROAD GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. WE PLACE OUR TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  WE HAVE MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES, WHICH POTENTIALLY EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK. THE PORTFOLIO OF NOTES IS PRINCIPALLY COLLATERALIZED BY SELF-STORAGE FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES RELATED TO THE NOTES FROM INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS OF NOTES IN ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED USING THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD AND USING INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY OFFERED FOR SIMILAR LOANS TO BORROWERS WITH SIMILAR CREDIT RATINGS.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ARE ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE AS THE ACTUAL INTEREST RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE ESTIMATED TO BE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR DEBT OF SIMILAR TERM AND REMAINING MATURITY.  OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CURRENT OR BEAR REASONABLE INTEREST RATES. AS A RESULT, THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  PLEASE SEE NOTE 22, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  PLEASE SEE NOTE 3, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  20  AMERCO AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018  LISTED BELOW, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, ARE REVENUES FOR OUR MAJOR PRODUCT LINES FOR FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018.

DURING FISCAL 2019 WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED LOCATIONS ALONG WITH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS, TRAILERS AND TOWING DEVICES IN OUR RENTAL FLEET.  IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS WE SAW REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CORPORATE ACCOUNT BUSINESS.  REVENUE AND TRANSACTIONS FOR BOTH THE ONE-WAY AND IN-TOWN MARKETS IMPROVED COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018.  SELF-STORAGE REVENUES INCREASED $43.4 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  THE AVERAGE MONTHLY AMOUNT OF OCCUPIED SQUARE FEET INCREASED BY 12.0% DURING FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE GROWTH IN REVENUES AND SQUARE FEET RENTED COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF IMPROVED RATES PER SQUARE FOOT, OCCUPANCY GAINS AT EXISTING LOCATIONS AND FROM THE ADDITION OF NEW FACILITIES TO THE PORTFOLIO. OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, WE ADDED APPROXIMATELY 5.3 MILLION NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, A 17.0% INCREASE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION OF THAT OCCURRING ON DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  SALES OF SELF-MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $2.6 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF MOVING SUPPLIES AND PROPANE.  LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS DECREASED $91.2 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OXFORD AGREED TO TERMINATE A REINSURANCE CONTRACT WITH ONE OF OUR REINSURERS (\u201cREINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION\u201d). AS A RESULT THERE WAS A ONE-TIME DECREASE IN LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF $78.4 MILLION DUE TO THE TRANSFER OF LIABILITIES TO THE REINSURER FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, ALONG WITH DECREASED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS INCREASED $3.8 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAFETOW  \u00ae  AND SAFESTOR  \u00ae  SALES WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH INCREASED EQUIPMENT AND STORAGE RENTAL TRANSACTIONS.  NET INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $0.5 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A LARGER INVESTED ASSET BASE AT OUR LIFE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY. UPDATED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOW REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT AT OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME. THIS ACCOUNTED FOR A $5.7 MILLION DECREASE IN FISCAL 2019.  OTHER REVENUE INCREASED $35.3 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, CAUSED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN OUR U-BOX  \u00ae  PROGRAM.  21  LISTED BELOW ARE REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AT EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 AND 2018.

THE MOVING AND STORAGE SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR A $203.2 MILLION INCREASE AND OUR INSURANCE SEGMENTS TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED $86.9 MILLION LARGELY DUE TO A ONE-TIME DECREASE OF $76.4 MILLION IN LIFE BENEFITS DUE TO THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION. OPERATING EXPENSES FOR MOVING AND STORAGE INCREASED $180.0 MILLION, LARGELY FROM INCREASED PERSONNEL, MAINTENANCE REPAIRS, SHIPPING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH U-BOX  \u00ae  , BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY TAXES. REPAIR COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR $45.6 MILLION OF THE INCREASE. NET GAINS FROM THE DISPOSAL OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT INCREASED $15.1 MILLION.

MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS DECREASED BY $9.3 MILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN NEW SALES AND DECLINED PREMIUMS ON THE EXISTING BUSINESS OFFSET BY RATE INCREASES ON RENEWAL PREMIUMS. THE REMAINING LINES OF BUSINESS HAD A NET INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION. DEFERRED ANNUITY DEPOSITS WERE $296.8 MILLION OR $93.7 MILLION ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS DEPOSITS RATHER THAN PREMIUMS.  NET INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME WAS $84.2 MILLION AND $77.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS FROM FIXED MATURITIES INCREASED $10.9 MILLION FROM A LARGER INVESTED ASSET BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.3 MILLION DECREASE IN GAINS FROM OUR MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  NET OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $22.1 MILLION AND $22.4 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN COMMISSION EXPENSE FROM DECREASED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS.  BENEFITS AND LOSSES EXPENSES WERE FLAT AT $169.3 MILLION FOR BOTH THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016. A DECREASE OF $9.2 MILLION IN MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS FROM AN IMPROVED BENEFIT TO PREMIUM RATIO WAS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE REMAINING LINES OF BUSINESS. LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS INCREASED $1.6 MILLION WITH INCREASED MORTALITY WHILE INTEREST CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDERS INCREASED BY $7.3 MILLION FROM A LARGER ANNUITY BASE. OTHER BENEFITS INCREASED $0.3 MILLION.  AMORTIZATION OF DAC, SIA AND VOBA WAS $24.5 MILLION AND $26.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL DAC AMORTIZATION IN THE PRIOR YEAR GENERATED BY ADDED GAINS ON DISCOUNTED MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASED AMORTIZATION FROM A LARGER DAC ASSET IN FISCAL 2018.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CHANGES IN REVENUES AND EXPENSES, PRETAX EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WERE $28.0 MILLION AND $27.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT WILL ENABLE US TO PURSUE OUR OPERATIONAL PLANS AND GOALS AND PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING SOME WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OUR OTHER FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $673.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $759.4 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE ASSETS OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF NON-INSURANCE OPERATIONS (AMERCO, U-HAUL AND REAL ESTATE). AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 (OR AS OTHERWISE INDICATED), CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS (RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, OTHER INVESTMENTS, FIXED MATURITIES, AND RELATED PARTY ASSETS) AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WERE.  MOVING & STORAGE  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE (A)  LIFE INSURANCE (A)  (IN THOUSANDS)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $643,918  $5,757  $24,026  OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS  149,842  463,079  2,207,099  DEBT OBLIGATIONS  4,163,323  \u2013  \u2013  (A) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018  30  AT MARCH 31, 2019, MOVING AND STORAGE HAD AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES OF $80.6 MILLION.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS FOR FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017 IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $975,583  $937,684  $1,059,455  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (1,571,136)  (898,304)  (1,183,908)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  514,582  16,604  223,753  EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE ON CASH  (4,716)  5,598  (2,140)  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH FLOW  (85,687)  61,582  97,160  CASH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD  759,388  697,806  600,646  CASH AT THE END OF THE PERIOD  $673,701  $759,388  $697,806  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $37.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 FROM REDUCED FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, A $64.6 MILLION CASH TRANSFER AS A RESULT OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION IN OUR LIFE INSURANCE SEGMENT DURING FISCAL 2019 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $53.0 MILLION IN NOTES AND INTEREST FROM BLACKWATER IN FISCAL 2018.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $672.8 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH ARE REPORTED NET OF CASH FROM SALES AND LEASE-BACK TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED $506.2 MILLION. CASH FROM THE SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT DECREASED $93.5 MILLION LARGELY DUE TO REDUCED FLEET SALES. NET CASH DEPOSITED IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS ESCROW ACCOUNTS DECREASED $27.1 MILLION. FOR OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $45.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $498.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. THIS WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASED DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE REPAYMENTS OF $49.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CASH FROM BORROWINGS OF $398.8 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET ANNUITY DEPOSITS FROM LIFE INSURANCE OF $48.0 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS PAID OF $9.8 MILLION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS  MOVING AND STORAGE  TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, U-HAUL MAINTAINS A LARGE FLEET OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF NEW RENTAL EQUIPMENT ACQUISITIONS AND THE BUYOUTS OF EXISTING FLEET FROM LEASES. THE CAPITAL TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN OBTAINED INTERNALLY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE SALE OF USED EQUIPMENT AND EXTERNALLY FROM DEBT AND LEASE FINANCING. IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SERVICE THE EXISTING DEBT AND FUND OPERATIONS. U-HAUL ESTIMATES THAT DURING FISCAL 2020 THE COMPANY WILL REINVEST IN ITS TRUCK AND TRAILER RENTAL FLEET APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION, NET OF EQUIPMENT SALES AND EXCLUDING ANY LEASE BUYOUTS. FOR FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED, NET OF SALES, APPROXIMATELY $560 MILLION BEFORE ANY LEASE BUYOUTS IN ITS TRUCK AND TRAILER FLEET. FLEET INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, THE TRUCK RENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE USED-TRUCK SALES MARKET. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE FISCAL 2020 INVESTMENTS WILL BE FUNDED LARGELY THROUGH DEBT FINANCING, EXTERNAL LEASE FINANCING AND CASH FROM OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING COST AND TAX CONSEQUENCES WHEN SELECTING A METHOD TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR ALLOCATION BETWEEN DEBT AND LEASE FINANCING CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED UPON FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ALTER THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING OPTIONS.  REAL ESTATE HAS TRADITIONALLY FINANCED THE ACQUISITION OF SELF-STORAGE PROPERTIES TO SUPPORT U-HAUL'S GROWTH THROUGH DEBT FINANCING AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S PLAN FOR THE EXPANSION OF OWNED STORAGE PROPERTIES INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF EXISTING SELF-STORAGE LOCATIONS FROM THIRD PARTIES, THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF BARE LAND, AND THE ACQUISITION AND REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT CURRENTLY USED FOR SELF-STORAGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THESE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ALONG WITH BORROWINGS AGAINST EXISTING PROPERTIES AS THEY OPERATIONALLY MATURE. FOR FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED $1,003 MILLION IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS, NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION AND REPAIR. FOR FISCAL 2020, THE TIMING OF NEW PROJECTS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS, AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, WEATHER, AND THE  31  IDENTIFICATION AND SUCCESSFUL ACQUISITION OF TARGET PROPERTIES. U-HAUL'S GROWTH PLAN IN SELF-STORAGE ALSO INCLUDES THE EXPANSION OF THE U-HAUL STORAGE AFFILIATE PROGRAM, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL.  NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT LESS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND LEASE PROCEEDS) WERE $1,263.7 MILLION, $663.9 MILLION AND $932.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  PURCHASES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT  $1,162,909  $1,006,503  $1,178,908  EQUIPMENT LEASE BUYOUTS  30,566  6,594  63,505  PURCHASES OF REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATIONS  1,003,030  606,990  484,487  OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  21,831  140,627  139,448  GROSS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  2,218,336  1,760,714  1,866,348  LESS: LEASE PROCEEDS  (348,368)  (396,969)  (446,843)  LESS: SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  (606,271)  (699,803)  (487,475)  NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  1,263,697  663,942  932,030  MOVING AND STORAGE CONTINUES TO HOLD SIGNIFICANT CASH AND WE BELIEVE HAS ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY. MANAGEMENT MAY INVEST THESE FUNDS IN OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, EXPAND OUR PRODUCT LINES OR PURSUE EXTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SELF-MOVING AND STORAGE MARKETPLACE, PAY DIVIDENDS OR REDUCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS WHERE POSSIBLE.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE'S ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF AMERCO, OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY OPERATING SEGMENT REMAINS SUFFICIENT AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO AMERCO WILL BE RESTRICTED PER STATE REGULATIONS.  OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY OPERATING SEGMENT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS $222.4 MILLION, $211.2 MILLION, AND $180.9 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 RESULTED FROM NET EARNINGS OF $21.7 MILLION, A REDUCTION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $20.2 MILLION AND AN INCREASE DUE TO A ONE-TIME RECLASS OF $9.7 MILLION BETWEEN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASU 2016-01. PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE DOES NOT USE DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUES TO INCREASE CAPITAL AND THEREFORE HAS NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  LIFE INSURANCE  LIFE INSURANCE MANAGES ITS FINANCIAL ASSETS TO MEET POLICYHOLDER AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING INVESTMENT CONTRACT WITHDRAWALS AND DEPOSITS. LIFE INSURANCE'S NET DEPOSIT INCREASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $267.3 MILLION. STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, LIFE INSURANCE'S ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF AMERCO  \u00ae  OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING SEGMENT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS $311.7 MILLION, $332.9 MILLION, AND $296.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 RESULTED FROM EARNINGS OF $20.1 MILLION AND A REDUCTION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $41.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON THE FIXED MATURITY PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. LIFE INSURANCE HAS NOT HISTORICALLY USED DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUES TO INCREASE CAPITAL AND THEREFORE HAS NOT HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT DIRECT EXPOSURE TO CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OXFORD HAD OUTSTANDING DEPOSITS OF $60.0 MILLION THROUGH ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (\u201cFHLB\u201d). FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THIS DEPOSIT, PLEASE SEE NOTE 9, BORROWINGS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  32  CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BY OPERATING SEGMENTS  MOVING AND STORAGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $958.9 MILLION, $858.6 MILLION AND $983.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018, 2017 AND 2016 FROM OPERATIONS, REDUCED FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2019 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $53.0 MILLION IN NOTES AND INTEREST FROM BLACKWATER IN FISCAL 2018.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $19.8 MILLION, $21.9 MILLION, AND $19.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND THE TIMING OF PAYABLES ACTIVITY.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AMOUNTED TO $11.2 MILLION, $17.0 MILLION, AND $20.7 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THESE BALANCES REFLECT FUNDS IN TRANSITION FROM MATURITY PROCEEDS TO LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS LEVEL OF LIQUID ASSETS, COMBINED WITH BUDGETED CASH FLOW, IS ADEQUATE TO MEET FORESEEABLE CASH NEEDS. CAPITAL AND OPERATING BUDGETS ALLOW PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE TO SCHEDULE CASH NEEDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INVESTMENT AND UNDERWRITING PROCEEDS.  LIFE INSURANCE  NET CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS ($3.2) MILLION, $57.2 MILLION AND $56.3 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.6 MILLION CASH TRANSFER AS A RESULT OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN BENEFITS AND COMMISSIONS.  IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LIQUID FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH LIFE INSURANCE'S SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO AND ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE FHLB. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AMOUNTED TO $24.1 MILLION, $50.7 MILLION AND $20.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE OVERALL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET FORESEEABLE CASH NEEDS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - SUMMARY  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET OUR BUSINESS PLANS INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. WE CONTINUE TO HOLD SIGNIFICANT CASH AND HAVE ACCESS TO EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR RENTAL FLEET, RENTAL EQUIPMENT AND STORAGE ACQUISITIONS AND BUILD OUTS.  OUR BORROWING STRATEGY IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ASSET-BACKED FINANCING AND RENTAL EQUIPMENT LEASES. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, WE SEEK TO LADDER MATURITIES AND FIX INTEREST RATES. WHILE EACH OF THESE LOANS TYPICALLY CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE BORROWED IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC ASSETS, THE OVERALL STRUCTURE IS FLEXIBLE WITH NO LIMITS ON OVERALL COMPANY BORROWINGS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT HAS ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY BETWEEN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY IN EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES TO MEET THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS OF THE COMPANY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES OF $80.6 MILLION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ALTER THE ABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO LEND US THE UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEVERAGE IN OUR EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY, PLEASE SEE NOTE 9, BORROWINGS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE MEASURED AND CLASSIFIED BASED UPON A THREE TIERED APPROACH TO VALUATION. ASC 820 REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BE CLASSIFIED AND DISCLOSED IN A LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 CATEGORY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE NOTE 15, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  33  THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVELY TRADED MARKETS WHERE PRICES ARE BASED EITHER ON DIRECT MARKET QUOTES OR OBSERVED TRANSACTIONS. LIQUIDITY IS A FACTOR CONSIDERED DURING THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES. MARKET PRICE QUOTES MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES OR THE MARKET FOR THEM HAS SLOWED OR CEASED. IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE MARKET IS DETERMINED TO BE ILLIQUID, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON LIMITED AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $0.2 MILLION OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ASSETS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3.  THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HELD BY US AS HEDGES AGAINST INTEREST RATE RISK FOR OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING VALUATION MODELS WHICH INCLUDE BROKER QUOTES FOR WHICH SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE. THEY INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER DEAL-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT TO SETTLE BOTH THE CASE RESERVES AND IBNR IS AN ESTIMATE BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT TRENDS AND SUCH ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE FUTURE PREMIUMS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  (B) THESE ESTIMATED OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, WITHDRAWAL AND LAPSE ASSUMPTIONS DRAWN FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY KNOWN TRENDS. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE EXPECTED INTEREST CREDITING BUT NO AMOUNTS FOR FUTURE ANNUITY DEPOSITS OR PREMIUMS FOR LIFE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT POLICIES.  THE CASH FLOWS SHOWN ABOVE ARE UNDISCOUNTED FOR INTEREST AND AS A RESULT TOTAL OUTFLOWS FOR ALL YEARS SHOWN SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES OF $2,039.4 MILLION INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. LIFE INSURANCE EXPECTS TO FULLY FUND THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM THEIR INVESTED ASSET PORTFOLIO. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  (C) THESE ESTIMATED OBLIGATIONS ARE PRIMARILY THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF INSURANCE ACCRUALS FOR PORTIONS OF THE LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR OUR RENTAL EQUIPMENT. THE ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE SETTLEMENT ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT TRENDS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  AS PRESENTED ABOVE, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON DEBT AND GUARANTEES REPRESENT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS WHILE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR OPERATING LEASES REPRESENT THE NOTIONAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  ASC 740 -  INCOME TAXES  LIABILITIES AND INTEREST OF $46.7 MILLION IS NOT INCLUDED ABOVE DUE TO UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING ULTIMATE SETTLEMENTS, IF ANY.  34  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY USES OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN SITUATIONS WHERE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ECONOMICS AND SOUND BUSINESS PRINCIPLES WARRANT THEIR USE.  WE UTILIZE OPERATING LEASES FOR CERTAIN RENTAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES WITH TERMS EXPIRING SUBSTANTIALLY THROUGH 2024. IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTFALL IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF THE UNDERLYING RENTAL EQUIPMENT ASSETS, AMERCO HAS GUARANTEED $5.2 MILLION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 FOR THESE ASSETS AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LEASE TERMS. AMERCO HAS BEEN LEASING RENTAL EQUIPMENT SINCE 1987. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED RESIDUAL VALUE SHORTFALLS RELATED TO THESE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. USING THE AVERAGE COST OF FLEET RELATED DEBT AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF AMERCO\u2019S MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS AND RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES WAS $6.4 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  DURING THE 1990S, WE USED CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXPANSION OF OUR SELF-STORAGE BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE SEE NOTE 19, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY USED WHEN OUR OVERALL BORROWING STRUCTURE WAS MORE LIMITED. WE DO NOT FACE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN UTILIZED IN OUR SELF-STORAGE EXPANSION IN RECENT YEARS. IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND CONSIDER OFF-BALANCE SHEET OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXTENT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO US AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS. SAC HOLDINGS, FOUR SAC SELF-STORAGE CORPORATION (\u201c4 SAC\u201d), FIVE SAC SELF-STORAGE CORPORATION (\u201c5 SAC\u201d), GALAXY INVESTMENTS, L.P. (\u201cGALAXY\u201d) AND PRIVATE MINI ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY BLACKWATER. BLACKWATER IS WHOLLY-OWNED BY WGHLP, WHICH IS OWNED BY MARK V. SHOEN (A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER) AND VARIOUS TRUSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EDWARD J. SHOEN (OUR CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT AND A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER) AND MARK V. SHOEN.  WE CURRENTLY MANAGE THE SELF-STORAGE PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY BLACKWATER AND MERCURY PURSUANT TO A STANDARD FORM OF MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, UNDER WHICH WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE OF BETWEEN 4% AND 10% OF THE GROSS RECEIPTS PLUS REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES. WE RECEIVED MANAGEMENT FEES, EXCLUSIVE OF REIMBURSED EXPENSES, OF $30.0 MILLION, $29.5 MILLION AND $27.8 MILLION FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED ENTITIES DURING FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THIS MANAGEMENT FEE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEE RECEIVED FOR OTHER PROPERTIES WE PREVIOUSLY MANAGED FOR THIRD PARTIES. MARK V. SHOEN CONTROLS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF MERCURY. THE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS OF MERCURY ARE INDIRECTLY OWNED BY MARK V. SHOEN, JAMES P. SHOEN, AND A TRUST BENEFITTING THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF EDWARD J. SHOEN.  WE LEASE SPACE FOR MARKETING COMPANY OFFICES, VEHICLE REPAIR SHOPS AND HITCH INSTALLATION CENTERS FROM SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER. TOTAL LEASE PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO SUCH LEASES WERE $2.7 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2019, 2018 AND 2017. THE TERMS OF THE LEASES ARE SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF LEASES FOR OTHER PROPERTIES OWNED BY UNRELATED PARTIES THAT ARE LEASED BY US.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER ACTED AS U-HAUL INDEPENDENT DEALERS. THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS OF THE DEALERSHIP CONTRACTS WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS OF THOSE WITH OUR OTHER INDEPENDENT DEALERS WHEREBY COMMISSIONS ARE PAID BY US BASED ON EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUES. WE PAID THE ABOVE MENTIONED ENTITIES $61.4 MILLION, $58.6 MILLION AND $57.1 MILLION IN COMMISSIONS PURSUANT TO SUCH DEALERSHIP CONTRACTS DURING FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE AGREEMENTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER, EXCLUDING DEALER AGREEMENTS, PROVIDED REVENUES OF $24.0 MILLION, EXPENSES OF $2.7 MILLION AND CASH FLOWS OF $21.3 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019. REVENUES AND COMMISSION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DEALER AGREEMENTS WERE $288.2 MILLION AND $61.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY DURING FISCAL 2019.  FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK  WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON INCREASING TRANSACTION VOLUME AND IMPROVING PRICING, PRODUCT AND UTILIZATION FOR SELF-MOVING EQUIPMENT RENTALS.  MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF NEW INVESTMENT IN OUR TRUCK FLEET IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR PLAN TO MEET OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS. REVENUE IN THE U-MOVE  \u00ae  PROGRAM COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED SHOULD WE FAIL TO EXECUTE IN ANY OF THESE AREAS. EVEN IF WE EXECUTE OUR PLANS, WE COULD SEE DECLINES IN REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFORESEEN EVENTS INCLUDING ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR HEIGHTENED COMPETITION THAT IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  35  WITH RESPECT TO OUR STORAGE BUSINESS, IN FISCAL 2019 WE HAVE ADDED NEW LOCATIONS AND EXPANDED EXISTING LOCATIONS. IN FISCAL 2020, WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING TO COMPLETE CURRENT PROJECTS, INCREASE OCCUPANCY IN OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF LOCATIONS AND ACQUIRE NEW LOCATIONS. NEW PROJECTS AND ACQUISITIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND PURSUED IF THEY FIT OUR LONG-TERM PLANS AND MEET OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K. SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR PLANS AND STRATEGY FOR OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDES FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  OVERVIEW  THE CONTAINER STORE\u00ae IS THE ORIGINAL AND LEADING SPECIALTY RETAILER OF STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ONLY NATIONAL RETAILER SOLELY DEVOTED TO THE CATEGORY. WE PROVIDE A COLLECTION OF CREATIVE, MULTIFUNCTIONAL AND CUSTOMIZABLE STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES AND ONLINE THROUGH A HIGH-SERVICE, DIFFERENTIATED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. OUR VISION IS TO BE A BELOVED BRAND AND THE FIRST CHOICE FOR CUSTOMIZED ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED, VERY BUSY AND PRIMARILY HOMEOWNERS WITH A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WE SERVICE THEM WITH STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS THAT HELP THEM ACCOMPLISH PROJECTS, MAXIMIZE THEIR SPACE, AND MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR HOME. WE BELIEVE AN ORGANIZED LIFE IS A HAPPY LIFE.  OUR OPERATIONS CONSIST OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS.  \u00b7  THE CONTAINER STORE (\u201cTCS\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF OUR RETAIL STORES, WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES), AS WELL AS OUR INSTALLATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE OPERATED 92 STORES WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF APPROXIMATELY 25,000 SQUARE FEET (19,000 SELLING SQUARE FEET) IN 33 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE ALSO OFFER ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, RESPONSIVE MOBILE SITE, AND CALL CENTER. OUR STORES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER CO-LOCATED WITH OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND CALL CENTER IN COPPELL, TEXAS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF OPENING A SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN LATE FISCAL 2019.  \u00b7  ELFA,  THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S WHOLLY OWNED SWEDISH SUBSIDIARY, ELFA INTERNATIONAL AB (\u201cELFA\u201d), DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURES COMPONENT\u2010BASED SHELVING AND DRAWER SYSTEMS AND MADE\u2010TO\u2010MEASURE SLIDING DOORS. ELFA WAS FOUNDED IN 1948 AND IS HEADQUARTERED IN MALMO\u0308, SWEDEN. ELFA\u2019S SHELVING AND DRAWER SYSTEMS ARE CUSTOMIZABLE FOR ANY AREA OF THE HOME, INCLUDING CLOSETS, KITCHENS, OFFICES AND GARAGES. ELFA OPERATES THREE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WITH TWO LOCATED IN SWEDEN AND ONE IN POLAND. THE CONTAINER STORE BEGAN SELLING ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS IN 1978 AND ACQUIRED ELFA IN 1999. TODAY OUR TCS SEGMENT IS THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. ELFA ALSO SELLS ITS PRODUCTS ON A WHOLESALE BASIS TO VARIOUS RETAILERS IN APPROXIMATELY 30 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH A CONCENTRATION IN THE NORDIC REGION OF EUROPE.  MANAGEMENT TRANSITION  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING LONG-TERM SUCCESSION PLANNING, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT MELISSA REIFF, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WILL SUCCEED WILLIAM A. (\u201cKIP\u201d) TINDELL, III AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (THE \u201c2019 ANNUAL MEETING\u201d).  THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT SHARON TINDELL, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER, WILL RETIRE FROM HER ROLE AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING. AT THAT TIME, JOHN GEHRE, WHO JOINED THE CONTAINER STORE IN JUNE 2018 AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF MERCHANDISING AND PLANNING, WILL SUCCEED MS. TINDELL AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER, AND MELISSA REIFF WILL ADD PRESIDENT TO HER TITLE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT JODI TAYLOR WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY UNTIL A MUTUALLY AGREED UPON DATE AFTER MARCH 1, 2020, BUT BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, AT WHICH POINT SHE WILL NO LONGER SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND A SUCCESSOR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WILL BE NAMED, BUT MS. TAYLOR WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS ON JANUARY 23, 2019 WITH MS. REIFF, MS. TINDELL, AND MS. TAYLOR.  EACH OF THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL GRANTS OF EQUITY AWARDS SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S 2013 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENTS THEREUNDER.  HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS  WE CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE KEY MEASURES WE USE TO DETERMINE HOW OUR BUSINESS IS PERFORMING ARE NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, GROSS MARGIN, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO REVIEW OTHER IMPORTANT OPERATING METRICS SUCH AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND NON-GAAP MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  OPTIMIZATION PLAN  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ON MAY 23, 2017, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED A FOUR-PART OPTIMIZATION PLAN TO DRIVE IMPROVED SALES AND PROFITABILITY (THE \u201cOPTIMIZATION PLAN\u201d). THIS PLAN INCLUDED SALES INITIATIVES, CERTAIN FULL-TIME POSITION ELIMINATIONS AT TCS, WHICH WERE CONCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017, ORGANIZATIONAL REALIGNMENT AT ELFA AND ONGOING SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCY EFFORTS.  THE COMPANY INCURRED PRE-TAX CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION IN FISCAL 2017. THE ANNUALIZED PRE-TAX SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN WERE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION WAS REALIZED IN FISCAL 2017.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A PRICE OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION OF PRE-TAX CHARGES IN FISCAL 2018 ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRICE OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE.  NET SALES  NET SALES REFLECT OUR SALES OF MERCHANDISE PLUS OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED, SUCH AS INSTALLATION, SHIPPING, DELIVERY, AND ORGANIZATION SERVICES, LESS RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS. NET SALES ALSO INCLUDE WHOLESALE SALES BY ELFA. REVENUE FROM OUR TCS SEGMENT IS RECOGNIZED UPON RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ELFA SEGMENT REVENUE IS RECORDED UPON SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE RETAIL AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE CYCLICAL, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR SALES ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SENSITIVE TO TRENDS IN THE LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME, HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE, CONSUMER DEBT, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES AND OVERALL CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.  OUR NET SALES ARE MODERATELY SEASONAL. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUES FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, WHICH OFTEN AFFECTS THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR INTERIM RESULTS. NET SALES ARE HISTORICALLY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF OUR ANNUAL ELFA  \u00ae  SALE, WHICH TRADITIONALLY BEGINS IN LATE DECEMBER AND RUNS INTO FEBRUARY.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IS EQUAL TO OUR NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IS REFERRED TO AS GROSS MARGIN. COST OF SALES IN OUR TCS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE PURCHASE COST OF INVENTORY LESS VENDOR REBATES, IN\u2010BOUND FREIGHT, AS WELL AS INVENTORY SHRINKAGE. DIRECT INSTALLATION AND ORGANIZATION COSTS, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED TO SHIP OR DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO CUSTOMERS, ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES IN OUR TCS SEGMENT. ELFA SEGMENT COST OF SALES FROM MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION, PRIMARILY MATERIAL, WAGES, FREIGHT AND OTHER VARIABLE COSTS, AND APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR COST OF SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPONENTS OF COST OF SALES OR SIMILAR MEASURES BY OTHER RETAILERS. AS A RESULT, DATA IN THIS REPORT REGARDING OUR GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY OTHER RETAILERS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT IS VARIABLE IN NATURE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWS CHANGES IN NET SALES. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, SALES FROM OUR TCS SEGMENT TYPICALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN THAN SALES TO THIRD PARTIES FROM OUR ELFA SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, SALES OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN THAN SALES OF SERVICES. GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT IS ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS CERTAIN PURCHASES OF ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS FROM OUR ELFA SEGMENT ARE IN SWEDISH KRONA, WHILE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN U.S. DOLLARS. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHEREBY WE HEDGE PURCHASES OF INVENTORY BY LOCKING IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN ADVANCE. SIMILARLY, GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS CERTAIN PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS ARE TRANSACTED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN SWEDISH KRONA, WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF ELFA.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE ALL OPERATING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION, AND PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS. FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT, THESE INCLUDE PAYROLL AND PAYROLL\u2010RELATED EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES, OCCUPANCY EXPENSES (WHICH INCLUDE RENT, REAL ESTATE TAXES, COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, TELEPHONE, PROPERTY INSURANCE, AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE), COSTS TO SHIP PRODUCT FROM THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO OUR STORES, AND SUPPLIES EXPENSES. WE ALSO INCUR COSTS FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION AND CORPORATE OFFICE OPERATIONS. FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT, THESE INCLUDE SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ALL EXPENSES RELATED TO OPERATIONS AT HEADQUARTERS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE EXCLUDED FROM BOTH GROSS PROFIT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE BOTH FIXED AND VARIABLE COMPONENTS AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH NET SALES. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPONENTS OF SIMILAR MEASURES OF OTHER RETAILERS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS WITH EXPECTED FUTURE STORE GROWTH AND THE OPENING OF OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN LATE FISCAL 2019.  PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS  NON\u2010CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND RELOCATING STORES, INCLUDING RENT, MARKETING EXPENSES, TRAVEL AND RELOCATION COSTS, TRAINING COSTS, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE INCLUDED IN PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPARABLE STORE SALES  A STORE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES CALCULATION ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SIXTEENTH FULL FISCAL MONTH FOLLOWING THE STORE\u2019S OPENING. COMPARABLE STORE SALES ARE NET OF DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS. WHEN A STORE IS RELOCATED, WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER SALES FROM THAT STORE TO BE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. A STORE TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE IN THE FISCAL MONTH IT IS CLOSED. THE STORE THEN BECOMES COMPARABLE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL MONTH IN WHICH IT REOPENS. NET SALES FROM OUR WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES) ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN CALCULATIONS OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES ALLOW US TO EVALUATE HOW OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IS PERFORMING BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN PERIOD\u2010OVER\u2010PERIOD NET SALES IN STORES THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS OR MORE. THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH METRIC IS AN OPERATING MEASURE INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING.  \u00b7  NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN OUR MERCHANDISE MIX;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN PRICING;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN TIMING OF PROMOTIONAL EVENTS OR HOLIDAYS; AND  \u00b7  WEATHER.  OPENING NEW STORES IS PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT A PORTION OF OUR NET SALES WILL COME FROM STORES NOT INCLUDED IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES CALCULATION. ACCORDINGLY, COMPARABLE STORE SALES IS ONLY ONE MEASURE WE USE TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN CONNECTION WITH COVENANT COMPLIANCE, EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, AND TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY, ITS EXECUTIVES AND OUR COVENANT COMPLIANCE, AS APPLICABLE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION UNDER OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. ADJUSTED EBITDA REFLECTS FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO EBITDA TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN NON\u2010CASH AND OTHER ITEMS, THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FOR RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, REFER TO \u201c  ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \u201d  ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED  WE USE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY. ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME BEFORE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, CERTAIN GAINS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, CERTAIN MANAGEMENT TRANSITION COSTS INCURRED AND BENEFITS REALIZED, CHARGES INCURRED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPTIMIZATION PLAN, CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY CLOSURE, AND THE TAX IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT TAX ITEMS. WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED AS ADJUSTED NET INCOME DIVIDED BY THE DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, REFER TO \u201c  ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA  .\u201d  ADJUSTMENT FOR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS  ADDITIONALLY, THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO REFERS TO ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES AFTER THE CONVERSION OF ELFA\u2019S NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DISCLOSURE OF ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE.  NOTE ON DOLLAR AMOUNTS  ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DATA REPRESENTS THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, MARCH 31, 2018 AND APRIL 1, 2017 EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND CERTAIN OPERATING DATA AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH METRIC IS AN OPERATING MEASURE INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  (2)  WE HAVE PRESENTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON\u2010RECURRING ITEMS. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN EVALUATING THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS.

ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES DECREASED $4,382 DURING FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, WHICH DECREASED THIRD PARTY NET SALES BY $4,832. AFTER CONVERTING ELFA\u2019S THIRD PARTY NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2017, ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES INCREASED $450 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES IN THE NORDIC MARKETS.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IN FISCAL 2018 INCREASED BY $26,622, OR 5.4%, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATED NET SALES COMBINED WITH HIGHER CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.

OTHER EXPENSES  OTHER EXPENSES WERE $177 IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO $5,734 IN FISCAL 2017. THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERANCE COSTS INCURRED IN FISCAL 2017 TO IMPLEMENT THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN.

ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED $2,082 OF LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN FISCAL 2018, COMPARED TO $2,369 OF LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN FISCAL 2017 AS A RESULT OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 WAS 1.3%, AS COMPARED TO -189.8% IN FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ENACTED IN FISCAL 2017, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $24,210 IN FISCAL 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL ACCRUAL OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $8,521.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2017 WAS -189.8%, AS COMPARED TO 38.6% FOR FISCAL 2016. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ENACTED IN FISCAL 2017, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $24,210 IN FISCAL 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL ACCRUAL OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $8,521.  THE COMPANY MADE PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF REMEASURING ITS DEFERRED TAX BALANCES DURING FISCAL 2017, AS WELL AS THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

SEASONALITY  OUR STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCT OFFERING MAKES US LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HOLIDAY SHOPPING PATTERNS THAN MANY RETAILERS. HISTORICALLY, OUR BUSINESS HAS REALIZED A HIGHER PORTION OF NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE, WHICH TRADITIONALLY STARTS IN LATE DECEMBER AND RUNS INTO FEBRUARY. OVER HALF OF OUR ADJUSTED NET INCOME WAS DERIVED IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017, AND 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, A $100,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW), AND THE SEK 140.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $15,062 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d BELOW), AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED THE ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW).  OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, DIRECT MATERIALS, PAYROLL, STORE RENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND UPDATING EXISTING STORES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING BUILDING OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES, TAXES RECEIVABLE AND TAXES PAYABLE. OUR LIQUIDITY FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF OUR BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND AS A RESULT, OUR BORROWINGS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER DURING THESE PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. OUR BORROWINGS GENERALLY INCREASE IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AS WE PREPARE FOR OUR ANNUAL SHELVING SALE, THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM OF LOANS, BONDS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT OR EQUITY, TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AT MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD $7,364 OF CASH, OF WHICH $4,192 WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $66,159 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY $9,551 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT MARCH 30, 2019. THERE WERE $4,428 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE.  PURSUANT TO THE TAX ACT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED. THE COMPANY FINALIZED THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNT FOR THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX IN FISCAL 2018. FUTURE AMOUNTS EARNED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES UPON TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IF THESE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN STATES.  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  A SUMMARY OF OUR KEY COMPONENTS AND MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30,  MARCH 31,  APRIL 1,  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $54,896  $62,176  $44,639  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (32,771)  (27,550)  (28,508)  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (22,007)  (37,688)  (13,981)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH  (1,153)  725  (223)  NET (DECREASE) INCREASE IN CASH  $(1,035)  $(2,337)  $1,927  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP) (1)  $21,226  $34,530  $16,124  (1)  SEE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON\u2010CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $54,896 FOR FISCAL 2018. NET INCOME OF $21,680 WAS COMBINED WITH NON-CASH ITEMS OF $41,898 (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS WELL AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) AND A DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $8,682. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY, A DECREASE IN NONCURRENT LIABILITIES AND A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASES IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW AVERA  TM  CUSTOM CLOSET LINE. THE DECREASE IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY RECORDED IN FISCAL 2017.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $62,176 FOR FISCAL 2017. NET INCOME OF $19,428 WAS COMBINED WITH NON-CASH ITEMS OF $19,941 (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OFFSET BY DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT) AND A DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $22,807. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALONG WITH INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IS DUE TO IMPROVED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT COMBINED WITH POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN FISCAL 2017. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A SHIFT IN TIMING OF RECEIPT OF REBATE AND LANDLORD RECEIVABLES DURING FISCAL 2017, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR BUSINESS SALES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE PROVISIONAL ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $44,639 FOR FISCAL 2016, AS NON\u2010CASH ITEMS (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS WELL AS STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES) OF $40,966 WERE COMBINED WITH $14,953 OF NET INCOME AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $11,280. THE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2016 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN CADENCY, COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STORES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR BUSINESS SALES, AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN TIMING OF RECEIPT OF REBATE AND LANDLORD RECEIVABLES DURING FISCAL 2016. THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A SHIFT IN THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS DURING FISCAL 2016.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORE OPENINGS, EXISTING STORE REMODELS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.

OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2016 WERE $28,515 WITH NEW STORE OPENINGS AND EXISTING STORE REMODELS ACCOUNTING FOR $16,001. THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $12,514 WERE PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $22,007 FOR FISCAL 2018. THIS INCLUDED NET PAYMENTS OF $37,001 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, $2,384 FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, AND $128 FOR TAXES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $37,688 FOR FISCAL 2017. THIS INCLUDED NET PAYMENTS OF $26,403 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, $11,246 FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, AND $39 FOR TAXES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $13,981 FOR FISCAL 2016, WHICH WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAYMENTS OF $5,496 PRIMARILY ON INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE NET PAYMENTS OF $5,000 ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2016, AND MADE NET PAYMENTS OF $3,485 ON THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD A TOTAL OF $66,159 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND $4,428 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THERE WERE $12,000 BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF MARCH 30, 2019.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, ELFA HAD A TOTAL OF $9,551 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND $5,511 OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  THE COMPANY PRESENTS FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH THE COMPANY DEFINES AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN A PERIOD MINUS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MADE IN THAT PERIOD, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES IT IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL LIQUIDITY, AS THE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW GENERATED IN ANY PERIOD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT REPAYMENT, INVESTMENT, AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY AND NON-DISCRETIONARY CASH USES. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT. OUR DEFINITION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT SOLELY REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS A MEASURE THAT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ALTHOUGH OTHER COMPANIES REPORT THEIR FREE CASH FLOW, NUMEROUS METHODS MAY EXIST FOR CALCULATING A COMPANY\u2019S FREE CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT, THE METHOD USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO CALCULATE OUR FREE CASH FLOW MAY DIFFER FROM THE METHODS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE THEIR FREE CASH FLOW.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A RECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO FREE CASH FLOW.

AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cSENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY\u201d). ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIFTH AMENDMENT (THE \u201cFIFTH AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AMENDED THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO SEPTEMBER 14, 2023, (II) DECREASE THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO 5.00% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 4.00% FOR BASE RATE LOANS, AND BEGINNING FROM THE DATE A COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS DELIVERED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 30, 2019, ALLOW THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO STEP DOWN TO 4.75% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 3.75% FOR BASE RATE LOANS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.75:1.00, AND (III) IMPOSE A 1.00% PREMIUM IF A VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT IS MADE FROM THE PROCEEDS OF A REPRICING TRANSACTION WITHIN 12 MONTHS AFTER SEPTEMBER 14, 2018. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. REPAID $20,000 OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WHICH REDUCED THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO $272,500.  THE CONTAINER STORE,  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INC. DREW DOWN A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $10,000 ON ITS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.  UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WE HAD $257,391 IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF MARCH 30, 2019 AND THE INTEREST RATE ON SUCH BORROWINGS IS LIBOR +5.00%, SUBJECT TO A LIBOR FLOOR OF 1.00%. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY PROVIDES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF $1,703 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023, WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2023.  THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTORS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS) (OTHER THAN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS) AND (B) A SECOND PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE ASSETS SECURING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, AND ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, AMONG THESE AN EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) REQUIREMENT. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS SYNDICATION AGENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d). THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS AUGUST 18, 2022.  THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE FACILITY IS $100,000. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST AT LIBOR +1.25%. IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES AN UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL REVOLVING FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF LENDER COMMITMENTS AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT PROCEEDS ARE TO BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND ALLOWS FOR SWING LINE ADVANCES OF UP TO $15,000 AND THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OF UP TO $40,000.  THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS LIMITED BY REFERENCE TO A BORROWING BASE FORMULA BASED UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND RESERVES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. AS A RESULT OF THE BORROWING BASE FORMULA, THE ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE LESS THAN THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY).  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, CONSISTING OF INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND (B) A SECOND-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, AND ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS). OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A CONSOLIDATED FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0 IF EXCESS AVAILABILITY IS LESS THAN $10,000 AT ANY TIME. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON APRIL 1, 2014, ELFA ENTERED INTO A MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK AB (\u201cNORDEA\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF AN SEK 60.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $6,455 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) TERM LOAN FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY\u201d) AND AN SEK 140.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $15,062 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY,\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE \u201c2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES TERM BEGAN ON AUGUST 29, 2014 AND MATURES ON AUGUST 29, 2019. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS PAID ON FEBRUARY 18, 2018, WHICH WAS PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE. ELFA WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 3.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $323 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019). THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA\u2019S BASE RATE +1.4%. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2016, ELFA AND NORDEA AGREED THAT THE STATED RATES WOULD APPLY THROUGH MATURITY.  THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICTED ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES. IN ADDITION, ELFA IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN (I) A CONSOLIDATED EQUITY RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF NOT LESS THAN 30% IN YEAR ONE AND NOT LESS THAN 32.5% THEREAFTER AND (II) A CONSOLIDATED RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF LESS THAN 3.2, THE CONSOLIDATED EQUITY RATIO TESTED AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER AND THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA TESTED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, ELFA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) HAD OCCURRED.  2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED THE 2014 ELFA FACILITIES AND ENTERED INTO A MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK ABP, FILIAL I SVERIGE (\u201cNORDEA BANK\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF (I) AN SEK 110.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $11,834 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d), (II) UPON ELFA\u2019S REQUEST, AN ADDITIONAL SEK 115.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $12,372 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ADDITIONAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY, THE \u201c2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES\u201d), AND (III) AN UNCOMMITTED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 25.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $2,690 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF NORDEA BANK\u2019S COMMITMENT AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY\u201d, TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES, THE \u201c2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE TERM FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES BEGAN ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND MATURES ON APRIL 1, 2024. LOANS BORROWED UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA BANK\u2019S BASE RATE +1.40%. ANY LOAN BORROWED UNDER THE INCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT STIBOR +1.70%.  THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SECURED BY THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS OF ELFA. THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES.

MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ON\u2010GOING BASIS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT OR COMPLEXITY AND ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO REPORTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, AND ARE THEREFORE DISCUSSED AS CRITICAL. THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, EVEN A RELATIVELY MINOR VARIANCE BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED EXPERIENCE CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A MATERIALLY FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON SUBSEQUENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. MORE INFORMATION ON ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 1\u2014  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  TO OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES AND THE RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT WHEN MERCHANDISE IS RECEIVED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF SHIPMENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED BY THE CUSTOMER. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON SHIPPING TERMS AND HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES AND THE RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT UPON SHIPMENT.  WE RECOGNIZE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AS REVENUE WHEN THE MERCHANDISE IS SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER. COSTS OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD. WE RECOGNIZE FEES FOR INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES AS REVENUE UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. COSTS OF INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD.  SALES TAX COLLECTED IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS IT IS ULTIMATELY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  WE RESERVE FOR PROJECTED MERCHANDISE RETURNS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE. THE RESERVE REDUCES SALES AND COST OF SALES, ACCORDINGLY. MERCHANDISE EXCHANGES OF SIMILAR PRODUCT AND PRICE ARE NOT CONSIDERED MERCHANDISE RETURNS AND, THEREFORE, ARE EXCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING THE SALES RETURNS RESERVE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES AT RETAIL STORES ARE COMPRISED OF FINISHED GOODS AND ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST DETERMINED ON A WEIGHTED\u2010AVERAGE COST METHOD INCLUDING ASSOCIATED IN-BOUND FREIGHT COSTS. MANUFACTURING INVENTORIES ARE COMPRISED OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK IN PROCESS, AND FINISHED GOODS AND ARE VALUED ON A FIRST\u2010IN, FIRST OUT BASIS USING FULL ABSORPTION ACCOUNTING WHICH INCLUDES MATERIAL, LABOR, OTHER VARIABLE COSTS, AND OTHER APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. TO DETERMINE IF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY IS RECOVERABLE AT COST, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED DEMAND, CUSTOMER PREFERENCE AND THE MERCHANDISE AGE. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES USED IN INVENTORY VALUATION ARE OBSOLESCENCE (INCLUDING EXCESS AND SLOW\u2010MOVING INVENTORY) AND ESTIMATES OF INVENTORY SHRINKAGE. WE ADJUST OUR INVENTORY FOR OBSOLESCENCE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, AGING REPORTS, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION AND OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RETAIL SALES PRICES.  RESERVES FOR SHRINKAGE ARE ESTIMATED AND RECORDED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINKAGE RESULTS AND CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS. ACTUAL SHRINKAGE IS RECORDED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED UPON PERIODIC CYCLE COUNTS. ACTUAL INVENTORY SHRINKAGE CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES DUE TO FACTORS INCLUDING THE MIX OF OUR INVENTORY AND EXECUTION AGAINST LOSS PREVENTION INITIATIVES IN OUR STORES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DUE TO THESE FACTORS, OUR OBSOLESCENCE AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES. BOTH ESTIMATES HAVE CALCULATIONS THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS REGARDING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE SELLING ENVIRONMENT, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND CURRENT INVENTORY TRENDS. IF ACTUAL OBSOLESCENCE OR SHRINKAGE ESTIMATES CHANGE FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, WE WILL ADJUST OUR INVENTORY RESERVES ACCORDINGLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THESE ESTIMATES WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR INVENTORY BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATIONS OF THE OBSOLESCENCE AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES UTILIZING THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 REQUIRES AN ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE\u2010LIKELY\u2010THAN\u2010NOT THAT THE REALIZATION OF THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT OCCUR. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RELEASED AS POSITIVE EVIDENCE OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME SUFFICIENT TO REALIZE THE UNDERLYING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BECOMES AVAILABLE (E.G., THREE\u2010YEAR CUMULATIVE FINANCIAL INCOME).  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS WHEN THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM A CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT OF THE CHANGE. CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  WE OPERATE IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASC 740\u201030 PROVIDES THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE UNDER THE PRESUMPTION THAT ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE PARENT COMPANY AS A DIVIDEND. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF THE INTENT TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THE EARNINGS IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE EARNED PRECLUDES A COMPANY FROM RECORDING THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE. FOR PURPOSES OF ASC 740\u201030, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EARNINGS SUBJECT TO THE TRANSITION TAX UNDER THE TAX ACT PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  ALL OTHER EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  LEASES  RENT EXPENSE ON OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING RENT HOLIDAYS AND SCHEDULED RENT INCREASES, IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT\u2010LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, COMMENCING ON THE DATE WE TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LEASED PROPERTY. RENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PRE\u2010OPENING RENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE NET EXCESS OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE ACTUAL CASH PAID HAS BEEN RECORDED AS DEFERRED RENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS DEFERRED RENT LIABILITIES AND ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE FROM THE POSSESSION DATE. CONTINGENT RENTAL PAYMENTS, TYPICALLY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN RENT EXPENSE WHEN PAYMENT OF THE CONTINGENT RENT IS PROBABLE.  INTANGIBLES AND LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS  GOODWILL  WE EVALUATE GOODWILL ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS IMPAIRED. GOODWILL IS ALSO TESTED BETWEEN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET. IF AN IMPAIRMENT INDICATOR EXISTS, WE TEST GOODWILL FOR RECOVERABILITY. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTING UNITS AND WE HAVE SELECTED THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER TO PERFORM OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING.  PRIOR TO TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATE THAT  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMPAIRMENT IS GREATER THAN 50%, THEN WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL. TO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING THE INCOME APPROACH, AS WELL AS A MARKET APPROACH TO COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE TO COMPARABLE COMPANIES. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES OF MANY CRITICAL FACTORS, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS, OUR NATURE AND OUR HISTORY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECTING US, OUR INDUSTRY AND THE GENERAL ECONOMY, PAST RESULTS, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS, SALES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES OR CAPITAL STOCK OF PUBLICLY HELD SIMILAR BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS PRICES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PAST SALES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES. FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATIONS ARE BASED, IN PART, ON OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS TO ESTIMATE INDUSTRY ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF FUTURE BUSINESS STRATEGIES. IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  TRADE NAMES  WE ANNUALLY EVALUATE WHETHER THE TRADE NAMES CONTINUE TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE. TRADE NAMES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND MAY BE REVIEWED MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE PRESENT. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET, A PRODUCT RECALL OR AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. IF THE RECORDED CARRYING VALUE OF THE TRADE NAME EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO WRITE THE TRADE NAME DOWN TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FACTORS USED IN THE VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATED MARKET ROYALTY RATES THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE LICENSING OF OUR TRADE NAMES TO THIRD PARTIES, AND A RATE USED TO DISCOUNT THE ESTIMATED ROYALTY CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE (OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE).  THE VALUATION OF TRADE NAMES REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES OF MANY CRITICAL FACTORS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTORS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cGOODWILL\u201d ABOVE. FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATIONS ARE BASED, IN PART, ON OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS TO ESTIMATE INDUSTRY ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF FUTURE BUSINESS STRATEGIES. IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS  LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET, A PRODUCT RECALL OR AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR. IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ASSET ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE, USUALLY DETERMINED BY THE ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS OF THE ASSET.  FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT, WE GENERALLY EVALUATE LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE STORE LEVEL, WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL AT WHICH INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. WE EVALUATE CORPORATE ASSETS OR OTHER LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE NOT STORE\u2010SPECIFIC AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT, WE EVALUATE LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SINCE THERE IS TYPICALLY NO ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS, WE ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES BASED ON THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON STORE\u2010LEVEL HISTORICAL RESULTS, CURRENT TRENDS, AND OPERATING AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE REASONABLE, FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED IF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AS PROJECTED, DO NOT OCCUR OR IF EVENTS CHANGE REQUIRING US TO REVISE OUR ESTIMATES.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AT  TRIBUTABLE TO US ARE EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED BY THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS.  CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS  OUR GLOBAL ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS, WHICH HAD BEEN IN A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AND WHICH CONTINUED THROUGH FISCAL 2019.  SUCH STABILIZATION IN CRUDE OIL PRICES AND IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO INCREASED ACTIVITY BY OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE DOWNSTREAM ENERGY SECTOR.  CUSTOMERS HAVE BEGUN TO INVEST IN UPGRADING AND TURNAROUND MAINTENANCE FOR EXISTING FACILITIES AND, IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES, ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT NEW CAPACITY.  WHILE THIS ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY IS ENCOURAGING, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE PACE AT WHICH A RECOVERY WILL PROGRESS OR IF IT WILL CONTINUE.  OUR LONG-TERM VIEW FOR THE GLOBAL ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS IS THAT GENERAL ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS WILL DRIVE INCREASING DEMAND AND RESULT IN CONTINUED CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO SATISFY INCREASING GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND. THESE FUNDAMENTALS INCLUDE RISING POPULATIONS, STRONG EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC EXPANSION.  OUR NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION MARKET HAS DEMAND TIED TO AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND SUBMARINE VESSEL CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES OF THE PRIMARY SHIPYARDS WHO SERVICE THE U.S. NAVY.  WE EXPECT GROWTH IN OUR NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION BUSINESS TO RESULT FROM OUR STRATEGIC ACTIONS TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, OUR SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE, AND EXPECTED INCREASES IN DEMAND.  WE BELIEVE THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK IN OUR KEY MARKETS SUPPORTS OUR GROWTH PLANS. IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW ORDER LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN VARIABLE, RESULTING IN BOTH RELATIVELY STRONG AND WEAK PERIODS.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, ORDER ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.  THE CHART BELOW SHOWS THE IMPACT OF OUR DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY.  OVER HALF OF OUR CURRENT BACKLOG IS FROM MARKETS NOT SERVED BY US IN THE FISCAL 2007-2009 TIME FRAME.  INCLUDED IN THE GRAPH BELOW IS $8,039 FOR ENERGY STEEL, A BUSINESS WHICH IS CURRENTLY HELD FOR SALE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018  SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE $91,831, UP 18% AS COMPARED WITH SALES OF $77,534 FOR FISCAL 2018.  DOMESTIC SALES WERE $59,441 OR 65% OF TOTAL SALES, UP FROM $51,950 OR 67% OF TOTAL SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  DOMESTIC SALES INCREASED $7,491, OR 14%, COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2018.  INTERNATIONAL SALES ACCOUNTED FOR $32,390, OR 35% OF TOTAL SALES, FOR FISCAL 2019, UP FROM $25,584, OR 33% OF TOTAL SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  INTERNATIONAL SALES INCREASED $6,806 OR 27%, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  BY MARKET, SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE 50% TO THE REFINING INDUSTRY (UP FROM 28% IN FISCAL 2018), 18% TO THE CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES (DOWN FROM 27% IN FISCAL 2018), 11% TO THE POWER MARKETS (DOWN FROM 14% IN FISCAL 2018), AND 21% TO DEFENSE AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (DOWN FROM 31% IN FISCAL 2018).  OUR GROSS MARGIN FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS 23.9% COMPARED WITH 21.9% FOR FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPROVED PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF CAPACITY.  GROSS PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2019 INCREASED $4,934, OR 29% COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND HIGHER GROSS MARGIN AS NOTED ABOVE, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  SG&A EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $17,878, UP 13% OR $2,109, COMPARED WITH $15,769 IN FISCAL 2018.  SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN FISCAL 2019 WAS 19.5% OF SALES COMPARED WITH 20.3% OF SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE DECIDED TO SELL OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS THAT WE OPERATE UNDER OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY ENERGY STEEL.  WE REVIEWED THE MARKET VALUE OF THE BUSINESS AT SUCH TIME AND DETERMINED THE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED BASED ON SUCH MARKET VALUE.  WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS RELATED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF ENERGY STEEL.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS WERE NEGLIGIBLE, DUE TO EROSION OF THE ENERGY STEEL BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY INDUSTRY.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $1,700, $2,000, $1,208, $1,222, AND $319 FOR PERMITS, TRADENAME, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, GOODWILL, AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY.  THE TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS $6,449 BEFORE TAXES AND $5,320 AFTER TAXES.  THE REMAINING VALUE OF THE BUSINESS IS NET WORKING CAPITAL.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT REVIEW.  WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL OF OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS RELATED TO THE DECEMBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ENERGY STEEL.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PERMITS, TRADENAME AND GOODWILL OF THE BUSINESS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE DUE TO REDUCED INVESTMENT FROM THE U.S. COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY MARKET, THE STRENGTH OF THE ENERGY STEEL BRAND RELATIVE TO LARGER MORE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLIERS, AND THE BANKRUPTCY OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY WHICH RESULTED IN THE STOPPAGE OF WORK AT THE SUMMER, SOUTH CAROLINA NUCLEAR FACILITY.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $8,600, $500, AND $5,716 FOR PERMITS, TRADENAME, AND GOODWILL, RESPECTIVELY.  THE TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS $14,816 BEFORE TAXES AND $12,014 AFTER TAXES.  ADDITIONALLY, WE INCURRED A $46 REVENUE REVERSAL, AND A $234 BAD DEBT CHARGE, RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY AND THE STOPPAGE OF WORK AT THE SUMMER, SOUTH CAROLINA NUCLEAR FACILITY.  THE TOTAL BEFORE AND AFTER TAX COST OF THESE TWO CHARGES WAS $280 AND $193, RESPECTIVELY.  ADDITIONALLY, WE RECOGNIZED A BENEFIT OF $786 RELATED TO THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATES FROM THE TAX ACT.  THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $786 INCLUDED $839 OF EXPENSE FOR ADJUSTING THE RATES ON THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF THE ENERGY STEEL ACQUISITION OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF $1,625 FOR OTHER TAX ITEMS.  IN FISCAL 2018, WE INCURRED A PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $316 ($224 AFTER TAX) FOR SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  THERE WERE NO SUCH CHARGES IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST INCOME FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $1,462, UP FROM $606 IN FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $12, THE SAME AMOUNT AS IN FISCAL 2018.  23  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS NOT MEANINGFUL IN FISCAL 2019, AS WE HAD A TAX EXPENSE DESPITE A PRE-TAX LOSS, DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE GOODWILL PORTION OF THE WRITE DOWN FOR OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WE INCURRED FROM OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS 20%.  THIS COMPARES TO AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 OF 23%.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WE INCURRED FROM OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS AND THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS 31%.  NET (LOSS) AND (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL 2019, WERE ($308) AND ($0.03), RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH NET (LOSS) AND (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE OF ($9,844) AND ($1.01), RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2018.  EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS IN EACH OF FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN FISCAL 2018, NET INCOME AND INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE $5,012 AND $0.51, RESPECTIVELY, AND  FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $1,801 AND $0.18, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY EARNINGS.  ON MARCH 31, 2019, OUR NET BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WAS $10.05, DOWN FROM $10.58 AT MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS APPEARING IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  CASH AND INVESTMENTS  $77,753  $76,479  WORKING CAPITAL  (1)  79,896  78,105  WORKING CAPITAL RATIO  (2)  2.5  3.1  WORKING CAPITAL EXCLUDING CASH AND INVESTMENTS  2,143  1,626  WORKING CAPITAL EXCLUDING CASH AND INVESTMENTS AS A  PERCENT OF NET SALES  2.3%  2.1%  (1)  WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES.  (2)  WORKING CAPITAL RATIO EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE USE THE ABOVE RATIOS TO ASSESS OUR LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH.  NET  CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $7,917, COMPARED WITH $8,511 FOR FISCAL 2018.  THE $594 DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED WAS DUE TO CASH USAGE FROM UNBILLED REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WHICH WERE BOTH CASH USAGES IN FISCAL 2019 BUT WERE CASH GENERATORS IN FISCAL 2018, MOSTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS, CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  CAPITAL SPENDING IN FISCAL 2019 WAS $2,138, COMPARED WITH $2,051 IN FISCAL 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018 WERE APPROXIMATELY 80% FOR FACILITIES ALONG WITH MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT AND THE REMAINING 20% FOR ALL OTHER ITEMS.  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE $3,834 IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH $3,517 I  N FISCAL 2018.  CASH AND INVESTMENTS WERE $77,753 AT MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH $76,479 AT MARCH 31, 2018, UP $1,274 OR 2%.  24  WE INVEST NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IN EXCESS OF CASH HELD FOR NEAR-TERM NEEDS IN SHORT-TERM, LESS THAN 365 DAYS, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS OR U.S. GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY WITH MATURITY PERIODS OF UP TO 180 DAYS.  OUR MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT IS USED TO SECURITIZE OUR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES OUR COST ON THOSE LETTERS OF CREDIT.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS ARE HELD IN THE U.S.  THE REMAINING 5% IS INVESTED IN OUR CHINA OPERATIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020 (WHICH WE REFER TO AS \"FISCAL 2020\") ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $2,500 AND $2,800.  APPROXIMATELY 75% TO 80% OF OUR FISCAL 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, WITH THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE USED FOR OTHER ITEMS.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH JP MORGAN CHASE, N.A. (\"JP MORGAN CHASE\") PROVIDES US WITH A LINE OF CREDIT OF $25,000, INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND BANK GUARANTEES.  IN ADDITION, OUR JP MORGAN CHASE AGREEMENT ALLOWS US TO INCREASE THE LINE OF CREDIT, AT OUR DISCRETION, UP TO ANOTHER $25,000, FOR TOTAL AVAILABILITY OF $50,000.  BORROWINGS UNDER THIS CREDIT FACILITY ARE SECURED BY ALL OF OUR ASSETS.  WE ALSO HAVE A $5,000 UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT WITH HSBC, N.A. (\"HSBC\").  LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING ON MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018 WERE $8,503 AND $8,233, RESPECTIVELY.  THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WERE ISSUED BY JP MORGAN CHASE, HSBC, AS WELL AS BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (UNDER OUR PREVIOUS CREDIT FACILITY).  THERE WERE NO OTHER AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING ON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  THE BORROWING RATE UNDER OUR JP MORGAN CHASE FACILITY AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS THE BANK\u2019S PRIME RATE, OR 5.50%.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE JP MORGAN CHASE AND HSBC LINES OF CREDIT WAS $22,505 AND $24,336 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, COMBINED WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE BOTH TO MEET OUR CASH NEEDS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CONTRACTUAL AND COMMERCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT FIVE FISCAL YEARS ENDING MARCH 31 AND THEREAFTER WERE AS FOLLOWS.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  TOTAL  LESS THAN  1 YEAR  1 \u2013 3  YEARS  3 \u2013 5  YEARS  THEREAFTER  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (1)  $172  $62  $73  $37  $\u2014  OPERATING LEASES  (1)  879  501  338  40  \u2014  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  (2)  78  78  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  ACCRUED PENSION LIABILITY  662  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  662  TOTAL  $1,791  $641  $411  $77  $662  (1)  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  (2)  AMOUNTS REPRESENT ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTIONS DURING FISCAL 2019 TO OUR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN, WHICH PROVIDES HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND ELIGIBLE SURVIVORS OF RETIREES.  ON FEBRUARY 4, 2003, WE TERMINATED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR OUR U.S. EMPLOYEES.  BENEFITS PAYABLE TO RETIREES OF RECORD ON APRIL 1, 2003 REMAINED UNCHANGED.  WE EXPECT TO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PLANS BEYOND ONE YEAR, BUT SUCH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED.  NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR FISCAL 2020.  ORDERS AND BACKLOG  ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 10% TO $101,241 FROM $112,230 IN FISCAL 2018.  ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019, EXCLUDING THE BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE, WERE $90,222, DOWN FROM $104,611 IN FISCAL 2018.  ORDERS REPRESENT COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS REQUESTING US TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON ORDERS RECEIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY DESCRIBED IN NOTES 1 AND 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DOMESTIC ORDERS WERE 61%, OR $62,205, AND INTERNATIONAL ORDERS WERE 39%, OR $39,036, OF OUR TOTAL NET ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019.  THIS COMPARED TO NET DOMESTIC ORDERS OF $77,126, OR 69%, OF TOTAL NET ORDERS, AND INTERNATIONAL ORDERS OF $35,104, OR 31%, OF OUR TOTAL ORDERS IN FISCAL 2018.   DOMESTIC ORDERS DECREASED BY $14,921, OR 19% AS A RESULT OF WEAKER ORDERS FOR THE U.S. NAVY BUSINESS (WE RECEIVED AN ATYPICAL ORDER FOR APPROXIMATELY $25,000 FOR WORK RELATED TO THE U.S. NAVY IN FISCAL 2018) AND REFINING MARKET, OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND IN THE PETROCHEMICAL PROCESSING AND NUCLEAR MARKET INDUSTRIES.  NET INTERNATIONAL ORDERS INCREASED BY $3,932, OR 11% IN FISCAL 2019.  25  BACKLOG WAS  $132,127  AT MARCH 31, 2019, UP 12% COMPARED WITH $117,946 AT MARCH 31, 2018.  BACKLOG WAS $124,088, EXCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS WHICH IS BEING HEL  D FOR SALE.  BACKLOG IS DEFINED BY US AS THE TOTAL DOLLAR VALUE OF ORDERS RECEIVED FOR WHICH REVENUE HAS NOT YET BEEN RECOGNIZED.  ALL ORDERS IN BACKLOG REPRESENT ORDERS FROM OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS IN ESTABLISHED PRODUCT LINES.  APPROXIMATELY 55% TO 60% O  F ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG ARE EXPECTED TO BE CONVERTED TO SALES WITHIN ONE YEAR.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 22% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EQUIPMENT FOR REFINERY PROJECT WORK, 19% FOR CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL PROJECTS, 7% FOR POWER,  INCLUDING NUCLEAR ENERGY (89% OF WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED HELD FOR SALE AS NOTED ABOVE), 49% FOR U.S. NAVY PROJECTS AND 3% FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2018, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EQUIPMENT FOR  REFINERY PROJECT WORK, 5% FOR CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL PROJECTS, 5% FOR POWER, INCLUDING NUCLEAR ENERGY, 56% FOR U.S. NAVY PROJECTS AND 4% FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NO PROJECTS ON HOLD.  OUTLOOK  CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE ENERGY MARKETS WE SERVE BEGAN TO INCREASE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AND CONTINUED THROUGH FISCAL 2019. ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THE REFINING MARKET WERE MUCH STRONGER IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 THAN THEY HAD BEEN IN THE THREE YEARS PRIOR.  ORDERS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKET BEGAN TO INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019.  IN GENERAL, REFINING AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY END MARKETS CONTINUE TO MEASUREDLY RELEASE ORDERS.  WHILE OUR BIDDING ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED A ROBUST PIPELINE OF POTENTIAL ORDERS, FINAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND ORDER PLACEMENTS BY CUSTOMERS REMAIN MEASURED.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, 49% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS FOR THE U.S. NAVY.  OUR PIPELINE CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST, BUT QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN ORDER LEVELS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS.  COUPLED WITH OUR DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY WITH THE U.S. NAVY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF OUR MARKETS WILL SUPPORT OUR GOAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY GROW OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE INVESTED IN CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS TO EXPAND THE WORK WE DO FOR THE U.S. NAVY.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN BOTH OUR EXISTING AND ANCILLARY MARKETS.  WE ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING EARNINGS VOLATILITY, GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND DIVERSIFYING OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LINES.  WE EXPECT REVENUE IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $95,000 TO $100,000; THIS EXCLUDES THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS WHICH IS HELD FOR SALE.  THIS WOULD BE AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE OF 14% TO 20% WHEN COMPARED WITH $83,495 FOR FISCAL 2019 WHEN EXCLUDING THE HELD FOR SALE BUSINESS.  WE PROJECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 55% TO 60% OF OUR MARCH 31, 2019 BACKLOG, EXCLUDING BACKLOG HELD FOR SALE, WILL CONVERT TO SALES IN FISCAL 2020.  WE EXPECT THE REMAINING BACKLOG WILL CONVERT BEYOND FISCAL 2020, WHICH INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF U.S. NAVY ORDERS THAT HAVE A LONG CONVERSION CYCLE (UP TO FIVE YEARS) AS WELL AS CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ORDERS, THE CONVERSION OF WHICH HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE EXPECT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE IN THE 23% TO 24% RANGE, COMPARED WITH 23.9% IN FISCAL 2019.  SG&A DURING FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $17,000 AND $18,000.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DURING FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20%.  WE EXPECT THAT CASH FLOW IN FISCAL 2020 WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOLID.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS IS GOOD AND EXPECT WE WILL HAVE MORE CLARITY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ONGOING RECOVERY AS WE WORK THROUGH FISCAL 2020.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY FROM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS ALLEGEDLY CONTAINED IN, OR ACCOMPANYING, OUR PRODUCTS.  WE ARE A CO-DEFENDANT WITH NUMEROUS OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THESE LAWSUITS AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.  THE CLAIMS ARE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS ASBESTOS LAWSUITS THAT NAMED US AS A DEFENDANT.  SUCH PREVIOUS LAWSUITS EITHER WERE DISMISSED WHEN IT WAS SHOWN THAT WE HAD NOT SUPPLIED PRODUCTS TO THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PLACES OF WORK OR WERE SETTLED BY US FOR IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS.  WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT ANY PENDING OR FUTURE MATTERS WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PREVIOUS LAWSUITS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THE LAWSUITS TO WHICH WE ARE, OR MAY BECOME, A PARTY TO CANNOT BE DETERMINED AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS CANNOT BE MADE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE OUTCOMES, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  26  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT REFLECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION 606, \"REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\" (\"ASC 606\"), WHICH IT ADOPTED ON APRIL 1, 2018 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON ALL CONTRACTS WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  CONTROL IS GENERALLY TRANSFERRED WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED, TITLE IS TRANSFERRED, SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED, WE HAVE RIGHTS TO PAYMENT, AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.  CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE MAY ALSO BE A FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT HAS TRANSFERRED.  ALTHOUGH REVENUE ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS, AS MEASURED BY NUMBER OF CONTRACTS, IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE ON LARGER CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE FEWER IN NUMBER BUT GENERALLY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF REVENUE, IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THESE CONTRACTS MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN ASC 606.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN INDICATORS ARE PRESENT.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING ANNUALLY OR EARLIER IF AN EVENT OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT MAY HAVE BEEN REDUCED BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT, IS RECORDED.  FAIR VALUES FOR REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING SUCH AMOUNTS.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, SALARY GROWTH, HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND OTHER ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS.  WE BASE THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR OUR PLANS ON MOODY'S OR CITIGROUP PENSION LIABILITY INDEX AA-RATED CORPORATE LONG-TERM BOND YIELD RATE.  THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON THE PLAN\u2019S ASSET ALLOCATION, HISTORICAL RETURNS AND EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE RETURNS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIFE OF THE PLAN LIABILITIES THAT WILL BE FUNDED WITH THE PLAN ASSETS.  THE SALARY GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON LONG-TERM ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK.  THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL COST AND PAYMENT DATA, THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF LIKELY LONG-TERM TRENDS.  INCOME TAXES.  WE USE THE LIABILITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES.  UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF LIABILITIES AND ASSETS MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX RATE.  DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING CURRENT TAX RATES.  WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND OTHER POSSIBLE SOURCES OF REALIZATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO REDUCE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS TO AN AMOUNT THAT REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS OF SUCH DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. DURING THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DO NOT MEET THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE LAPSE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO THE RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  WE HAVE EVALUATED THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND BELIEVE THOSE POLICIES TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.  27  WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATE TO LABOR HOUR ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHMENT OF OPERATIONAL MILESTONES WHICH ARE US  ED TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME, FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, UNDER WHICH WE ACCRUE A LOSS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN  INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\" WE RECOGNIZE A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE USING AN OVER-TIME RECOGNITION METHOD.  THE KEY ESTIMATE FOR THE OVER-TIME RECOGNITION MODEL IS TOTAL LABOR TO BE INCURRED ON EACH CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS ESTIMATE CHANGES, IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN EACH PERIOD.  AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE ANTICIPATE CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR OVER-TIME REVENUE RECOGNITION WHICH MAY CAUSE INORDINATE QUARTER-TO-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-YEAR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE VOLATILITY.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE ASSESS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT, IS RECORDED.  FAIR VALUES FOR REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE.  CONTINGENCIES, BY THEIR NATURE, RELATE TO UNCERTAINTIES THAT REQUIRE US TO EXERCISE JUDGMENT BOTH IN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AS WELL AS IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL LOSS.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS, SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE COST OF BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED WELL INTO THE FUTURE AND ATTRIBUTING THAT COST OVER THE TIME PERIOD EACH EMPLOYEE WORKS.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, EXTENSIVE USE IS MADE OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT INFLATION, INVESTMENT RETURNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER, MEDICAL COSTS AND DISCOUNT RATES.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY.  THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS EXPENSE (INCOME) IS DETERMINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ACTUARY BY REFERENCE TO A CURRENT YIELD CURVE AND BY CONSIDERING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.  THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS 3.95% FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND 3.63% FOR OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN.  A REDUCTION IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OF 50 BASIS POINTS, WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE INCREASED FISCAL 2019 NET PERIODIC BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN BY APPROXIMATELY $451 AND $0, RESPECTIVELY.  THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION OF 8.0% USED IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR PENSION PLAN IS DETERMINED BY EVALUATING THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS THAT COMPRISE PLAN ASSETS AND EXTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS.  A REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF RETURN OF 50 BASIS POINTS, WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE INCREASED FISCAL 2019 NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $191.  DURING FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, THE PENSION PLAN RELEASED LIABILITIES FOR VESTED BENEFITS OF CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF NONPARTICIPATING ANNUITY CONTRACTS WITH A THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE COMPANY.  AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, IN FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION DECREASED $1,589 AND $890, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE PLAN ASSETS DECREASED $1,718 AND $998, RESPECTIVELY.  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS, A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS UNDERTAKEN INVOLVING OUR MANAGERS WITH FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FINANCIAL, CREDIT, TAX, ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND BENEFIT MATTERS, AND OUTSIDE ADVISORS SUCH AS LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND ACTUARIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR JUDGMENTS AND TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K RELATED TO REVENUE, CONTINGENCIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER MATTERS REQUIRING THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ALTHOUGH ACTUAL OUTCOMES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE SEC, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE, THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS OR ANY OTHER AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING BODY TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR  28  DISCUSSION OF THE NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SEE  ''  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING CHANGES  ''  IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS AN  NUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  YOU SHOULD READ THIS DISCUSSION TOGETHER WITH OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. IN ADDITION  TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  THAT INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS COULD DIFFER  MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING  THOSE DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A OF THIS REPORT.  GENERAL  WE DEVELOP AND SELL DEVICES THAT USE \u201cSPINTRONICS,\u201d  A NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT RELIES ON ELECTRON SPIN RATHER THAN ELECTRON CHARGE TO ACQUIRE,  STORE, AND TRANSMIT INFORMATION. WE MANUFACTURE HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPINTRONIC PRODUCTS  INCLUDING SENSORS AND COUPLERS TO REVOLUTIONIZE DATA SENSING AND TRANSMISSION.  WE ALSO RECEIVE CONTRACTS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ARE A LICENSOR OF SPINTRONIC  MAGNETORESISTIVE RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY TECHNOLOGY, COMMONLY KNOWN AS MRAM.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC GUIDANCE, THOSE MATERIAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO AN INVESTOR\u2019S  UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION AND REQUIRE COMPLEX MANAGEMENT  JUDGMENT ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  OUR INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS.  WE HAVE GENERALLY INVESTED EXCESS CASH IN HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT GRADE LONG-TERM  MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH LESS THAN FIVE YEARS TO MATURITY. WE CLASSIFY ALL OF  OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, THUS SECURITIES ARE RECORDED  AT FAIR VALUE AND ANY ASSOCIATED UNREALIZED GAIN OR LOSS, NET OF TAX, IS INCLUDED  AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, \u201cACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.\u201d IF WE JUDGED A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE FOR ANY  SECURITY TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SECURITY  WOULD BE WRITTEN DOWN AND A CHARGE RECOGNIZED TO NET INCOME. THE FAIR VALUES FOR  OUR SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES AS OF THE VALUATION  DATE AND OBSERVABLE PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS. WE CONSIDER A NUMBER OF FACTORS  IN DETERMINING WHETHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, INCLUDING: CREDIT  MARKET CONDITIONS; THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE SECURITIES; HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATES  FOR SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE CREDIT RATING; THE PRESENCE OF INSURANCE OF THE SECURITIES  AND, IF INSURED, THE CREDIT RATING AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INSURER; THE  EFFECT OF MARKET INTEREST RATES ON THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES; AND THE DURATION  AND EXTENT OF ANY UNREALIZED LOSSES. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL  BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITIES PRIOR TO MATURITY BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS. IF ANY OF THESE CONDITIONS AND ESTIMATES CHANGE IN  THE FUTURE, OR, IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES ARE USED, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS  MAY CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AND COULD RESULT IN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET  REALIZABLE VALUE. COST IS DETERMINED BY THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT METHOD. WHERE  THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT INVENTORY COULD BE DISPOSED OF AT LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE,  THE INVENTORY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  ADDITIONALLY, WE PERIODICALLY EXAMINE OUR INVENTORY IN THE CONTEXT OF INVENTORY  TURNOVER, SALES TRENDS, COMPETITION AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS, AND WE RECORD PROVISIONS  TO INVENTORY RESERVE WHEN WE DETERMINE CERTAIN INVENTORY IS UNLIKELY TO BE SOLD.  IF RESERVED INVENTORY IS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, CORRESPONDING REDUCTIONS IN INVENTORY  AND INVENTORY RESERVES ARE MADE. OUR INVENTORY RESERVE WAS $190,000 AS OF MARCH 31,  2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ESTIMATION  IN DETERMINING THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR NET DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS, WE MUST ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUFFICIENT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME  IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS, BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS TO REALIZE THE  BENEFIT OF THESE ASSETS. WE EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED ASSETS  QUARTERLY AND ASSESS THE NEED FOR VALUATION ALLOWANCES OR REDUCTION OF EXISTING  ALLOWANCES QUARTERLY. NO VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS RECORDED AS WE BELIEVE IT IS  MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.  WE HAD $353,735 OF NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 AND $572,655 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  INCLUDED $62,671 IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND $55,886 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018.  12  TABLE  OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE PERCENTAGE OF  REVENUE AND YEAR-TO-YEAR CHANGES FOR VARIOUS ITEMS FOR THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS.

THE DECREASE IN PRODUCT SALES WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO DECREASED PURCHASES BY EXISTING CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN CONTRACT RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT REVENUE WAS DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS.  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR FISCAL 2019 INCREASED TO  80% FROM 79% FOR FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A MORE PROFITABLE REVENUE MIX.  TOTAL EXPENSES INCREASED 4% FOR FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018, DUE TO AN 11% INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY AN 15% DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE  INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NEW PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  WAS DUE TO STAFFING CHANGES.  INTEREST INCOME INCREASED 15% IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON OUR MARKETABLE  SECURITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR SECURITIES.  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 18% OF INCOME  BEFORE TAXES FOR FISCAL 2019, COMPARED TO 30% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE  WAS DUE TO THE EFFECT OF A DECREASE IN THE FEDERAL TAX RATE AND CERTAIN OTHER  PROVISIONS WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON INCOME TAXES.  NET INCOME INCREASED 4% IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED  TO FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES,  INCREASED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, A DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE, AND AN INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.  13  TABLE  OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE $6,877,304 AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $4,755,082 AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. THE $2,122,222  INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS DUE TO $14,218,994 IN NET CASH PROVIDED  BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $7,059,328 NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES,  LESS $19,156,100 NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES RELATED  TO PRODUCT SALES AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT REVENUE AS OUR PRIMARY  SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL FOR FISCAL 2019 AND 2018. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS $14,218,994 FOR FISCAL 2019 AND $15,151,928 FOR FISCAL 2018.  INVENTORY INCREASED $614,437 IN FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKETABLE SECURITY MATURITIES OF $20,800,000, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY FIXED ASSETS PURCHASES OF $68,265 AND MARKETABLE SECURITY PURCHASES  OF $13,672,407.  PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS WERE $68,265 IN FISCAL  2019 AND $604,800 IN FISCAL 2018. PURCHASES WERE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL EQUIPMENT  AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS TO INCREASE OUR PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND WERE FINANCED  WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES CAN VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YEAR TO YEAR DEPENDING ON OUR NEEDS AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASING  OPPORTUNITIES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2019 WAS DUE TO $19,374,040 IN CASH DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET  BY NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK OF $217,940 FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.

ALL FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL BE SUBJECT TO BOARD  APPROVAL AND SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH AND MARKETABLE  SECURITY BALANCES, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER FACTORS THE  BOARD MAY DEEM RELEVANT. FURTHERMORE, DIVIDENDS MAY BE MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED  AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE CONTAINED IN OR IMPLIED BY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  COMMVAULT IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND RELATED SERVICES. COMMVAULT WAS INCORPORATED IN 1996 AS A DELAWARE CORPORATION. THE COMMVAULT SOFTWARE PLATFORM IS AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL, INTEGRATED DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTION, BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP ON A SINGLE PLATFORM AND UNIFIED CODE BASE. ALL SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY SHARE THE SAME BACK-END TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER THE BENEFITS OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PROTECTING, MANAGING, AND ACCESSING DATA. THE SOFTWARE ADDRESSES MANY ASPECTS OF DATA MANAGEMENT IN THE ENTERPRISE, WHILE PROVIDING SCALABILITY AND CONTROL OF DATA AND INFORMATION.  IN FISCAL 2018 THE COMPANY ALSO STARTED SELLING APPLIANCES THAT INTEGRATE THE COMMVAULT SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE AND ADDRESS A WIDE-RANGE OF BUSINESS NEEDS AND USE CASES, RANGING FROM SUPPORT FOR REMOTE OR BRANCH OFFICES WITH LIMITED IT STAFF UP TO LARGE CORPORATE DATA CENTERS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPORT AND FIELD OPERATIONS.  COMMVAULT SOFTWARE ENABLES OUR CUSTOMERS TO SIMPLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY PROTECT AND MANAGE THEIR ENTERPRISE DATA THROUGHOUT ITS LIFECYCLE, FROM THE MOBILE WORKER TO THE REMOTE OFFICE, TO THE DATA CENTER, COVERING THE LEADING OPERATING SYSTEMS, RELATIONAL DATABASES, VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENTS AND APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION TO ADDRESSING TODAY\u2019S DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES, OUR CUSTOMERS CAN REALIZE LOWER CAPITAL COSTS THROUGH MORE EFFICIENT USE OF THEIR ENTERPRISE-WIDE STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS. THIS INCLUDES THE AUTOMATED MOVEMENT OF DATA FROM HIGHER COST TO LOWER COST STORAGE DEVICES THROUGHOUT ITS LIFECYCLE, AND THROUGH SHARING AND BETTER UTILIZATION OF STORAGE RESOURCES ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE. WE CAN ALSO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH REDUCED OPERATING COSTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING FAST APPLICATION DEPLOYMENT, REDUCED TRAINING TIME, LOWER COST OF STORAGE MEDIA CONSUMABLES, PROACTIVE MONITORING AND ANALYSIS, AND LOWER ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. WE ALSO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A BROAD RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE DELIVERED BY OUR WORLDWIDE SUPPORT AND FIELD OPERATIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  WE HAD LICENSED OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO OVER  28,000  REGISTERED CUSTOMERS.  HISTORY AND BACKGROUND  IN EARLY 2000, WE LAUNCHED COMMVAULT GALAXY FOR BACKUP AND RECOVERY, A STORAGE INDUSTRY AWARD WINNER. IN THE YEARS SINCE, COMMVAULT HAS FORGED NUMEROUS ALLIANCES WITH TOP SOFTWARE APPLICATION AND HARDWARE VENDORS TO ENHANCE CAPABILITIES AND TO CREATE A PREMIERE SUITE OF DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. IN 2002, WE LAUNCHED OUR SINGLE-PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT PROVIDES THE FOUNDATION OF OUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO STORING, MANAGING, AND ACCESSING DATA.  HISTORICALLY, OUR SOFTWARE LICENSES HAVE TYPICALLY PROVIDED FOR A PERPETUAL RIGHT TO USE OUR SOFTWARE AND WERE SOLD ON A PER TERABYTE CAPACITY BASIS, PER SOLUTION SETS INSTANCE BASIS, ON A PER-COPY BASIS, OR AS SITE LICENSES.  CAPACITY BASED SOFTWARE LICENSES PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH UNLIMITED LICENSES OF SPECIFIED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BASED ON A DEFINED LEVEL OF TERABYTES OF DATA UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A RESULT, WHEN WE SELL OUR PLATFORM THROUGH A TERABYTE BASED CAPACITY LICENSE, CERTAIN OF THE VARIOUS COMMVAULT FUNCTIONALITIES ARE BUNDLED INTO ONE CAPACITY BASED PRICE.  INSTANCE BASED LICENSES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL MACHINE BACKUPS, ENDPOINTS, OR EMAIL BOXES.  THESE INSTANCE BASED LICENSES ALSO INCLUDE VARIOUS FUNCTIONALITIES BUNDLED INTO ONE INSTANCE BASED PRICE.  SITE LICENSES GIVE THE CUSTOMER THE ADDITIONAL RIGHT TO DEPLOY THE SOFTWARE ON A LIMITED BASIS DURING A SPECIFIED TERM.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON SUBSCRIPTION AND OTHER REPEATABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE MARKET. ANY OF OUR LICENSING MODELS (CAPACITY, INSTANCE BASED, ETC.) CAN BE SOLD VIA A SUBSCRIPTION ARRANGEMENT.  IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHT TO USE THE SOFTWARE OVER A DESIGNATED PERIOD OF TIME.  THE CAPACITY OF THE LICENSE IS FIXED AND THE CUSTOMER HAS MADE AN UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT TO PAY.  SOFTWARE REVENUE IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 40% OF SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE WAS SOLD UNDER A SUBSCRIPTION MODEL. WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE TO CONTINUE INCREASE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.  WE ALSO SELL TO SOME CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS, VIA UTILITY, OR PAY-AS-YOU-GO MODELS.  IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS ACTUAL USAGE IS REGULARLY MEASURED AND BILLED.  REVENUE IN THESE UTILITY ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SOFTWARE IS USED.  30  THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE CURRENTLY OPERATE CONTINUES TO GO THROUGH ACCELERATING CHANGES AS THE RESULT OF COMPOUNDING DATA GROWTH AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE ARE CONTINUING TO PURSUE AN AGGRESSIVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN BOTH DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. OUR DATA MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INCLUDE NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL BACKUP, BUT ALSO NEW INNOVATIONS IN DE-DUPLICATION, DATA MOVEMENT, VIRTUALIZATION, SNAP-BASED BACKUPS AND ENTERPRISE REPORTING. OUR INFORMATION MANAGEMENT INNOVATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS OF ARCHIVING, EDISCOVERY, RECORDS MANAGEMENT, GOVERNANCE, OPERATIONAL REPORTING AND COMPLIANCE. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON BOTH THE DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT TRENDS IN THE MARKETPLACE AND, IN FACT, A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR EXISTING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE UTILIZED TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH NEW TECHNOLOGIES DISCUSSED ABOVE. WHILE WE ARE CONFIDENT IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET THESE CHANGING INDUSTRY DEMANDS WITH OUR COMMVAULT SUITE AND POTENTIAL FUTURE RELEASES, THE DEVELOPMENT, RELEASE AND TIMING OF ANY FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY REMAIN AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND OUR SOLUTIONS OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MAY NOT BE WIDELY ADOPTED.  GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE, OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO OBSOLESCENCE. WE CONTINUALLY DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE UPDATES TO OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS IN ORDER TO KEEP PACE WITH EVOLVING INDUSTRY TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, WE MUST ADDRESS EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CHANGING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS THAT MAY RENDER OUR EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS OBSOLETE.  IN FISCAL 2018 WE ALSO STARTED SELLING A BACKUP APPLIANCE WHICH INTEGRATES OUR SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE.  IF OUR FORECAST EXCEEDS OUR ACTUAL REQUIREMENTS, A SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNER MAY ASSESS ADDITIONAL CHARGES OR WE MAY INCUR COSTS RELATED TO EXCESS INVENTORY, EACH OF WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGINS.  FOR EACH OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WE PROVIDE FULL SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT GENERALLY AVAILABLE RELEASE AND ONE PRIOR RELEASE. WHEN WE DECLARE A PRODUCT RELEASE OBSOLETE, A CUSTOMER NOTICE IS DELIVERED TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF OBSOLESCENCE ANNOUNCING CONTINUATION OF FULL PRODUCT SUPPORT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS. WE PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF EXTENDED ASSISTANCE SUPPORT IN WHICH WE ONLY PROVIDE EXISTING WORKAROUNDS OR FIXES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY. WE DO NOT HAVE EXISTING PLANS TO MAKE ANY OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS PERMANENTLY OBSOLETE.  SOURCES OF REVENUES  WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FROM SALES OF LICENSES OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. WE DO NOT CUSTOMIZE OUR SOFTWARE FOR A SPECIFIC END-USER CUSTOMER. WE SELL OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND PRODUCTS TO END-USER CUSTOMERS BOTH DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR SALES FORCE AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH OUR GLOBAL NETWORK OF VALUE-ADDED RESELLER PARTNERS, SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS, CORPORATE RESELLERS AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS. OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  44%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  45%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017.  IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS, WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY THREE-QUARTERS OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE FROM OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER BASE AND APPROXIMATELY ONE-QUARTER OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE FROM NEW CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD IS, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM LARGE CUSTOMER SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS DEALS, WHICH WE REFER TO AS ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS. ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS (TRANSACTIONS GREATER THAN $0.1 MILLION) REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  65%  OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  59%  FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND  56%  FOR  FISCAL 2017.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WAS  93%  OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  86%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  87%  IN  FISCAL 2017  . SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS WAS  7%  OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  14%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  13%  IN  FISCAL 2017  . THE DOLLAR VALUE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  INCREASED  APPROXIMATELY $19.7 MILLION  , OR  7%  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . THE DOLLAR VALUE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH DIRECT DISTRIBUTION  DECREASED  $21.6 MILLION  , OR  50%  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . DEALS INITIATED BY OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE ARE SOMETIMES TRANSACTED THROUGH INDIRECT CHANNELS BASED ON END-USER CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE NOT ALWAYS IN OUR CONTROL AND CAN CAUSE THIS OVERALL PERCENTAGE SPLIT TO VARY FROM FISCAL YEAR TO FISCAL YEAR. AS SUCH, THERE MAY BE FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DOLLARS AND PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH OUR DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM TIME TO TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT THE GROWTH OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE, DERIVED FROM BOTH OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL PARTNERS AND DIRECT SALES FORCE, ARE KEY ATTRIBUTES TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN BOTH OUR CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS AND DIRECT SALES FORCE IN THE FUTURE, BUT WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT MORE REVENUE TO BE GENERATED THROUGH INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OVER THE LONG TERM. THE FAILURE OF OUR INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OR OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE TO EFFECTIVELY SELL OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REVENUES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER AGREEMENT IS WITH HITACHI VANTARA (HITACHI) AND ALLOWS THEM TO MARKET, SELL AND SUPPORT OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND/OR INCORPORATE OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS INTO THEIR OWN HARDWARE PRODUCTS. OUR OEM PARTNERS, INCLUDING HITACHI, HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO RECOMMEND OR OFFER OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS EXCLUSIVELY OR AT ALL, AND THEY HAVE NO MINIMUM SALES REQUIREMENTS AND CAN TERMINATE OUR RELATIONSHIP AT ANY TIME.  31  WE ALSO HAVE NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING OUR NORTH AMERICAN COMMERCIAL MARKETS AND OUR U.S. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MARKET WITH ARROW ENTERPRISE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS, INC. (ARROW), A SUBSIDIARY OF ARROW ELECTRONICS, INC. PURSUANT TO THESE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THESE DISTRIBUTORS\u2019 PRIMARY ROLE IS TO ENABLE A MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY MANAGING OUR RESELLER PARTNERS AND LEVERAGING THEIR OWN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE. WE GENERATED APPROXIMATELY  38%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES THROUGH ARROW IN  FISCAL 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  36%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018  AND APPROXIMATELY  36%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2017  . IF ARROW WAS TO DISCONTINUE OR REDUCE THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR IF OUR AGREEMENT WITH ARROW WAS TERMINATED, AND IF WE WERE UNABLE TO TAKE BACK THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR RESELLER CHANNEL OR FIND ANOTHER NORTH AMERICAN DISTRIBUTOR TO REPLACE ARROW, THEN IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE BUSINESS.  OUR SERVICES REVENUE WAS  56%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  55%  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017  . OUR SERVICES REVENUE IS MADE UP OF FEES FROM THE DELIVERY OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPDATES ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS FOR AN ANNUAL FEE BASED ON LICENSES PURCHASED AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE SUBSCRIBED. OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, IMPLEMENTATION AND POST-DEPLOYMENT SERVICES AND TRAINING, ALL OF WHICH TO DATE HAVE PREDOMINANTLY BEEN SOLD IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.  MOST OF OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ARE FOR A ONE-YEAR TERM. AS THE END OF THE ANNUAL PERIOD APPROACHES, WE PURSUE THE RENEWAL OF THE AGREEMENT WITH THE CUSTOMER. HISTORICALLY, MAINTENANCE RENEWALS HAVE REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. BECAUSE OF THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF OUR BUSINESS, IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE NOT TO RENEW THEIR MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT AGREEMENTS WITH US ON BENEFICIAL TERMS, OR AT ALL, OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE HARMED.  THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR SERVICES REVENUE WAS  77%  FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017  . OVERALL, OUR SERVICES REVENUE HAS LOWER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE. THE GROSS MARGIN OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  92%  FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  98%  FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND  99%  FOR  FISCAL 2017  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS IS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR INTEGRATED APPLIANCE, WHICH INCLUDES HARDWARE. AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES REPRESENTED BY SERVICES REVENUE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  DURING FISCAL 2019, JOSEPH F. EAZOR, FORMER CEO OF RACKSPACE, INC (RACKSPACE), WAS A DIRECTOR ON OUR BOARD.  RACKSPACE HAS BEEN A CUSTOMER OF OURS SINCE 2006.  ON JULY 31, 2018, JOSEPH F. EAZOR RESIGNED FROM OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. TOTAL RECOGNIZED REVENUE RELATED TO RACKSPACE FOR FISCAL  2019  THROUGH JULY 31, 2018 WAS  $0.6  MILLION.  DESCRIPTION OF COSTS AND EXPENSES  OUR COST OF REVENUES IS AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COST OF APPLIANCE HARDWARE, THIRD-PARTY ROYALTIES AND OTHER COSTS SUCH AS MEDIA, MANUALS, TRANSLATION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS; AND  \u2022  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARY AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS IN PROVIDING CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE AS FOLLOWS  \u2022  SALES AND MARKETING  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, COMMISSIONS, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT BUSINESS EXPENSES, INCLUDING TRAVEL AND RELATED EXPENSES, SALES PROMOTION EXPENSES, PUBLIC RELATIONS EXPENSES AND COSTS FOR MARKETING MATERIALS AND OTHER MARKETING EVENTS (SUCH AS TRADE SHOWS AND ADVERTISING);  \u2022  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  , WHICH IS PRIMARILY THE EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND MODIFYING EXISTING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PERSONNEL AND RELATED EXPENSES; CONTRACT LABOR EXPENSE AND CONSULTING FEES AS WELL AS OTHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, CERTIFICATION AND TESTING OF OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATENT REGISTRATION OF SUCH SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS;  32  \u2022  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  , CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR OUR EXECUTIVE, ACCOUNTING, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS CATEGORY ARE OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES, SUCH AS OUTSIDE LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES, COMPLIANCE COSTS AND INSURANCE; AND  \u2022  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  , CONSISTS OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY FOR OUR OWNED CORPORATE CAMPUS HEADQUARTERS LOCATION AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT WE USE FOR INFORMATION SERVICES AND IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND TEST LABS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\u2019 IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WERE APPROXIMATELY  47%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR  FISCAL 2019  ,  46%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR  FISCAL 2018  AND 44% FOR  FISCAL 2017  . THE INCOME STATEMENTS OF OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR EACH APPLICABLE MONTH IN A PERIOD. TO THE EXTENT THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THE TRANSLATION OF THESE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASED REVENUE, OPERATING EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS. SIMILARLY, OUR REVENUE, OPERATING EXPENSES AND NET INCOME WILL GENERALLY DECREASE FOR OUR NON-U.S. OPERATIONS IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  USING THE AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES FROM  FISCAL 2018  , OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $5.2 MILLION, OUR SERVICES REVENUE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $4.4 MILLION, OUR COST OF SALES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $1.0 MILLION AND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BY $5.2 MILLION FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS FOR  FISCAL 2019.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISKS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATION PRIMARILY FROM CASH BALANCES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESULTING TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. WE RECOGNIZED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OF  $1.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $0.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  , AND  $0.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN PRESENTING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED THEREIN. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE RELATE TO MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AS THEY PERTAIN TO FUTURE EVENTS. WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE REQUIRE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. IN APPLYING OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, WE MUST DETERMINE WHICH PORTIONS OF OUR REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY (GENERALLY SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE) AND WHICH PORTIONS MUST BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS (GENERALLY SERVICES REVENUE). WE ANALYZE VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE SELLING PRICE OF UNDELIVERED SERVICES WHEN SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS, OUR PRICING POLICIES, THE CREDIT-WORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, AND CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS IN HELPING US TO MAKE SUCH JUDGMENTS ABOUT REVENUE RECOGNITION. CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ON ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN A GIVEN PERIOD.  WE DERIVE REVENUE FROM TWO PRIMARY SOURCES: SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES. SERVICES INCLUDE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (SOFTWARE UPDATES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT), CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, INSTALLATION SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION. A TYPICAL CONTRACT INCLUDES BOTH LICENSES AND SERVICES.  OUR SOFTWARE LICENSES TYPICALLY PROVIDE FOR A PERPETUAL RIGHT TO USE OUR SOFTWARE. WE ALSO SELL TERM-BASED SOFTWARE LICENSES THAT EXPIRE, WHICH ARE REFERRED TO AS SUBSCRIPTION ARRANGEMENTS. WE DO NOT CUSTOMIZE OUR SOFTWARE AND INSTALLATION SERVICES ARE NOT REQUIRED. THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED BEFORE RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND IS FUNCTIONAL WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, UPDATES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR SOFTWARE LICENSE IS FUNCTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS DISTINCT AS THE USER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE SOFTWARE ON ITS OWN. SOFTWARE AND PRODUCT REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS DELIVERED AND/OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD AS THIS IS THE POINT THE USER OF THE SOFTWARE CAN DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM THE FUNCTIONAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SOFTWARE REVENUE RELATED TO THE RENEWAL OF SUBSCRIPTION SOFTWARE LICENSES EARLIER THAN THE BEGINNING OF THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.  33  IN FISCAL 2018, WE ALSO STARTED SELLING APPLIANCES THAT INTEGRATE OUR SOFTWARE WITH HARDWARE AND ADDRESS A WIDE-RANGE OF BUSINESS NEEDS AND USE CASES, RANGING FROM SUPPORT FOR REMOTE OR BRANCH OFFICES WITH LIMITED IT STAFF UP TO LARGE CORPORATE DATA CENTERS. REVENUE RELATED TO APPLIANCES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE APPLIANCES PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER; TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY.  SERVICES REVENUE INCLUDES REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. CUSTOMER SUPPORT INCLUDES SOFTWARE UPDATES ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, TELEPHONE SUPPORT, INTEGRATED WEB-BASED SUPPORT AND BUG FIXES OR PATCHES. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS CUSTOMER SUPPORT CONTRACTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SOFTWARE PURCHASES THE SUPPORT IS RELATED TO. CUSTOMER SUPPORT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR.  OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDE CONSULTING, ASSESSMENT AND DESIGN SERVICES, INSTALLATION SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION. CUSTOMER EDUCATION SERVICES INCLUDE COURSES TAUGHT BY OUR INSTRUCTORS OR THIRD-PARTY CONTRACTORS. REVENUE RELATED TO OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND CUSTOMER EDUCATION SERVICES IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS CONTAIN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SEPARATELY IF THEY ARE DISTINCT. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ON A RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BASIS. STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED USING THE RESIDUAL APPROACH. STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY ESTIMATED BASED ON OBSERVABLE TRANSACTIONS WHEN THESE SERVICES ARE SOLD ON A STANDALONE BASIS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S TYPICAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  IS TYPICALLY SATISFIED  WHEN PAYMENT IS  TYPICALLY DUE  HOW STANDALONE SELLING PRICE IS  TYPICALLY ESTIMATED  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  SOFTWARE LICENSES  UPON SHIPMENT OR MADE AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD (POINT IN TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SHIPMENT EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES WHICH ARE PAID FOR OVER TIME  RESIDUAL APPROACH  APPLIANCES  WHEN CONTROL OF THE APPLIANCES PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER; TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF DELIVERY  RESIDUAL APPROACH  CUSTOMER SUPPORT REVENUE  SOFTWARE UPDATES  RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACT (OVER TIME)  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD  OBSERVABLE IN RENEWAL TRANSACTIONS  CUSTOMER SUPPORT  RATABLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE SUPPORT CONTRACT (OVER TIME)  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT PERIOD  OBSERVABLE IN RENEWAL TRANSACTIONS  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES (EXCEPT FOR EDUCATION SERVICES)  AS WORK IS PERFORMED (OVER TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SERVICES BEING PERFORMED  OBSERVABLE IN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  EDUCATION SERVICES  WHEN THE CLASS IS TAUGHT (POINT IN TIME)  WITHIN 90 DAYS OF SERVICES BEING PERFORMED  OBSERVABLE IN TRANSACTIONS WITHOUT MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  34  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  UNDER ASC 740, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN, IN THE OUR JUDGMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE WEIGH THE AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LEVELS OF PRE-TAX INCOME, LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS, EXPECTATIONS AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTIMATES OF FUTURE PRE-TAX INCOME, AND PRUDENT AND FEASIBLE TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WE CONCLUDED THAT BASED ON THE AMOUNT, AND TREND, OF PRE-TAX LOSS IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ITS GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THEREFORE HAVE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE IMPACT OF THE REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TO ZERO.  THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN THE FUTURE, CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATES REGARDING THE REALIZABILITY OF OUR GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND AS A RESULT, FILE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY TAXING AUTHORITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INCLUDING SUCH MAJOR JURISDICTIONS AS THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, GERMANY, NETHERLANDS AND UNITED KINGDOM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  REVENUES  TOTAL REVENUES  INCREASED  $11.6 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FROM  $699.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $711.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE.  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE  DECREASED  $1.8 MILLION  , OR  1%  , FROM  $311.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $309.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE REPRESENTED  44%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  45%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018.  THE OVERALL  DECREASE  IN SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN TRANSACTIONS LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION. SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM TRANSACTIONS LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION  DECREASED  $17.9 MILLION  , IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  .  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE AMOUNT OF ENTERPRISE TRANSACTION REVENUE (TRANSACTIONS GREATER THAN $0.1 MILLION), WHICH  INCREASED  BY  $16.0 MILLION  , OR  9%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  .  ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  65%  AND  59%  OF OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  INCREASE  IN ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  17%  INCREASE  IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS OF THIS TYPE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  7%  DECREASE  IN THE AVERAGE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS. THE AVERAGE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF ENTERPRISE TRANSACTIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY  $272,000  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND APPROXIMATELY  $292,000  IN  FISCAL 2018.  WE TRACK SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT ARE TRACKED ARE THE AMERICAS (UNITED STATES, CANADA, LATIN AMERICA), EMEA (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA) AND APAC (AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, SOUTHEAST ASIA, CHINA).  AMERICAS, EMEA AND APAC REPRESENTED 55%, 31% AND 14% OF TOTAL SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE YEAR OVER YEAR INCREASE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN THE AMERICAS AND APAC WAS 1%, WHILE EMEA DECREASED 5%.  \u25aa  THE INCREASE IN AMERICAS SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS THE RESULT OF A 21% INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM NON-ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS AND A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE SIZE OF ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS.  \u25aa  EMEA SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DECREASED AS A RESULT OF A 11% DECLINE IN NON-ENTERPRISE TRANSACTION REVENUE. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE IN ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, EMEA SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE DECLINED 2% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25aa  THE INCREASE IN APAC WAS THE RESULT OF A 10% INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS THAT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4% DECREASE IN NON-ENTERPRISE REVENUE TRANSACTIONS. ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, APAC SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WOULD HAVE INCREASED 5% COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR.  OUR SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN EMEA AND APAC IS SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED ABOVE IN THE  \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES\u2019 IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d  SECTION.  35  SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL (RESELLERS AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS)  INCREASED  $19.7 MILLION  , OR  7%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  , AND SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE  DECREASED  $21.6 MILLION  , OR  50%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  . FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ON SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE DERIVED FROM OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE SEE THE  \u201cSOURCES OF REVENUE\u201d  SECTION.  SERVICES REVENUE.  SERVICES REVENUE  INCREASED  $13.4 MILLION  , OR  3%  , FROM  $387.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $401.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . SERVICES REVENUE REPRESENTED  56%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  55%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE NET  INCREASE  IN SERVICES REVENUE IS DUE TO A  $12.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS AS A RESULT OF SOFTWARE SALES TO NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWAL AGREEMENTS WITH OUR INSTALLED SOFTWARE BASE.  COST OF REVENUES  TOTAL COST OF REVENUES  INCREASED  $18.9 MILLION  , OR  19%  , FROM  $98.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $117.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . TOTAL COST OF REVENUES REPRESENTED  16%  OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO 14% IN  FISCAL 2018  .  THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY SALES OF OUR HYPERSCALE APPLIANCES.  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE.  COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WAS  $25.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  $7.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  , REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 8% OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO 2% IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE IS RELATED TO ADDITIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ROYALTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR APPLIANCE AND HYPERSCALE PRODUCT OFFERINGS. AS SALES OF OUR APPLIANCES AND HYPERSCALE PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO RAMP, WE EXPECT THE COST OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS REVENUE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE.  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE.  COST OF SERVICES REVENUE  INCREASED  $0.4 MILLION  FROM  $90.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $91.3 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . COST OF SERVICES REVENUE REPRESENTED  23%  OF OUR SERVICES REVENUE IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018.  OPERATING EXPENSES  SALES AND MARKETING.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES  DECREASED  $40.6 MILLION  , OR  10%  , FROM  $410.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $370.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . THE  DECREASE  IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A $23.0 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, A $6.1 MILLION DECREASE IN TRAVEL EXPENSES, AND A $2.3 MILLION DECREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES. SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES  DECREASED  TO  52%  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  59%  IN  FISCAL 2018.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED  $1.6 MILLION  , OR  2%  , FROM  $91.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $92.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR ENGINEERING GROUP. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS  13%  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  . INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY FOR COMMVAULT, AND WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED SPENDING RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  $10.2 MILLION  , OR  11%  , FROM  $90.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $100.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $11.2 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO A NON-ROUTINE SHAREHOLDER MATTER.  THE COSTS ARE FOR PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO OUR SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE SHAREHOLDER AND CONSULTING FEES INCURRED WITH THE OPERATIONAL REVIEW WHICH WAS AGREED TO AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT. FISCAL 2019 ALSO INCLUDES $12.2 MILLION RELATED TO THE MODIFICATION OF STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN  FISCAL 2019  INCLUDES  $1.0 MILLION  OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS COMPARED TO  $0.1 MILLION  OF NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS RECOGNIZED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN  FISCAL 2018  . GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES WAS  14%  IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  13%  IN  FISCAL 2018.  RESTRUCTURING.  IN FISCAL 2019 WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN OUR SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS REDUCE COSTS ACROSS ALL FUNCTIONAL AREAS.  DURING THE YEAR, WE HAVE INCURRED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF  $14.8 MILLION  .  THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATE PRIMARILY TO SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  THESE CHARGES INCLUDE $2.6 MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION RELATED TO MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING AWARDS GRANTED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEES INCLUDED IN THE RESTRUCTURING.  WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WILL ACHIEVE ITS INTENDED RESULT. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL UNEXPECTED COSTS, ADVERSE EFFECTS ON EMPLOYEE MORALE AND THE FAILURE TO MEET OPERATIONAL AND GROWTH TARGETS DUE TO THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, ANY OF WHICH MAY IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANTICIPATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE HARM OUR BUSINESS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE  INCREASED  $0.9 MILLION  , FROM  $9.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $10.6 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019.  36  INTEREST INCOME  INTEREST INCOME  INCREASED  $3.3 MILLION  , FROM  $2.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  TO  $5.5 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  .  THE INCREASE WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND INCREASED YIELD ON THOSE INVESTMENTS.  OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE IN U.S. TREASURY BILLS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $6.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO EXPENSE OF  $58.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  .  IN FISCAL 2018 WE DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IT WILL NOT REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ITS GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THEREFORE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE GROSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, NET OF THE IMPACT OF THE REVERSAL OF TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TO ZERO.  THE INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  RELATES PRIMARILY TO CURRENT FOREIGN TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE WAS  $328.0 MILLION  .  INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE WAS  $102.7 MILLION  OF CASH EQUIVALENTS WHICH CONSISTED OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY  $130.3 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INVESTED IN U.S. TREASURY BILLS. IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY HAS BEEN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES BY OUR FOREIGN LEGAL ENTITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY  $153.7 MILLION  . THESE BALANCES ARE DISPERSED ACROSS MANY INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH DISPERSION MEETS THE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN LEGAL ENTITIES. IN THE EVENT WE NEEDED TO REPATRIATE FUNDS FROM OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, SUCH REPATRIATION WOULD LIKELY BE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS BY LOCAL LAWS AND/OR TAX CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED $132.7  MILLION OF COMMON STOCK (2.1 MILLION SHARES) UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. OUR FUTURE STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IS SUBJECT TO THE BUSINESS JUDGMENT OF OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CASH FLOWS AND OTHER ANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM REDUCES THE DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND OUR PREVIOUS PUBLIC AND PRIVATE STOCK OFFERINGS THROUGH THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK.  AS OF MAY 3, 2019, THERE IS $111.0 MILLION REMAINING IN THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH EXPIRES ON MARCH 31, 2020. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS BEEN FUNDED BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AS WELL AS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS.  OUR SUMMARIZED ANNUAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION IS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $110,180  $84,169  $100,039  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (5,261  )  (17,991  )  (28,045  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (90,713  )  (82,104  )  (22,435  )  EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE \u2014 CHANGES IN CASH  (16,998  )  17,219  (8,175  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(2,792  )  $1,293  $41,384  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $110.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $84.2 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  $100.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017  . IN  FISCAL 2019  , CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET  INCOME  ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH CHARGES AND INCREASES IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  IN FISCAL 2018, CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH CHARGES AND INCREASES IN DEFERRED SERVICES REVENUE AS A RESULT OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FROM NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWAL AGREEMENTS WITH OUR INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  37  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $5.3 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $18.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  $28.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017  . IN  FISCAL 2019  , CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO  $1.3 MILLION  OF NET  PROCEEDS  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF U.S. TREASURY BILLS, AND  $6.6 MILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE. INCLUDED IN THIS BALANCE WAS A PURCHASE OF LAND ADJACENT TO OUR GLOBAL CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS. IN FISCAL 2018, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO $10.9 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF U.S. TREASURY BILLS, AND $7.0 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FISCAL 2017, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO $21.6 MILLION OF NET PURCHASES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF U.S. TREASURY BILLS, AND $6.4 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $90.7 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  ,  $82.1 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  AND  $22.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2017  . THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $132.7  MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $42.0 MILLION  OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $112.2 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $30.1 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. THE CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $50.0 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $21.3 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND $6.2 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  A SUMMARY OF THE CASH USED FOR THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING.  YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  CASH USED FOR REPURCHASES (IN THOUSANDS)  $132,697  $112,218  $49,998  SHARES REPURCHASED (IN THOUSANDS)  2,115  2,098  982  AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE  $62.74  $53.49  $50.91  WORKING CAPITAL  INCREASED  $6.0 MILLION  FROM  $322.6 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  TO  $328.7 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE  INCREASE  IN WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND OUR CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND POTENTIAL STOCK REPURCHASES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCINGS OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS DURING THIS PERIOD. ADEQUATE FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. IF ADDITIONAL FUNDS ARE RAISED BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WILL RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY OBTAINING LOANS FROM THIRD PARTIES, THE TERMS OF THOSE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCLUDE NEGATIVE COVENANTS OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, AND WOULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO FUND ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE. IF FUNDING IS INSUFFICIENT AT ANY TIME IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DEVELOP OR ENHANCE OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES OR RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, ANY OF WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  38  SUMMARY DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  OUR MATERIAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS CONSIST OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER FACILITIES AND OPERATING LEASES. SOME OF THESE LEASES HAVE FREE OR ESCALATING RENT PAYMENT PROVISIONS. WE RECOGNIZE RENT EXPENSE UNDER LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR OBLIGATIONS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

THE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ABOVE RELATE PRIMARILY TO MARKETING AND IT SERVICES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH \u201cSELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA\u201d  AND OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OPERATING DATA, WHICH ARE INCLUDED  ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, INCLUDING INFORMATION  WITH RESPECT TO OUR PLANS AND STRATEGY FOR OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDES FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.  YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d AND \u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d SECTIONS OF  THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  WE OPERATE ON A FISCAL CALENDAR WHICH, IN A GIVEN FISCAL  YEAR, CONSISTS OF A 52- OR 53-WEEK PERIOD ENDING ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO JANUARY 31ST. THE REPORTING PERIODS CONTAINED  IN OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT CONTAIN 52 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH  ENDED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2019, 53 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, WHICH ENDED ON FEBRUARY 3, 2018, AND 52 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS  IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, WHICH ENDED ON JANUARY 28, 2017. HISTORICAL RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED  FOR ANY FUTURE PERIOD.  OVERVIEW  FRANCESCA\u2019S\u00ae IS A SPECIALTY RETAILER WHICH OPERATES  A NATIONWIDE-CHAIN OF BOUTIQUES PROVIDING CUSTOMERS A UNIQUE, FUN AND PERSONALIZED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. THE MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT  IS DIVERSE AND BALANCE MIX OF APPAREL, JEWELRY, ACCESSORIES AND GIFTS. AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, FRANCESCA\u2019S\u00ae OPERATED 727  BOUTIQUES IN 47 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA AND ALSO SERVED ITS CUSTOMERS THROUGH WWW.FRANCESCAS.COM, ITS ECOMMERCE WEBSITE.  IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE CONSIDER A  VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE KEY MEASURES FOR DETERMINING HOW OUR BUSINESS IS PERFORMING ARE NET SALES, COMPARABLE  SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE  HAVE DEVELOPED A TURNAROUND PLAN TO STABILIZE AND THEN GROW OUR BUSINESS. THIS PLAN INCLUDES STRATEGIES AIMED AT ENHANCING  OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, WHICH HAS DECLINED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OUR CONTINUED COMPARABLE SALES DECLINES. SEE ABOVE  UNDER ITEM 1. BUSINESS, \u201cOUR GROWTH STRATEGY\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, COMPARABLE SALES  DECLINED 14% AND IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARABLE SALES DECLINED 11%. IN EACH CASE, WE BELIEVE THE DECLINES WERE PRIMARILY THE  RESULT OF OUR INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT MERCHANDISE PLANNING, BUYING AND PROMOTIONAL POLICIES TO LEVERAGE OUR  STRENGTH OF DELIVERING ON-TREND MERCHANDISE AT A COMPELLING VALUE, CAUSING DECLINES IN BOTH CONVERSION RATES AND BOUTIQUE  TRAFFIC. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROWTH IN OUR EXPENSE STRUCTURE HAS OUTPACED OUR REVENUES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE  CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND WE ENDED THE YEAR WITH $20.1 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED  BELOW)  . SU  BSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN  ADDITIONAL $5.0 MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND  FROM THE IRS. AS OF MAY 2, 2019, OUR ESTIMATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.0 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED THE  RECEIPT OF $8.5 MILLION INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS WE RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THE ESTIMATED CASH  BALANCE AS OF MAY 2, 2019 REFLECTS A $5.0 MILLION PAYMENT ON OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BRINGING THE  OUTSTANDING BALANCE BACK DOWN TO $10.0 MILLION AND OUR ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY TO $14.6 MILLION AS OF THAT DATE.  WE  ALSO INCURRED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $33.5 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $30.0 MILLION IN FISCAL  2017. OUR OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 INCLUDES A NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR  NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, PROFESSIONAL FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S TURNAROUND PLAN AND EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC  AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES DISCUSSED BELOW AND REVERSAL OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE  OFFICER\u2019S (\u201cCEO\u201d) RESIGNATION. SEE BELOW, \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.  IN  ADDITION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, IN JANUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIATED A REVIEW OF OUR STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES  TO MAXIMIZE VALUE.  WE RETAINED ROTHSCHILD & CO AND OTHER ADVISORS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF THESE ALTERNATIVES. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE EXPLORATION OF STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES WILL RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION OR OTHER RESULT  THAT ENHANCES VALUE. ALSO AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WE HAVE NOT SET A TIMETABLE FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE REVIEW PROCESS, AND WE  DO NOT INTEND TO COMMENT ON THE PROCESS UNLESS A SPECIFIC TRANSACTION OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,  THE PROCESS IS CONCLUDED, OR IT IS OTHERWISE DETERMINED THAT FURTHER DISCLOSURE IS APPROPRIATE OR REQUIRED BY LAW.  IN ADDITION, IN FEBRUARY 2019, MR. STEVE LAWRENCE RESIGNED  FROM HIS POSITION AS OUR PRESIDENT AND CEO AND MR. MICHAEL PRENDERGAST OF ALVAREZ & MARSAL WAS APPOINTED AS OUR INTERIM  CEO. ALSO IN FEBRUARY 2019,  OUR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER DEPARTED THE COMPANY.  WE ARE IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF A FORMAL SEARCH FOR A PERMANENT CEO AND EITHER A GENERAL MERCHANDISING MANAGER OR A CHIEF  MERCHANDISING OFFICER, BUT ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN EXPERIENCED INTERIM LEADERSHIP TEAM IN PLACE TO EXECUTE ON  OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  30  WE RECORDED A NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $20.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO 153 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES FOR WHICH THE REMAINING, OR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING,  NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. SEE NOTE 4, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. ADDITIONALLY, THIS ASSET  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCLUDED A $4.9 MILLION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-OFF OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT  ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEE ABOVE UNDER  ITEM 1. BUSINESS, \u201cOUR SALES CHANNELS\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 INCLUDED A $17.1  MILLION NON-CASH VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN RECORDED IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018 BECAUSE WE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. SEE NOTE  5, INCOME TAXES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.

SEE NOTE 4, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  (3)  NOT MEANINGFUL.  31  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED 9%, OR $43.6 MILLION, TO $428.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO $471.7 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 DUE TO A 14% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES FOLLOWING AN 11% DECREASE  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2017 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION OF SALES FOR THE 53  RD  WEEK. THE DECREASE  IN COMPARABLE SALES WAS DUE TO DECLINES IN BOTH BOUTIQUE TRAFFIC AND CONVERSION RATE. THERE WERE 698 COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES AND 29  NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019, COMPARED TO 657 AND 64, RESPECTIVELY, AT FEBRUARY 3, 2018.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS WAS FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY  $265.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017. COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED BY $10.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 DUE TO A DECREASE  IN SALES VOLUME AND MARKED OUT-OF-STOCK CHARGES BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ECOMMERCE SHIPPING EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF HIGHER  ECOMMERCE SALES PENETRATION. OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED BY $10.2 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE 32 NEW BOUTIQUES  OPENED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 26 BOUTIQUES CLOSED DURING THE YEAR; 12 OF WHICH WERE CLOSED DURING THE LAST WEEK OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  ADDITIONALLY, WE SAW INCREASES IN AVERAGE RENT AND RELATED EXPENSES DUE TO INCREASED PENETRATION OF BOUTIQUES IN HIGH TRAFFIC CENTERS,  DEPRECIATION DUE TO INCREASED COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES AND REMODELS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUE REMODELS.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY  COSTS INCREASED TO 61.9% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FROM 56.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AN UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE OF 580 BASIS POINTS. THIS  UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE WAS DRIVEN BY 440 BASIS POINTS DELEVERAGING OF OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES AS WELL AS THE INCREASE  IN OCCUPANCY COSTS DISCUSSED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, MERCHANDISE MARGINS WERE LOWER BY 140 BASIS POINTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED  TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASED MARKDOWNS AND HIGHER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK  CHARGES AND INVENTORY RESERVES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE FLAT AT APPROXIMATELY  $176.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017. THE $2.7 MILLION INCREASE IN MARKETING, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND DEPRECIATION WAS OFFSET  BY A DECREASE OF $2.4 MILLION IN SELLING EXPENSES DUE TO LABOR EFFICIENCIES AT THE BOUTIQUE LEVEL AND THE $0.8 MILLION REVERSAL  OF PREVIOUSLY AWARDED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIGNATION OF OUR PRIOR CEO. PART OF THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL  FEES WAS DUE TO $1.5 MILLION IN CONSULTING EXPENSES INCURRED ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TURNAROUND PLAN AND EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC AND  FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVES THAT COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2019.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES INCREASED TO 41.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FROM 37.4% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELEVERAGING OF EXPENSES RESULTING  FROM LOWER SALES.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  WE RECOGNIZED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $20.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 MOSTLY RELATED TO 153 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES FOR WHICH THE REMAINING, OR A PORTION OF THE REMAINING,  NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. ADDITIONALLY, WE WROTE OFF $4.9 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT ARE NO LONGER INTENDED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF  POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS. SEE ABOVE UNDER \u201cRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\u201d  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED TO $7.5 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2018 COMPARED TO $14.3 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017. WE DID NOT INCUR AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT ASSOCIATED  WITH OUR NET LOSS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $17.1 MILLION VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  SEE ABOVE UNDER \u201cRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 22.4% AND 47.9% IN FISCAL  YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DUE TO THE $17.1 MILLION  VALUATION ALLOWANCE PROVIDED ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d) ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017. THIS CHANGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $3.3  MILLION NON-CASH EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 AS A RESULT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS USING  THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TAX ACT. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE  TAX ACT AND DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS WAS NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED PROVISIONAL AMOUNT.

ACCORDINGLY, PRIOR YEAR PRESENTATION  HAS BEEN UPDATED TO CONFORM TO SUCH PRESENTATION. THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE NO IMPACT ON PREVIOUSLY REPORT FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED 3%, OR $15.5 MILLION, TO $471.7 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $487.2 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO AN 11% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES  COMPARED TO A 2% INCREASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE THE DECLINE IN BOUTIQUE CONVERSION  RATE AS OUR MERCHANDISE DID NOT RESONATE WITH OUR GUESTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE BACK HALF OF THE YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, HURRICANES HARVEY  AND IRMA ADVERSELY IMPACTED COMPARABLE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 105 BASIS POINTS, MOSTLY AS A RESULT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION  WE EXPERIENCED AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES LOCATED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 50 NET NEW BOUTIQUES OPENED  SINCE THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND SALES DURING THE 53  RD  WEEK OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. THERE WERE 657 COMPARABLE  BOUTIQUES AND 64 NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT FEBRUARY 3, 2018 COMPARED TO 604 AND 67, RESPECTIVELY, AT JANUARY 28, 2017.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 2%, OR $6.4  MILLION, TO $264.9 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $258.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. COST OF GOODS SOLD DECREASED BY  $2.0 MILLION DUE TO LOWER MARKED OUT-OF-STOCK ACTIVITY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ECOMMERCE SHIPPING COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER  ECOMMERCE SALES PENETRATION. OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED BY $8.3 MILLION PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF BOUTIQUES  IN OPERATION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2017 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY  COSTS INCREASED TO 56.2% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 FROM 53.1% IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, AN UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE OF 310 BASIS POINTS. THIS  UNFAVORABLE VARIANCE WAS DUE TO A 230 BASIS POINTS DELEVERAGING OF OCCUPANCY COSTS AS WELL AS 80 BASIS POINTS DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE  MARGIN. THE LOWER MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED MARKDOWNS IN ORDER TO SELL THROUGH SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY LOWER MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK CHARGES AS WE BENEFITTED FROM OUR IN-SEASON CLEARANCE STRATEGY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  10%, OR $16.0 MILLION, TO $176.5 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO $160.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. THIS  INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN $11.1 MILLION INCREASE IN BOUTIQUE AND CORPORATE PAYROLL TO SUPPORT OUR LARGER BOUTIQUE BASE  AND ECOMMERCE OPERATIONS, A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN SOFTWARE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY  AND INFRASTRUCTURE, $2.0 MILLION PRIOR YEAR NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESIGNATION OF OUR PRIOR CEO AND THE RELATED  SEARCH PROCESS, A $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN MARKETING EXPENSES DUE TO NEW MARKETING INITIATIVES, AND A $1.4 MILLION INCREASE  IN WEBSITE, LEGAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.0 MILLION DECREASE IN SHORT- AND  LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE EXPENSES AS THE REQUIRED PERFORMANCE METRICS WERE NOT ACHIEVED OR ARE NOT EXPECTED TO  BE ACHIEVED.  33  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES INCREASED TO 37.4% IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 FROM 33.0% IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN BOUTIQUE, TECHNOLOGY  AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS DELEVERAGING OF EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE DECREASED TO $14.3 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2017 COMPARED TO $25.6 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 DUE TO THE DECREASE IN TAXABLE INCOME. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 47.9% AND  37.9% IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DUE TO A $3.3 MILLION NON-CASH EXPENSE  AS A RESULT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS USING THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TAX ACT ENACTED  IN DECEMBER 2017. SEE NOTE 5, \u201cINCOME TAXES,\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL IN NATURE AND DEMAND IS GENERALLY THE  HIGHEST IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER DUE TO THE YEAR-END HOLIDAY SEASON AND LOWEST IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. IN ADDITION, TO  PREPARE FOR THESE PERIODS, WE MUST ORDER AND KEEP IN STOCK MORE MERCHANDISE THAN WE CARRY DURING OTHER PARTS OF THE YEAR. WE EXPECT  INVENTORY LEVELS, ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, GENERALLY TO REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS IN THE  FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER IN ANTICIPATION OF THE INCREASED NET SALES DURING THIS PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THIS SEASONALITY AND GENERALLY  BECAUSE OF VARIATION IN CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, WE EXPERIENCE FLUCTUATIONS IN NET SALES AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING  THE YEAR.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS  AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (SEE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION).  ADDITIONALLY, ON APRIL 22, 2019, WE RECEIVED AN INCOME TAX REFUND CHECK OF $8.5 MILLION FROM THE IRS. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE  FOR FUNDING NORMAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE OPERATION OF OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUES AND ECOMMERCE BUSINESS, THE IMPLEMENTATION  OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN, AND PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL, IF ANY, UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE MAY  USE CASH OR OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT MERCHANDISE IMPORTS OR FOR OTHER CORPORATE  PURPOSES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM  SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES AND  WE TYPICALLY HAVE UP TO 45 DAYS TO PAY OUR INVENTORY VENDORS AND UP TO 60 DAYS TO PAY OUR OTHER VENDORS.  ON FEBRUARY 2, 2019, WE HAD $20.1 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS, $10.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND $12.3 MILLION OF BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY. SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $5.0 MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER OUR  ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  AS OF MAY  2, 2019, OUR ESTIMATED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.0 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED THE RECEIPT OF  $8.5 MILLION  INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS WE RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THE ESTIMATED CASH BALANCE AS OF MAY 2, 2019 REFLECTS  A $5.0 MILLION PAYMENT ON OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BRINGING THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE BACK DOWN TO $10.0 MILLION  AND OUR ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY TO $14.6 MILLION AS OF THAT DATE. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL  OUR COVENANTS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  34  WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, THE $8.5 MILLION  IRS TAX REFUND CHECK RECEIVED ON APRIL 22, 2019 DISCLOSED ABOVE AND ALONG WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST  REQUIREMENTS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CASH FLOW  A SUMMARY OF OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  FEBRUARY 3,  JANUARY 28,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $9,533  $24,825  $72,171  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (26,199  )  (26,778  )  (21,844  )  PROVIDED BY (USED) IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  5,438  (19,918  )  (53,349  )  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(11,228  )  $(21,871  )  $(3,022  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NET LOSS OR INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS (INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, ASSET  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND DEFERRED TAXES), THE EFFECT OF WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES AND TENANT ALLOWANCES  RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $15.3  MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME TO A NET LOSS AS WELL  AS LOWER TENANT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS  FOR INVENTORY PURCHASES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $47.3 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME AND HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR INVENTORY PURCHASES AND OTHER PAYABLES, INCLUDING SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, SUPPLIES, LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES FOR NEW BOUTIQUES, REMODELS, IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES AS WELL AS INVESTMENT IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND  OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITY.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  FEBRUARY 3,  JANUARY 28,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR.  NEW BOUTIQUES  $8,357  $19,280  $13,370  REMODELS  10,537  2,189  3,651  EXISTING BOUTIQUES  3,869  3,125  24  TECHNOLOGY  2,535  1,826  4,067  CORPORATE AND DISTRIBUTION  901  358  740  $26,199  $26,778  $21,852  OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND  2016 WERE $26.2 MILLION, $26.8 MILLION AND $21.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A MAJORITY OF OUR SPENDING IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 WERE INVESTED  IN BOUTIQUE REMODELS AT $10.5 MILLION AND IN NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AT $19.3 MILLION AND $13.4 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND  2016, RESPECTIVELY. SPENDING FOR NEW BOUTIQUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUES THAT WILL OPEN IN THE SUBSEQUENT FISCAL  YEAR.  35  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2,  2019  FEBRUARY 3,  2018  JANUARY 28,  2017  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT BOUTIQUE COUNT)  NEW BOUTIQUES.  NUMBER OF NEW BOUTIQUES OPENED  32  60  64  AVERAGE COST PER NEW BOUTIQUE  $320  $293  $235  AVERAGE TENANT ALLOWANCE PER NEW BOUTIQUE  $44  $57  $77  TENANT ALLOWANCE COLLECTED  $3,400  $3,100  $3,700  REMODELS.  NUMBER OF BOUTIQUES REMODELED  81  17  32  AVERAGE COST PER REMODELED BOUTIQUE  $149  $129  $114  THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES DURING FISCAL  YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS DUE TO HIGHER COSTS OF FURNITURE AND FIXTURES AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING OUR NEW BOUTIQUE  DESIGN PILOTED IN OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUES LAST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, THE AVERAGE BOUTIQUE BUILD-OUT COSTS WERE HIGHER IN FISCAL  YEARS 2018 AND 2017 COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS DUE TO OPENING LARGER BOUTIQUES, PARTICULARLY IN OUTLET LOCATIONS. THE AVERAGE SIZE  OF BOUTIQUES OPENED IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016 WERE 2,033 SQUARE FEET, 1,714 SQUARE FEET AND 1,597 SQUARE FEET, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE TENANT ALLOWANCE IN EACH YEAR WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO OUR CONTINUED FOCUS IN LOWERING RENTAL RATES. TENANT  ALLOWANCES ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION IN RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. THE AVERAGE COLLECTION PERIOD FOR THESE ALLOWANCES  IS APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AFTER BOUTIQUE OPENING. AS A RESULT, WE FUNDED THE COST OF NEW BOUTIQUES AND REMODELS WITH CASH FLOW  FROM OPERATIONS, TENANT ALLOWANCES FROM OUR LANDLORDS, OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AS NEEDED.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMMENCED A BOUTIQUE REFRESH PROGRAM  AND REMODELED 81 HIGH VOLUME EXISTING BOUTIQUES. WE VIEW THIS REMODEL PROGRAM AS AN IMPORTANT INVESTMENT TO CONTINUALLY ENHANCE  THE DIFFERENTIATED CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE WE STRIVE TO ACHIEVE. THE INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF REMODELS IN EACH YEAR  WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO MORE EXTENSIVE UPGRADE OR ENHANCEMENT PERFORMED AT EACH LOCATION.  THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF FISCAL YEARS 2018,  2017 AND 2016 WERE USED FOR INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING BOUTIQUES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR CORPORATE OFFICES AND FOR DISTRIBUTION  FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. OUR SPENDING FOR EXISTING BOUTIQUES TOTALED $3.9 MILLION, $3.1 MILLION AND LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION IN FISCAL  YEAR 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS MOSTLY SPENT IN RELOCATING EXISTING BOUTIQUES. OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS  IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 WERE THE HIGHEST DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW POINT-OF-SALE SYSTEM AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENTS  SYSTEM.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL YEAR  2019 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT WILL BE SPENT ON FUNDING THE OPENING OF FOUR NEW BOUTIQUES  AND INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING BOUTIQUES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF  BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, IF ANY, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AS WELL AS PROCEEDS FROM THE  EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE RELATED TAX CONSEQUENCE.  NET CASH PROVIDED  BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2018 WAS $5.4 MILLION WHICH CONSISTED OF $10.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY $4.0 MILLION REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND $0.5 MILLION PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2016 WERE $19.9 MILLION AND $53.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH MAINLY CONSISTED OF REPURCHASES  OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  PRIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON AUGUST 30, 2013, FRANCESCA\u2019S COLLECTIONS, INC., AS  BORROWER, AND ITS PARENT COMPANY, FRANCESCA\u2019S LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDED  AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cSECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH ROYAL BANK OF CANADA, AS ADMINISTRATIVE  AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE  NO LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019. SUBSEQUENT TO FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE BORROWED AN ADDITIONAL $5.0  MILLION UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHILE WAITING FOR THE RECEIPT OF AN INCOME TAX REFUND FROM THE IRS.  AS  OF MAY 2, 2019, WE HAD AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF $10.0 MILLION AFTER A $50 MILLION ON OUR OUTSTANDING BORROWING AND AN  ESTIMATED $14.6 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF THAT DATE.  ALL OBLIGATIONS OF EACH LOAN PARTY UNDER  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING AND FUTURE DIRECT AND  INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING THE BORROWERS. ALL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND THE GUARANTEES  OF THOSE OBLIGATIONS (AS WELL AS BANKING SERVICES OBLIGATIONS AND ANY INTEREST RATE HEDGING OR OTHER SWAP AGREEMENTS), ARE SECURED  BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY AND EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING AND FUTURE DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY  OWNED DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REQUIRES THE LOAN PARTIES  TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING A RESTRICTION PROHIBITING THE LOAN PARTIES FROM DECLARING OR MAKING DIVIDEND  PAYMENTS, EXCEPT THAT HOLDINGS MAY DO SO SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE PAYMENT CONDITIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT).  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THAT THE AUDITOR\u2019S REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PREVIOUS  FISCAL YEAR DOES NOT CONTAIN A \u201cGOING CONCERN\u201d OR LIKE QUALIFICATION OR EXCEPTION AND ALSO REQUIRES THE LOAN PARTIES  TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM RATIO OF (I) EBITDAR (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) MINUS UNFINANCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (AS DEFINED  IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), TO (II) FIXED CHARGES OF 1.00 TO 1.00 DURING PERIODS WHEN AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT)  IS LESS THAN $6.0 MILLION (OR HAS RECENTLY BEEN LESS THAN $6.0 MILLION AS FURTHER SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) (SUCH RATIO,  THE \u201cFIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO\u201d). AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, OUR BORROWING AVAILABILITY WAS MORE THAN $6.0 MILLION,  RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO REQUIREMENT.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BEAR  INTEREST AT A RATE EQUAL TO AN APPLICABLE MARGIN PLUS, AT THE OPTION OF THE BORROWERS, EITHER (A) IN THE CASE OF BASE RATE BORROWINGS,  A RATE EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (1) THE PRIME RATE OF JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., (2) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 1/2 OF 1.00%, AND  (3) LIBOR FOR AN INTEREST PERIOD OF ONE MONTH PLUS 1.00% (SUBJECT TO A 0.0% LIBOR FLOOR), PROVIDED THAT THAT THE INTEREST RATE  FOR BASE RATE BORROWINGS (INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF THE APPLICABLE MARGIN) SHALL BE NO LESS THAN 1.50% PER ANNUM, OR (B) IN THE  CASE OF LIBOR BORROWINGS, A RATE EQUAL TO THE LIBOR FOR THE INTEREST PERIOD RELEVANT TO SUCH BORROWING SUBJECT TO A 0.00% FLOOR.  THE APPLICABLE MARGIN FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT RANGES FROM -0.50% TO 0.00% PER ANNUM WITH RESPECT TO BASE RATE  BORROWINGS AND FROM 1.25% TO 1.75% PER ANNUM WITH RESPECT TO LIBOR BORROWINGS, IN EACH CASE BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED  LEVELS OF THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO.

PRIOR PERIOD  AMOUNTS WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION.\u201d AS A RESULT  OF ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE RECORDED AN ADJUSTMENT OF $2.1 MILLION, NET OF $0.7 MILLION TAX EFFECT, TO THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF  RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN TIMING OF RECOGNIZING GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME. IN ADDITION, THE COST OF ESTIMATED  RETURNS IS NOW INCLUDED IN CURRENT ASSETS RATHER THAN NETTED WITH THE ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS, AND ECOMMERCE SALES ARE NOW  RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT RATHER THAN DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER, WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT RELATED TO THIS CHANGE DETERMINED TO  BE IMMATERIAL.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN CONTROL OF THE MERCHANDISE IS TRANSFERRED  TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH MERCHANDISE. FOR BOUTIQUE SALES, CONTROL  IS TRANSFERRED AT THE POINT AT WHICH THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES AND PAYS FOR THE MERCHANDISE AT THE REGISTER. FOR ECOMMERCE SALES, CONTROL  IS TRANSFERRED WHEN MERCHANDISE IS TENDERED TO A THIRD PARTY CARRIER FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER. THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IS  THE STATED PRICE OF THE MERCHANDISE, NET OF ANY DISCOUNT, SALES TAX COLLECTED AND ESTIMATED SALES RETURNS, AND, IN THE CASE OF  ECOMMERCE SALES, INCLUDES SHIPPING REVENUE. CASH IS TYPICALLY RECEIVED ON THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS,  WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES FUTURE RETURNS ON PREVIOUSLY SOLD MERCHANDISE BASED ON RETURN HISTORY  AND CURRENT SALES LEVELS. ESTIMATED RETURNS ARE PERIODICALLY COMPARED TO ACTUAL SALES RETURNS AND ADJUSTED, IF APPROPRIATE. WE  DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE LIKELIHOOD THAT THERE WILL BE MATERIAL CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS WE  USE TO CALCULATE OUR MERCHANDISE RETURN RESERVE; HOWEVER, IF THE ACTUAL RATE OF MERCHANDISE RETURNS INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY, OUR  OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES WHILE THE ASSOCIATED  COST OF MERCHANDISE IS INCLUDED AS PART OF PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  INVENTORY VALUATION  WE VALUE MERCHANDISE INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST AND NET  REALIZABLE VALUE ON A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST BASIS. INVENTORY COSTS INCLUDE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND FREIGHT COSTS. WE RECORD MERCHANDISE  RECEIPTS AT THE TIME THEY ARE DELIVERED TO OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER OR TO OUR BOUTIQUES DIRECTLY FROM VENDORS.  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO IDENTIFY SLOW-MOVING  MERCHANDISE. IN ORDER TO CLEAR SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE, WE USE PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWNS OR MARK CERTAIN ITEMS OUT-OF-STOCK AND DISPOSE  OF SUCH INVENTORY AT A PACE SUITABLE FOR OUR MERCHANDISING STRATEGY. EACH PERIOD, WE EVALUATE RECENT SELLING TRENDS AND THE RELATED  PROMOTIONAL EVENTS OR PRICING STRATEGIES IN PLACE TO SELL THROUGH THE CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS. PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWNS, ADDITIONS  TO THE LOWER OF COST AND NET REALIZABLE VALUE (\u201cLNRV\u201d) RESERVE OR INVENTORY DISPOSAL MAY OCCUR WHEN INVENTORY EXCEEDS  OUR EXPECTED CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR REASONS OF STYLE, SEASONAL ADAPTATION, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCE, LACK OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE  OF FASHION ITEMS, COMPETITION OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE INVENTORY IN STOCK WILL NOT SELL AT ITS CURRENTLY TICKETED PRICE.  SUCH MARKDOWNS OR DISPOSALS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON EARNINGS, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT AND AMOUNT OF INVENTORY AFFECTED. IN  ADDITION, THE ANTICIPATED DEPLOYMENT OF NEW MERCHANDISE IS REFLECTED WITHIN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE PROMOTIONAL MARKDOWN PLAN AS SUCH  NEW INVENTORY, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WILL DISPLACE MERCHANDISE CURRENTLY ON-HAND.  WE ALSO ESTIMATE AN INVENTORY SHRINKAGE RESERVE FOR THE PERIOD  OF TIME BETWEEN THE LAST PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNT AND THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE ESTIMATE FOR SHRINKAGE RESERVE CAN BE AFFECTED  BY CHANGES IN MERCHANDISE MIX AND CHANGES IN ACTUAL SHRINKAGE TRENDS.  38  CHANGES TO THE LNRV AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN COST  OF GOODS SOLD AND OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  IF THERE ARE MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS  WE USE TO CALCULATE OUR LNRV OR SHRINKAGE RESERVES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE AFFECTED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  WE EVALUATE LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE AND HELD FOR SALE  WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THOSE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE  GROUPED AND EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT A BOUTIQUE  LEVEL. IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, WE CONSIDER BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS.  THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE UNDISCOUNTED  FUTURE CASH FLOWS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ASSET AND COMPARING IT AGAINST ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET  IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET AND ITS DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE  ASSET\u2019S HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, CURRENT SALES TRENDS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS DEEMED MATERIAL, AND DISCOUNTED  USING A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. THE INPUTS USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE CONSIDERED AS  LEVEL 3 INPUTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR ASSESSMENTS, WE RECORDED NON-CASH  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $20.1 MILLION, $0.3 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THESE  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATE TO 153, 3 AND 2 UNDERPERFORMING BOUTIQUES IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY, FOR WHICH  THE REMAINING NET BOOK VALUE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018, THE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES INCLUDES A $4.9 MILLION WRITE-OFF OF BOUTIQUE FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND SUPPLIES THAT ARE NO LONGER  INTENDED TO BE USED AS A RESULT OF POSTPONING NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS AND REMODELS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES USING THE LIABILITY METHOD. UNDER  THIS METHOD, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES CURRENTLY PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE IS ACCRUED, AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED  FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT CURRENTLY EXIST BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS AND THE FINANCIAL  REPORTING BASIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE REALIZATION OF THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT OCCUR.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED  TAX RATES IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS WHEN THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM A  CHANGE IN TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE OF THE CHANGE. CHANGES  IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW EFFECTIVE  ON JANUARY 1, 2018. UPON ENACTMENT, WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AND ONE-TIME NON-CASH DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE OF $3.3 MILLION DUE  TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE REDUCTION OF THE STATUTORY FEDERAL TAX RATE TO 21%.  THIS EXPENSE IS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS  OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT AND DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS WAS NEEDED TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED PROVISIONAL AMOUNT.  WE PERFORM AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS  NECESSARY AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSET AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. BASED ON AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING  PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME, FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND TAX PLANNING  STRATEGIES, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT IT IS NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT IT WILL REALIZE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN FUTURE PERIODS  AND THEREFORE, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS ESTABLISHED AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECORDED A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF  $17.1 MILLION ON OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE  EVIDENCE IN FUTURE PERIODS AND, IN THE EVENT THAT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, WE MAY REVERSE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE  PERIODS WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR REPORTED NET INCOME IN THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  A TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION MAY BE RECOGNIZED  WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS  OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS. INCOME TAX POSITIONS MUST MEET A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD  TO BE RECOGNIZED.  WE RECOGNIZE TAX LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND  ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES WHEN THE COMPANY\u2019S JUDGMENT CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF NEW INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY  AVAILABLE. INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THERE WERE NO UNCERTAIN  TAX POSITIONS REQUIRING ACCRUAL AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 3, 2018.  39  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT DATE  FAIR VALUE AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (WHICH GENERALLY IS THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD).  BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, FORFEITURES WERE RECOGNIZED AS THEY OCCUR RATHER THAN ESTIMATING EXPECTED FORFEITURES.  WE RECOGNIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTING TO $1.3 MILLION,  $2.4 MILLION AND $1.0 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEARS  2018 AND 2016 INCLUDED A $0.8 MILLION AND $2.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  RELATED TO THE FORFEITURE OF UNVESTED AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR PREVIOUS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WHO RESIGNED FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE  POSITION IN THOSE YEARS. THE NET REVERSAL WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL YEAR 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  RESTRICTED STOCK  THE FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED STOCKS AWARDS IS DETERMINED BASED  ON THE CLOSING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE AWARD DATE. FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS SUBJECT TO PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS, COMPENSATION  EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE GOALS WILL BE ACHIEVED.  WE ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF VESTING AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND ADJUST STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BASED ON THE RESULTS OF SUCH  ASSESSMENT. AS A RESULT OF THIS ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A REVERSAL OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED EXPENSES TOTALING $0.9 MILLION,  $1.2 MILLION AND $0 IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  CHANGES IN THESE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT  THE MEASUREMENT OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  STOCK OPTIONS  WE GENERALLY USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE  THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, EXCEPT FOR STOCK OPTIONS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS FOR WHICH WE USE A MONTE-CARLO SIMULATION  MODEL. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE USING EACH OF THESE MODELS CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.  \u00b7  EXPECTED VOLATILITY.  WE ESTIMATED EXPECTED VOLATILITY USING THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF OUR OWN COMMON STOCK.  \u00b7  EXPECTED TERM.  THE EXPECTED TERM REPRESENTS THE PERIOD OF TIME OPTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING. DUE TO LACK OF  SUFFICIENT HISTORICAL DATA, WE USE THE \u201cSIMPLIFIED METHOD\u201d AS ALLOWED BY SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN TOPIC 14D2 TO  ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED TERM. THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD DEFINES EXPECTED TERM AS THE MIDPOINT BETWEEN THE VESTING DATE AND THE CONTRACTUAL  TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION.  \u00b7  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE.  THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON THE RATE OF TREASURY INSTRUMENTS WHOSE MATURITIES ARE  SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARD BEING VALUED.  \u00b7  EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD.  THE EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTATIONS OF NOT PAYING DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON  STOCK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NO STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017.  THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED IN 2016 WAS ESTIMATED USING EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 54.2%, EXPECTED TERM OF 5.5  YEARS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE OF 1.2%, AND EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD OF 0%.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE ARE NOT PARTY TO ANY OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS  OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND THE EFFECT SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  40  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  LESS THAN  MORE THAN  TOTAL  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  5 YEARS  (IN THOUSANDS)  LONG TERM DEBT  $10,000  $-  $-  $10,000  $-  ESTIMATED INTEREST ON DEBT  (1)  2,287  530  1,059  698  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (2)  244,891  48,644  80,141  57,067  59,039  MERCHANDISE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS  (3)  28,927  28,927  -  -  -  CONTRACTS FOR SOFTWARE APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION  5,934  3,170  2,540  224  -  (1)  INCLUDES $1.9 MILLION ESTIMATED INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING  BORROWING AND $0.4 MILLION UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE, WE ESTIMATED THE INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING BORROWING  AND UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE USING $10.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING, $40.0 UNUSED REVOLVER COMMITMENT, 4.4% CURRENT INTEREST RATE AND 0.20%  UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE RATE UNDER OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  (2)  EXCLUDES COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE CHARGES, REAL ESTATE  TAXES AND CERTAIN OTHER EXPENSES WHICH AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 46% OF MINIMUM LEASE OBLIGATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE PRESENTED  BASED ON HISTORICAL COST. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION DUE TO THE IMPRECISE NATURE OF THE  ESTIMATES REQUIRED, WE BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, IF ANY, ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN  IMMATERIAL. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED  BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\"  NATURE OF OPERATIONS  WE DESIGN, DEVELOP AND MARKET PROGRAMMABLE DEVICES AND ASSOCIATED TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING ADVANCED ICS IN THE FORM OF PLDS, BOARDS, SOFTWARE DESIGN TOOLS AND PREDEFINED SYSTEM FUNCTIONS DELIVERED AS IP. IN ADDITION TO OUR PROGRAMMABLE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE DESIGN SERVICES, CUSTOMER TRAINING, FIELD ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. OUR PLDS INCLUDE FPGAS, CPLDS AND PROGRAMMABLE SOCS. THESE DEVICES ARE STANDARD PRODUCTS THAT OUR CUSTOMERS PROGRAM TO PERFORM DESIRED LOGIC FUNCTIONS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE HIGH INTEGRATION AND QUICK TIME-TO-MARKET FOR ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS IN END MARKETS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION & DATA CENTER, INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, AND AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS GLOBALLY THROUGH AN INDEPENDENT DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL AND THROUGH DIRECT SALES TO OEMS BY SELECTED INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVE FIRMS AND BY A DIRECT SALES MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE SEC HAS DEFINED CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE THAT ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE US TO MAKE OUR MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. BASED ON THIS DEFINITION, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDE: VALUATION OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH IMPACTS LOSSES ON DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WHEN WE RECORD IMPAIRMENTS; REVENUE RECOGNITION, WHICH IMPACTS THE RECORDING OF REVENUES; AND VALUATION OF INVENTORIES, WHICH IMPACTS COST OF REVENUES AND GROSS MARGIN. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ALSO INCLUDE: THE ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHICH IMPACTS THEIR VALUATION; THE ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL, WHICH IMPACTS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT; ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WHICH IMPACTS THE PROVISION OR BENEFIT RECOGNIZED FOR INCOME TAXES, AS WELL AS, THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH IMPACTS THE VALUATION OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECOGNIZED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. BELOW, WE DISCUSS THESE POLICIES FURTHER, AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE NOT AS SUBJECTIVE, AND THEREFORE, THEIR APPLICATION WOULD NOT REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE AS DIFFICULT, BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.  VALUATION OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF PRIMARILY MARKETABLE DEBT, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, EQUITY SECURITIES. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A FAIR VALUE OF  $2.74 BILLION.  WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUES FOR MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING INDUSTRY STANDARD PRICING SERVICES, DATA PROVIDERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SOURCES AND BY INTERNALLY PERFORMING VALUATION TESTING AND ANALYSES. SEE \"NOTE 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\" TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,\" FOR DETAILS OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES. IN DETERMINING IF AND WHEN A DECLINE IN VALUE BELOW THE ADJUSTED COST OF MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, WE EVALUATE ON AN ONGOING BASIS THE MARKET CONDITIONS, TRENDS OF EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT RATINGS, ANY UNDERLYING COLLATERAL AND OTHER KEY MEASURES FOR OUR INVESTMENTS. WE DID NOT RECORD ANY OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FOR MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES IN FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  OR  2017  . MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE, WHETHER REALIZED OR UNREALIZED, RECORDED THROUGH THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2019 AFTER THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2016-01.  OUR INVESTMENTS IN NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE UPON THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01. THE CARRYING VALUE IS MEASURED AT COST, LESS ANY IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS CHANGES RESULTING FROM OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE IDENTICAL OR A SIMILAR INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. DETERMINING WHETHER AN OBSERVED TRANSACTION IS SIMILAR TO A SECURITY WITHIN OUR PORTFOLIO REQUIRES JUDGMENT BASED ON THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE SECURITIES. OUR PERIODIC ASSESSMENT OF IMPAIRMENT IS MADE BY CONSIDERING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING THE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE INVESTEE\u2019S INDUSTRY, THE INVESTEE\u2019S PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT STATUS AND SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS OF FINANCING AND THE RELATED VALUATION AND/OR OUR PARTICIPATION IN SUCH FINANCINGS. WE ALSO ASSESS THE INVESTEE\u2019S ABILITY TO MEET BUSINESS MILESTONES AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL INVESTEE, INCLUDING THE RATE AT WHICH THE INVESTEE IS USING ITS CASH, THE INVESTEE\u2019S NEED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AT A LOWER VALUATION AND ANY BONA FIDE OFFER TO PURCHASE THE INVESTEE FROM A  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROSPECTIVE ACQUIRER. THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES IS BASED ON THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE WHICH REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND ARE LEVEL 3 INPUTS. SEE \u201cNOTE 3. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. WHEN A DECLINE IN VALUE IS DEEMED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, WE RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS TO THE EXTENT OF THE DECLINE. THE IMPAIRMENTS LOSS FOR NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL DURING ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUE FROM SALES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS IS RECOGNIZED UPON THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS AT SHIPMENT, AND IS REDUCED BY ESTIMATED ALLOWANCES FOR DISTRIBUTOR PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AND RIGHTS OF RETURN. THE DISTRIBUTOR PRICE ADJUSTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ACTUAL AND FORECASTED SHIP AND DEBIT CLAIMS, AT THE DISTRIBUTOR AND PART LEVEL TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT PRICING AND BUSINESS TRENDS. FOR FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  54%  OF OUR NET REVENUES WERE FROM PRODUCTS SOLD TO DISTRIBUTORS PRIMARILY FOR SUBSEQUENT RESALE TO OEMS OR THEIR SUBCONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.  REVENUE FROM SALES TO OUR NON-DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS IS RECOGNIZED NET OF SALES INCENTIVES (IF ANY) UPON TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS AT SHIPMENT. SALES RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES ON PRODUCT SALES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE.  REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND RENEWALS IS  RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE. REVENUE FROM SUPPORT SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE LICENSES AND SUPPORT SERVICES WERE LESS THAN  2%  OF NET REVENUES FOR ALL OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  VALUATION OF INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF ACTUAL COST (DETERMINED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD) OR MARKET (ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE). THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY AS WELL AS INVENTORY THAT IS NOT OF SALABLE QUALITY. WE REVIEW AND SET STANDARD COSTS QUARTERLY TO APPROXIMATE CURRENT ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS. OUR MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD STANDARDS FOR PRODUCT COSTS ARE CALCULATED ASSUMING FULL ABSORPTION OF ACTUAL SPENDING OVER ACTUAL VOLUMES. GIVEN THE CYCLICALITY OF THE MARKET, THE OBSOLESCENCE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT LIFECYCLES, WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORY BASED ON FORECASTED DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE. THESE FORECASTS ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON INPUTS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING BOOKINGS AND EXTENDED BUT UNCOMMITTED DEMAND FORECASTS, AND INTERNAL ANALYSES SUCH AS CUSTOMER HISTORICAL PURCHASING TRENDS AND ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED DESIGN WINS, AS WELL AS MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TECHNOLOGY CHANGES, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND CHANGES IN STRATEGIC DIRECTION. THESE FACTORS REQUIRE ESTIMATES THAT MAY INCLUDE UNCERTAIN ELEMENTS. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMAND THAT WE USE IN THE VALUATION OF INVENTORY ARE THE BASIS FOR OUR PUBLISHED REVENUE FORECASTS, WHICH ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH OUR SHORT-TERM MANUFACTURING PLANS. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR DEMAND FORECAST AND THE ACTUAL DEMAND IN THE RECENT PAST HAVE NOT RESULTED IN ANY MATERIAL WRITE DOWN IN OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR DEMAND FORECAST FOR SPECIFIC PRODUCTS IS GREATER THAN ACTUAL DEMAND AND WE FAIL TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING OUTPUT ACCORDINGLY, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO WRITE DOWN ADDITIONAL INVENTORY, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST. IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARE REVIEWED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST AND ASSETS ARE HELD FOR USE, WE ESTIMATE FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSETS. IN THE EVENT SUCH CASH FLOWS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE ASSETS, THE ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES BASED ON THE EXPECTED DISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSETS OR BASED ON APPRAISALS. FACTORS AFFECTING IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS HELD FOR USE INCLUDE THE ABILITY OF THE SPECIFIC ASSETS TO GENERATE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS.  WHEN ASSETS ARE REMOVED FROM OPERATIONS AND HELD FOR SALE, WE ESTIMATE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS OVER THEIR FAIR VALUE. MARKET CONDITIONS ARE AMONGST THE FACTORS AFFECTING IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS HELD FOR SALE. CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE FACTORS COULD NECESSITATE IMPAIRMENT RECOGNITION IN FUTURE PERIODS FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS SUCH AS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE CONSIDERED NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS, AND ARE ONLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL  GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT IS SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST, AND GOODWILL IS WRITTEN DOWN WHEN IT IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN WHICH THE GOODWILL RESIDES TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THE GOODWILL OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS POTENTIALLY IMPAIRED. FOR PURPOSES OF IMPAIRMENT TESTING, XILINX OPERATES AS A SINGLE REPORTING UNIT. WE USE THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW PERFORMED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN FISCAL  2019  . UNLESS THERE ARE INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT, OUR NEXT IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR GOODWILL WILL BE PERFORMED AND COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . TO DATE, NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  XILINX IS A MULTINATIONAL CORPORATION OPERATING IN MULTIPLE TAX JURISDICTIONS. WE MUST DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME TO EACH OF THESE JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND APPLY THE APPROPRIATE TAX RATES FOR THESE JURISDICTIONS. WE UNDERGO ROUTINE AUDITS BY TAXING AUTHORITIES REGARDING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DEDUCTIONS AND THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS. TAX AUDITS OFTEN REQUIRE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME TO RESOLVE AND MAY RESULT IN INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS IF CHANGES TO THE ALLOCATION ARE REQUIRED BETWEEN JURISDICTIONS WITH DIFFERENT TAX RATES.  IN DETERMINING INCOME FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES AND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE MUST ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT AND LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSSES ARISING FROM AUDITS OR DEFICIENCY NOTICES ISSUED BY TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TAXING AUTHORITIES' POSITIONS AND OUR ASSESSMENT CAN CHANGE OVER TIME RESULTING IN A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN PERIODS WHEN THESE CHANGES OCCUR.  WE MUST ALSO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IF RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST INCREASE OUR PROVISION FOR TAXES BY RECORDING A RESERVE IN THE FORM OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WE ESTIMATE WILL NOT ULTIMATELY BE RECOVERABLE.  WE PERFORM A TWO-STEP APPROACH TO RECOGNIZE AND MEASURE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS RELATING TO ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THE FIRST STEP IS TO EVALUATE THE TAX POSITION FOR RECOGNITION BY DETERMINING IF THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON AUDIT, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, IF ANY. THE SECOND STEP IS TO MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS MORE THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING ULTIMATELY REALIZED.  BUSINESS COMBINATION  WE USE THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM THE ACQUIREE BASED ON THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. CRITICAL ESTIMATES IN VALUING INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF FUTURE GROWTH AND MARGINS, FUTURE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, EXPECTED COST AND TIME TO DEVELOP IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, BRAND AWARENESS AND DISCOUNT RATES. FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED  43%  IN FISCAL  2019  WHILE REVENUES FROM OUR CORE PRODUCTS REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE. THE INCREASE IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER ADVANCED PRODUCTS SALES ACROSS ALL END MARKETS, PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNICATIONS. NET REVENUES IN FISCAL  2018  WERE  $2.47 BILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  5%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2017  .  REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED  20%  IN FISCAL  2018  BUT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES FROM OUR CORE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN ADVANCED PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER SALES ACROSS ALL END MARKETS, ESPECIALLY IN DATA CENTER & TME. SEE ALSO \"NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT\" AND \"NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS\" BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PRODUCT AND END MARKET CATEGORIES.  EXCEPT FOR AVNET,  NO  OTHER DISTRIBUTOR OR END CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  10%  OF NET REVENUES FOR ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS TO GLOBAL MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN END MARKETS SUCH AS COMMUNICATION & DATA CENTER, INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE, AND AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR NET REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM SALES OF OUR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS, BUT WE ALSO GENERATE SALES FROM SUPPORT PRODUCTS. WE CLASSIFY OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO TWO CATEGORIES: ADVANCED PRODUCTS AND CORE PRODUCTS.  \u2022  ADVANCED PRODUCTS ARE OUR MOST RECENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INCLUDE THE ULTRASCALE+, ULTRASCALE AND 7-SERIES PRODUCT FAMILIES, AND OUR ALVEO BOARDS BUSINESS.  \u2022  CORE PRODUCTS ARE ALL OTHER PRODUCT FAMILIES.  THESE PRODUCT CATEGORIES ARE MODIFIED ON A PERIODIC BASIS TO BETTER REFLECT THE MATURITY OF THE PRODUCTS AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. THE MOST RECENT MODIFICATION WAS MADE ON APRIL 3, 2016, WHICH WAS THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL 2017, WHEREBY WE RECLASSIFIED OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH HOW THESE CATEGORIES ARE ANALYZED AND REVIEWED INTERNALLY.  SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE GROUPED THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED AT THE 28NM, 20NM AND 16NM NODES INTO A CATEGORY NAMED ADVANCED PRODUCTS WHILE ALL OTHER PRODUCTS ARE INCLUDED IN A CATEGORY NAMED CORE PRODUCTS.  NET REVENUES BY PRODUCT CATEGORIES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (IN MILLIONS)  2019% OF TOTAL% CHANGE  2018% OF TOTAL% CHANGE  2017  ADVANCED PRODUCTS  $1,952.4  64  43  $1,362.8  55  20  $1,131.3  CORE PRODUCTS  1,106.6  36  \u2014  1,104.2  45  (10  )  1,225.4  TOTAL NET REVENUES  $3,059.0  100  24  $2,467.0  100  5  $2,356.7  NET REVENUES FROM ADVANCED PRODUCTS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN FISCAL  2019  DRIVEN BY SALES GROWTH IN 28NM, 20NM AND, IN PARTICULAR, 16NM PRODUCT FAMILIES. SALES FROM OUR 16NM PRODUCTS WERE OVER $500.0 MILLION, WHILE SALES FROM OUR 20NM AND 28NM PRODUCTS EXCEEDED $400.0 MILLION AND $900.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL  2019  .  IN FISCAL  2018  , GROWTH ACROSS ALL NODES OF OUR ADVANCED PRODUCTS FAMILIES CONTRIBUTED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. SALES FROM OUR 28NM PRODUCTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $900.0 MILLION, WHILE SALES FROM OUR 20NM AND 16NM PRODUCTS EXCEEDED $300.0 MILLION AND $100.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL  2018  . WE EXPECT SALES OF ADVANCED PRODUCTS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AS MORE CUSTOMER PROGRAMS ENTER INTO VOLUME PRODUCTION WITH OUR 16NM PRODUCTS.  NET REVENUES FROM CORE PRODUCTS WERE FLAT IN FISCAL  2019  , WHILE THEY DECREASED IN FISCAL  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL  2019  THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM SPARTAN-6 PRODUCT WAS OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SALES FROM OUR VIRTEX-6 AND VIRTEX-5 PRODUCT FAMILIES, WHILE THE DECREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN SALES FROM OUR VIRTEX-5, VIRTEX-6 AND SPARTAN-3 PRODUCT FAMILIES.  NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS  OUR END MARKET REVENUE DATA IS DERIVED FROM OUR UNDERSTANDING OF OUR END CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRIMARY MARKETS, WHICH IS BASED ON REPORTS PROVIDED BY DISTRIBUTORS AND OUR INTERNAL RECORDS. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL VISIBILITY, STARTING APRIL 1, 2018, WE CLASSIFY OUR END MARKETS INTO BUSINESSES WITH SIMILAR MARKET DRIVERS: DATA CENTER & TME; AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER; COMMUNICATIONS; AND INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE. ADDITIONALLY, WE CLASSIFY REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS, BUT NOT YET SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TO THE END MARKETS, AND NOT IDENTIFIABLE TO AN END MARKET, AS CHANNEL REVENUE. THE CHANNEL REVENUE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS AND WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TO THE END CUSTOMERS WITHIN THE GIVEN PERIOD. THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE CALCULATION IN THE TABLE BELOW REPRESENTS THE YEAR-TO-YEAR DOLLAR CHANGE IN EACH END MARKET.  NET REVENUES BY END MARKETS FOR FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM DATA CENTER. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM TME, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, DATA CENTER.  NET REVENUES FROM AUTOMOTIVE, BROADCAST & CONSUMER INCREASED, IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS, IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES IN FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AUTOMOTIVE AND AUDIO, VIDEO AND BROADCAST.  NET REVENUES FROM COMMUNICATIONS INCREASED IN FISCAL  2019  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM ALL SUB-SEGMENTS, WITH PARTICULAR STRENGTH COMING FROM WIRELESS BUSINESS DRIVEN BY BOTH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF 4G LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) NETWORKS AND THE ACCELERATED GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT RAMP OF 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS. IN FISCAL  2018  , NET REVENUES FROM COMMUNICATIONS DECREASED, DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN SALES FROM BOTH WIRELINE AND WIRELESS, FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET REVENUES FROM INDUSTRIAL, AEROSPACE & DEFENSE INCREASED, IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTE DOLLARS, IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  WERE DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM ALL SUB-SEGMENTS.  CHANNEL REVENUE WAS A POSITIVE AMOUNT IN FISCAL  2019  , BECAUSE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS EXCEEDED WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SHIPPED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING SUCH PERIOD. IN FISCAL  2018  , CHANNEL REVENUE WAS A NEGATIVE AMOUNT BECAUSE SHIPMENTS TO DISTRIBUTORS WAS LOWER THAN WHAT THE DISTRIBUTORS SUBSEQUENTLY SHIPPED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS DURING SUCH PERIOD.  NET REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY  GEOGRAPHIC REVENUE INFORMATION REFLECTS THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE DISTRIBUTORS, OEMS OR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS WHO PURCHASED OUR PRODUCTS. THIS MAY DIFFER FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF THE END CUSTOMERS. NET REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS INDICATED WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM DATA CENTER AND WIRELINE, AND THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE.  NET REVENUES IN ASIA PACIFIC INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM WIRELESS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, FROM INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL, WHILE THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES FROM CONSUMER, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT FROM INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL.  NET REVENUES IN EUROPE INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL  2019  , THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES FROM AUTOMOTIVE, WHILE IN FISCAL  2018  THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH FROM TME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES FROM WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS.  NET REVENUES IN JAPAN INCREASED IN BOTH FISCAL  2019  AND  2018  FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. IN FISCAL 2019, THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES IN TME AND AUDIO, VIDEO AND BROADCAST, WHILE IN FISCAL 2018 THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES IN TME AND INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC AND MEDICAL.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO END-MARKET MIX, AS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DERIVED FROM WIRELESS (WHICH HAS RELATIVELY LOWER GROSS MARGIN) HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.  GROSS MARGIN MAY BE AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE IN \"RISK FACTORS,\" INCLUDED IN PART I OF THIS FORM 10-K, SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF CUSTOMERS AND PRODUCTS, COMPETITIVE-PRICING PRESSURE, MANUFACTURING-YIELD ISSUES AND WAFER PRICING. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MITIGATE ANY ADVERSE IMPACTS FROM THESE FACTORS BY CONTINUING TO IMPROVE YIELDS ON OUR ADVANCED PRODUCTS, IMPROVE MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES AND IMPROVE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE MANAGEMENT, CONTINUING GROWTH IN WIRELESS DRIVEN BY BOTH THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF 4G LONG TERM EVOLUTION (LTE) NETWORKS AND THE RAMP UP GLOBAL DEPLOYMENT OF 5G WIRELESS NETWORKS WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGIN IN THE FUTURE.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ORDER TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY, WE PASS MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF REDUCED PRICES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN MAINTAIN ACCEPTABLE MARGINS. PRICE EROSION IS COMMON IN THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY, AS ADVANCES IN BOTH PRODUCT ARCHITECTURE AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS TECHNOLOGY PERMIT CONTINUAL REDUCTIONS IN UNIT COST. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO OFFSET MUCH OF THIS REVENUE DECLINE IN OUR MATURE PRODUCTS WITH INCREASED REVENUES FROM NEWER PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  CHANGE  2018  CHANGE  2017  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $743.0  16%  $639.8  6%  $601.4  PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  24%  26%  26%  R&D SPENDING INCREASED BY $103.2 MILLION OR  16%  DURING FISCAL  2019  , AND BY $38.4 MILLION OR  6%  DURING FISCAL  2018  , FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION), AS WE INCREASED HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS. FOR FISCAL 2018, THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MASK AND WAFER SPENDING.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO SELECTIVELY INVEST IN R&D EFFORTS IN AREAS SUCH AS NEW PRODUCTS AND MORE ADVANCED PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, IP CORES AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS. WE MAY ALSO CONSIDER ACQUISITIONS TO COMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY FOR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND ENGINEERING RESOURCES IN CRITICAL AREAS.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VARIABLE SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGIN SUCH AS SALES COMMISSION AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES. IN FISCAL  2018  , THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION (INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) FROM INCREASED HEADCOUNT RELATING TO REVENUE GROWTH.  EXECUTIVE TRANSITION COSTS  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE TRANSITION OF OUR PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER POSITION, WHEREBY MOSHE GAVRIELOV RESIGNED FROM THOSE ROLES AND VICTOR PENG ASSUMED THESE ROLES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO IMPLEMENTED RESTRUCTURING MEASURES TO REALIGN RESOURCES AND DRIVE OVERALL OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, WHICH IMPACTED APPROXIMATELY 60 POSITIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND FUNCTIONS WORLDWIDE. WE RECORDED TOTAL TRANSITION CHARGES OF $33.4 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY RELATED TO SEVERANCE PAY EXPENSES AND OTHER BENEFITS. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2019, THE REMAINING ACCRUAL FOR SEVERANCE AND OTHER BENEFITS WAS IMMATERIAL.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME FROM THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN FISCAL  2018  , WE HAD NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME OF  $5.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NET INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE OF  $8.3 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2017  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST INCOME FROM THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LOWER INTEREST EXPENSES FROM THE 2024 NOTES AND ITS RELATED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.

THE TCJA PROVIDES FOR NUMEROUS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES AND MODIFICATIONS INCLUDING THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, THE REQUIREMENT FOR COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED AND THE CREATION OF A NEW TAX ON THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI) OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  SOME PROVISIONS OF THE TCJA BEGAN TO IMPACT US IN FISCAL 2018, WHILE OTHER PROVISIONS IMPACTED US BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2019.  STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 118 ALLOWED COMPANIES TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS AND RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF THE TAX LAW CHANGES DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  WE RECORDED PROVISIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $214.7 MILLION IN OUR FISCAL 2018 RESULTS.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $2.4 MILLION AS MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018. THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ENDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ALTHOUGH THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD HAS CLOSED, FURTHER TECHNICAL GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE TCJA, INCLUDING FINAL REGULATIONS ON A BROAD RANGE OF TOPICS, IS EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 740, THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE ANY EFFECTS OF THE GUIDANCE IN THE PERIOD THAT SUCH GUIDANCE IS ISSUED.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF INCOME EARNED IN LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEW TAX ON GILTI.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL TAX RATE OF 31.5% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX NET OF THE REVERSAL OF THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF INCOME EARNED IN LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS.  THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2019 FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX OF $590.2 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON A PORTION OF UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN ACCRUED THROUGH FISCAL 2017 IN THE AMOUNT OF $381.7 MILLION.  THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX OF $590.2 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON A PORTION OF UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAD BEEN ACCRUED THROUGH FISCAL 2017 IN THE AMOUNT OF $381.7 MILLION.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCING TO SUPPORT ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN CRITICAL OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES, PURCHASE FACILITIES AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK AND DEBENTURES UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PAY DIVIDENDS AND FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES ARE LIQUID AND AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BUSINESS NEEDS.  FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO FISCAL  2018  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS  THE COMBINATION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  TOTALED  $3.23 BILLION  AND  $3.55 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $3.18 BILLION  AND WORKING CAPITAL OF  $3.42 BILLION  . AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  , CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE  $3.45 BILLION  AND WORKING CAPITAL WAS  $3.24 BILLION.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $1.80 BILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. ENTITIES. THE RECENT TCJA THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, SUBJECTS U.S. COMPANIES TO A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON TOTAL POST-1986 EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF THEIR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE TCJA ALSO GENERALLY ALLOWS COMPANIES TO REPATRIATE THESE ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL TAXES BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017.  ACCORDINGLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL $1.80 BILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. ENTITIES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN THE U.S. WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY IS PAYABLE IN EIGHT ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS, AS OUTLINED IN \"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\" BELOW. THE FIRST INSTALLMENT WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE SECOND INSTALLMENT IS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT INCOME TAX PAYABLE. SEE \u201cNOTE 14. INCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN ITEM 8. \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA,\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX.  DURING FISCAL  2019  , OUR OPERATIONS GENERATED NET POSITIVE CASH FLOW OF  $1.09 BILLION  , WHICH WAS  $271.1 MILLION  HIGHER THAN THE  $820.0 MILLION  GENERATED DURING FISCAL  2018  . THE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS GENERATED DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY FROM NET INCOME AS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH RELATED ITEMS AND DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN INVENTORIES AND OTHER ASSETS AND A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $690.5 MILLION  DURING FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $948.2 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018  . NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  CONSISTED OF  $312.5 MILLION  OF NET PURCHASES OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES,  $234.1 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEEPHI TECH ACQUISITION,  $89.0 MILLION  OF PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OTHER INTANGIBLES AND  $54.8 MILLION  OF OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEC, THE TABLE ABOVE SHOWS OUR BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE NET ASSETS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE TABLE, THE ANNUALIZED BASE MANAGEMENT FEE HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO  3.06% OF THE AVERAGE NET ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL ANNUALIZED AMOUNT OF THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE BY OUR AVERAGE NET ASSETS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE FOR THE QUARTER  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 BEFORE APPLICATION OF ANY CREDITS WAS $3.1 MILLION.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE 1940 ACT, THE ADVISER MAKES AVAILABLE SIGNIFICANT MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE TO OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. THE ADVISER MAY ALSO PROVIDE OTHER SERVICES TO OUR  PORTFOLIO COMPANIES UNDER CERTAIN AGREEMENTS AND MAY RECEIVE FEES FOR SERVICES OTHER THAN MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE. SUCH SERVICES MAY INCLUDE: (I) ASSISTANCE OBTAINING, SOURCING OR STRUCTURING CREDIT FACILITIES, LONG TERM LOANS OR ADDITIONAL  EQUITY FROM UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; (II) NEGOTIATING IMPORTANT CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS; (III) CONSULTING SERVICES REGARDING RESTRUCTURING OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY AND FINANCIAL MODELING AS IT RELATES TO RAISING ADDITIONAL  DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL FROM UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTIES; AND (IV) PRIMARY ROLE IN INTERVIEWING, VETTING, AND NEGOTIATING EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS WITH CANDIDATES IN CONNECTION WITH ADDING AND RETAINING KEY PORTFOLIO COMPANY MANAGEMENT TEAM MEMBERS.

(6)  THE INCENTIVE FEE PAYABLE TO THE ADVISER UNDER THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS: AN INCOME-BASED  FEE AND A CAPITAL GAINS-BASED FEE. THE INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, AND EQUALS 20% OF THE EXCESS, IF ANY, OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME THAT EXCEEDS A 1.75%  QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE OF OUR NET ASSETS, WHICH WE DEFINE AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS INDEBTEDNESS AND BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE OR CONTRACTUALLY DUE BUT NOT PAYABLE DURING THE PERIOD, AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING  CALENDAR QUARTER, ADJUSTED APPROPRIATELY FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE PERIOD, SUBJECT TO A  \u201cCATCH-UP\u201d  PROVISION MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER. THE  \u201cCATCH-UP\u201d  PROVISION REQUIRES US TO PAY 100% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME WITH RESPECT TO THAT PORTION OF SUCH INCOME, IF ANY, THAT EXCEEDS THE  HURDLE RATE BUT IS LESS THAN 125% OF THE QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE (OR 2.1875%) IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER (8.75% ANNUALIZED). THE  CATCH-UP  PROVISION IS MEANT TO PROVIDE OUR ADVISER WITH 20% OF OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME AS IF A HURDLE RATE DID NOT APPLY WHEN OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDS 125% OF THE QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE IN ANY  CALENDAR QUARTER. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WAS $1.3 MILLION.  THE CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE EQUALS 20% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS IN EXCESS OF UNREALIZED DEPRECIATION SINCE OUR INCEPTION,  IF ANY, COMPUTED AS ALL REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION SINCE OUR INCEPTION, LESS ANY PRIOR PAYMENTS, MEASURED AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR YEAR AND PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE RECORDED CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEES OF $2.1 MILLION IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, WHICH WERE NOT CONTRACTUALLY DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT.  NO CREDITS WERE APPLIED TO THE INCENTIVE FEE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019; HOWEVER, THE ADVISER MAY CREDIT SUCH FEE IN THE  FUTURE.  EXAMPLES OF HOW THE INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE CALCULATED ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 0.55%, THERE WOULD BE  NO INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE BECAUSE SUCH INCOME WOULD NOT EXCEED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.75%.  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 2.00%, THE  INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = 100.0% \u00d7 (2.00% - 1.75%)  = 0.25%  \u2022  ASSUMING  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME OF 2.30%, THE  INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = (100.0% \u00d7  (\u201cCATCH-UP\u201d.  2.1875% - 1.75%)) + (20.0% \u00d7 (2.30% - 2.1875%))  = (100.0% \u00d7  0.4375%) + (20.0% \u00d7 0.1125%)  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  = 0.4375% + 0.0225%  = 0.46%  \u2022  ASSUMING NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS OF 6% AND REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION OF 1%,  THE CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS.  = 20.0% \u00d7 (6.0% - 1.0%)  = 20.0% \u00d7 5.0%  = 1.0%  FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE CALCULATION OF THE  TWO-PART  INCENTIVE FEE, INCLUDING THE CAPITAL  GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEE CALCULATION UNDER GAAP, SEE \u201c  ITEM 1.

(10)  TOTAL ANNUALIZED GROSS EXPENSES, BASED ON ACTUAL AMOUNTS INCURRED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019 (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN FOOTNOTE 9), WOULD BE $52.0 MILLION. AFTER ALL  NON-CONTRACTUAL,  UNCONDITIONAL, AND IRREVOCABLE CREDITS DESCRIBED IN FOOTNOTE 4, FOOTNOTE 5, AND FOOTNOTE 6 ABOVE ARE  APPLIED TO THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEE AND THE LOAN SERVICING FEE, TOTAL ANNUALIZED EXPENSES AFTER FEE CREDITS, BASED ON ACTUAL AMOUNTS INCURRED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN FOOTNOTE 9), WOULD BE  $42.6 MILLION OR 10.39% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSETS.  EXAMPLE  THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATES THE PROJECTED DOLLAR AMOUNT OF TOTAL CUMULATIVE EXPENSES THAT WOULD BE INCURRED OVER VARIOUS PERIODS WITH RESPECT TO A  HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK. IN CALCULATING THE FOLLOWING EXPENSE AMOUNTS, WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES WOULD REMAIN AT THE LEVELS SET FORTH IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  THE EXAMPLE BELOW AND THE EXPENSES IN THE TABLE  ABOVE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF OUR FUTURE EXPENSES, AND ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN. WHILE THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES, AS REQUIRED BY THE SEC, A 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN, OUR PERFORMANCE WILL VARY AND MAY RESULT IN  A RETURN GREATER OR LESS THAN 5.0%. DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE NOT IN THOUSANDS.  1 YEAR  3 YEARS  5 YEARS  10 YEARS  COMMON STOCKHOLDERS WOULD PAY THE FOLLOWING EXPENSES ON A $1,000 INVESTMENT.  ASSUMING A 5% ANNUAL RETURN CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF ORDINARY INCOME  (1)(2)  $98  $281  $446  $794  ASSUMING A 5% ANNUAL RETURN CONSISTING ENTIRELY OF CAPITAL GAINS  (2)(3)  $107  $304  $478  $835  (1)  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS EXAMPLE, WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE ASSUMED 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN WOULD  CONSTITUTE ORDINARY INCOME. WHILE WE RECORDED CAPITAL GAINS-BASED INCENTIVE FEES OF $2.1 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THESE FEES WERE NOT CONTRACTUALLY DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE ADVISORY  AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THE ASSUMED 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN IS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE HURDLE RATE OF 7.0% (ANNUALIZED) THAT WE MUST ACHIEVE UNDER THE ADVISORY AGREEMENT TO TRIGGER THE PAYMENT OF AN INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE, WE HAVE ASSUMED, FOR PURPOSES OF  THIS EXAMPLE, THAT NO INCOME-BASED INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BE PAYABLE IF WE REALIZED A 5.0% ANNUAL RETURN.  (2)  WHILE THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES REINVESTMENT OF ALL DISTRIBUTIONS AT NAV PER SHARE, PARTICIPANTS IN THE DIVIDEND  REINVESTMENT PLAN WILL RECEIVE A NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNT OF THE DISTRIBUTION PAYABLE TO A PARTICIPANT BY THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE CLOSE OF TRADING ON THE  VALUATION DATE FOR THE DISTRIBUTION, AND THIS PRICE PER SHARE MAY DIFFER FROM NAV PER SHARE.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR  ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND THE NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG ANY AMOUNTS IN THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIPS FOR ANY FUTURE PERIODS. EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS, DOLLAR AMOUNTS INCLUDED HEREIN ARE IN THOUSANDS UNLESS OTHERWISE  INDICATED.  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  WE WERE INCORPORATED UNDER THE GENERAL CORPORATION LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON FEBRUARY 18, 2005. ON JUNE 22, 2005, WE COMPLETED OUR INITIAL  PUBLIC OFFERING AND COMMENCED OPERATIONS. WE OPERATE AS AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED,  CLOSED-END,  NON-DIVERSIFIED  MANAGEMENT INVESTMENT COMPANY AND HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED  AS A BDC UNDER THE 1940 ACT. FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES, WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE CODE. IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO QUALIFY AS A RIC FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES AND OBTAIN FAVORABLE RIC TAX  TREATMENT, WE MUST MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS.  WE WERE ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTING IN  DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED PRIVATE BUSINESSES OPERATING IN THE U.S. OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES ARE TO: (I) ACHIEVE AND GROW CURRENT INCOME BY INVESTING IN DEBT SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE  STABLE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW TO PAY EXPENSES, MAKE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT GROW OVER TIME; AND (II) PROVIDE OUR STOCKHOLDERS WITH LONG-TERM CAPITAL  APPRECIATION IN THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS BY INVESTING IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES, GENERALLY, IN COMBINATION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DEBT SECURITIES, THAT WE BELIEVE CAN GROW OVER TIME TO PERMIT US TO SELL OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS  FOR CAPITAL GAINS. TO ACHIEVE OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO INVEST IN SEVERAL CATEGORIES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, WITH INDIVIDUAL INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TOTALING UP TO $30 MILLION, ALTHOUGH INVESTMENT SIZE MAY  VARY, DEPENDING UPON OUR TOTAL ASSETS OR AVAILABLE CAPITAL AT THE TIME OF INVESTMENT. WE EXPECT THAT OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OVER TIME WILL CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 75% IN DEBT SECURITIES AND 25% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AT COST. AS OF MARCH 31,  2019, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO WAS MADE UP OF 75.1% IN DEBT SECURITIES AND 24.9% IN EQUITY SECURITIES, AT COST.  WE FOCUS ON INVESTING IN LOWER MIDDLE  MARKET BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. THAT MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THE BUSINESS\u2019 FREE CASH FLOW AND ITS ABILITY TO GROW IT OVER TIME, ADEQUATE ASSETS FOR LOAN COLLATERAL, EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAMS WITH A  SIGNIFICANT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, REASONABLE CAPITALIZATION OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, INCLUDING AN AMPLE EQUITY CONTRIBUTION OR CUSHION BASED ON PREVAILING ENTERPRISE VALUATION MULTIPLES, AND THE POTENTIAL TO REALIZE  APPRECIATION AND GAIN LIQUIDITY IN OUR EQUITY POSITION, IF ANY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT LIQUIDITY IN OUR EQUITY POSITION WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH A MERGER OR ACQUISITION OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, A PUBLIC OFFERING OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S STOCK  OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BY EXERCISING OUR RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY TO REPURCHASE OUR WARRANTS, AS APPLICABLE, THOUGH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE RIGHTS. WE INVEST IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT NEED FUNDS FOR  GROWTH CAPITAL, TO FINANCE ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS, OR TO RECAPITALIZE OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, REFINANCE THEIR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES. WE SEEK TO AVOID INVESTING IN HIGH-RISK, EARLY-STAGE ENTERPRISES.  WE INVEST BY OURSELVES OR JOINTLY WITH OTHER FUNDS AND/OR MANAGEMENT OF THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY, DEPENDING ON THE OPPORTUNITY, AND HAVE OPPORTUNISTICALLY MADE  SEVERAL  CO-INVESTMENTS  WITH OUR AFFILIATE GLADSTONE CAPITAL PURSUANT TO THE  CO-INVESTMENT  ORDER. WE BELIEVE THE  CO-INVESTMENT  ORDER HAS ENHANCED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES. IF WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN AN INVESTMENT WITH ONE OR MORE  CO-INVESTORS,  WHETHER OR NOT AN  AFFILIATE OF OURS, OUR INVESTMENT IS LIKELY TO BE SMALLER THAN IF WE WERE INVESTING ALONE.  BUSINESS  PORTFOLIO ACTIVITY  WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  REMAINS COMPETITIVE, WE CONTINUE TO SEE NEW INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF PROVIDING A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY IN SUPPORT OF MANAGEMENT AND INDEPENDENT  SPONSOR-LED  BUYOUTS OF LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES IN THE U.S. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE EXITED FIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES WITH A COMBINED FAIR VALUE PRIOR TO THEIR EXITS OF $131.4 MILLION, AND INVESTED $57.8 MILLION IN TWO NEW  PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, RESULTING IN A NET REDUCTION OF THREE COMPANIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WHICH WAS COMPRISED OF 30 COMPANIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. FROM OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2005 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, WE MADE INVESTMENTS IN  49 COMPANIES, EXCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN SYNDICATED LOANS, FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, BEFORE GIVING EFFECT TO PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND DIVESTITURES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE MAJORITY OF THE DEBT SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO HAVE A SUCCESS FEE COMPONENT, WHICH ENHANCES THE YIELD  ON OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS. UNLIKE PIK INCOME, WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE SUCCESS FEES AS INCOME UNTIL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED. DUE TO THE CONTINGENT NATURE OF SUCCESS FEES, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ANY OR ALL OF  THESE SUCCESS FEES OR KNOW THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD UNRECOGNIZED, CONTRACTUAL SUCCESS FEES OF $30.1 MILLION, OR $0.92 PER COMMON SHARE. CONSISTENT WITH GAAP, WE GENERALLY HAVE NOT  RECOGNIZED SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES AND RELATED INCOME IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNTIL EARNED.  FROM INCEPTION THROUGH MARCH 31,  2019, WE COMPLETED SALES OF 16 PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT WE ACQUIRED UNDER OUR BUYOUT STRATEGY (WHICH EXCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN SYNDICATED LOANS). IN THE AGGREGATE, THESE SALES HAVE GENERATED $185.9 MILLION IN NET REALIZED GAINS AND  $23.4 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME UPON EXIT, FOR A TOTAL INCREASE TO OUR NET ASSETS OF $209.3 MILLION. WE BELIEVE, IN AGGREGATE, THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE EQUITY-ORIENTED INVESTMENT SUCCESSES AND EXEMPLIFY OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF STRIVING TO  ACHIEVE RETURNS THROUGH CURRENT INCOME ON THE DEBT PORTION OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL GAINS FROM THE EQUITY PORTION. THE 16 LIQUIDITY EVENTS HAVE OFFSET ANY REALIZED LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY INCURRED DURING THE RECESSION IN  CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF PERFORMING SYNDICATED LOANS AT A REALIZED LOSS TO PAY OFF A FORMER LENDER. THESE SUCCESSFUL EXITS, IN PART, ENABLED US TO INCREASE THE MONTHLY DISTRIBUTION BY 70.0% FROM MARCH 2011 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2019, AND ALLOWED  US TO DECLARE AND PAY A $0.03 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, A $0.05 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN NOVEMBER 2013, A $0.05 PER COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN DECEMBER 2014, AND A $0.06 PER  COMMON SHARE SUPPLEMENTAL DISTRIBUTION IN EACH OF JUNE 2017, DECEMBER 2017, JUNE 2018, AND DECEMBER 2018.  CAPITAL RAISING EFFORTS  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MEET OUR CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH EXTENSIONS OF AND INCREASES TO THE CREDIT FACILITY AND BY ACCESSING THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN THE FORM OF  PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY EXTENDED THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S REVOLVING PERIOD MULTIPLE TIMES, MOST RECENTLY TO AUGUST 2021, AND CURRENTLY HAVE A TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT OF $200.0 MILLION (WITH A  POTENTIAL TOTAL COMMITMENT OF $300.0 MILLION THROUGH ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS OF NEW OR EXISTING LENDERS). DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE SOLD 168,824 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE SOLD 127,412 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS HISTORICALLY, MARKET CONDITIONS MAY CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND THUS  OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE NEW INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON EQUITY. ON MARCH 31, 2019, THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS $11.60 PER SHARE, WHICH REPRESENTED A 6.5% DISCOUNT TO OUR MARCH 31, 2019 NAV PER SHARE OF  $12.40. WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK TRADES BELOW NAV, OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL EQUITY IS CONSTRAINED BY PROVISIONS OF THE 1940 ACT, WHICH GENERALLY PROHIBITS THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN ISSUANCE PRICE BELOW THE THEN CURRENT NAV  PER SHARE WITHOUT STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL, OTHER THAN THROUGH SALES TO OUR THEN EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS PURSUANT TO A RIGHTS OFFERING.  AT OUR 2018 ANNUAL  MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS HELD ON AUGUST 9, 2018, OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL AUTHORIZING US TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR THEN CURRENT NAV PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THAT THE  NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES ISSUED AND SOLD PURSUANT TO SUCH AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXCEED 25.0% OF OUR THEN OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO EACH SUCH SALE, PROVIDED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAKES CERTAIN DETERMINATIONS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH  SALE. THIS AUGUST 2018 STOCKHOLDER AUTHORIZATION IS IN EFFECT FOR ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL. WE SOUGHT AND OBTAINED STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL CONCERNING SIMILAR PROPOSALS AT EACH ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS SINCE 2008, AND WITH  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 SUBSEQUENT APPROVAL, WE ISSUED SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THREE OFFERINGS AT A PRICE BELOW THE THEN CURRENT NAV PER SHARE, ONCE IN MAY 2017, ONCE IN MARCH 2015, AND ONCE IN OCTOBER 2012. CERTAIN SALES UNDER THE  AT-THE-MARKET  PROGRAM IN MARCH 2018 AND APRIL 2018 WERE ALSO BELOW THE THEN CURRENT ESTIMATED NAV PER SHARE. THE RESULTING PROCEEDS, IN PART, HAVE ALLOWED US TO (I) GROW  OUR PORTFOLIO BY MAKING NEW INVESTMENTS, (II) GENERATE ADDITIONAL INCOME THROUGH THESE NEW INVESTMENTS, (III) ENSURE CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY TESTS AND (IV) INCREASE OUR DEBT CAPITAL WHILE STILL COMPLYING WITH OUR  APPLICABLE  DEBT-TO-EQUITY  RATIOS.

UNDER THE 200% ASSET COVERAGE STANDARD PRIOR TO APRIL 10, 2019, WE WERE ABLE TO BORROW DEBT OR ISSUE  SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.00 FOR EVERY $1.00 OF EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. STARTING FROM APRIL 10, 2019, UNDER THE 150% ASSET COVERAGE STANDARD, WE MAY BORROW DEBT OR ISSUE SENIOR SECURITIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $2.00 FOR EVERY $1.00 OF  EQUITY IN THE COMPANY. NOTWITHSTANDING THE MODIFIED ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENT UNDER THE 1940 ACT DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE SEPARATELY SUBJECT TO A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE REQUIREMENT OF 200% WITH RESPECT TO OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK.

IN JUNE 2017, THE UNDERWRITERS PARTIALLY EXERCISED THEIR OVER-ALLOTMENT OPTION AND PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 155,265 SHARES AT  THE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $9.38 PER SHARE AND ON THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS SOLELY TO COVER OVER-ALLOTMENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN GROSS PROCEEDS OF $1.5 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND  OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, OF $1.4 MILLION.  64  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ANTICIPATE ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT  DETERMINE THE TIMING OR TERMS OF ANY FUTURE EQUITY ISSUANCES OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO ISSUE EQUITY ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. WHEN OUR COMMON STOCK IS TRADING AT A PRICE BELOW NAV PER SHARE, THE 1940 ACT PLACES REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS  ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BY ISSUING COMMON STOCK. GENERALLY, THE 1940 ACT PROVIDES THAT WE MAY NOT ISSUE AND SELL OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR NAV PER COMMON SHARE, OTHER THAN TO OUR THEN EXISTING COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  PURSUANT TO A RIGHTS OFFERING, WITHOUT FIRST OBTAINING APPROVAL FROM OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND OUR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND MEETING OTHER STATED REQUIREMENTS. ON MARCH 29, 2019, THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WAS $11.60 PER SHARE,  REPRESENTING A 6.5% DISCOUNT TO OUR NAV PER SHARE OF $12.40 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  AT OUR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS HELD ON AUGUST 9,  2018, OUR STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL AUTHORIZING US TO ISSUE AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW OUR THEN CURRENT NAV PER COMMON SHARE FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF SUCH APPROVAL, PROVIDED THAT OUR BOARD OF  DIRECTORS MAKES CERTAIN DETERMINATIONS PRIOR TO ANY SUCH SALE. AT OUR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN AUGUST 2019, WE INTEND TO ASK OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF A SIMILAR PROPOSAL SO THAT IT MAY BE IN EFFECT  FOR ANOTHER YEAR.  TERM PREFERRED STOCK  IN  AUGUST 2018, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 2,990,000 SHARES OF OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. GROSS PROCEEDS TOTALED $74.8 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS  AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WERE $72.1 MILLION. TOTAL UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING WERE $2.7 MILLION, WHICH HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DISCOUNTS TO THE LIQUIDATION VALUE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD ENDING AUGUST 31, 2025, THE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE.  OUR SERIES E  TERM PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY AND PROVIDES FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.375% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH EQUATES TO $4.8 MILLION PER YEAR). WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF  OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON AUGUST 31, 2025, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. IN  ADDITION, TWO OTHER POTENTIAL MANDATORY REDEMPTION TRIGGERS ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED  STOCK, AND (2) IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN ASSET COVERAGE AS REQUIRED BY SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT (WHICH IS CURRENTLY 150%) AND ARE UNABLE TO CORRECT SUCH FAILURE WITHIN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM A PORTION OF OUR  OUTSTANDING SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK OR OTHERWISE CURE THE ASSET COVERAGE REDEMPTION TRIGGER (WE MAY ALSO REDEEM ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO CAUSE ASSET COVERAGE TO BE UP TO 200%). WE MAY ALSO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SERIES E  TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT OUR SOLE OPTION AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER AUGUST 31, 2020.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE USED THE PROCEEDS FROM  THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK, ALONG WITH BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK, EACH OF WHICH HAD A LIQUIDATION  PREFERENCE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE VOLUNTARY REDEMPTION OF OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK, WE INCURRED A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $1.7 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN REALIZED  LOSS ON OTHER IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  AND WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED ISSUANCE COSTS AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION.  PRIOR TO ITS REDEMPTION IN AUGUST 2018, OUR SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDED FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.75% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH  EQUATED TO $2.8 MILLION PER YEAR). WE WERE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES B TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON DECEMBER 31, 2021, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED  BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION.

OUR SERIES C TERM PREFERRED STOCK WAS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE COMPLETED A PUBLIC OFFERING OF 2,300,000 SHARES OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $25.00 PER SHARE.  GROSS PROCEEDS TOTALED $57.5 MILLION AND NET PROCEEDS, AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS BORNE BY US, WERE $55.4 MILLION. TOTAL UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND OFFERING COSTS RELATED TO THIS OFFERING WERE  $2.1 MILLION, WHICH HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS DISCOUNTS TO THE LIQUIDATION VALUE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2023, THE MANDATORY REDEMPTION DATE.  65  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY. OUR SERIES  D TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDES FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 6.25% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH EQUATES TO $3.6 MILLION PER YEAR). WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 30,  2023, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE, PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. IN ADDITION, TWO OTHER POTENTIAL MANDATORY REDEMPTION TRIGGERS ARE AS  FOLLOWS: (1) UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF US, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK, AND (2) IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN ASSET COVERAGE OF AT  LEAST 200% AND ARE UNABLE TO CORRECT SUCH FAILURE WITHIN A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME, WE ARE REQUIRED TO REDEEM A PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK OR OTHERWISE CURE THE ASSET COVERAGE REDEMPTION TRIGGER (AND WE MAY ALSO REDEEM  ADDITIONAL SECURITIES TO CAUSE THE ASSET COVERAGE TO BE 240%). WE MAY ALSO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AT OUR SOLE OPTION AT THE REDEMPTION PRICE AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WE USED A PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK TO VOLUNTARILY REDEEM ALL 1.6 MILLION  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH HAD A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $25.00 PER SHARE. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS VOLUNTARY REDEMPTION, WE INCURRED A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.2 MILLION, WHICH HAS BEEN RECORDED  IN REALIZED LOSS ON OTHER IN OUR ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  AND WHICH WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED ISSUANCE COSTS AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION.  PRIOR TO ITS REDEMPTION IN SEPTEMBER 2016, OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK PROVIDED FOR A FIXED DIVIDEND EQUAL TO 7.125% PER YEAR, PAYABLE MONTHLY (WHICH  EQUATED TO $2.9 MILLION PER YEAR). WE WERE REQUIRED TO REDEEM ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017, FOR CASH AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO $25.00 PER SHARE PLUS AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO ACCUMULATED BUT  UNPAID DIVIDENDS, IF ANY, TO THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. OUR SERIES A TERM PREFERRED STOCK WAS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER SECURITY.  EACH SERIES OF OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAS A PREFERENCE OVER OUR COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO DIVIDENDS, WHEREBY NO DISTRIBUTIONS ARE  PAYABLE ON OUR COMMON STOCK UNLESS THE STATED DIVIDENDS, INCLUDING ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS, ON THE MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL. THE SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES E TERM PREFERRED STOCK ARE  CONSIDERED LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND, AS SUCH, AFFECT OUR ASSET COVERAGE, EXPOSING US TO ADDITIONAL LEVERAGE RISKS. THE ASSET COVERAGE ON OUR SENIOR SECURITIES THAT ARE STOCK (OUR SERIES D TERM PREFERRED STOCK AND SERIES E TERM  PREFERRED STOCK) AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 309.1%, CALCULATED PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT.  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  ON AUGUST 22, 2018, WE, THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BUSINESS INVESTMENT, ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 4 TO THE FIFTH AMENDED AND  RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, ORIGINALLY ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 30, 2013, WITH KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (\u201cKEYBANK\u201d) AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, LEAD ARRANGER, MANAGING AGENT AND LENDER, THE ADVISER, AS SERVICER, AND CERTAIN OTHER LENDERS  PARTY THERETO. THE REVOLVING PERIOD WAS EXTENDED TO AUGUST 22, 2021, AND IF NOT RENEWED OR EXTENDED BY SUCH DATE, ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE ON AUGUST 22, 2023 (TWO YEARS AFTER THE REVOLVING PERIOD END DATE). AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019, THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED TWO  ONE-YEAR  EXTENSION OPTIONS THAT MAY BE EXERCISED ON OR BEFORE THE FIRST AND SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE AUGUST 22, 2018 AMENDMENT DATE, SUBJECT TO  APPROVAL BY ALL LENDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY COMMITMENT AMOUNT WAS INCREASED FROM $165.0 MILLION TO $200.0 MILLION AND, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, CAN BE EXPANDED TO A TOTAL FACILITY AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION THROUGH ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM EXISTING OR NEW LENDERS.  ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY GENERALLY BEAR INTEREST AT  30-DAY  LIBOR PLUS 2.85% PER ANNUM UNTIL AUGUST 21, 2021, WITH THE MARGIN THEN INCREASING TO 3.10% FOR THE PERIOD FROM AUGUST 22, 2021 TO AUGUST 21, 2022, AND INCREASING FURTHER TO 3.35% THEREAFTER.  THE CREDIT FACILITY HAS AN UNUSED COMMITMENT FEE ON THE DAILY UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT OF 0.50% PER ANNUM IF THE AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 50% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT, 0.75% PER ANNUM IF THE  AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS GREATER THAN 50% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 65% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT AMOUNT, AND 1.00% PER ANNUM IF THE AVERAGE UNUSED COMMITMENT AMOUNT FOR THE PERIOD IS GREATER THAN 65% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENT  AMOUNT. WE INCURRED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AMENDMENT.  INTEREST IS PAYABLE MONTHLY DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT  FACILITY. AVAILABLE BORROWINGS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS AND APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE SIZE, CHARACTERISTICS, AND QUALITY OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED BY BUSINESS INVESTMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES  THAT ANY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON PLEDGED LOANS BE REMITTED DIRECTLY BY THE BORROWER INTO A LOCKBOX ACCOUNT WITH KEYBANK. KEYBANK IS ALSO THE TRUSTEE OF THE ACCOUNT AND GENERALLY REMITS THE COLLECTED FUNDS TO US ONCE A MONTH.  AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS A SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY, PROHIBIT  CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS (SUCH AS MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, LIQUIDATIONS OR DISSOLUTIONS) AND RESTRICT CERTAIN MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES WITHOUT THE LENDERS\u2019 CONSENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO  GENERALLY SEEKS TO RESTRICT DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS TO THE SUM OF (I) OUR NET INVESTMENT INCOME, (II) NET CAPITAL GAINS, AND (III) AMOUNTS DEEMED BY THE COMPANY TO BE CONSIDERED AS HAVING BEEN PAID DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 855(A) OF THE CODE. LOANS ELIGIBLE TO BE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC CONCENTRATIONS, INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, LOAN SIZE, PAYMENT  FREQUENCY AND STATUS, AVERAGE LIFE, PORTFOLIO COMPANY LEVERAGE, AND LIEN PROPERTY.  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO COMPLY WITH OTHER FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL COVENANTS, WHICH OBLIGATE BUSINESS INVESTMENT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, MAINTAIN CERTAIN  FINANCIAL RATIOS, INCLUDING ASSET AND INTEREST COVERAGE AND A MINIMUM NUMBER OF OBLIGORS REQUIRED IN THE BORROWING BASE. ADDITIONALLY, THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A PERFORMANCE GUARANTY THAT REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN (I) A MINIMUM NET  WORTH (DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY TO INCLUDE OUR MANDATORY REDEEMABLE TERM PREFERRED STOCK) OF THE GREATER OF $210.0 MILLION OR $210.0 MILLION PLUS 50% OF ALL EQUITY AND SUBORDINATED DEBT RAISED MINUS 50% OF ANY EQUITY OR SUBORDINATED  DEBT REDEEMED OR RETIRED AFTER NOVEMBER 16, 2016, WHICH EQUATED TO $218.7 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, (II) ASSET COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS OF AT LEAST 150% (OR SUCH PERCENTAGE AS MAY BE SET  FORTH IN SECTION 18 OF THE 1940 ACT, AS MODIFIED BY SECTION 61 OF THE 1940 ACT), AND (III) OUR STATUS AS A BDC UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND AS A RIC UNDER THE CODE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AND AS DEFINED IN THE PERFORMANCE GUARANTY OF  THE CREDIT FACILITY, WE HAD A NET WORTH OF $533.9 MILLION, ASSET COVERAGE ON OUR SENIOR SECURITIES REPRESENTING INDEBTEDNESS OF 997.6%, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTIONS 18 AND 61 OF THE 1940 ACT, AND AN ACTIVE STATUS  AS A BDC AND RIC. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABILITY, AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS BASED ON COLLATERAL QUALITY, OF $137.5 MILLION UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT  FACILITY.  IN JULY 2013, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE THEN EFFECTIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT, WE ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT WITH KEYBANK  EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 2013 FOR A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $45.0 MILLION. THE INTEREST RATE CAP AGREEMENT EXPIRED IN APRIL 2016. PRIOR TO ITS EXPIRATION IN APRIL 2016, THE AGREEMENT EFFECTIVELY LIMITED THE INTEREST RATE ON A PORTION OF OUR BORROWINGS  UNDER THE THEN EFFECTIVE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. WE INCURRED A PREMIUM FEE OF $75 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN NET REALIZED LOSS ON OTHER ON OUR ACCOMPANYING  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  DURING THE YEAR  ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  UNLIKE PIK INCOME, WE GENERALLY DO NOT RECOGNIZE SUCCESS FEES AS INCOME UNTIL PAYMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED. DUE TO THE CONTINGENT NATURE OF SUCCESS FEES, THERE  ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ANY OR ALL OF THESE SUCCESS FEES OR KNOW THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE HAD UNRECOGNIZED, CONTRACTUAL  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES OF $30.1 MILLION AND $28.3 MILLION (OR APPROXIMATELY $0.92 AND $0.87 PER COMMON SHARE), RESPECTIVELY, ON OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH GAAP, WE HAVE  NOT RECOGNIZED SUCCESS FEE RECEIVABLES AND RELATED INCOME IN OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  UNTIL EARNED.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS TO CERTAIN OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY DRAWN. SINCE THESE LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS HAVE  EXPIRATION DATES AND WE EXPECT MANY WILL NEVER BE FULLY DRAWN, THE TOTAL LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENT AMOUNTS DO NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMBINED UNUSED LINE OF CREDIT COMMITMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 TO BE IMMATERIAL.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE ALSO EXTENDED A GUARANTY ON BEHALF OF ONE OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, CCE,  WHEREBY WE HAVE GUARANTEED $1.0 MILLION OF OBLIGATIONS OF CCE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON THIS OR ANY PREVIOUS GUARANTIES, AND WE CONSIDER THE CREDIT RISKS TO BE REMOTE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS  GUARANTY TO BE IMMATERIAL.  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, AT COST.

(C)  INCLUDES INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AND SECURED BORROWING AND DIVIDEND OBLIGATIONS ON EACH  SERIES OF OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST PAYMENTS CALCULATED FOR PURPOSES OF THIS TABLE WAS BASED UPON RATES AND OUTSTANDING BALANCES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. DIVIDEND OBLIGATIONS ON OUR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE  PREFERRED STOCK ASSUME QUARTERLY DECLARATIONS AND MONTHLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS THROUGH THE DATE OF MANDATORY REDEMPTION OF EACH SERIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE PERIOD REPORTED. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED OUR INVESTMENT  VALUATION POLICY (WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS) AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2\u2014  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. ADDITIONALLY, REFER TO NOTE 3 \u2014  INVESTMENTS  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND OUR APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 820, \u201c  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.\u201d  WE HAVE ALSO IDENTIFIED OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY AS A  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2\u2014  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  CREDIT MONITORING AND  RISK RATING  THE ADVISER MONITORS A WIDE VARIETY OF KEY CREDIT STATISTICS THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TO HELP US ASSESS  CREDIT QUALITY AND PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, ARE USED AS INPUTS IN OUR VALUATION TECHNIQUES. GENERALLY, WE, THROUGH THE ADVISER, PARTICIPATE IN PERIODIC BOARD MEETINGS OF OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES IN WHICH WE HOLD BOARD SEATS AND  ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE ANNUAL AUDITED AND MONTHLY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. USING THESE STATEMENTS OR COMPARABLE INFORMATION AND BOARD DISCUSSIONS, THE ADVISER CALCULATES AND EVALUATES CERTAIN CREDIT STATISTICS.  THE ADVISER RISK RATES ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE ADVISER DOES NOT RISK RATE EQUITY SECURITIES. FOR LOANS THAT HAVE BEEN RATED BY A  SEC-REGISTERED  NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATION (\u201cNRSRO\u201d), THE ADVISER GENERALLY USES THE AVERAGE OF TWO CORPORATE LEVEL NRSRO\u2019S RISK RATINGS FOR SUCH SECURITY. FOR ALL OTHER DEBT  SECURITIES, THE ADVISER USES A PROPRIETARY RISK RATING SYSTEM. WHILE THE ADVISER SEEKS TO MIRROR THE NRSRO SYSTEMS, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE SAME RISK RATING AS AN NRSRO FOR THESE  SECURITIES. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT ON DEBT SECURITIES AND THE EXPECTED LOSS, IF THERE IS A DEFAULT. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM USES A SCALE OF 0 TO >10, WITH >10 BEING  THE LOWEST PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT. IT IS THE ADVISER\u2019S UNDERSTANDING THAT MOST DEBT SECURITIES OF LOWER MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES DO NOT EXCEED THE GRADE OF BBB ON AN NRSRO SCALE, SO THERE WOULD BE NO DEBT SECURITIES IN THE LOWER MIDDLE MARKET  THAT WOULD MEET THE DEFINITION OF AAA, AA OR A. THEREFORE, THE ADVISER\u2019S SCALE BEGINS WITH THE DESIGNATION >10 AS THE BEST RISK RATING WHICH MAY BE EQUIVALENT TO A BBB FROM AN NRSRO; HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT A >10 ON THE  ADVISER\u2019S SCALE IS EQUAL TO A BBB OR BAA2 ON AN NRSRO SCALE. THE ADVISER\u2019S RISK RATING SYSTEM COVERS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS AND THE SECURITIES WE HOLD.  68  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS RISK RATINGS FOR ALL LOANS IN OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018.  AS OF MARCH 31,  RATING  2019  2018  HIGHEST  9.0  10.0  AVERAGE  6.7  6.4  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE  7.2  6.5  LOWEST  1.0  4.0  TAX STATUS  WE  INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE CODE FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AS A RIC, WE GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON THE PORTION OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND GAINS  DISTRIBUTED TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. TO MAINTAIN OUR QUALIFICATION AS A RIC, WE MUST MAINTAIN OUR STATUS AS A BDC AND MEET CERTAIN  SOURCE-OF-INCOME  AND ASSET DIVERSIFICATION  REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, IN ORDER TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS A RIC, WE MUST DISTRIBUTE TO STOCKHOLDERS AT LEAST 90% OF OUR INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO THE DIVIDENDS PAID DEDUCTION. OUR POLICY GENERALLY IS TO MAKE  DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS IN AN AMOUNT UP TO 100% OF INVESTMENT COMPANY TAXABLE INCOME. WE MAY RETAIN SOME OR ALL OF OUR NET LONG-TERM CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, AND DESIGNATE THEM AS DEEMED DISTRIBUTIONS, OR DISTRIBUTE SUCH GAINS TO  STOCKHOLDERS IN CASH. SEE  \u201cBUSINESS \u2014 MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS\u201d  AND  \u201c  \u2014  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \u2014 DISTRIBUTIONS AND DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS.  \u201d  IN AN EFFORT TO LIMIT FEDERAL EXCISE TAXES, WE HAVE TO DISTRIBUTE TO STOCKHOLDERS, DURING EACH CALENDAR YEAR, AN AMOUNT CLOSE TO THE SUM OF: (1) 98% OF  OUR ORDINARY INCOME FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR, (2) 98.2% OF OUR NET CAPITAL GAINS (BOTH LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM), IF ANY, FOR  THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD  ENDING ON OCTOBER 31 OF THE CALENDAR YEAR, AND  (3) ANY INCOME REALIZED, BUT NOT DISTRIBUTED, IN THE PRECEDING PERIOD (TO THE EXTENT THAT INCOME TAX WAS NOT IMPOSED ON SUCH AMOUNTS), LESS CERTAIN REDUCTIONS, AS APPLICABLE. UNDER THE RIC MODERNIZATION ACT, WE ARE PERMITTED TO CARRYFORWARD ANY  CAPITAL LOSSES THAT WE MAY INCUR FOR AN UNLIMITED PERIOD, AND SUCH CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WILL RETAIN THEIR CHARACTER AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM CAPITAL LOSSES.

OUR REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE TITLES AND SOFTWARE TITLES DEVELOPED BY THIRD PARTIES.

THE NBA 2K LEAGUE BEGAN ITS SECOND SEASON ON APRIL 2, 2019.  TRENDS AND FACTORS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS  PRODUCT RELEASE SCHEDULE.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF OUR PRODUCT RELEASES AND THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF THOSE TITLES. OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR HAVE HISTORICALLY ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. SALES OF  GRAND THEFT AUTO  PRODUCTS GENERATED  25.7%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . IN OCTOBER 2018, WE RELEASED  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  . SALES OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION  PRODUCTS GENERATED  32.1%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE TIMING OF OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  OR  RED DEAD REDEMPTION  PRODUCT RELEASES MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.  ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND RETAILER PERFORMANCE.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY UNFAVORABLY AFFECT OUR BUSINESSES, SUCH AS DETERIORATING CONSUMER DEMAND, PRICING PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS, CREDIT QUALITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  70.1%  ,  70.7%  AND  65.5%  OF NET REVENUE DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , FIVE CUSTOMERS COMPRISED  66.6%  AND  65.4%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, RESPECTIVELY, WITH OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS (THOSE THAT INDIVIDUALLY COMPRISED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE) ACCOUNTING FOR  55.8%  AND  53.2%  OF SUCH BALANCE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  40.1%  AND  15.7%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  37.7%  AND  15.5%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  . THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT HAS AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE PAST, AND MAY DO SO IN THE FUTURE. BANKRUPTCIES OR CONSOLIDATIONS OF OUR LARGE RETAIL CUSTOMERS COULD SERIOUSLY HURT OUR BUSINESS, DUE TO UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND THE CONCENTRATION OF PURCHASING POWER AMONG THE REMAINING LARGE RETAILERS. CERTAIN OF OUR LARGE CUSTOMERS SELL USED COPIES OF OUR GAMES, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS BY REDUCING DEMAND FOR NEW COPIES OF OUR GAMES. WHILE THE DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT THAT WE NOW OFFER FOR CERTAIN OF OUR TITLES MAY SERVE TO REDUCE USED GAME SALES, WE EXPECT USED GAME SALES TO CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.  HARDWARE PLATFORMS.  WE DERIVE MOST OF OUR REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS MADE FOR VIDEO GAME CONSOLES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS SONY'S PS4 AND MICROSOFT'S XBOX ONE, WHICH COMPRISED  83.7%  OF OUR NET REVENUE BY PRODUCT PLATFORM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF THESE PLATFORMS AND THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE OF THESE PLATFORMS. WHEN NEW HARDWARE PLATFORMS ARE INTRODUCED, DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE USED ON OLDER PLATFORMS TYPICALLY DECLINES, WHICH MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS DURING THE MARKET TRANSITION TO THE NEW CONSOLES. WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR CONSOLE HARDWARE SALES. WE MANAGE OUR PRODUCT DELIVERY ON EACH CURRENT AND FUTURE PLATFORM IN A MANNER WE BELIEVE TO BE MOST EFFECTIVE TO MAXIMIZE OUR REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. ACCORDINGLY, OUR STRATEGY IS TO FOCUS OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON A SELECT NUMBER OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY TITLES FOR THESE PLATFORMS, WHILE ALSO EXPANDING OUR OFFERINGS FOR EMERGING PLATFORMS SUCH AS TABLETS, SMARTPHONES AND ONLINE GAMES.  ONLINE CONTENT AND DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION.  THE INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IS DELIVERING A GROWING AMOUNT OF CONTENT THROUGH DIGITAL ONLINE DELIVERY METHODS. WE PROVIDE A VARIETY OF ONLINE DELIVERED PRODUCTS AND OFFERINGS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR TITLES THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH RETAILERS AS PACKAGED GOODS PRODUCTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH DIRECT DIGITAL DOWNLOAD (FROM WEBSITES WE OWN AND OTHERS OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES) AS WELL AS A LARGER SELECTION OF OUR CATALOG TITLES. IN ADDITION, WE AIM TO DRIVE ONGOING ENGAGEMENT AND INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM RECURRENT CONSUMER SPENDING ON OUR TITLES  THROUGH VIRTUAL CURRENCY, ADD-ON CONTENT, AND IN-GAME PURCHASES  . WE ALSO PUBLISH AN EXPANDING VARIETY OF TITLES FOR TABLETS AND SMARTPHONES, WHICH ARE DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS THROUGH DIGITAL DOWNLOAD. OUR \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" DISCLOSES THAT NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS COMPRISED  63.0%  OF OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE EXPECT ONLINE DELIVERY OF GAMES AND GAME OFFERINGS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND TO BECOME AN INCREASING PART OF OUR BUSINESS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  27  PRODUCT RELEASES  WE RELEASED THE FOLLOWING KEY TITLES IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  .

REFER TO NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCLOSURE FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN GENERAL, THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 RESULTS IN A MORE ACCELERATED REVENUE PATTERN, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) THE ELIMINATION OF THE REQUIREMENT FOR VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (\"VSOE\") OF FAIR VALUE WHEN ALLOCATING BETWEEN MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND (II) THE CHANGE OF OUR ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD TO A USER LIFE. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT ON A GIVEN PERIOD MAY DIFFER FROM THIS GENERAL TREND. IN OCTOBER 2018, WE RELEASED  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  THE ACCELERATION OF REVENUE FOR THIS TITLE WAS MATERIAL AND IS THE PRIMARY COMPONENT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 THROUGHOUT THE DISCUSSION IN OUR \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" BELOW.

THIS INCREASE INCLUDED A  $741.2 MILLION  INCREASE  28  IN NET REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE REMAINING INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY SALES OF THE TITLES DESCRIBED ABOVE.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF  $107.1 MILLION  FROM A REDUCTION IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED. OUR DETERMINATION TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ALONG WITH OUR RECENT POSITIVE TREND OF EARNINGS.

THESE NET INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF OUR RESTRICTED STOCK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO BANK TIME DEPOSITS AND PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS.

NOIRE,  AND  MAFIA III,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  42.9%  , AS COMPARED TO  49.9%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606 RESULTED IN A 6.1% INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE. THE REMAINING PERCENTAGE DECREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INTERNAL ROYALTIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF WHEN ROYALTIES ARE EARNED AND TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES.  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES  INCREASED  BY  $500.9 MILLION  AND ACCOUNTED FOR  46.5%  OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  41.3%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

SELLING AND MARKETING  SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $135.3 MILLION  IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO $108.5 MILLION IN HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES. ADVERTISING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RELEASE OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  IN OCTOBER 2018, OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE.  THE REMAINING INCREASE IS DUE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $33.4 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) INCREASES IN PERSONNEL EXPENSES DUE TO ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT, (II) A REDUCTION OF EXPENSE IN THE PRIOR PERIOD RELATED TO UPDATING THE FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, (III) INCREASES IN IT RELATED EXPENSES FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND (IV) INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RELATED PRIMARILY TO SHARE BASED AWARDS GRANTED UNDER OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ZELNICKMEDIA, AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  INCLUDE OCCUPANCY EXPENSE (PRIMARILY RENT, UTILITIES AND OFFICE EXPENSES) OF $22.0 MILLION  AND $18.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR DEVELOPMENT STUDIOS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $33.8 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED PERSONNEL EXPENSE DUE TO (I) INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND (II) HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN PRODUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR TITLES FOR WHICH TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $3.7 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RECOGNITION OF A  $11.3 MILLION  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN SEPTEMBER 2017, AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A CERTAIN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IPR&D\") INTANGIBLE ASSET FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE MOVE TO OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN DECEMBER 2017 AND AN INCREASE IN IT INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS.  32  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , BUSINESS REORGANIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED  $19.7 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF A BENEFIT DUE TO UPDATING ESTIMATES FOR AND COMPLETING OUR 2016 PLAN AS WELL AS COSTS RELATED TO OUR 2018 PLAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD. ALTHOUGH WE MAY RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN FUTURE PERIODS TO TRUE-UP ESTIMATES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL REORGANIZATION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE REORGANIZATIONS.

THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A  $16.8 MILLION  INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SIZE OF, NATURE OF, AND RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND A  $14.2 MILLION  DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\"), WHICH MATURED JULY 1, 2018. THE NET INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD ON THE EARLY CONVERSION OF OUR CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WITH NO CORRESPONDING GAINS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  PROVISION/BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES  WE RECOGNIZED A TAX BENEFIT OF  $107.1 MILLION  FROM A REDUCTION IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF A DETERMINATION THAT IT WAS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED. OUR DETERMINATION TOOK INTO ACCOUNT THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2  DURING THE YEAR ALONG WITH OUR RECENT POSITIVE TREND OF EARNINGS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE. THE ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM  35%  TO  21%  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 AND REQUIRED COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE ACT MADE OTHER CHANGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, (1) A BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (\"BEAT\"), WHICH IS A NEW MINIMUM TAX, (2) GENERALLY ELIMINATING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, (3) A NEW PROVISION THAT TAXES GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (\"GILTI\"), (4) THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION, AND (5) OTHER BASE BROADENING PROVISIONS.  THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118,  INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACTS  (\"SAB 118\"), WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACT'S IMPACT. SAB 118 PROVIDES A MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH SHOULD NOT EXTEND BEYOND ONE YEAR FROM THE ACT ENACTMENT DATE, DURING WHICH A COMPANY ACTING IN GOOD FAITH MAY COMPLETE THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE ACT UNDER ASC 740. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAB 118, THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE ACT MUST BE REFLECTED IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 740 IS COMPLETE. WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING AND RECORDED A DECREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $4.6 MILLION  TO ADJUST THE PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. THE IMPACT OF THE ACT DIFFERS FROM THESE ESTIMATES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE, GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED, AND ACTIONS TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THE ACT.  THE ACT SUBJECTS A U.S. SHAREHOLDER TO CURRENT TAX ON GILTI EARNED BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE FASB STAFF Q&A TOPIC NO. 5,  ACCOUNTING FOR GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME  , STATES THAT AN ENTITY CAN MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION EITHER TO RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAXES FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE AS GILTI IN FUTURE YEARS OR PROVIDE FOR THE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO GILTI RESULTING FROM THOSE ITEMS IN THE YEAR THE TAX IS INCURRED. WE HAVE ELECTED TO RECOGNIZE THE RESULTING TAX ON GILTI AS AN EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD INCURRED.  OUR INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS  $101.1 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $36.9 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  , THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  (43.4)%  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $107.1 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, A BENEFIT OF  $35.0 MILLION  FOR TAX CREDITS,  33  $13.3 MILLION  FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, AND  $9.0 MILLION  FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAX EXPENSE FROM OTHER IMMATERIAL ITEMS, WHICH INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE ACT.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF  31.6%  , THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  (27.0)%  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $53.2 MILLION  FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES (PREVIOUSLY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT AND TAX DEFICIENCIES WERE RECOGNIZED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL), A BENEFIT OF  $22.6 MILLION  FOR TAX CREDITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UTILIZED, A BENEFIT OF  $15.1 MILLION  FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND A BENEFIT OF  $7.9 MILLION  FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT AND  $10.4 MILLION  FOR CHANGES IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER U.S. STATUTORY RATE, INCREASED TAX BENEFITS FROM CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, INCREASED TAX BENEFITS FROM TAX CREDITS, REDUCED TAX EXPENSE FROM THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AND TAX CREDITS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEDUCTIONS TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN, WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE AWARD VESTING. SINCE WE RECOGNIZE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON A DISCRETE BASIS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN EACH PERIOD.  ON JUNE 21, 2018, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT ISSUED ITS DECISION IN SOUTH DAKOTA V. WAYFAIR, WHICH OVERTURNED PREVIOUS CASE LAW THAT PRECLUDED STATES FROM REQUIRING RETAILERS TO COLLECT SALES TAX ON SALES MADE TO IN-STATE CUSTOMERS UNLESS THE RETAILER HAD PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. ALTHOUGH THIS CASE IS LIMITED TO SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THIS DECISION ON OUR STATE INCOME TAX FOOTPRINT.  THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF TAX PAYABLE IN A GIVEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD MAY BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY SUDDEN OR UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN TAX LAWS, CHANGES IN THE MIX AND LEVEL OF EARNINGS BY TAXING JURISDICTIONS, OR CHANGES TO EXISTING ACCOUNTING RULES OR REGULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, ON JULY 24, 2018, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN OPINION IN ALTERA CORP. V. COMMISSIONER REQUIRING RELATED PARTIES IN AN INTERCOMPANY COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENT TO SHARE EXPENSES RELATED TO STOCK COMPENSATION. ON AUGUST 7, 2018, THE OPINION WAS WITHDRAWN TO ALLOW TIME FOR A RECONSTITUTED PANEL TO CONFER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS AND THE FINAL OPINION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF  $139.0 MILLION  , OF WHICH  $23.9 MILLION  WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF REALIZED. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS INCREASED BY  $10.5 MILLION.  WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO AUDIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2014. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2013. CERTAIN U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2014 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2017.  WE ARE REGULARLY AUDITED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR REASONABLY FORESEEABLE TAX ASSESSMENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR NET INCOME WAS  $333.8 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO  $173.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $2.90  , AS COMPARED TO  $1.54  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING OF  115.2 MILLION  WERE  2.4 MILLION  HIGHER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SETTLEMENT ON CONVERSION OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK USING THE STATED CONVERSION RATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, NORMAL STOCK COMPENSATION ACTIVITY INCLUDING GRANTS AND FORFEITURES, OFFSET BY SHARE REPURCHASES.

FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET REVENUE INCREASED BY $13.1 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE OF $159.4 MILLION IN NET REVENUE FROM OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $134.9 MILLION IN NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III  , WHICH RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2016.  NET REVENUE FROM OUR  GRAND THEFT AUTO  FRANCHISE INCREASED $32.0 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET REVENUE FROM PC AND OTHER DECREASED BY $9.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE TO 18.4% COMPARED TO 19.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PC AND OTHER WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  CIVILIZATION VI  , WHICH RELEASED ON THE PC IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM SOCIAL POINT TITLES FOR WHICH WE HAD ONLY TWO MONTHS OF NET REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS IT WAS ACQUIRED IN JANUARY 2017.  NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS INCREASED BY $209.2 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 63.1% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 51.8% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM DIGITAL ONLINE CHANNELS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER REVENUE RELATED TO OUR  NBA 2K  FRANCHISE AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  CIVILIZATION VI  AND  GRAND THEFT AUTO V  . NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL AND OTHER CHANNELS DECREASED BY $196.1 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 36.9% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 48.2% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL AND OTHER CHANNELS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET REVENUE FROM  MAFIA III, GRAND THEFT AUTO V,  AND  BIOSHOCK: THE COLLECTION  , WHICH RELEASED IN SEPTEMBER 2016, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET REVENUE FROM  L.A. NOIRE  DUE TO RELEASES ON PS4, XBOX ONE, SWITCH, AND HTC VIVE.

GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS 49.9%, AS COMPARED TO 42.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO  MAFIA III  AND  CIVILIZATION VI  RELEASING IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS LOWER PRODUCT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE DECREASE IN NET REVENUE FROM PHYSICAL RETAIL SALES. THE INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERNAL ROYALTIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DUE TO THE TIMING OF WHEN ROYALTIES ARE EARNED AND TO A LESSER EXTENT HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES DECREASED BY $40.0 MILLION AND ACCOUNTED FOR 41.3% OF OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO 43.9%.

ADVERTISING EXPENSES WERE LOWER IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RELEASES OF  MAFIA III  AND  CIVILIZATION VI  IN OCTOBER 2016 AND  BATTLEBORN  IN MAY 2016, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD FOR  GRAND THEFT AUTO ONLINE  AND  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2.  THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PERSONNEL EXPENSES, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $36.4 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO (I) INCREASES IN PERSONNEL EXPENSES, INCLUDING STOCK AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE, DUE TO ADDITIONAL HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, (II) INCREASES IN PROFESSIONAL FEES, RELATED PRIMARILY TO OUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH ZELNICKMEDIA AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN OUR SHARE PRICE, (III) INCREASES IN IT RELATED EXPENSES FROM THE PURCHASE OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE, AND (IV) INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE DUE TO NEW LOCATIONS, INCLUDING OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK AND FOR SOCIAL POINT, AS WELL AS INCREASED RENT IN OTHER LOCATIONS. THIS OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY A $6.5 MILLION REDUCTION OF EXPENSE RELATED TO REVERSING A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION LIABILITY RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOCIAL POINT ACQUISITION AS WE DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WAS $0 BASED ON THE LOWER PROBABILITY OF SOCIAL POINT ACHIEVING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE 24-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 INCLUDE OCCUPANCY EXPENSE (PRIMARILY RENT, UTILITIES AND OFFICE EXPENSES) OF $18.2 MILLION AND $15.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR DEVELOPMENT STUDIOS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED BY $58.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED PERSONNEL EXPENSE DUE TO (I) INCREASED HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT, AND (II) HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION EXPENSES FOR TITLES THAT HAVE NOT REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES INCREASED BY $13.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RECOGNITION OF A $11.3 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION NOT TO PROCEED WITH FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF A CERTAIN IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IPR&D\") INTANGIBLE ASSET FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF SOCIAL POINT.  36  BUSINESS REORGANIZATION  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED AND INITIATED ACTIONS TO IMPLEMENT A STRATEGIC REORGANIZATION AT ONE OF OUR LABELS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS INITIATIVE WE INCURRED BUSINESS REORGANIZATION EXPENSES OF $14.7 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, DUE PRIMARILY TO EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS WITH NO CORRESPONDING COSTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ALTHOUGH WE MAY RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN FUTURE PERIODS TO TRUE-UP ESTIMATES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL REORGANIZATION COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS REORGANIZATION.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A $20.7 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR 1.75% CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN DECEMBER 2016 AND HIGHER GAINS ON EARLY CONVERSIONS OF OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES AS WELL AS HIGHER INTEREST INCOME DUE TO THE NATURE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND THE RISE OF INTEREST RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION LOSSES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  PROVISION/BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MAKES BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT US. THE ACT REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, THE ACT MAKES OTHER CHANGES THAT MAY AFFECT US, BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2018. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO (1) A BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT), WHICH IS A NEW MINIMUM TAX, (2) GENERALLY ELIMINATING U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, (3) A NEW PROVISION THAT TAXES GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI), (4) THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION, AND (5) OTHER BASE BROADENING PROVISIONS.  THE FASB STAFF Q&A, TOPIC 740, NO. 5,  ACCOUNTING FOR GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME  , STATES THAT AN ENTITY CAN MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER RECOGNIZE DEFERRED TAXES FOR TEMPORARY BASIS DIFFERENCES EXPECTED TO REVERSE AS GILTI IN FUTURE YEARS OR PROVIDE FOR THE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO GILTI IN THE YEAR THE TAX IS INCURRED. GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THE GILTI PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND HAS NOT YET DETERMINED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY. AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY IS STILL EVALUATING THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND ANALYSIS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME THAT IS SUBJECT TO GILTI AND THEREFORE IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE AND HAS NOT REFLECTED ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO GILTI IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATED INCREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $18.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE PREVIOUSLY UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. THE ESTIMATED INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF A TRANSITION TAX OF $26.6 MILLION, OFFSET BY INCREASED BENEFITS FROM DOMESTIC PRODUCTION DEDUCTIONS AND TAX CREDITS. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, WE RECORDED A DECREASE TO NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $47.7 MILLION AND A CORRESPONDING DECREASE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $39.8 MILLION AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT A PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FROM INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES AS A SOURCE OF INCOME AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, RESULTING IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $7.9 MILLION. THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY RELATING TO INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLES, DUE TO THE RATE CHANGE, RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT OF $6.2 MILLION.  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE ACT, AND THE AMOUNTS RECORDED REPRESENT PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES FOR CERTAIN IDENTIFIED INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR WHICH THE ACCOUNTING IS INCOMPLETE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CAN BE DETERMINED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (SAB 118). FURTHER ANALYSIS IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW HISTORICAL PRACTICES USED TO CALCULATE THE UNTAXED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL TIME TO EVALUATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE NEW TAX LAW ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATIVE GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED. THE IMPACT OF THE ACT MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, POSSIBLY MATERIALLY, DUE TO CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WE HAVE MADE, GUIDANCE THAT MAY BE ISSUED, AND ACTIONS WE MAY  37  TAKE AS A RESULT OF THE ACT. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO ANALYZE THE ACT AND ITS IMPACT AND EXPECT TO RECORD ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES NO LATER THAN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS $36.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AS COMPARED TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $9.7 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATUTORY RATE OF 31.6%, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF (27.0)% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $53.2 MILLION FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES (PREVIOUSLY EXCESS TAX BENEFIT AND TAX DEFICIENCIES WERE RECOGNIZED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL), A BENEFIT OF $22.6 MILLION FOR TAX CREDITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UTILIZED, A BENEFIT OF $15.1 MILLION FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND A BENEFIT OF $7.9 MILLION FROM OUR GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT AND $10.4 MILLION FOR CHANGES IN OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS LOWER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO $53.2 MILLION FROM EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT FROM INCOME TAXES IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AN INCREASED BENEFIT FROM CHANGES IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $17.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPIRATION OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, AND $11.0 MILLION OF INCREASED TAX BENEFITS DUE TO MIX OF EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM TAX CREDITS OF $12.7 MILLION AND PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ACT.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION, TAX CREDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE, AND CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE ACT MAY ARISE IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEDUCTIONS TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN, WHICH DEPENDS UPON THE STOCK PRICE AT THE TIME OF EMPLOYEE AWARD VESTING. SINCE WE RECOGNIZE EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON A DISCRETE BASIS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL VARY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DEPENDING ON OUR STOCK PRICE IN EACH PERIOD.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, WE HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF $128.5 MILLION, OF WHICH $22.8 MILLION WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IF REALIZED. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS INCREASED BY $8.3 MILLION.  WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO AUDIT FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016 AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2013. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, WE ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2012. CERTAIN U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES ARE CURRENTLY EXAMINING OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2012 THROUGH MARCH 31, 2016.  WE ARE REGULARLY AUDITED BY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN TAXING AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR REASONABLY FORESEEABLE TAX ASSESSMENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OUR NET INCOME WAS $173.5 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $67.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $1.54, AS COMPARED TO $0.72 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017. BASIC WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING OF 110.1 MILLION WERE 19.9 MILLION HIGHER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO THE SETTLEMENT ON CONVERSION OF OUR 1.75% CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND OUR 1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK USING THE STATED CONVERSION RATE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. SEE NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NOTE 13 - EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS HAVE BEEN TO FUND (I) THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF OUR PUBLISHED PRODUCTS, (II) WORKING CAPITAL, (III) ACQUISITIONS AND (IV) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE EXPECT TO RELY ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS WELL AS ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FUNDS PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND OUR NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT TO SATISFY OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $744.5 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY-LIQUID IN NATURE AND REPRESENT AN INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS DEPENDING ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  38  NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cNEW CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT REPLACED OUR EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS TERMINATED ON THE SAME DAY. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT RUNS THROUGH  FEBRUARY 8, 2024  . THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR AN UNSECURED FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH COMMITMENTS OF  $200,000  , INCLUDING SUBLIMITS FOR (I) THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT IN AN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF UP TO  $25,000  AND (II) BORROWINGS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT DENOMINATED IN POUNDS STERLING, EUROS AND CANADIAN DOLLARS IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $25,000. IN ADDITION, THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL CAPACITY PERMITTING THE INCURRENCE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $250,000  IN TERM LOANS OR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. LOANS UNDER THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A MARGIN OF (A)  0.125%  TO  0.750%  ABOVE A CERTAIN BASE RATE (  5.50%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ), OR (B)  1.125%  TO  1.750%  ABOVE LIBOR (APPROXIMATELY  2.49%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ), WHICH MARGINS ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS  $198.3 MILLION  AVAILABLE TO BORROW UNDER THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WE HAD  $1.7 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS, MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO, MINIMUM CASH RESERVES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANTS, AS WELL AS LIMITATIONS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ABILITY TO: CREATE, INCUR, ASSUME OR BE LIABLE FOR INDEBTEDNESS; DISPOSE OF ASSETS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE; ACQUIRE, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE WITH OR INTO ANOTHER PERSON OR ENTITY; CREATE, INCUR OR ALLOW ANY LIEN ON ANY OF ITS PROPERTY; MAKE INVESTMENTS; OR PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT SUCH AS NONPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE THEREUNDER, BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, NONCOMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS, ACTS OF INSOLVENCY AND DEFAULT ON INDEBTEDNESS HELD BY THIRD PARTIES (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND CURE PERIODS).  1.00% CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018  ON JUNE 18, 2013, WE ISSUED  $250.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  1.00%  CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE 2018. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WERE ISSUED AT  98.5%  OF PAR VALUE FOR PROCEEDS OF  $283.2 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDED A  $37.5 MILLION  OVERALLOTMENT OPTION THAT WAS EXERCISED. INTEREST ON THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES WAS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON JULY 1  ST  AND JANUARY 1  ST  OF EACH YEAR, COMMENCING ON JANUARY 1, 2014. THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES MATURED ON JULY 1, 2018.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CREDIT RISKS, PARTICULARLY IF ANY OF OUR RECEIVABLES REPRESENT A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS OR ARE CONCENTRATED IN FOREIGN MARKETS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS THEY BECOME DUE, IT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND WORKING CAPITAL POSITION.  GENERALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE DO NOT HOLD ANY COLLATERAL TO SECURE PAYMENT FROM CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE TRADE CREDIT INSURANCE ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO MITIGATE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RISK.  A MAJORITY OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO MAJOR RETAILERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. OUR FIVE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  70.1%  ,  70.7%  , AND  65.5%  OF NET REVENUE DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , FIVE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR  66.6%  AND  65.4%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, RESPECTIVELY. CUSTOMERS THAT INDIVIDUALLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE COMPRISED  55.8%  AND  53.2%  OF SUCH BALANCES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  40.1%  AND  15.7%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND TWO CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR  37.7%  , AND  15.5%  OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  . WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF OUR GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  . BASED UPON PERFORMING ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS, MAINTAINING TRADE CREDIT INSURANCE ON A MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT THE RECEIVABLE BALANCES FROM THESE LARGEST CUSTOMERS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK, ALTHOUGH WE ACTIVELY MONITOR EACH CUSTOMER'S CREDIT WORTHINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL. WE ARE MONITORING THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING CREDIT MARKETS AND OTHER FACTORS AS IT RELATES TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE RISK OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CASH, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO SATISFY OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND COMMITMENTS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WAS  $292.7 MILLION  . THESE BALANCES ARE DISPERSED ACROSS VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH DISPERSION MEETS  39  THE BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR FOREIGN AFFILIATES. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH DOMESTICALLY TO SUPPORT ONGOING OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE \"TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT\u201d (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE \"ACT\u201d). THE ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT US. THE ACT INCLUDED A NUMBER OF PROVISIONS, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL PROVISIONS, WHICH GENERALLY ESTABLISH A TERRITORIAL-STYLE SYSTEM FOR TAXING FOREIGN INCOME OF DOMESTIC MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS. OUR CURRENT INTENTION IS TO REINVEST INDEFINITELY EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT RECORDED ANY TAX LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO  14.2 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THIS PROGRAM, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS, INCLUDING IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS. REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF STOCK, PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE TRADING PRICE OF THE STOCK, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OTHER CONDITIONS. THE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON. DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , WE REPURCHASED  3.7 MILLION  ,  1.5 MILLION  , AND  0.0 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR  $362.4 MILLION  ,  $154.8 MILLION  , AND  $0.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AS PART OF THE PROGRAM. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF  10.4 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM, AND  3.8 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OUR CHANGES IN CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31,  (THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS)  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $843,515  $493,527  $407,903  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (223,576  )  (271,827  )  (129,030  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (463,685  )  (281,467  )  (49,772  )  EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (10,639  )  24,924  (7,798  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $145,615  $(34,843  )  $221,303  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  1,392.0 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH, COMPARED TO  1,246.4 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH FROM  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM SALES, PRIMARILY OF  RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSES AS WELL AS ROYALTY PAYMENTS. THESE NET INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF OUR RESTRICTED STOCK, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO BANK TIME DEPOSITS AND PURCHASES OF FIXED ASSETS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH COMMITMENTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. GENERALLY, THESE INCLUDE.  \u2022  SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING.  WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT INCLUDE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS TO DEVELOPERS UNDER SEVERAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS THAT EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGH  MARCH 2025  . OUR AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COMMITMENTS ASSUME SATISFACTORY PERFORMANCE BY THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO HAVE LICENSING COMMITMENTS THAT PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OBLIGATIONS TO HOLDERS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR USE OF THEIR TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS, TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.  \u2022  MARKETING.  WE HAVE CERTAIN MINIMUM MARKETING SUPPORT COMMITMENTS WHERE WE COMMIT TO SPEND SPECIFIED AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARKETING OUR PRODUCTS. MARKETING COMMITMENTS EXPIRE AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGH  SEPTEMBER 2024.  \u2022  OPERATING LEASES.  OUR OFFICES ARE OCCUPIED UNDER NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES EXPIRING AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGH  DECEMBER 2032  . WE ALSO LEASE CERTAIN FURNITURE, EQUIPMENT AND AUTOMOBILES UNDER NON-CANCELABLE LEASES EXPIRING THROUGH  JUNE 2023  . SOME OF THE LEASES HAVE FIXED RENT INCREASES AND ALSO INCLUDE INDUCEMENTS TO ENTER INTO THE LEASE. THE EFFECT OF SUCH AMOUNTS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED LEASE TERM.  \u2022  PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  : THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE SERVICES THAT ARE ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON US THAT SPECIFIES ALL SIGNIFICANT TERMS, INCLUDING FIXED, MINIMUM OR VARIABLE PRICING PROVISIONS; AND THE APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTIONS, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGH  MARCH 2024.  40  A SUMMARY OF ANNUAL MINIMUM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  IS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS).

AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD RECORDED A LIABILITY FOR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, OF  $23.9 MILLION  , FOR WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE AND RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THESE LIABILITIES WILL BE SETTLED WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAX AUTHORITIES; THEREFORE, THESE LIABILITIES HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE.  LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS.  WE ARE, OR MAY BECOME, SUBJECT TO DEMANDS AND CLAIMS (INCLUDING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS) AND ARE INVOLVED IN ROUTINE LITIGATION IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH WE DO NOT BELIEVE TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE APPROPRIATELY ACCRUED AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN OF THESE CLAIMS AND LEGAL AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. WHILE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS ACCRUED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH LOSSES, UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED, WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL.  ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, ALL OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, AND COUNTERCLAIMS THAT HAD BEEN PENDING SINCE APRIL 2016 WITH MR. LESLIE BENZIES, THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES, WERE RESOLVED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTIES, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. AS SUCH, WE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO ANY FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET OR CREDIT RISK THAT COULD ARISE IF WE HAD ENGAGED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS.  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  NET REVENUE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES IS PRINCIPALLY GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND LATIN AMERICA. FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  ,  46.5%  ,  41.3%  AND  43.9%  , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR NET REVENUE WAS EARNED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT IN FOREIGN TRADE, INCLUDING INCREASED CREDIT RISKS, TARIFFS AND DUTIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, SHIPPING DELAYS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL, REGULATORY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, ALL OF WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS AND SEASONALITY  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TITLES; VARIATIONS IN SALES OF TITLES DEVELOPED FOR PARTICULAR PLATFORMS; MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TITLES; DEVELOPMENT AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES RELATING TO THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW TITLES; SEQUELS OR ENHANCEMENTS OF EXISTING TITLES; PROJECTED AND ACTUAL CHANGES IN PLATFORMS; THE TIMING AND SUCCESS OF TITLE INTRODUCTIONS BY OUR COMPETITORS; PRODUCT RETURNS; CHANGES IN PRICING POLICIES BY US AND OUR COMPETITORS; THE ACCURACY OF RETAILERS' FORECASTS OF CONSUMER DEMAND; THE SIZE AND TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS; THE TIMING OF ORDERS FROM MAJOR CUSTOMERS; AND ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT. SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE ALSO SEASONAL, WITH PEAK SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY OCCURRING IN THE FOURTH CALENDAR QUARTER AS A RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON. FOR CERTAIN OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS, WE DEFER THE RECOGNITION OF OUR NET REVENUE OVER AN ESTIMATED SERVICE PERIOD WHICH GENERALLY RANGES FROM 9 TO 15 MONTHS. AS A RESULT, THE QUARTER IN WHICH WE GENERATE THE HIGHEST NET SALES VOLUME MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE QUARTER IN WHICH WE RECOGNIZE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF NET REVENUE. QUARTERLY COMPARISONS OF OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  41", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "TAKE TWO INTERACTIVE SOFTWARE INC", "CIK": 946581, "Date": "2019-05-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "TTWO", "Name": "Take Two Interactive Software Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 7372.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 510350842.0, "key": "20190514TTWO", "labelr1": 3.7952679864799683, "labelr2": 0.06512839598064121, "labelr3": -0.8275220827522088, "labelr4": -3.450215638477398, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.12920669, "prof1": 0.87079334, "return1&2": 1.0386286817962338, "return1&2&3": 1.030033800096572, "return1&2&3&4": 0.994495412844037, "return2": 1.0006512839598063, "return1": 1.0379526798647998, "return3": 0.991724779172478, "return4": 0.965497843615226, "4_day_return": -0.5504587155963026, "cumulative_return1": 0.08091603346469824, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0016760095557319663, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.6333721374784563e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.3114020879229054e-07, "indexx": 2357, "cumreturn1b": 0.7909321666093785, "cumreturndow": 0.975110554155894, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9704079859015129}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2362, "level_0": 2387, "index": 5813, "text": "ITEM 7.

THIS SECTION PROVIDES A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND A SUMMARY OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR  FISCAL 2019  . IN ADDITION, THIS SECTION INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND IN ANTICIPATING FUTURE TRENDS.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES AN ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY.

IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 3 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u2022  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  THIS SECTION DISCUSSES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT HAVE BEEN RECENTLY ISSUED.  OVERVIEW  OUR BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE DESIGN, MARKETING, AND DISTRIBUTION OF PREMIUM LIFESTYLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING APPAREL, FOOTWEAR, ACCESSORIES, HOME FURNISHINGS, AND OTHER LICENSED PRODUCT CATEGORIES. OUR LONG-STANDING REPUTATION AND DISTINCTIVE IMAGE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED ACROSS AN EXPANDING NUMBER OF PRODUCTS, BRANDS, SALES CHANNELS, AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. OUR BRAND NAMES INCLUDE RALPH LAUREN, RALPH LAUREN COLLECTION, RALPH LAUREN PURPLE LABEL, POLO RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, LAUREN RALPH LAUREN, POLO RALPH LAUREN CHILDREN, CHAPS, AND CLUB MONACO, AMONG OTHERS.  WE DIVERSIFY OUR BUSINESS BY GEOGRAPHY (NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA, AMONG OTHER REGIONS) AND CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION (WHOLESALE, RETAIL, AND LICENSING). THIS ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN A DYNAMIC BALANCE AS OUR OPERATING RESULTS DO NOT DEPEND SOLELY ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY SINGLE GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR CHANNEL OF DISTRIBUTION. OUR WHOLESALE SALES ARE MADE PRINCIPALLY TO MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES AND SPECIALTY STORES AROUND THE WORLD, AS WELL AS TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTY-OWNED STORES TO WHICH WE HAVE LICENSED THE RIGHT TO OPERATE IN DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES USING OUR TRADEMARKS. WE ALSO SELL DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED RETAIL CHANNEL, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RETAIL STORES, CONCESSION-BASED SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AND DIGITAL COMMERCE OPERATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. IN ADDITION, WE LICENSE TO THIRD PARTIES FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS THE RIGHT TO ACCESS OUR VARIOUS TRADEMARKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE LICENSEES' MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF DESIGNATED PRODUCTS, SUCH AS CERTAIN APPAREL, EYEWEAR, FRAGRANCES, AND HOME FURNISHINGS.  WE ORGANIZE OUR BUSINESS INTO THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  \u2022  NORTH AMERICA  \u2014 OUR NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  51%  OF OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES, PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SALES OF OUR RALPH LAUREN BRANDED PRODUCTS MADE THROUGH OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, EXCLUDING CLUB MONACO. IN NORTH AMERICA, OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF SALES TO DEPARTMENT STORES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SPECIALTY STORES. OUR RETAIL BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA IS COMPRISED OF OUR RALPH LAUREN STORES, OUR FACTORY STORES, AND OUR DIGITAL COMMERCE SITE, WWW.RALPHLAUREN.COM.  38  \u2022  EUROPE  \u2014 OUR EUROPE SEGMENT, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  26%  OF OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES, PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SALES OF OUR RALPH LAUREN BRANDED PRODUCTS MADE THROUGH OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BUSINESSES IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST, EXCLUDING CLUB MONACO. IN EUROPE, OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF A VARYING MIX OF SALES TO BOTH DEPARTMENT STORES AND SPECIALTY STORES, DEPENDING ON THE COUNTRY. OUR RETAIL BUSINESS IN EUROPE IS COMPRISED OF OUR RALPH LAUREN STORES, OUR FACTORY STORES, OUR CONCESSION-BASED SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AND OUR VARIOUS DIGITAL COMMERCE SITES.  \u2022  ASIA  \u2014 OUR ASIA SEGMENT, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  17%  OF OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES, PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SALES OF OUR RALPH LAUREN BRANDED PRODUCTS MADE THROUGH OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL BUSINESSES IN ASIA, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND. OUR RETAIL BUSINESS IN ASIA IS COMPRISED OF OUR RALPH LAUREN STORES, OUR FACTORY STORES, OUR CONCESSION-BASED SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AND OUR DIGITAL COMMERCE SITE, WWW.RALPHLAUREN.CN, WHICH LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2018. IN ADDITION, WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS ONLINE THROUGH VARIOUS THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL PARTNER COMMERCE SITES. IN ASIA, OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF SALES TO DEPARTMENT STORES, WITH RELATED PRODUCTS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS.  IN ADDITION TO THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, WE ALSO HAVE OTHER NON-REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY  6%  OF OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF (I) SALES OF CLUB MONACO BRANDED PRODUCTS MADE THROUGH OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THE U.S., CANADA, AND EUROPE, AND OUR LICENSING ALLIANCES IN EUROPE AND ASIA, (II) SALES OF RALPH LAUREN BRANDED PRODUCTS MADE THROUGH OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS IN LATIN AMERICA, AND (III) ROYALTY REVENUES EARNED THROUGH OUR GLOBAL LICENSING ALLIANCES, EXCLUDING CLUB MONACO.  APPROXIMATELY  46%  OF OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES WERE EARNED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. SEE  NOTE 19  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE.  OUR BUSINESS IS TYPICALLY AFFECTED BY SEASONAL TRENDS, WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF WHOLESALE SALES IN OUR SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS AND HIGHER RETAIL SALES IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS. THESE TRENDS RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE TIMING OF SEASONAL WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS AND KEY VACATION TRAVEL, BACK-TO-SCHOOL, AND HOLIDAY SHOPPING PERIODS IMPACTING OUR RETAIL BUSINESS.  GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS  THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND OUR INDUSTRY ARE IMPACTED BY MANY DIFFERENT INFLUENCES. THE CURRENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE FUTURE STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL TRADE RELATIONS. MOST RECENTLY, THE U.S. AND CHINA HAVE IMPOSED SIGNIFICANT NEW TARIFFS ON EACH OTHER RELATED TO THE IMPORTATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCT CATEGORIES, AND ADDITIONAL TARIFFS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED. THERE ARE ALSO GROWING CONCERNS REGARDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE UNITED KINGDOM'S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \"BREXIT.\" NEGOTIATIONS TO DETERMINE THE UNITED KINGDOM'S FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING TERMS OF TRADE AND MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE, HAVE BEEN COMPLEX. IN JANUARY 2019, BRITISH PARLIAMENT REJECTED PRIME MINISTER THERESA MAY'S PROPOSED WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR AT THIS TIME WHAT, IF ANY, AGREEMENTS WILL BE REACHED BY THE CURRENT OCTOBER 31, 2019 DEADLINE. AS OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW AND BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE PRODUCED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., MAJOR CHANGES IN GLOBAL TRADE AND DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AS WELL AS ANY RESULTING ANTI-AMERICAN SENTIMENT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS. CERTAIN OTHER WORLDWIDE EVENTS, INCLUDING POLITICAL UNREST, ACTS OF TERRORISM, TAXATION OR MONETARY POLICY CHANGES, FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES, AND RISING HEALTHCARE COSTS, ALSO INCREASE VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, OUR RESULTS HAVE BEEN, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, IMPACTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS ALSO EVOLVING, WITH CONSUMERS CONTINUING TO DIVERSIFY THE CHANNELS IN WHICH THEY TRANSACT AND SHIFTING THEIR SHOPPING PREFERENCE FROM PHYSICAL STORES TO ONLINE. THIS ALONG WITH OTHER FACTORS HAS RESULTED IN MANY RETAILERS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR LARGE WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS, BECOMING HIGHLY PROMOTIONAL AND AGGRESSIVELY MARKING DOWN THEIR MERCHANDISE IN AN ATTEMPT TO OFFSET DECLINES IN PHYSICAL STORE TRAFFIC. THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED NUMEROUS BANKRUPTCIES, RESTRUCTURINGS, AND OWNERSHIP CHANGES IN RECENT YEARS. CERTAIN OF OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR NORTH AMERICA WHOLESALE BUSINESS, HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THESE DYNAMICS. THE CONTINUATION OF THESE INDUSTRY TRENDS COULD FURTHER IMPACT CONSUMER SPENDING AND CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOR IN OUR INDUSTRY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR OPERATING RESULTS. ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING A RECESSION OR THE FEAR OF A RECESSION, MAY FURTHER IMPACT CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY INCOME LEVELS AND SPENDING.  WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED VARIOUS OPERATING STRATEGIES GLOBALLY TO HELP ADDRESS MANY OF THESE CURRENT CHALLENGES, AND CONTINUE TO BUILD A FOUNDATION FOR LONG-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH CENTERED AROUND STRENGTHENING OUR CONSUMER-FACING AREAS OF PRODUCT, STORES, AND MARKETING ACROSS CHANNELS AND DRIVING A MORE EFFICIENT OPERATING MODEL. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE STRATEGIES, WE ARE TAKING DELIBERATE ACTIONS TO ENSURE PROMOTIONAL CONSISTENCY ACROSS CHANNELS AND ENHANCE THE OVERALL BRAND AND SHOPPING EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING BETTER ALIGNING SHIPMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS WITH UNDERLYING DEMAND. INVESTING IN OUR DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM REMAINS A  39  PRIMARY FOCUS AND IS A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR INTEGRATED GLOBAL OMNI-CHANNEL STRATEGY. IN JUNE 2018, WE SHIFTED OUR EUROPEAN DIGITAL COMMERCE OPERATIONS TO THE THIRD-PARTY CLOUD-BASED PLATFORM USED BY OUR NORTH AMERICA OPERATIONS, WHICH IS DELIVERING A MORE BRAND-ENHANCING AND CONSISTENT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE ACROSS OUR GLOBAL DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM. IN ADDITION, IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE LAUNCHED OUR DIGITAL FLAGSHIP IN CHINA, FEATURING OUR SIGNATURE ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. WE ALSO REMAIN COMMITTED TO OPTIMIZING OUR WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL AND ENHANCING OUR DEPARTMENT STORE CONSUMER EXPERIENCE. ALTHOUGH THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE ARE MAKING IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR QUALITY OF SALES INITIATIVES MAY CREATE OPERATING PROFIT PRESSURE IN THE NEAR-TERM, WE EXPECT THAT THESE INITIATIVES WILL CREATE LONGER-TERM SHAREHOLDER VALUE. FURTHER, IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT TRADE DEVELOPMENTS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, WE ARE ACTIVELY REVIEWING OPTIONS TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE IN THE EVENT ANY RESULTING TARIFFS IMPACT OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES, INCLUDING DIVERTING PRODUCTION TO AND SOURCING FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, DRIVING PRODUCTIVITY WITHIN OUR EXISTING SUPPLIER BASE, AND TAKING PRICING ACTIONS. WE ARE ALSO CLOSELY MONITORING THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS REGARDING BREXIT AND ARE ASSESSING RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE IN THE EVENT OF A \"HARD\" BREXIT (E.G., IF THE UNITED KINGDOM EXITS THE EUROPEAN UNION WITHOUT HAVING A FINAL WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE).  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE CONDITIONS AND TRENDS AND EVALUATE AND ADJUST OUR OPERATING STRATEGIES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY AND COST MANAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP MITIGATE THE RELATED IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHILE REMAINING FOCUSED ON THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROTECTING AND ELEVATING THE VALUE OF OUR BRAND.  FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR EXPECTATIONS, SEE PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 \"  RISK FACTORS  \" INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OPERATING RESULTS  IN  FISCAL 2019  , WE REPORTED NET REVENUES OF  $6.313 BILLION  , NET INCOME OF  $430.9 MILLION  , AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE OF  $5.27  , AS COMPARED TO NET REVENUES OF  $6.182 BILLION  , NET INCOME OF  $162.8 MILLION  , AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE OF  $1.97  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES, AS WELL AS RESTRUCTURING-RELATED CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.  OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR  FISCAL 2019  REFLECTED REVENUE GROWTH OF  2.1%  ON A REPORTED BASIS AND  2.8%  ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, AS DEFINED WITHIN \"  TRANSACTIONS AND TRENDS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  \"  BELOW. THE INCREASE IN REPORTED NET REVENUES DURING  FISCAL 2019  WAS DRIVEN BY OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES.  OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  INCREASED  BY  90 BASIS POINTS  TO  61.6%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED PRICING AND LOWER LEVELS OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY, AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INVENTORY RESERVES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\"SG&A\") EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  INCREASED  SLIGHTLY BY  10 BASIS POINTS  TO  50.2%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INCREASED MARKETING INVESTMENT, NEW STORE EXPANSION, AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEOGRAPHIC AND CHANNEL MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE.  NET INCOME  INCREASED  BY  $268.1 MILLION  TO  $430.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $174.8 MILLION  DECREASE IN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION LARGELY DRIVEN BY LOWER TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES, A  $63.6 MILLION  INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, AND A  $28.5 MILLION  INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME. NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE INCREASED BY  $3.30  TO  $5.27  PER SHARE IN  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  , DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AND LOWER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING  FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME DURING FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018 REFLECTED TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES OF  $27.6 MILLION  , OR  $0.34  PER DILUTED SHARE, AND  $221.4 MILLION  , OR  $2.68  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING-RELATED CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES TOTALING  $163.1 MILLION  AND  $165.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WHICH HAD AN AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF REDUCING NET INCOME BY  $129.0 MILLION  , OR  $1.58  PER DILUTED SHARE, AND  $113.3 MILLION  , OR  $1.38  PER DILUTED SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.  40  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  WE ENDED  FISCAL 2019  IN A NET CASH AND INVESTMENTS POSITION (CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PLUS SHORT-TERM AND NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS, LESS TOTAL DEBT) OF  $1.343 BILLION  , COMPARED TO  $1.494 BILLION  AS OF THE END OF  FISCAL 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OUR NET CASH AND INVESTMENTS POSITION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR USE OF CASH TO SUPPORT CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES OF  $502.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING WITHHOLDINGS IN SATISFACTION OF TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS, TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH  $197.7 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF  $190.7 MILLION  , AS WELL AS THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $23.9 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF  $783.8 MILLION.  WE GENERATED  $783.8 MILLION  OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS DURING  FISCAL 2019  , COMPARED TO  $975.1 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE DECLINE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO A NET UNFAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES.  OUR EQUITY DECREASED TO  $3.287 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $3.457 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY AND DIVIDENDS DECLARED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS DURING  FISCAL 2019.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN  ON JUNE 4, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE OF OPERATING WITH DISCIPLINE TO DRIVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH (THE \"FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN\"). THE FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ACTIVITIES: (I) RIGHTSIZING AND CONSOLIDATION OF OUR GLOBAL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND CORPORATE OFFICES; (II) TARGETED SEVERANCE-RELATED ACTIONS; AND (III) CLOSURE OF CERTAIN OF OUR STORES AND SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS. ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN WERE LARGELY COMPLETED DURING FISCAL 2019, WITH CERTAIN ACTIVITIES SHIFTING INTO FISCAL 2020. TOTAL ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN ARE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN GROSS ANNUALIZED EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION TO $80 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE EXPECT TO INCUR TOTAL ESTIMATED CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY  $125 MILLION  TO  $150 MILLION  , COMPRISED OF CASH-RELATED CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY  $90 MILLION  TO  $110 MILLION  AND NON-CASH CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY  $35 MILLION  TO  $40 MILLION  . CUMULATIVE CHARGES INCURRED SINCE INCEPTION WERE  $97.3 MILLION.  SEE  NOTE 9  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILED DISCUSSIONS OF THE CHARGES RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  U.S. TAX REFORM  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW NEW TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \"TCJA\"), WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. THE TCJA SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED U.S. TAX LAW BY, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, LOWERING THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, CREATING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES A ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND ELIMINATING OR REDUCING CERTAIN INCOME TAX DEDUCTIONS.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE RECORDED NET CHARGES OF  $221.4 MILLION  WITHIN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJA, WHICH INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY  4,520 BASIS POINTS  . SUBSEQUENTLY, DURING FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED NET MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS OF  $27.6 MILLION  AS PERMITTED BY SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (\"SAB 118\"). THESE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY  470 BASIS POINTS  DURING FISCAL 2019.  ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 WE REEVALUATED OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT ASSERTION AND DETERMINED THAT UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX WERE NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2017. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DECISION, WE REPATRIATED  $252 MILLION  OF CASH TO THE U.S. FROM CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, AND WE REPATRIATED AN ADDITIONAL  $875 MILLION  DURING FISCAL 2019.  SEE  NOTE 10  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION REGARDING THE TCJA.  41  WAY FORWARD PLAN  ON JUNE 2, 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF DELIVERING SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE SALES GROWTH AND LONG-TERM VALUE CREATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS (THE \"WAY FORWARD PLAN\"). WE ARE REFOCUSING ON OUR CORE BRANDS AND EVOLVING OUR PRODUCT, MARKETING, AND SHOPPING EXPERIENCE TO INCREASE DESIRABILITY AND RELEVANCE. WE ARE ALSO EVOLVING OUR OPERATING MODEL TO ENABLE SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE SALES GROWTH BY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVING QUALITY OF SALES, REDUCING SUPPLY CHAIN LEAD TIMES, IMPROVING OUR SOURCING, AND EXECUTING A DISCIPLINED MULTI-CHANNEL DISTRIBUTION AND EXPANSION STRATEGY. AS PART OF THE WAY FORWARD PLAN, WE ARE RIGHTSIZING OUR COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENTING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT-DRIVEN FINANCIAL MODEL TO FREE UP RESOURCES TO INVEST IN THE BRAND AND DRIVE HIGH-QUALITY SALES. THE WAY FORWARD PLAN INCLUDES STRENGTHENING OUR LEADERSHIP TEAM AND CREATING A MORE NIMBLE ORGANIZATION BY MOVING FROM AN AVERAGE OF NINE TO SIX LAYERS OF MANAGEMENT. THE WAY FORWARD PLAN ALSO INCLUDES THE DISCONTINUANCE OF OUR DENIM & SUPPLY BRAND AND THE INTEGRATION OF OUR DENIM PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO OUR POLO RALPH LAUREN BRAND. COLLECTIVELY, THESE ACTIONS, WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED DURING FISCAL 2017, RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN STORES AND SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AS WELL AS GROSS ANNUALIZED EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION.  ON MARCH 30, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY FORWARD PLAN: (I) THE RESTRUCTURING OF OUR IN-HOUSE GLOBAL DIGITAL COMMERCE PLATFORM WHICH WAS IN DEVELOPMENT AND SHIFTING TO A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE, FLEXIBLE PLATFORM THROUGH A NEW AGREEMENT WITH SALESFORCE'S COMMERCE CLOUD, FORMERLY KNOWN AS DEMANDWARE; (II) THE CLOSURE OF OUR POLO STORE AT 711 FIFTH AVENUE IN NEW YORK CITY; AND (III) THE FURTHER STREAMLINING OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE EXECUTION OF OTHER KEY CORPORATE ACTIONS IN LINE WITH THE WAY FORWARD PLAN. THESE ACTIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE OUR STATED OBJECTIVE TO RETURN TO SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE GROWTH AND INVEST IN THE FUTURE. THESE ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ACTIVITIES WERE LARGELY COMPLETED DURING FISCAL 2018 AND RESULTED IN A FURTHER REDUCTION IN WORKFORCE AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN CORPORATE OFFICE AND STORE LOCATIONS, AS WELL AS GROSS ANNUALIZED EXPENSE SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE WAY FORWARD PLAN, WE HAVE INCURRED TOTAL CUMULATIVE CHARGES OF  $838.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $155.2 MILLION  RECORDED DURING FISCAL 2017 ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF INVENTORY. ADDITIONALLY, AS WE DID NOT LEGALLY ASSIGN A CERTAIN LEASE AGREEMENT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS BEEN DEEMED THE OWNER OF THE LEASED ASSET FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES PRIOR TO THE END OF FISCAL 2019, AN IMPAIRMENT OF APPROXIMATELY  $170 MILLION  TO  $190 MILLION  IS EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO REDUCE OUR OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2020 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02 (SEE NOTE 4 TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). ACCORDINGLY, ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAY FORWARD PLAN ARE NOW COMPLETE AND NO ADDITIONAL CHARGES ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLAN.

TRANSACTIONS AND TRENDS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED HEREIN HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY CERTAIN EVENTS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  PRETAX CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGES, AS SUMMARIZED BELOW (REFERENCES TO \"NOTES\" ARE TO THE NOTES TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

SINCE WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE TRANSACT CHANGE IN VALUE OVER TIME COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THESE RATE FLUCTUATIONS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS. AS SUCH, IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (\"U.S. GAAP\"), OUR DISCUSSIONS OFTEN CONTAIN REFERENCES TO CONSTANT CURRENCY MEASURES, WHICH ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT-YEAR AND PRIOR-YEAR REPORTED AMOUNTS INTO COMPARABLE AMOUNTS USING A SINGLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FOR EACH CURRENCY. WE PRESENT CONSTANT CURRENCY FINANCIAL INFORMATION, WHICH IS A NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, AS A SUPPLEMENT TO OUR REPORTED OPERATING RESULTS. WE USE CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR BUSINESSES PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. WE BELIEVE THIS INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF OPERATING RESULTS AND BETTER IDENTIFYING TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY PERFORMANCE MEASURES SHOULD BE VIEWED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT IN LIEU OF OR SUPERIOR TO, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. RECONCILIATIONS BETWEEN THIS NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE U.S. GAAP MEASURE ARE INCLUDED IN THE \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" SECTION WHERE APPLICABLE.  OUR DISCUSSION ALSO INCLUDES REFERENCE TO COMPARABLE STORE SALES. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING THE FIRST QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL 2019, WE CHANGED OUR DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES TO PROVIDE A MORE RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE AND ALIGN WITH GENERAL RETAIL INDUSTRY PRACTICE. UNDER THE NEW DEFINITION, COMPARABLE STORE SALES REFER TO THE CHANGE IN SALES OF OUR STORES THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR AT LEAST 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS. SALES FROM OUR DIGITAL COMMERCE SITES ARE ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN COMPARABLE SALES FOR THOSE GEOGRAPHIES THAT HAVE BEEN SERVICED BY THE RELATED SITE FOR AT LEAST 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS. SALES FOR STORES OR DIGITAL COMMERCE SITES THAT ARE CLOSED OR SHUT DOWN DURING THE YEAR ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES. SALES FOR STORES THAT ARE EITHER RELOCATED, ENLARGED (AS DEFINED BY GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE EXPANSION OF 25% OR GREATER), OR GENERALLY CLOSED FOR 30 OR MORE CONSECUTIVE DAYS FOR RENOVATION ARE ALSO EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES UNTIL SUCH STORES HAVE BEEN OPERATING IN THEIR NEW LOCATION OR IN THEIR NEWLY RENOVATED STATE FOR AT LEAST 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS. ALL COMPARABLE STORE SALES METRICS ARE CALCULATED ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS. OUR PREVIOUS DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES REQUIRED A STORE OR DIGITAL COMMERCE SITE TO BE OPERATIONAL FOR ONE FULL FISCAL YEAR TO BE CONSIDERED COMPARABLE AND INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION. ALL PRIOR PERIOD COMPARABLE STORE SALES METRICS HAVE BEEN RECAST TO CONFORM WITH THE COMPANY'S NEW DEFINITION.  OUR \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS INCLUDES THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING RESULTS ARISING FROM THESE ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY. HOWEVER, UNUSUAL ITEMS OR TRANSACTIONS MAY OCCUR IN ANY PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS SHOULD CONSIDER THE TYPES OF EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED OPERATING TRENDS.  43  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND EXPRESSES THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP TO NET REVENUES OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CAPTIONS.

GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT  INCREASED  BY  $134.3 MILLION  , OR  3.6%  , TO  $3.886 BILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . GROSS PROFIT DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  REFLECTED NON-CASH INVENTORY-RELATED CHARGES OF  $7.2 MILLION  AND  $7.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT ALSO INCLUDED A NET UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT OF  $15.2 MILLION  . GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  INCREASED  TO  61.6%  IN  FISCAL 2019  FROM  60.7%  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  90 BASIS POINT  INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED PRICING AND LOWER LEVELS OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN CONNECTION WITH OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY, AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INVENTORY RESERVES.  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE RELATIVE SALES MIX AMONG DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD, THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN MATERIAL COSTS. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, MAY CAUSE GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES TO FLUCTUATE FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  46  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SG&A EXPENSES INCLUDE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, RENT AND OCCUPANCY, DISTRIBUTION, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, LEGAL, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, BAD DEBT, AND OTHER SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. SG&A EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $72.8 MILLION  , OR  2.4%  , TO  $3.168 BILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  . THIS INCREASE INCLUDED A NET FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT OF  $17.4 MILLION  . SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES  INCREASED  SLIGHTLY TO  50.2%  IN  FISCAL 2019  FROM  50.1%  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  10 BASIS POINT  INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INCREASED MARKETING INVESTMENT, NEW STORE EXPANSION, AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO GEOGRAPHIC AND CHANNEL MIX, AS A GREATER PORTION OF OUR REVENUE WAS GENERATED BY OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES (WHICH TYPICALLY CARRY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSE MARGINS). THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE.  THE  $72.8 MILLION  NET INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY.

WE EXPECT TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS WHILE CONTINUING TO MANAGE OUR COST BASE WITH DISCIPLINE, INCLUDING THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CORPORATE OFFICE FOOTPRINT.  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS.  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $21.2 MILLION  TO WRITE OFF CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS RELATED TO OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL STORES, SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AND CORPORATE OFFICES. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION TO SELL A CERTAIN CORPORATE FIXED ASSET, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $4.6 MILLION  TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET HELD-FOR-SALE TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, LESS COSTS TO SELL. DURING  FISCAL 2018  , WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $41.2 MILLION  TO WRITE OFF CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS RELATED TO OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL STORES, SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, AND CORPORATE OFFICES. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE PLANNED USAGE OF A CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSET, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $8.8 MILLION  TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.

UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES  DECREASED  BY  $9.4 MILLION  TO  $663.4 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER IMPAIRMENT OF ASSET CHARGES OF  $14.8 MILLION  AND LOWER COMPENSATION-RELATED EXPENSES OF $8.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CONSULTING FEES OF $6.1 MILLION, HIGHER MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES OF $5.1 MILLION, AND HIGHER OTHER EXPENSES OF $2.6 MILLION.

NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET.  NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET IS COMPRISED OF INTEREST EXPENSE, INTEREST INCOME, AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, WHICH INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS (LOSSES), EQUITY IN LOSSES FROM OUR EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEES, AND OTHER NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE REPORTED NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET, OF  $20.7 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET, OF  $9.0 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $29.7 MILLION  IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME OF  $28.5 MILLION  DUE TO THE INCREASED BALANCE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS A FAVORABLE SHIFT TO HIGHER INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO RECENT CASH REPATRIATIONS FROM OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  INCOME TAX PROVISION.  THE INCOME TAX PROVISION REPRESENTS FEDERAL, FOREIGN, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN  FISCAL 2019  WERE  $151.6 MILLION  AND  26.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO  $326.4 MILLION  AND  66.7%  , RESPECTIVELY, IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $174.8 MILLION  DECLINE  IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES RECORDED DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN PRETAX INCOME. DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  , WE RECORDED TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES OF  $27.6 MILLION  AND  $221.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WHICH INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES BY  470 BASIS POINTS  AND  4,520 BASIS POINTS  , RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION TO THIS 4,050 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES RECORDED, THE  DECLINE  IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTED THE NET FAVORABLE IMPACT OF 20 BASIS POINTS DUE TO OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING A NET FAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO COMPENSATION-RELATED ADJUSTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TAX IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR WORLDWIDE EARNINGS. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL CHANGE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX  48  OF EARNINGS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FOREIGN DIVIDENDS, ENACTED TAX LEGISLATION, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, TAX AUDIT FINDINGS AND SETTLEMENTS, AND THE INTERACTION OF VARIOUS GLOBAL TAX STRATEGIES.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME  INCREASED  TO  $430.9 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2019  , FROM  $162.8 MILLION  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $268.1 MILLION  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND THE INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME AND INTEREST INCOME, ALL AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. NET INCOME IN  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  REFLECTED TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES OF  $27.6 MILLION  AND  $221.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING-RELATED CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES TOTALING  $163.1 MILLION  AND  $165.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WHICH HAD AN AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF REDUCING NET INCOME BY  $129.0 MILLION  AND  $113.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE.  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE INCREASED TO  $5.27  IN  FISCAL 2019  , FROM  $1.97  IN  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $3.30  PER SHARE  INCREASE  WAS DUE TO THE HIGHER LEVEL OF NET INCOME, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, AND LOWER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING  FISCAL 2019  DRIVEN BY OUR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS.

THE INCREASE ALSO REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF 350 BASIS POINTS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND A DECLINE IN SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUES. THE IMPROVEMENT ALSO REFLECTED FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECTS OF 140 BASIS POINTS. THESE INCREASES IN OPERATING MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 40 BASIS POINT DECLINE RELATED TO OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS.  UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES  DECREASED BY $67.6 MILLION TO $672.8 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER IMPAIRMENT OF ASSET CHARGES OF $96.3 MILLION, LOWER NON-INCOME TAX RELATED EXPENSES OF $9.4 MILLION, AND LOWER OTHER EXPENSES OF $10.7 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERCOMPANY SOURCING COMMISSION INCOME OF $31.9 MILLION (WHICH IS OFFSET AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL AND ELIMINATES IN CONSOLIDATION), HIGHER CONSULTING FEES OF $8.7 MILLION, AND HIGHER COMPENSATION-RELATED EXPENSES OF $8.2 MILLION.

THE DECLINE IN NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET, WAS DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A $5.0 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR; AND  \u2022  A $3.4 MILLION INCREASE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS, LARGELY RELATED TO THE NET FAVORABLE REVALUATION AND SETTLEMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUSIVE OF THE IMPACT OF FORWARD FOREIGN  53  CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR (FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS (LOSSES) DO NOT RESULT FROM THE TRANSLATION OF THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO U.S. DOLLARS).  THESE DECLINES IN NON-OPERATING EXPENSE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A $5.8 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE DRIVEN BY THE LESS FAVORABLE IMPACT OF OUR SWAP CONTRACTS DURING FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR SWAP CONTRACTS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION).  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE REPORTED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $326.4 MILLION AND AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 66.7%, AS COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $5.6 MILLION AND AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 5.3% DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $332.0 MILLION INCREASE IN THE INCOME TAX PROVISION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES OF $221.4 MILLION RECORDED DURING FISCAL 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJA, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 4,520 BASIS POINTS, AS WELL AS THE INCREASE IN PRETAX INCOME. THE 66.7% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 WAS HIGHER THAN OUR BLENDED STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 31.5% PRIMARILY DUE TO TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES, THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09, \"IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING\" (\"ASU 2016-09\"), AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN INCOME TAX AUDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TAX IMPACTS OF EARNINGS IN LOWER TAXED FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS VERSUS THE U.S. AND TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND PROVISION TO TAX RETURN ADJUSTMENTS. THE 5.3% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2017 WAS LOWER THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 35.0% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX IMPACT OF EARNINGS IN LOWER TAXED FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS VERSUS THE U.S., VALUATION ALLOWANCES AND ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND INCOME TAX RESERVES LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCOME TAX SETTLEMENT AND CERTAIN INCOME TAX AUDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF AN INCOME TAX RESERVE RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN TAX LAW THAT IMPACTED AN INTEREST ASSESSMENT ON A PRIOR YEAR WITHHOLDING TAX.  NET INCOME (LOSS).  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE REPORTED NET INCOME OF $162.8 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $99.3 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $262.1 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $590.5 MILLION INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $332.0 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED. NET INCOME IN FISCAL 2018 REFLECTED TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES OF $221.4 MILLION. OUR OPERATING RESULTS DURING FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2017 WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING-RELATED CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES TOTALING $165.6 MILLION AND $770.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH HAD AN AFTER-TAX EFFECT OF REDUCING NET INCOME BY $113.3 MILLION AND $592.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, OUR NET LOSS DURING FISCAL 2017 REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF $15.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF AN INCOME TAX RESERVE RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN TAX LAW THAT IMPACTED AN INTEREST ASSESSMENT ON A PRIOR YEAR WITHHOLDING TAX.  NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE REPORTED NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE OF $1.97, AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE OF $1.20 DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $3.17 PER SHARE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE HIGHER LEVEL OF NET INCOME, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, AND LOWER WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING FISCAL 2018, DRIVEN BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE IMPACT OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING FISCAL 2017. NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE DURING FISCAL 2018 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $2.68 PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF TCJA ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGES. NET INCOME (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE DURING FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2017 WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $1.38 PER SHARE AND $7.10 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF RESTRUCTURING-RELATED CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS, AND CERTAIN OTHER CHARGES. IN ADDITION, OUR NET LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE DURING FISCAL 2017 REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF $0.19 PER SHARE RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF AN INCOME TAX RESERVE RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN TAX LAW THAT IMPACTED AN INTEREST ASSESSMENT ON A PRIOR YEAR WITHHOLDING TAX.  54  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  FINANCIAL CONDITION  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN OUR NET CASH AND INVESTMENTS POSITION AT  MARCH 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR USE OF CASH TO SUPPORT CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES OF  $502.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING WITHHOLDINGS IN SATISFACTION OF TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS, TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS THROUGH  $197.7 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF  $190.7 MILLION  , AS WELL AS THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $23.9 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS OF  $783.8 MILLION.

THE NET UNFAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR INVENTORY LEVELS LARGELY TO SUPPORT REVENUE GROWTH, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF INVENTORY RECEIPTS;  55  \u2022  AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO OUR INCOME TAX PAYABLE, LARGELY A RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN CHARGES RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJA'S MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR;  \u2022  AN UNFAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES LARGELY DRIVEN BY FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; AND  \u2022  UNFAVORABLE CHANGES RELATED TO OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $879.3 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  $189.1 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $690.2 MILLION  NET INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A  $650.4 MILLION  INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, LESS PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS. DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE MADE NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES OF  $673.3 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO  $22.9 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  ;  \u2022  A  $36.1 MILLION  INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE SPENT  $197.7 MILLION  ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AS COMPARED TO  $161.6 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  . OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING  FISCAL 2019  PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW STORE OPENINGS, RETAIL AND DEPARTMENT STORE RENOVATIONS, AND ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS; AND  \u2022  A  $23.8 MILLION  INCREASE IN PAYMENTS TO SETTLE NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.  THESE INCREASES IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH PROCEEDS OF  $20.0 MILLION  FROM THE SALE OF ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN NORTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2019.  IN FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CONTINUING OUR GLOBAL STORE FLEET EXPANSION AND RENOVATIONS WITH DEMONSTRATED RATES OF RETURN, INVESTING IN OUR DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM AND OTHER CONSUMER-FACING INITIATIVES, AND CONSOLIDATING OUR CORPORATE OFFICE FOOTPRINT.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $605.7 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  $197.5 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE  $408.2 MILLION  NET INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A  $485.5 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE USED  $470.0 MILLION  TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND AN ADDITIONAL  $32.6 MILLION  IN SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE SURRENDERED OR WITHHELD IN SATISFACTION OF WITHHOLDING TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF AWARDS UNDER OUR LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS, DURING  FISCAL 2018  , NO SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE REPURCHASED AND  $17.1 MILLION  IN SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE SURRENDERED OR WITHHELD FOR TAXES; AND  \u2022  A  $28.3 MILLION  INCREASE IN PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE TO THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND PER SHARE (AS DISCUSSED WITHIN \"  DIVIDENDS  \" BELOW). DIVIDENDS PAID AMOUNTED TO  $190.7 MILLION  AND  $162.4 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND  FISCAL 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THESE INCREASES IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A  $78.1 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT, LESS DEBT REPAYMENTS. DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE RECEIVED  $398.1 MILLION  IN PROCEEDS FROM OUR ISSUANCE OF 3.750% UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2018, A PORTION OF WHICH WAS USED TO REPAY  $300.0 MILLION  OF OUR 2.125% UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED IN SEPTEMBER 2018. ADDITIONALLY, DURING  FISCAL 2019  WE REPAID APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION THAT HAD BEEN BORROWED UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES DURING  FISCAL 2018  ; AND  \u2022  A  $21.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.  56  FISCAL 2018  COMPARED TO  FISCAL 2017  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2018  APRIL 1,  2017  $CHANGE  (MILLIONS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $975.1  $952.6  $22.5  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (189.1  )  (208.1  )  19.0  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (197.5  )  (518.4  )  320.9  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  55.2  (16.4  )  71.6  NET INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $643.7  $209.7  $434.0  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $975.1 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2018, FROM $952.6 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $22.5 MILLION NET INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO A NET FAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES. THE DECLINE IN NET INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES REFLECTED A NET CHARGE OF $209.3 MILLION RECORDED DURING FISCAL 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJA'S ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX. THIS CHARGE, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID OVER AN EIGHT-YEAR PERIOD NET OF FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND OTHER FEDERAL INCOME TAX ACTIVITY, DID NOT IMPACT OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2018 AS REFLECTED IN THE OFFSETTING NET FAVORABLE CHANGE IN OUR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED TAXES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THIS ENACTMENT-RELATED CHARGE, THE NET INCREASE RELATED TO OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  FAVORABLE CHANGES IN OUR (I) OTHER INCOME TAX RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX) AND (II) DEFERRED INCOME, BOTH LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF CASH COLLECTIONS AND PAYMENTS.  THESE INCREASES RELATED TO OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A LESS FAVORABLE CHANGE RELATED TO OUR INVENTORY IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND THE TIMING OF INVENTORY RECEIPTS; AND  \u2022  UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN OUR (I) ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND (II) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS AND COLLECTIONS, RESPECTIVELY.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $189.1 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2018, AS COMPARED TO $208.1 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $19.0 MILLION NET DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A $122.4 MILLION DECLINE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING FISCAL 2018, WE SPENT $161.6 MILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AS COMPARED TO $284.0 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2018 PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR GLOBAL RETAIL AND DEPARTMENT STORE RENOVATIONS, NEW STORE OPENINGS, AND THE CONTINUED ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR GLOBAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS.  THIS DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A $104.9 MILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, LESS PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2018, WE MADE NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES OF $22.9 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO RECEIVING NET PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS OF $82.0 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $197.5 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2018, AS COMPARED TO $518.4 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2017. THE $320.9 MILLION NET DECREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY.  \u2022  A $198.1 MILLION DECLINE IN CASH USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK. DURING FISCAL 2018, $17.1 MILLION IN SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE SURRENDERED OR WITHHELD IN SATISFACTION OF WITHHOLDING TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF AWARDS UNDER OUR LONG-TERM STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS. ON A COMPARATIVE BASIS, DURING FISCAL 2017, WE USED $200.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR COMMON STOCK  57  REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND AN ADDITIONAL $15.2 MILLION IN SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK WERE SURRENDERED OR WITHHELD FOR TAXES; AND  \u2022  A $126.2 MILLION DECLINE IN CASH USED TO REPAY DEBT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DEBT ISSUANCES. DURING FISCAL 2018, WE RECEIVED $10.1 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES. DURING FISCAL 2017, WE MADE $90.0 MILLION IN NET REPAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTE ISSUANCES AND REPAYMENTS AND REPAID $26.1 MILLION OF BORROWINGS  PREVIOUSLY OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS, OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING OPTIONS.  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE GENERATED  $783.8 MILLION  OF NET CASH FLOWS FROM OUR OPERATIONS. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD $1.987 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, OF WHICH  $607.4 MILLION  WERE HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES DOMICILED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN CASH TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. GIVEN RECENT CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TCJA (AS DISCUSSED WITHIN \"  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \"), DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 WE REEVALUATED OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT ASSERTION AND DETERMINED THAT UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO THE TCJA'S ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX WERE NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2017. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DECISION, WE REPATRIATED  $252 MILLION  OF CASH TO THE U.S. FROM CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, AND WE REPATRIATED AN ADDITIONAL  $875 MILLION  DURING FISCAL 2019, ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO EARNINGS PREVIOUSLY TAXED UNDER THE TCJA. THE MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX DOES NOT APPLY TO UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS GENERATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017, AND THEREFORE WE INTEND TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST ANY SUCH EARNINGS. HOWEVER, IF OUR PLANS CHANGE AND WE CHOOSE TO REPATRIATE POST-2017 EARNINGS TO THE U.S. IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE U.S. AND FOREIGN TAXES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR TOTAL AVAILABILITY, BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING, AND REMAINING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  .  MARCH 30, 2019  DESCRIPTION  (A)  TOTAL  AVAILABILITY  BORROWINGS  OUTSTANDING  REMAINING  AVAILABILITY  (MILLIONS)  GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY AND COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM  (B)  $500  $10  (C)  $490  PAN-ASIA CREDIT FACILITIES  33  \u2014  33  (A)  AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 11  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (B)  BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM ARE SUPPORTED BY THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT EXPECT COMBINED BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY TO EXCEED $500 MILLION.  (C)  REPRESENTS OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR WHICH WE WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE UNDER THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY IS ADEQUATELY DIVERSIFIED WITH NO UNDUE CONCENTRATION IN ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. IN PARTICULAR, AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NINE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY, WITH NO ONE PARTICIPANT MAINTAINING A MAXIMUM COMMITMENT PERCENTAGE IN EXCESS OF 20%. BORROWINGS UNDER THE PAN-ASIA CREDIT FACILITIES ARE GUARANTEED BY THE PARENT COMPANY AND ARE GRANTED AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE PARTICIPATING REGIONAL BRANCHES OF JPMORGAN CHASE (THE \"BANKS\"), SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY OF THE BANKS' FUNDS AND SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS WILL BE UNABLE TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE FINANCING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY AND THE PAN-ASIA CREDIT FACILITIES IN THE EVENT OF OUR ELECTION TO DRAW FUNDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  58  OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE USED TO FUND OUR ONGOING CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, GLOBAL RETAIL STORE AND DIGITAL COMMERCE EXPANSION, CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION OF SHOP-WITHIN-SHOPS, INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENTS, CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SETTLEMENT OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (INCLUDING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS), AND OTHER CORPORATE ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING OUR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH, THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING, CAPITAL, AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, THE ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESSES, AND OUR PLANS FOR FURTHER BUSINESS EXPANSION.  SEE  NOTE 11  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE REMAINING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS APPROXIMATELY  $630 MILLION  , REFLECTING THE JUNE 4, 2018 APPROVAL BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $1.000 BILLION  OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. ON  MAY 13, 2019  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS US TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $600 MILLION  OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK. REPURCHASES OF SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO OVERALL BUSINESS AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  SEE  NOTE 15  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  DIVIDENDS  SINCE 2003, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND PROGRAM ON OUR COMMON STOCK. ON JUNE 4, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE TO THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK FROM $0.50 TO $0.625 PER SHARE. ON  MAY 13, 2019  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A FURTHER INCREASE TO THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK FROM  $0.625  TO  $0.6875  PER SHARE.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO PAY REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. HOWEVER, ANY DECISION TO DECLARE AND PAY DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE MADE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH REQUIREMENTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY DEEM RELEVANT.  SEE  NOTE 15  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND PROGRAM.  DEBT AND COVENANT COMPLIANCE  IN AUGUST 2015, WE COMPLETED A REGISTERED PUBLIC DEBT OFFERING AND ISSUED  $300 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES DUE  AUGUST 18, 2020  , WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF  2.625%  , PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY (THE \"2.625% SENIOR NOTES\"). IN AUGUST 2018, WE COMPLETED ANOTHER REGISTERED PUBLIC DEBT OFFERING AND ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL  $400 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES DUE  SEPTEMBER 15, 2025  , WHICH BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF  3.750%  , PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY (THE \"3.750% SENIOR NOTES\").  THE INDENTURE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES GOVERNING THE 2.625% SENIOR NOTES AND 3.750% SENIOR NOTES (AS SUPPLEMENTED, THE \"INDENTURE\") CONTAIN CERTAIN COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR CERTAIN LIENS; ENTER INTO SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS; CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE WITH ANOTHER PARTY; OR SELL, LEASE, OR CONVEY ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PROPERTY OR ASSETS TO ANOTHER PARTY. HOWEVER, THE INDENTURE DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS.  THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS, AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 11  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED PURSUANT TO THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY) HAS OCCURRED UNDER OUR GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY. THE PAN-ASIA CREDIT FACILITIES DO NOT CONTAIN ANY FINANCIAL COVENANTS.

AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF POTENTIAL CASH FLOWS UNDERLYING OUR RELATED SWAP CONTRACTS (SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF OUR SWAP CONTRACTS);  \u2022  LEASE OBLIGATIONS  REPRESENT THE FIXED MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS DUE UNDER NONCANCELABLE LEASES OF OUR REAL ESTATE AND OPERATING EQUIPMENT. WE ARE ALSO NORMALLY REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES, INSURANCE, AND CERTAIN OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATING TO OUR LEASED REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE FIXED AND DETERMINABLE. APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THESE LEASE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS. INFORMATION HAS BEEN PRESENTED SEPARATELY FOR OPERATING AND CAPITAL LEASES;  \u2022  INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS  REPRESENT OUR LEGALLY-BINDING AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES OF GOODS AT DETERMINABLE PRICES;  \u2022  MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS  REPRESENT OUR TAX OBLIGATION INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS PURSUANT TO THE TCJA (SEE  NOTE 10  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE TCJA); AND  \u2022  OTHER COMMITMENTS  PRIMARILY REPRESENT OUR LEGALLY-BINDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER SPONSORSHIP, LICENSING, AND OTHER MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AGREEMENTS; DISTRIBUTION-RELATED AGREEMENTS; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY-RELATED SERVICE AGREEMENTS; AND PENSION-RELATED OBLIGATIONS.  EXCLUDED FROM THE ABOVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE IS THE NON-CURRENT LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF  $78.8 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS WE CANNOT MAKE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LIABILITY WILL BE SETTLED, IF EVER. THE ABOVE TABLE ALSO EXCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: (I) OTHER THAN CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS, AMOUNTS RECORDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WHICH WILL BE PAID WITHIN ONE YEAR; AND (II) NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES THAT HAVE NO CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM (E.G., DEFERRED REVENUE), OR THE CASH OUTFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ARE UNCERTAIN OR DO NOT REPRESENT A \"PURCHASE OBLIGATION\" AS THE TERM IS USED HEREIN (E.G., DEFERRED TAXES, DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS).  60  WE ALSO HAVE CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE US TO MAKE PAYMENTS IF CERTAIN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR. SEE  NOTE 14  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITMENTS INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE, OUR OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FIRM COMMITMENTS RELATING TO OUR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTED TO  $11.5 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  . WE DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS, OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 13  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF RISKS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BALANCES, CERTAIN ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, AND POSSIBLE DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF REPORTED NET ASSETS OF OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. CONSEQUENTLY, AT TIMES, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE SUCH RISKS. WE DO NOT ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE OR TRADING PURPOSES.  AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, WE ARE EXPOSED TO THE RISK THAT COUNTERPARTIES TO OUR CONTRACTS WILL FAIL TO MEET THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. TO MITIGATE THIS COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, WE HAVE A POLICY OF ONLY ENTERING INTO CONTRACTS WITH CAREFULLY SELECTED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF THEIR CREDIT RATINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS, ADHERING TO ESTABLISHED LIMITS FOR CREDIT EXPOSURE. OUR ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR MITIGATING CREDIT RISK FROM DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS INCLUDE ONGOING REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES. WE ALSO ENTER INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES, WHEN POSSIBLE, TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE CONSIDERATIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE ARE EXPOSED TO ANY UNDUE CONCENTRATION OF COUNTERPARTY RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  . HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE IN AGGREGATE $27.6 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN NET ASSET POSITIONS WITH SEVEN CREDITWORTHY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT  WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS. REFER TO  NOTE 13  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND FAIR VALUES OF OUR FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS  WE ENTER INTO FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AS HEDGES TO REDUCE OUR RISK RELATED TO EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON INVENTORY TRANSACTIONS MADE IN AN ENTITY'S NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, THE SETTLEMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BALANCES, AND THE TRANSLATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN OPERATIONS' NET ASSETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. AS PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO THE RISK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE EURO, THE JAPANESE YEN, THE SOUTH KOREAN WON, THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR, THE BRITISH POUND STERLING, THE SWISS FRANC, THE SWEDISH KRONA, THE CHINESE RENMINBI, THE NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR, AND THE HONG KONG DOLLAR, WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ANTICIPATED OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD. IN DOING SO, WE USE FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS THAT GENERALLY HAVE MATURITIES OF TWO MONTHS TO TWO YEARS TO PROVIDE CONTINUING COVERAGE THROUGHOUT THE HEDGING PERIOD OF THE RESPECTIVE EXPOSURE.  OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE GOVERNED BY OUR COMPANY'S ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. THESE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK THAT ALLOWS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CURRENCY EXPOSURES WHILE ENSURING THE ACTIVITIES ARE CONDUCTED WITHIN OUR ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. OUR POLICIES INCLUDE GUIDELINES FOR THE ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FUNCTION AND FOR INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUTHORIZATION LEVELS, TRANSACTION LIMITS, AND CREDIT QUALITY CONTROLS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS MEASUREMENTS FOR MONITORING COMPLIANCE. WE MONITOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK USING DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING A PERIODIC REVIEW OF MARKET VALUES AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSES.  61  WE RECORD OUR FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. TO THE EXTENT FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS QUALIFYING CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE RELATED GAINS OR LOSSES ARE INITIALLY DEFERRED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\"AOCI\") AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  FORECASTED INVENTORY TRANSACTIONS  \u2014 RECOGNIZED AS PART OF THE COST OF THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED WITHIN COST OF GOODS SOLD WHEN THE RELATED INVENTORY IS SOLD TO A THIRD PARTY.  \u2022  SETTLEMENT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY BALANCES  \u2014 RECOGNIZED WITHIN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE HEDGED BALANCE IS REMEASURED THROUGH EARNINGS, GENERALLY THROUGH ITS SETTLEMENT WHEN THE RELATED PAYMENT OCCURS.  WE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS NET GAINS ON FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS OF  $9.8 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , AND NET LOSSES OF  $8.7 MILLION  AND  $2.6 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2018  AND  FISCAL 2017  , RESPECTIVELY.  CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS  DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 2, 2016 (\"FISCAL 2016\"), WE ENTERED INTO TWO PAY-FLOATING RATE, RECEIVE-FLOATING RATE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS, WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF \u20ac280 MILLION AND \u20ac274 MILLION, WHICH WE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OUR NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. THE \u20ac280 MILLION NOTIONAL CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP, WHICH WAS SETTLED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, SWAPPED THE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED VARIABLE INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE 3-MONTH LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\"LIBOR\") PLUS A FIXED SPREAD (AS PAID UNDER THE 2.125% INTEREST RATE SWAP DISCUSSED BELOW) FOR EURO-DENOMINATED VARIABLE INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS BASED ON THE 3-MONTH EURO INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\"EURIBOR\") PLUS A FIXED SPREAD, WHICH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 2.125% INTEREST RATE SWAP, ECONOMICALLY CONVERTED OUR PREVIOUSLY-OUTSTANDING $300 MILLION FIXED-RATE 2.125% SENIOR NOTES OBLIGATION TO A \u20ac280 MILLION FLOATING-RATE EURO-DENOMINATED OBLIGATION. SIMILARLY, THE \u20ac274 MILLION NOTIONAL CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP, WHICH MATURES ON AUGUST 18, 2020, SWAPS THE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED VARIABLE INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A FIXED SPREAD (AS PAID UNDER THE 2.625% INTEREST RATE SWAP DISCUSSED BELOW) FOR EURO-DENOMINATED VARIABLE INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS BASED ON 3-MONTH EURIBOR PLUS A FIXED SPREAD, WHICH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 2.625% INTEREST RATE SWAP, ECONOMICALLY CONVERTS OUR $300 MILLION FIXED-RATE 2.625% SENIOR NOTES OBLIGATION TO A \u20ac274 MILLION FLOATING-RATE EURO-DENOMINATED OBLIGATION.  ADDITIONALLY, IN AUGUST 2018, WE ENTERED INTO PAY-FIXED RATE, RECEIVE-FIXED RATE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF \u20ac346 MILLION WHICH WE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OUR NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN OF OUR EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2025, SWAP THE U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS ON OUR 3.750% SENIOR NOTES FOR EURO-DENOMINATED 1.29% FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS, THEREBY ECONOMICALLY CONVERTING OUR $400 MILLION FIXED-RATE 3.750% SENIOR NOTES OBLIGATION TO A \u20ac346 MILLION FIXED-RATE 1.29% EURO-DENOMINATED OBLIGATION.  SENSITIVITY  WE PERFORM A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS THAT MARKET RISK EXPOSURES MAY HAVE ON THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP CONTRACTS. TO PERFORM THE ANALYSIS, WE ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS IN THESE CONTRACTS' FAIR VALUES THAT WOULD RESULT FROM HYPOTHETICAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS ANALYSIS ASSUMES A LIKE MOVEMENT BY THE FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN OUR HEDGE PORTFOLIO AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , A 10% APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES UNDER CONTRACT WOULD RESULT IN A NET INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO OF APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION. THIS HYPOTHETICAL NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE NET CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS.  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT  DURING FISCAL 2016, WE ENTERED INTO TWO PAY-FLOATING RATE, RECEIVE-FIXED RATE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WHICH WE DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AGAINST CHANGES IN THE RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES OF OUR PREVIOUSLY-OUTSTANDING FIXED-RATE 2.125% SENIOR NOTES AND OUR FIXED-RATE 2.625% SENIOR NOTES ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN THE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP RELATED TO THE 2.125% SENIOR NOTES (THE \"2.125% INTEREST RATE SWAP\"), WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2018 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MATURITY OF THE RELATED DEBT, HAD A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION AND SWAPPED THE FIXED INTEREST RATE ON THE 2.125% SENIOR NOTES FOR A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A FIXED SPREAD. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP RELATED TO THE 2.625% SENIOR NOTES (THE \"2.625% INTEREST RATE SWAP\"), WHICH MATURES ON AUGUST 18, 2020 AND ALSO HAS A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION, SWAPS THE FIXED INTEREST RATE ON THE 2.625% SENIOR NOTES FOR A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE BASED ON 3-MONTH LIBOR PLUS A FIXED SPREAD.  62  SENSITIVITY  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , NOTWITHSTANDING THE AFOREMENTIONED 2.625% INTEREST RATE SWAP, WE HAD NO VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OUTSTANDING. AS SUCH, OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES PRIMARILY RELATES TO A CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE SENIOR NOTES. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR SENIOR NOTES WERE  $709.1 MILLION  . A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES WOULD DECREASE OR INCREASE, RESPECTIVELY, THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SENIOR NOTES BY APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION. SUCH POTENTIAL INCREASES OR DECREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT WOULD ONLY BE RELEVANT IF WE WERE TO RETIRE ALL OR A PORTION OF THE DEBT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AND ARE BASED ON CERTAIN SIMPLIFYING ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING AN IMMEDIATE ACROSS-THE-BOARD INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES WITH NO OTHER SUBSEQUENT CHANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.  INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON-HAND OF  $584.1 MILLION  , CONSISTING OF DEPOSITS IN INTEREST BEARING ACCOUNTS, INVESTMENTS IN MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. OUR OTHER SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS INCLUDED  $1.403 BILLION  OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CONSISTING OF INVESTMENTS IN TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS;  $42.4 MILLION  OF RESTRICTED CASH PLACED IN ESCROW WITH CERTAIN BANKS AS COLLATERAL, PRIMARILY TO SECURE GUARANTEES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL TAX MATTERS AND REAL ESTATE LEASES; AND  $44.9 MILLION  OF INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN ONE YEAR, CONSISTING OF TIME DEPOSITS.  WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR GLOBAL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDE MONITORING BOTH GENERAL AND ISSUER-SPECIFIC ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE CAPITAL PRESERVATION, MAINTAINING ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY, DIVERSIFICATION TO MINIMIZE LIQUIDITY AND CREDIT RISK, AND ACHIEVEMENT OF MAXIMUM RETURNS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES SET FORTH IN OUR INVESTMENT POLICY. SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL OF THE COMPOSITION OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  WE EVALUATE INVESTMENTS HELD IN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITIONS, IF ANY, FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS EVALUATION INVOLVES A VARIETY OF CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND DISTINCT CONDITIONS AFFECTING SPECIFIC ISSUERS. WE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: (I) THE LENGTH OF TIME AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST, (II) THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT WORTHINESS, AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, (III) THE LENGTH OF TIME TO MATURITY, (IV) ANTICIPATED FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MARKET FORECASTS, (V) OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO RETAIN OUR INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR RECOVERY OF MARKET VALUE, AND (VI) AN ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL OUR INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF MARKET VALUE. NO MATERIAL REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN ANY OF THE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS CONSIDERED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT IS IMPORTANT TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND CASH FLOWS, AND REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT IN ITS APPLICATION. OUR ESTIMATES ARE OFTEN BASED ON COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, ASSESSMENTS OF PROBABILITY, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE, BUT THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT OTHER PROFESSIONALS, APPLYING REASONABLE JUDGMENT TO THE SAME SET OF FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, COULD DEVELOP AND SUPPORT A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING LIST REPRESENTS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE  NOTE 3  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SALES RESERVES AND UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS  A SIGNIFICANT AREA OF JUDGMENT AFFECTING REPORTED REVENUE AND NET INCOME INVOLVES ESTIMATING SALES RESERVES, WHICH REPRESENT THE PORTION OF GROSS REVENUES NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED. IN PARTICULAR, REVENUE RELATED TO OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS IS REDUCED BY ESTIMATES OF RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, END-OF-SEASON MARKDOWNS, OPERATIONAL CHARGEBACKS, AND CERTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING ALLOWANCES. REVENUE RELATED TO OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, INCLUDING DIGITAL COMMERCE SALES, IS ALSO REDUCED BY AN ESTIMATE OF RETURNS.  IN DETERMINING ESTIMATES OF RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, END-OF-SEASON MARKDOWNS, OPERATIONAL CHARGEBACKS, AND COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING ALLOWANCES, WE ANALYZE HISTORICAL TRENDS, ACTUAL AND FORECASTED SEASONAL RESULTS, CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, RETAILER PERFORMANCE, AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, CONTRACTUAL TERMS. ESTIMATES FOR OPERATIONAL CHARGEBACKS ARE BASED ON ACTUAL CUSTOMER NOTIFICATIONS OF ORDER FULFILLMENT DISCREPANCIES AND HISTORICAL TRENDS. WE REVIEW AND REFINE THESE ESTIMATES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. OUR HISTORICAL ESTIMATES OF THESE COSTS HAVE NOT DIFFERED MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. A HYPOTHETICAL 1% INCREASE IN OUR RESERVES  63  FOR RETURNS, DISCOUNTS, END-OF-SEASON MARKDOWNS, OPERATIONAL CHARGEBACKS, AND CERTAIN COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING ALLOWANCES AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR  FISCAL 2019  NET REVENUES BY APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION.  SIMILARLY, WE EVALUATE OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TO DETERMINE IF THEY WILL ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE INVOLVED IN THIS EVALUATION, INCLUDING AN ANALYSIS OF SPECIFIC RISKS ON A CUSTOMER-BY-CUSTOMER BASIS FOR LARGER ACCOUNTS AND CUSTOMERS, AND A RECEIVABLES AGING ANALYSIS THAT DETERMINES THE PERCENTAGE OF RECEIVABLES THAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN UNCOLLECTED BY AGED CATEGORY. BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, WE PROVIDE A RESERVE FOR THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS BELIEVED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR THOSE RISKS AS PART OF OUR BAD DEBT RESERVE, A SEVERE AND PROLONGED ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS' BUSINESS OPERATIONS COULD HAVE A CORRESPONDING MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR NET SALES, CASH FLOWS, AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  SEE \"ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\" IN  NOTE 3  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR AN ANALYSIS OF THE ACTIVITY IN OUR SALES RESERVES AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED.  INVENTORIES  WE HOLD INVENTORY THAT IS SOLD THROUGH WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS TO MAJOR DEPARTMENT STORES AND SPECIALTY RETAIL STORES. WE ALSO HOLD RETAIL INVENTORY THAT IS SOLD IN OUR OWN STORES AND DIGITAL COMMERCE SITES DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INVENTORIES ARE COMPRISED OF FINISHED GOODS, WHICH ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST DETERMINED ON A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST BASIS.  THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF INVENTORY IS DETERMINED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS OF OUR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCT LINES, THE IMPACT OF MARKET TRENDS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND A FORECAST OF FUTURE DEMAND, GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE VALUE OF CURRENT ORDERS IN-HOUSE FOR FUTURE SALES OF INVENTORY, AS WELL AS PLANS TO SELL INVENTORY THROUGH OUR FACTORY STORES, AMONG OTHER LIQUIDATION CHANNELS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES DUE TO THE QUANTITY, QUALITY, AND MIX OF PRODUCTS IN INVENTORY, CONSUMER AND RETAILER PREFERENCES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. RESERVES FOR INVENTORY SHRINKAGE, REPRESENTING THE RISK OF PHYSICAL LOSS OF INVENTORY, ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ARE ADJUSTED BASED UPON PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS. OUR HISTORICAL ESTIMATES OF THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED PROVISIONS HAVE NOT DIFFERED MATERIALLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  A HYPOTHETICAL 1% INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF OUR INVENTORY RESERVES AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR  FISCAL 2019  GROSS PROFIT BY APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION.  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL AND CERTAIN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED. RATHER, GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND, ALONG WITH OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS, ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT PERIODICALLY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEIR CARRYING VALUES MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE.  WE GENERALLY PERFORM OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT USING A QUALITATIVE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUE. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO REASSESS THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE PERIODICALLY PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS IN LIEU OF USING THE QUALITATIVE APPROACH.  PERFORMANCE OF THE QUALITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT REQUIRES JUDGMENT IN IDENTIFYING AND CONSIDERING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF RELEVANT KEY FACTORS, EVENTS, AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT AFFECT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THIS REQUIRES CONSIDERATION AND ASSESSMENT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS MACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY, AND MARKET CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS ENTITY-SPECIFIC FACTORS, SUCH AS OUR ACTUAL AND PLANNED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE ALSO GIVE CONSIDERATION TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EACH REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE AND CARRYING VALUE AS OF THE MOST RECENT DATE THAT A FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT WAS PERFORMED. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT CONCLUDE THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED.  THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST INVOLVES COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT TO BE IMPAIRED. HOWEVER, IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THAT EXCESS. ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECOGNIZED IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNIT'S ALLOCATED GOODWILL.  64  DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT UNDER THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND OFTEN INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. SIMILARLY, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WHETHER OR NOT AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED AND THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY SUCH CHARGE. TO ASSIST MANAGEMENT IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, WE MAY REVIEW AND CONSIDER APPRAISALS FROM ACCREDITED INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRMS. ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, MARKET COMPARISONS, AND RECENT TRANSACTIONS. THESE APPROACHES USE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS (INCLUDING TIMING), DISCOUNT RATES REFLECTING THE RISKS INHERENT IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS, PERPETUAL GROWTH RATES, AND DETERMINATION OF APPROPRIATE MARKET COMPARABLES.  WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019  USING THE QUALITATIVE APPROACH DISCUSSED ABOVE, WHILE GIVING CONSIDERATION TO OUR MOST RECENT QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST (THE RESULTS OF WHICH INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS WITH ALLOCATED GOODWILL SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES). BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, WE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE REPORTING UNITS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES AND THERE WERE NO REPORTING UNITS AT RISK OF IMPAIRMENT. ADDITIONALLY, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED DURING ANY OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS.  SUBSEQUENT TO OUR FISCAL 2017 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, WE REALIGNED OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017 AS A RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IMPLEMENTED IN CONNECTION WITH THE WAY FORWARD PLAN. AS A RESULT OF THE REALIGNMENT OF OUR SEGMENT REPORTING STRUCTURE, WE REALLOCATED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL TO OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS BASED UPON EACH REPORTING UNIT'S RELATIVE FAIR VALUE AS OF THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS REALLOCATION, WE PERFORMED AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS USING THE QUANTITATIVE APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT PERFORMED, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF ONE OF OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. AS A RESULT, A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $5.2 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017 TO FULLY WRITE OFF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S REALLOCATED GOODWILL. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE REMAINING NEW REPORTING UNITS SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES AND WERE NOT AT RISK OF IMPAIRMENT.  IN EVALUATING FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY, WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION WHERE PROBABLE. TO THE EXTENT THAT ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSET ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSET AND ITS FAIR VALUE, CONSIDERING EXTERNAL MARKET PARTICIPANT ASSUMPTIONS.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $8.8 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE PLANNED USAGE OF A CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSET TO REDUCE THE VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. THERE WERE NO OTHER FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED DURING ANY OF THE FISCAL PERIODS PRESENTED. SEE  NOTE 8  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR CONCLUSIONS REGARDING IMPAIRMENT OR RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS IF, FOR EXAMPLE, (I) OUR BUSINESSES DO NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, (II) OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN FUTURE YEARS VARY FROM CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, (III) BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR STRATEGIES CHANGE FROM OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR (IV) THE IDENTIFICATION OF OUR REPORTING UNITS CHANGE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. SUCH CHANGES COULD RESULT IN A FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ALONG WITH OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS, ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT PERIODICALLY WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEIR RELATED CARRYING VALUES MAY NOT BE FULLY RECOVERABLE. IN EVALUATING LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR RECOVERABILITY, WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION, WHERE APPLICABLE. TO THE EXTENT THAT ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSET ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSET AND ITS FAIR VALUE, CONSIDERING EXTERNAL MARKET PARTICIPANT ASSUMPTIONS. ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AND FOR WHICH THERE IS A COMMITTED PLAN OF DISPOSAL (COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ASSETS HELD-FOR-SALE) ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE, LESS COSTS TO SELL.  IN DETERMINING FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WE TAKE VARIOUS FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN MERCHANDISING STRATEGY, THE EMPHASIS ON RETAIL STORE COST CONTROLS, THE EFFECTS OF MACROECONOMIC TRENDS SUCH AS CONSUMER SPENDING, AND THE IMPACTS OF MORE EXPERIENCED RETAIL STORE MANAGERS AND INCREASED LOCAL ADVERTISING. SINCE THE DETERMINATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS IS AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS MAY ARISE IN THE EVENT THAT FUTURE CASH FLOWS DO NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS.  65  DURING  FISCAL 2019  ,  FISCAL 2018  , AND  FISCAL 2017  , WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $21.2 MILLION  ,  $41.2 MILLION  , AND  $248.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, TO FULLY WRITE OFF THE CARRYING VALUES OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS BASED UPON THEIR ASSUMED FAIR VALUES OF ZERO. ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $4.6 MILLION TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF A CERTAIN ASSET HELD-FOR-SALE TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, LESS COSTS TO SELL. SEE  NOTE 8  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  INCOME TAXES  IN DETERMINING OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, WE ESTABLISH A RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. IF WE CONSIDER THAT A TAX POSITION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT, BASED SOLELY ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION, WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT. WE MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT BY DETERMINING THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT, PRESUMING THAT THE TAX POSITION IS EXAMINED BY THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITY THAT HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION. THESE ASSESSMENTS CAN BE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT, AND WE OFTEN OBTAIN ASSISTANCE FROM EXTERNAL ADVISORS. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ESTIMATES CHANGE OR THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT FROM THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATIONS ARE MADE. IF THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF A POSITION FAILS TO RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF A TAX BENEFIT, WE WILL RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT IF (I) THERE ARE CHANGES IN TAX LAW OR ANALOGOUS CASE LAW THAT SUFFICIENTLY RAISE THE LIKELIHOOD OF PREVAILING ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION TO MORE LIKELY THAN NOT; (II) THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRES; OR (III) THERE IS A COMPLETION OF AN AUDIT RESULTING IN A SETTLEMENT OF THAT TAX YEAR WITH THE APPROPRIATE AGENCY.  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES, CAPITAL LOSSES, GENERAL BUSINESS CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, AND THE NET TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES, AS DETERMINED UNDER ENACTED TAX LAWS AND RATES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED. TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ANALYZED PERIODICALLY BY ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF FUTURE EXPECTED TAXABLE INCOME, WHICH TYPICALLY INVOLVES THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES. SUCH ALLOWANCES ARE ADJUSTED AS EVENTS OCCUR, OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THAT WARRANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE BALANCES.  SEE  NOTE 10  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF INCOME TAXES.  CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE PERIODICALLY EXPOSED TO VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CERTAIN LITIGATION, ALLEGED INFORMATION SYSTEM SECURITY BREACHES, CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES, EMPLOYEE RELATION MATTERS, VARIOUS TAX OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUDITS, AND TRADEMARK AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTERS AND DISPUTES. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR SUCH CONTINGENCIES TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CONCLUDE THEIR OCCURRENCE IS PROBABLE AND THE RELATED LOSSES ARE ESTIMABLE. IN ADDITION, IF IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN UNFAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CONTINGENCY COULD EXCEED THE ESTABLISHED LIABILITY, WE DISCLOSE THE ESTIMATED IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IF PRACTICABLE. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS IN MAKING THESE ASSESSMENTS. AS THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF CONTINGENCIES IS INHERENTLY UNPREDICTABLE, THESE ASSESSMENTS CAN INVOLVE A SERIES OF COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COURT RULINGS, NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN AFFECTED PARTIES, AND GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE ACCOUNTING FOR LOSS CONTINGENCIES RELIES HEAVILY ON MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT IN DEVELOPING THE RELATED ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE EXPENSE ALL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDED TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS BASED ON THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARDS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, ADJUSTED FOR FORFEITURES WHICH ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTED FUTURE TRENDS.  STOCK OPTIONS  STOCK OPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS WITH EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. WE USE THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS, WHICH REQUIRES THE USE OF BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS. CERTAIN KEY ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE ESTIMATING FUTURE UNCERTAIN EVENTS. THE KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING THE ESTIMATION PROCESS INCLUDE THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTION, EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE, OUR EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, AMONG OTHERS. GENERALLY, ONCE STOCK OPTION VALUES ARE DETERMINED, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES DO NOT PERMIT THEM TO BE CHANGED, EVEN IF THE ESTIMATES USED ARE DIFFERENT FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  66  NO STOCK OPTIONS WERE GRANTED DURING ANY OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS PRESENTED. SEE  NOTE 17  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (\"RSUS\")  WE HAVE GRANTED RESTRICTED SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK TO OUR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS AND GRANT SERVICE-BASED RSUS TO CERTAIN OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER EMPLOYEES, AS WELL AS TO OUR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. IN ADDITION, WE GRANT RSUS WITH PERFORMANCE-BASED AND MARKET-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS TO SUCH SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES.  THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR RESTRICTED STOCK, SERVICE-BASED RSU, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED RSU AWARDS ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT, ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE ABSENCE OF DIVIDENDS FOR ANY AWARDS FOR WHICH DIVIDEND EQUIVALENT AMOUNTS DO NOT ACCRUE WHILE OUTSTANDING AND UNVESTED. RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED RSUS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE EMPLOYEES' REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE GOALS (UPON WHICH VESTING IS DEPENDENT) IS DEEMED PROBABLE, AND INVOLVES JUDGMENT AS TO EXPECTATIONS SURROUNDING OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN DEFINED OPERATING PERFORMANCE METRICS.  THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKET-BASED RSU AWARDS, FOR WHICH VESTING IS DEPENDENT UPON TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (\"TSR\") OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK OVER A THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD RELATIVE TO THAT OF A PRE-ESTABLISHED PEER GROUP, IS MEASURED ON THE GRANT DATE BASED ON ESTIMATED PROJECTIONS OF OUR RELATIVE TSR OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THESE ESTIMATES ARE MADE USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION, WHICH MODELS MULTIPLE STOCK PRICE PATHS OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND THAT OF THE PEER GROUP TO EVALUATE AND DETERMINE OUR ULTIMATE EXPECTED RELATIVE TSR PERFORMANCE RANKING. RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, IS RECORDED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, THE MARKET CONDITION IS ULTIMATELY SATISFIED. SEE  NOTE 17  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  SENSITIVITY  THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES OF OUR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATES. IN ADDITION, ESTIMATING THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED REQUIRES JUDGMENT. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE STOCK-BASED AWARD GRANTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND, THEREFORE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED. A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN OUR  FISCAL 2019  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD HAVE AFFECTED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION.

SEE RELATED DISCUSSION IN THE EXPLANATORY NOTE.  BACKGROUND OF INVESTIGATION, PROCEDURES AND ANALYSIS  SEE \"EXPLANATORY NOTE\" TO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM-10K.  NASDAQ DELISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK  AS A RESULT OF THE DELAY IN FILING OUR PERIODIC REPORTS WITH THE SEC AND FAILURE TO HOLD AN ANNUAL MEETING, WE WERE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH THE NASDAQ LISTING STANDARDS AND OUR COMMON STOCK WAS SUSPENDED FROM TRADING ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET EFFECTIVE AUGUST 23, 2018 AND FORMALLY DELISTED EFFECTIVE MARCH 22, 2019. FOLLOWING THE SUSPENSION OF TRADING, OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN QUOTED ON THE OTC MARKET AND IS CURRENTLY TRADED UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cSMCI.\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING TRADING IN OUR COMMON STOCK, REFER TO PART II, ITEM 5, \u201cMARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\u201d IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL LEADER IN HIGH PERFORMANCE, HIGH EFFICIENCY SERVER TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION. WE DEVELOP AND PROVIDE END-TO-END GREEN COMPUTING SOLUTIONS TO THE CLOUD COMPUTING, DATA CENTER, ENTERPRISE, BIG DATA, HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING (\"HPC\" AND INTERNET OF THINGS (\"IOT\")/EMBEDDED MARKETS. OUR SOLUTIONS RANGE FROM COMPLETE SERVER, STORAGE, BLADE AND WORKSTATIONS TO FULL RACKS, NETWORKING DEVICES, SERVER MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT AND SERVICES.  WE COMMENCED OPERATIONS IN 1993 AND HAVE BEEN PROFITABLE EVERY YEAR SINCE INCEPTION. FOR FISCAL YEARS  2017  ,  2016  AND  2015  , OUR NET INCOME WAS  $66.9 MILLION  ,  $72.1 MILLION  AND  $92.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. IN ORDER TO INCREASE OUR SALES AND PROFITS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE MUST CONTINUE TO DEVELOP FLEXIBLE AND CUSTOMIZABLE SERVER SOLUTIONS AND BE AMONG THE FIRST TO MARKET WITH NEW FEATURES AND PRODUCTS. WE MUST ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR SOFTWARE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT OFFERINGS, PARTICULARLY AS WE INCREASINGLY FOCUS ON LARGER ENTERPRISE SALES. WE MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL SUCCESS BASED ON VARIOUS INDICATORS, INCLUDING GROWTH IN NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN AS KEY MEASURES OF PROFITABILITY, AND CASH CONVERSION CYCLE AS A KEY MEASURE OF WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT. AMONG THE KEY NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS OF OUR SUCCESS IS OUR ABILITY TO RAPIDLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND DELIVER THE LATEST APPLICATION OPTIMIZED SERVER SOLUTIONS. IN THIS REGARD, WE WORK CLOSELY WITH MICROPROCESSOR AND OTHER COMPONENT VENDORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AS THEY ARE INTRODUCED. HISTORICALLY, OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS RAPIDLY HAS ALLOWED US TO BENEFIT FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW MICROPROCESSORS AND AS A RESULT WE MONITOR THE INTRODUCTION CYCLES OF INTEL CORPORATION, ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC., AND NVIDIA CORPORATION CAREFULLY. THIS ALSO IMPACTS OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST MORE IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OTHER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  .  \u2022  NET SALES INCREASED BY  11.7%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2016 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED UNIT SHIPMENTS, REFLECTING THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY TO SHIP MORE COMPLETE SYSTEMS, WHICH INCREASED BY  13.5%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR  2016.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN DECLINED TO  14.1%  FROM  14.9%  IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMPONENT PRICES FOR MEMORY AND STORAGE RELATIVE TO OUR ABILITY TO PASS COST INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES WHERE PRICING IS TYPICALLY MORE COMPETITIVE AND LOWER TOTAL CAPACITY UTILIZATION WHILE WE RAMP UP USE OF OUR NEW FACILITIES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED BY  14.4%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR  2016  , BUT REMAINED APPROXIMATELY 10% OF SALES AS WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE OUR HUMAN TALENT, PRIMARILY WITH RESPECT TO FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  \u2022  NET INCOME DECLINED TO  $66.9 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $72.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2016  , WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  $16.1 MILLION  DECLINE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO  26.8%  AS COMPARED TO  32.9%  IN FISCAL  2016.  \u2022  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE  $110.6 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  , COMPARED WITH  $178.8 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2016  . THE  DECREASE  IN OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  $96.2 MILLION  OF CASH USED IN OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND  $29.4 MILLION  OF PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, OF WHICH $16.1 MILLION  WAS RELATED TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS AT OUR GREEN COMPUTING PARK IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $66.6 MILLION  OF BORROWINGS, NET OF REPAYMENTS.  \u2022  THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE IS THE SUM OF DAYS OF SALES OUTSTANDING (\u201cDSO\u201d) AND DAYS OF INVENTORY OUTSTANDING (\u201cDIO\u201d), LESS DAYS OF PURCHASES OUTSTANDING (\u201cDPO\u201d). CASH CONVERSION CYCLE AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS  86  DAYS COMPARED WITH  76  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2016  . DSO AND DIO AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2017 WERE 3 DAYS HIGHER AND 6 DAYS HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2016. DPO AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS 1 DAY LOWER THAN AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2016.  \u2022  OUR INVENTORY BALANCE WAS  $736.7 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  , COMPARED WITH  $516.8 MILLION  AT THE END  OF FISCAL YEAR  2016  . THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY WAS TO MEET CURRENT DEMAND AND EXPECTED FUTURE SALES VOLUME GROWTH.  \u2022  OUR PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND SUPPLIERS WERE  $309.1 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2017  AND  $334.0 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL YEAR  2016.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  FOR DETAILS, SEE PART II, ITEM 8, NOTE 18, \u201cSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  FISCAL YEAR  OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON JUNE 30. REFERENCES TO FISCAL YEAR  2017  , FOR EXAMPLE, REFER TO THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  JUNE 30, 2017.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  GENERAL  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND SALES RETURNS, INVENTORY VALUATION, USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PRODUCT WARRANTY ACCRUALS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS, AND INCOME TAXES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING THE JUDGMENTS WE MAKE ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. BECAUSE THESE ESTIMATES CAN VARY DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES.  A SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8, NOTE 1, \u201cORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\u201d IN OUR NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING ARE THE MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT SALES  . WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM SALES OF PRODUCTS UPON MEETING ALL OF THE FOLLOWING REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA, WHICH IS TYPICALLY MET UPON SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS, UNLESS CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE IS UNCERTAIN OR SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER REMAIN: (I) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS THROUGH CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND ORDERS, (II) THE CUSTOMER TAKES TITLE AND ASSUMES THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP, (III) THE SALES PRICE CHARGED IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AS EVIDENCED BY CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND ORDERS AND (IV) COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.  WE ESTIMATE RESERVES FOR FUTURE SALES RETURNS BASED ON A REVIEW OF OUR HISTORY OF ACTUAL RETURNS FOR EACH MAJOR PRODUCT LINE. WE ALSO REDUCE REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVE OFFERINGS SUCH AS PRICE PROTECTION AND REBATES AS WELL AS COOPERATIVE MARKETING ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BENEFIT IDENTIFIED FROM THE COSTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  WE MAY USE DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL PRODUCTS TO END CUSTOMERS. REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTORS MAY BE RECOGNIZED ON SELL-IN OR SELL-THROUGH BASIS DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF THE ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTOR AND US.  SERVICES SALES.  OUR SALE OF SERVICES MAINLY CONSISTS OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND ON-SITE SERVICES. THESE SERVICES ARE SOLD AT THE TIME OF THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS. REVENUE RELATED TO EXTENDED WARRANTY COMMENCES UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE STANDARD WARRANTY PERIOD AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD. REVENUE RELATED TO ON-SITE SERVICES COMMENCES UPON RECOGNITION OF THE PRODUCT SALE AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD. THESE SERVICE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY ONE TO FIVE YEARS IN LENGTH. SERVICE REVENUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN 10% OF NET SALES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AND IS NOT SEPARATELY DISCLOSED.  MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS CONTAIN MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, CONSISTING OF BOTH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN ALL THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET FOR THAT ELEMENT.  WE ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AT THE INCEPTION OF AN ARRANGEMENT TO ALL DELIVERABLES, IF THEY REPRESENT A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE ESTIMATED STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES. A DELIVERABLE QUALIFIES AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WHEN THE DELIVERED ELEMENT HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER. THE GUIDANCE ESTABLISHES THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE ESTIMATED STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (\u201cVSOE\u201d), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (\u201cTPE\u201d) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR (III) THE VENDOR'S BEST ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE (\u201cBESP\u201d)  IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE ARE AVAILABLE. WE DO NOT HAVE VSOE FOR DELIVERABLES IN OUR ARRANGEMENTS, AND TPE IS GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS ARE HIGHLY DIFFERENTIATED, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN RELIABLE INFORMATION ON THE PRODUCTS AND PRICING PRACTICES OF OUR COMPETITORS. BESP REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICE OF A DELIVERABLE WOULD BE IF IT WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.  AS SUCH, BESP IS GENERALLY USED TO ALLOCATE THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION AT THE ARRANGEMENT INCEPTION. WE DETERMINE BESP FOR A PRODUCT BY CONSIDERING MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GEOGRAPHIES, CUSTOMER TYPES, INTERNAL COSTS, GROSS MARGIN OBJECTIVES AND PRICING PRACTICES.  PRODUCT WARRANTIES  WE OFFER PRODUCT WARRANTIES RANGING FROM 15 TO 39 MONTHS AGAINST ANY DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS. WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS OF DEFECTIVE PRODUCTS AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL WARRANTY EXPERIENCE AND RECENT TRENDS. WE MONITOR WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS AND MAY MAKE REVISIONS TO OUR WARRANTY RESERVE IF ACTUAL COSTS OF PRODUCT REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OR LOWER THAN ESTIMATED. ACCRUALS FOR ANTICIPATED FUTURE WARRANTY COSTS ARE CHARGED TO COST OF SALES AND INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WE ADJUST THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS AS A RESULT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OR CHANGES IN UNIT VOLUMES COMPARED WITH OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OR IF THE COST OF SERVICING WARRANTY CLAIMS IS GREATER OR LESSER THAN EXPECTED, AND WE ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES PROSPECTIVELY.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. INVENTORIES CONSIST OF PURCHASED PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS (PRINCIPALLY COMPONENTS), WORK IN PROCESS (PRINCIPALLY PRODUCTS BEING ASSEMBLED) AND FINISHED GOODS. MARKET VALUE REPRESENTS NET REALIZABLE VALUE FOR FINISHED GOODS AND WORK IN PROCESS AND REPLACEMENT VALUE FOR PURCHASED PARTS AND RAW MATERIALS. WE EVALUATE INVENTORY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS FOR LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AND EXCESS AND OBSOLESCENCE AND, AS NECESSARY, WRITE DOWN THE VALUATION OF UNITS BASED UPON USAGE AND SALES, ANTICIPATED SALES PRICE, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE AND OTHER FACTORS. ONCE A RESERVE IS ESTABLISHED, IT IS MAINTAINED UNTIL THE PRODUCT TO WHICH IT RELATES IS SOLD OR SCRAPPED.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE RECEIVE VARIOUS REBATE INCENTIVES FROM CERTAIN SUPPLIERS BASED ON OUR CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING VOLUME-BASED REBATES. THE REBATES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF INVENTORIES AND REDUCES THE COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE RELATED INVENTORY IS SOLD.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER AN ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REFLECT THE IMPACT OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND SUCH AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED FOR INCOME TAX REPORTING PURPOSES, NET OF OPERATING LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS AND OTHER TAX CREDITS MEASURED BY APPLYING ENACTED TAX LAWS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIODS. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE PROVIDED WHEN NECESSARY TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.  WE RECOGNIZE TAX LIABILITIES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS ON THE INCOME TAX RETURN BASED ON THE TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE FIRST STEP IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT EACH INCOME TAX POSITION WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AUDIT. THE SECOND STEP IS TO ESTIMATE AND MEASURE THE TAX BENEFIT AS THE AMOUNT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH THE TAX AUTHORITY. ESTIMATING THESE AMOUNTS REQUIRES US TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF VARIOUS POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. WE EVALUATE THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES, CHANGES IN APPLICABLE TAX LAW, SETTLEMENT OF ISSUES UNDER AUDIT AND NEW EXPOSURES. IF WE LATER DETERMINE THAT OUR EXPOSURE IS LOWER OR THAT THE LIABILITY IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR REVISED EXPECTATIONS, WE ADJUST THE LIABILITY AND EFFECT A RELATED CHARGE IN OUR TAX PROVISION DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE MEASURE AND RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED AWARDS MADE TO EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS AND NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (\"RSUS\"). WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE VALUE OF AWARDS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO VEST IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIODS. THE FAIR VALUE OF RSUS IS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND A SINGLE OPTION AWARD APPROACH. THIS MODEL REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE OPTION AND THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE FAIR VALUE IS THEN AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIODS OF THE AWARDS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD.  THE EXPECTED TERM REPRESENTS THE PERIOD THAT OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OUTSTANDING AND WAS DETERMINED BASED ON A COMBINATION OF OUR PEER GROUP AND OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF OUR IMPLIED AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IN ADDITION, FORFEITURES OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF GRANT AND REVISED, IF NECESSARY, IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. WE USE HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE PRE-VESTING OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT FORFEITURES AND RECORD STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ONLY FOR THOSE AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO VEST.  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  WE DETERMINE AT THE INCEPTION OF EACH ARRANGEMENT WHETHER AN ENTITY IN WHICH WE HOLD AN INVESTMENT OR IN WHICH WE HAVE OTHER VARIABLE INTERESTS IN IS CONSIDERED A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (\"VIE\"). WE CONSOLIDATE VIES WHEN WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF A VIE IS THE PARTY THAT MEETS BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA: (1) HAS THE POWER TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE VIE; AND (2) HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS THAT IN EITHER CASE COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. PERIODICALLY, WE ASSESS WHETHER ANY CHANGES IN THE INTEREST OR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE ENTITY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE ENTITY IS STILL A VIE AND, IF SO, WHETHER WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. IF WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IN A VIE, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE INVESTMENT UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OR COST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE GAAP.  WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT ABLECOM TECHNOLOGY, INC. (\"ABLECOM\") AND ITS AFFILIATE, COMPUWARE TECHNOLOGY, INC. (\"COMPUWARE\") ARE VIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE; HOWEVER, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY AS WE DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE ENTITIES AND THEREFORE, WE DO NOT CONSOLIDATE THESE ENTITIES. IN PERFORMING THIS ANALYSIS, OUR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED OUR EXPLICIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH ABLECOM AND COMPUWARE, INCLUDING THE SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL RELATED PARTY RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN US AND THESE TWO COMPANIES, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED WHETHER ANY IMPLICIT ARRANGEMENTS EXIST THAT WOULD CAUSE US TO PROTECT THOSE RELATED PARTIES\u2019 INTERESTS FROM SUFFERING LOSSES. MANAGEMENT DETERMINED THAT NO IMPLICIT ARRANGEMENTS EXIST WITH ABLECOM, COMPUWARE, OR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE AND ABLECOM JOINTLY ESTABLISHED SUPER MICRO ASIA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARK, INC. (THE \u201cMANAGEMENT COMPANY\u201d) IN TAIWAN TO MANAGE THE COMMON AREAS SHARED BY US AND ABLECOM FOR OUR SEPARATELY CONSTRUCTED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, EACH COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $0.2 MILLION AND OWNS 50% OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY IS A VIE, AND ALTHOUGH THE OPERATIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY ARE INDEPENDENT, THROUGH GOVERNANCE RIGHTS WE HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDED THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  2017  ,  2016  AND  2015  , THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH OUR ACCOUNTS, AND A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR ABLECOM\u2019S INTERESTS IN THE NET ASSETS AND OPERATIONS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMPANY. IN FISCAL YEARS  2017  ,  2016  AND  2015  ,  $(14,000)  ,  $20,000  AND  $(11,000)  OF NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO ABLECOM\u2019S INTEREST WAS INCLUDED IN OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, RESPECTIVELY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET SALES  NET SALES CONSIST OF SALES OF OUR SERVER SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING SERVER SYSTEMS AND RELATED SERVICES, SUBSYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES. THE MAIN FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR NET SALES ARE THE NUMBER OF COMPUTE NODES SOLD, THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES PER NODE FOR OUR SERVER SYSTEM SALES AND UNITS SHIPPED AND THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT FOR OUR SUBSYSTEM AND ACCESSORIES. THE PRICES FOR OUR SERVER SYSTEMS RANGE WIDELY DEPENDING UPON THE CONFIGURATION, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF COMPUTE NODES, AND THE PRICES FOR OUR SUBSYSTEMS AND ACCESSORIES VARY BASED ON THE TYPE. A COMPUTE NODE IS A HARDWARE CONFIGURATION HAVING ITS OWN CPU, RAM AND STORAGE AND THAT IS CAPABLE OF RUNNING ITS OWN INSTANCE OF A NON-VIRTUALIZED OPERATING SYSTEM. MEASURING VOLUME USING COMPUTE NODES ENABLES MORE CONSISTENT MEASUREMENT ACROSS DIFFERENT SERVER FORM FACTORS AND ACROSS DIFFERENT VENDORS. AS WITH MOST ELECTRONICS-BASED PRODUCTS, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES TYPICALLY ARE HIGHEST AT THE TIME OF INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT UTILIZE THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY AND TEND TO DECREASE OVER TIME AS SUCH PRODUCTS MATURE IN THE MARKET AND ARE REPLACED BY NEXT GENERATION PRODUCTS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS NET SALES BY PRODUCT TYPE FOR FISCAL YEARS  2017  ,  2016  AND  2015  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS).

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN SERVER SYSTEM SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER NODE FROM  $2,902  IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  TO  $3,118  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  . THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF OUR SERVER SYSTEMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES OF OUR COMPLETE SERVER SYSTEMS THAT OFFER HIGHER DENSITY COMPUTING AND MORE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE CAPACITY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN NET SALES OF OUR SUBSYSTEMS AND ACCESSORIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES OF SERVER ACCESSORIES TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS.  FISCAL YEAR  2016  COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  OF  $270.6 MILLION  IN OUR NET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR SERVER SYSTEMS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SALES OF SUBSYSTEMS.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN SERVER SYSTEM SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN APPROXIMATELY 15% INCREASE IN SERVER SYSTEM SHIPPING VOLUME AND AN INCREASE OF AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER NODE FROM  $2,661  IN FISCAL YEAR  2015  TO  $2,902  IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  . THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF OUR SERVER SYSTEMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES OF OUR COMPLETE SERVER  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS THAT OFFER HIGHER DENSITY COMPUTING AND MORE MEMORY AND HARD DRIVE CAPACITY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES OF OUR SUBSYSTEMS AND ACCESSORIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  WAS PRIMARILY DUE LOWER SALES OF HARD DRIVES AND MEMORY BUNDLED WITH OUR SERVER SOLUTIONS TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AS WE CONTINUED TO PROMOTE OUR SALES OF COMPLETE SERVER SYSTEMS TO OUR OEM AND DIRECT CUSTOMERS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE PERCENTAGES OF NET SALES FROM PRODUCTS SOLD TO DISTRIBUTORS AND OEMS AND DIRECT CUSTOMERS FOR FISCAL YEARS  2017  ,  2016  AND  2015  .

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES TO DIRECT AND OEM CUSTOMERS IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2016  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR COMPLETE SERVER SYSTEMS FROM CLOUD COMPUTING AND INTERNET DATA CENTER CUSTOMERS.  FISCAL YEAR  2016  COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LOWER SALES OF OUR SUBSYSTEM AND ACCESSORIES, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES TO DIRECT AND OEM CUSTOMERS IN FISCAL YEAR  2016  AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER SALES OF OUR COMPLETE SERVER SYSTEMS TO OUR CLOUD COMPUTING AND INTERNET DATA CENTER CUSTOMERS.

AS A RESULT, OUR UNITED STATES SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES DECREASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2016. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES IN ASIA AND EUROPE IN FISCAL 2017 AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2016 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES TO OUR CHANNEL PARTNERS IN CHINA, TAIWAN, JAPAN AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  FISCAL YEAR  2016  COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2015  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES IN THE UNITED STATES IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER SALES OF OUR SERVER SYSTEMS TO OUR CLOUD COMPUTING AND INTERNET DATA CENTER CUSTOMERS, WHICH SALES REPRESENT A HIGHER PORTION OF SALES IN THE UNITED STATES THAN IN OTHER REGIONS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES IN ASIA AND EUROPE IN FISCAL YEAR 2016 AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2015 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES GROWTH OF OUR SERVER SYSTEMS IN CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AS COMPARED TO OTHER REGIONS.  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF SALES PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF THE COSTS TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF MATERIALS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURING, SHIPPING, PERSONNEL AND RELATED EXPENSES INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, EQUIPMENT AND FACILITY EXPENSES, WARRANTY COSTS AND INVENTORY EXCESS AND OBSOLESCENCE PROVISIONS. THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR COST OF SALES ARE THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND COST OF MATERIALS, WHICH INCLUDE RAW MATERIAL COSTS, SHIPPING COSTS AND SALARY AND BENEFITS RELATED TO PRODUCTION. COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MAY INCREASE OVER TIME IF DECREASES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ARE NOT OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING DECREASES IN OUR COSTS. OUR COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO EFFICIENTLY UTILIZE OUR EXPANDING MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. BECAUSE WE GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE LONG-TERM FIXED SUPPLY AGREEMENTS, OUR COST OF SALES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE COST OF MATERIALS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT, OUR COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN ANY PERIOD CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT PRICE INCREASES RESULTING FROM COMPONENT SHORTAGES.  WE USE SEVERAL SUPPLIERS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE COMPONENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR SPECIFICATIONS, WITH MOST FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING PERFORMED AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. DURING FISCAL YEAR  2017  , WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE MANUFACTURING AND SERVICE OPERATIONS IN TAIWAN AND THE NETHERLANDS PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT OUR ASIAN AND EUROPEAN CUSTOMERS AND HAVE CONTINUED TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR UTILIZATION OF OUR OVERSEAS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. WE WORK WITH ABLECOM, ONE OF OUR KEY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND ALSO A RELATED PARTY TO OPTIMIZE MODULAR DESIGNS FOR OUR CHASSIS AND CERTAIN OF OTHER COMPONENTS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING CLOUD PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS, THAT ENABLE BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES TO COMMUNICATE FASTER AND SMARTER ACROSS VOICE, VIDEO MEETINGS, CHAT AND CONTACT CENTERS, TRANSFORMING BOTH EMPLOYEE AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCES WITH COMMUNICATIONS THAT WORK SIMPLY, INTEGRATE SEAMLESSLY, AND PERFORM RELIABLY. FROM ONE PROPRIETARY CLOUD TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, CUSTOMERS HAVE ACCESS TO UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, TEAM COLLABORATION, VIDEO CONFERENCING, CONTACT CENTER, DATA AND ANALYTICS AND OTHER SERVICES.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE SPREAD ACROSS MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES AND RANGE FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO LARGE ENTERPRISES WITH MORE THAN 10,000 EMPLOYEES. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON THE MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER SECTORS, AND IN FISCAL 2019, WE GENERATED A MAJORITY OF OUR NEW SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN THESE BUSINESS SECTORS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR SOFTWARE SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. THE REMAINDER OF OUR REVENUES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN COMPRISED OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE AND PRODUCT REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OFFICE PHONES AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. WE DEFINE A \u201cCUSTOMER\u201d AS ONE OR MORE LEGAL ENTITIES TO WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES PURSUANT TO A SINGLE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT. IN SOME CASES, WE MAY HAVE MULTIPLE BILLING RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SINGLE CUSTOMER (FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE WE ESTABLISH SEPARATE BILLING ACCOUNTS FOR A PARENT COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES).  HISTORICALLY, OUR FLAGSHIP SERVICES HAVE BEEN VIRTUAL OFFICE, A UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTION, AND VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER, A CONTACT CENTER SOLUTION.  IN 2018, WE BEGAN SELLING OUR 8X8 X SERIES SUITE OF SERVICES, WHICH CONSIST OF SERVICE PLANS DESIGNATED X1, X2, ETC., THROUGH X8. WITH 8X8 X SERIES, WE PROVIDE BOTH UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT CENTER FUNCTIONALITY FROM A SINGLE PLATFORM, WITH A SINGLE INTERFACE, IN THE HIGH-END SET OF OUR SERVICE PLANS (X5 THROUGH X8).  WE ALSO OFFER MORE BASIC, COST-EFFICIENT UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN X1 THROUGH X4. DURING THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NEARLY ALL OF OUR NEW CUSTOMERS PURCHASED SERVICE PLANS FOR 8X8 X SERIES, ALTHOUGH WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBED TO OUR VIRTUAL OFFICE AND VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER PLATFORMS.  WE HAVE BEGUN MIGRATING THESE CUSTOMERS FROM OUR LEGACY PLATFORMS TO 8X8 X SERIES, AND WE INTEND TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF MIGRATIONS DURING FISCAL YEARS 2020 AND 2021.  THESE MIGRATIONS WILL REQUIRE US TO INCUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COSTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, AND THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE IN CHURN.  RECLASSIFICATION  EFFECTIVE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED CERTAIN EXPENSES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  WE BELIEVE THESE CLASSIFICATIONS PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CLARITY AND INSIGHTS INTO THE COMPANY\u2019S GO-TO-MARKET, DEMAND GENERATION AND SALES EXECUTION ACTIVITIES, AND HOW THE TOTAL SALES AND MARKETING SPEND DRIVES REVENUE GENERATION, IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT STRATEGIC AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IMPACTING OUR CHANNEL, MARKETING AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. THESE CHANGES IN CLASSIFICATION ALSO ALIGN OUR EXTERNAL PRESENTATION OF OPERATING-RELATED EXPENSES WITH THE WAY THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (CODM) EXPECTS TO ASSESS SPEND AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION DECISIONS AROUND THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND MARKETING DEMAND  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERATION EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY. WE RECLASSIFIED THESE EXPENSES FOR THE PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE COMPARABLE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  THE RECLASSIFICATIONS DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT TO CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (LOSS), NET INCOME (LOSS) OR CASH FLOWS.  A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT ON THE VARIOUS LINE ITEMS OF OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COST OF REVENUES: CERTAIN EXPENSES FOR PROVIDING TRAINING TO CUSTOMERS, DEPLOYMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, CUSTOMER SUPPORT, AND RELATED EXPENSES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF REVENUES.  \u2022  SALES & MARKETING EXPENSES: CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHICH INCLUDES CUSTOMER DEPLOYMENT, TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND OTHER COSTS WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM SALES & MARKETING EXPENSE TO COST OF REVENUES, RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND/OR GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  \u2022  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES: CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO CUSTOMER DEPLOYMENTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING EXPENSES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  \u2022  GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES: CERTAIN PERSONNEL EXPENSES THAT SUPPORT BILLING AND COLLECTION EFFORTS AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS COSTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED IN SALES & MARKETING WERE RECLASSIFIED TO GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  ALSO BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO RECRUITING ACTIVITIES THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED ACROSS ALL DEPARTMENTS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE REPORTED IN GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  TABLES SHOWING THE RECLASSIFICATIONS AND FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE AFFECTED LINE ITEMS ARE SET FORTH BELOW UNDER NOTE 14 IN PART II, ITEM 8, NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK  OUR 2019 FISCAL YEAR WAS AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE YEAR FOR 8X8.  WE LAUNCHED 8X8 X SERIES, OUR SINGLE-TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM.  WE RE-ALIGNED OUR CHANNEL AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS TO SUPPORT A MORE SCALABLE, HIGH-GROWTH, GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY.   WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR BELIEF THAT OWNERSHIP OF THE CORE TECHNOLOGY BEHIND OUR PLATFORM IS AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATOR.  IN FISCAL 2019, OUR TOTAL SERVICE REVENUE GREW  19%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO  $334.4 MILLION  , ROUGHLY IN-LINE WITH OUR FISCAL 2018 GROWTH RATE. WE CONTINUED TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER (ARPU), WHICH GREW TO $498, COMPARED WITH $450 IN FISCAL  2018  , AS WE ARE SELLING MORE TO MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS. SERVICE REVENUE FROM MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS REPRESENTED 62% OF TOTAL SERVICE REVENUE AND GREW 30% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR. WE ALSO INCREASED THE NUMBER OF DEALS WHERE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE OUR INTEGRATED COMMUNICATIONS AND CONTACT CENTER SOLUTION, WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED TO AS BUNDLED DEALS.  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018, WE HAVE DE-EMPHASIZED PROFITABILITY AS A SHORT-TERM CORPORATE GOAL AND HAVE FOCUSED INSTEAD ON MAKING INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE GROWTH.  THIS DECISION WAS BASED, IN PART, ON OUR BELIEF THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET WAS AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE SHIFT OF BUSINESSES FROM LEGACY ON-PREMISE SOLUTIONS TO CLOUD SERVICES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY TREND WILL CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND.  ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IN THE COMPANY'S INTEREST TO CONTINUE TO INVEST HEAVILY IN OUR BUSINESS--IN PARTICULAR, TO BUILD OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FURTHER AND EXPAND OUR SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE CHANNEL--IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO SCALE EFFICIENTLY AND CAPTURE MARKET SHARE DURING THIS PHASE OF INDUSTRY DISRUPTION.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT UPFRONT INVESTMENTS IN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS, WHICH INCLUDES OUR SALES FORCE AND DIGITAL MARKETING SPEND. WE ALSO INTEND TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL TO MARKET TO SELL OUR SOLUTIONS. SHOULD THESE UPFRONT INVESTMENTS NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM NEW OR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, SEE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MAY 30, 2018.  WE HAVE MINIMAL SEASONALITY IN OUR BUSINESS, BUT TYPICALLY SALES OF NEW SUBSCRIPTIONS IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER ARE GREATER THAN IN ANY OF THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. WE BELIEVE THIS OCCURS BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS WE TARGET TEND TO SPEND A RELATIVELY GREATER PORTION OF THEIR ANNUAL CAPITAL BUDGETS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR YEAR COMPARED WITH EACH OF THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF THE YEAR.  REVENUE  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  YEAR-OVER-YEAR  2019  2018  CHANGE  (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  SERVICE REVENUE  $334,438  $280,430  $54,008  19.3%  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE  94.9%  94.6%  SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PROVISION OF OUR 8X8 CLOUD COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS, ALONG WITH REVENUES FROM PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.  THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR  2018  , WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR BUSINESS CUSTOMER SUBSCRIBER BASE (NET OF CUSTOMER CHURN), WITH THE LARGEST PART OF THE INCREASE COMING FROM OUR MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE OUR FASTEST GROWING CUSTOMER SECTOR, CONTRIBUTING TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER. OUR BUSINESS SERVICE SUBSCRIBER BASE GREW FROM APPROXIMATELY 49,000 CUSTOMERS AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018  TO APPROXIMATELY 52,000 CUSTOMERS ON  MARCH 31, 2019  . AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER FOR THE FISCAL YEAR INCREASED FROM $450 FOR FISCAL  2018  TO $498 FOR FISCAL  2019  . WE EXPECT THE NUMBER OF BUSINESS CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND AVERAGE MONTHLY SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN FISCAL  2020.  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  YEAR-OVER-YEAR  2019  2018  CHANGE  (DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  PRODUCT REVENUE  $18,148  $16,070  $2,078  12.9%  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE  5.1%  5.4%  PRODUCT REVENUE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF REVENUES FROM SALES OF IP TELEPHONES IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CLOUD TELEPHONY SERVICE. PRODUCT REVENUE IS DEPENDENT ON THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE AN IP TELEPHONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SERVICE INSTEAD OF USING THE SOLUTION ON THEIR CELL PHONE, COMPUTER OR OTHER COMPATIBLE DEVICE. WE EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO CONTINUE TO ADOPT OUR MOBILE AND DESKTOP SOLUTIONS IN THE FUTURE.  NO SINGLE CUSTOMER REPRESENTED MORE THAN 10% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES DURING FISCAL  2019  OR  2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES OUR REVENUES BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA. REVENUES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO COUNTRIES BASED ON THE DESTINATION OF SHIPMENT AND THE CUSTOMER'S SERVICE ADDRESS.

OTHER COSTS SUCH AS CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHICH INCLUDES DEPLOYMENT ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE.  THE INCREASE IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE FOR FISCAL  2019  FROM FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $5.5 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, A $4.7 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES, A $2.3 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, A $1.5 MILLION INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, A $1.4 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES, A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY NETWORK SERVICE EXPENSES (DUE TO INCREASED CALL VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GROWTH), AND A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN LICENSES AND FEES.  THE INCREASE IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE FOR FISCAL  2018  FROM FISCAL  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $7.0 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES, A $1.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THIRD-PARTY NETWORK SERVICE EXPENSES (DUE TO INCREASED CALL VOLUMES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE GROWTH), A $1.7 MILLION INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, A $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES, A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN LICENSES AND FEES, AND A $0.7 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.  WE EXPECT SERVICE GROSS MARGIN TO SLIGHTLY DECREASE FOR FISCAL  2020  AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO GROW SERVICE REVENUE.

THE INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR FISCAL  2019  FROM FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $20.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES FROM AN INCREASE IN OUR SALES FORCE, A $10.5 MILLION INCREASE IN ADVERTISING, A $5.3 MILLION INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, A $3.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CONSULTING AND OUTSIDE SERVICE EXPENSES AND A $3.0 MILLION INCREASE IN TRAVEL EXPENSES.

FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $66.3 MILLION  , MOSTLY RELATED TO THE RECORDING OF A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ESTABLISHED AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE RECORD DEFERRED TAXES BASED ON DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT BASIS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND AVAILABLE TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, IN DETERMINING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS. WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A SIGNIFICANT ITEM OF OBJECTIVE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED WAS THE HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE PRETAX LOSS REACHED IN FISCAL 2018. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"THE ACT\") THAT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, SIGNIFICANTLY REFORMED THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED. THE ACT CONTAINS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CORPORATE TAXATION, INCLUDING REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, LIMITATION OF THE TAX DEDUCTION FOR INTEREST EXPENSE TO 30% OF EARNINGS, LIMITATION OF THE DEDUCTION FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES TO 80% OF CURRENT YEAR TAXABLE INCOME AND ELIMINATION OF NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYBACKS, ONE TIME TAXATION OF OFFSHORE EARNINGS AT REDUCED RATES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY ARE REPATRIATED, ELIMINATION OF U.S. TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN IMPORTANT EXCEPTIONS), IMMEDIATE DEDUCTIONS FOR CERTAIN NEW INVESTMENTS INSTEAD OF DEDUCTIONS FOR DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER TIME, AND MODIFYING OR REPEALING MANY BUSINESS DEDUCTIONS AND CREDITS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE REMEASURED OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE RATES AT WHICH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS GENERALLY 21%. WE RECORDED NO ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY FOR OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OUR PRELIMINARY CALCULATIONS CONCLUDED WE DO NOT HAVE ANY UNTAXED FOREIGN ACCUMULATED EARNINGS.  WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. IN ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANNUAL PRE-TAX INCOME, PERMANENT TAX DIFFERENCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AND THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS. WE RECORD THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS, WHICH ARE UNUSUAL OR OCCUR INFREQUENTLY, IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, INCLUDING CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ABOUT DEFERRED TAX VALUATION  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALLOWANCES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFIT GENERATED IN CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, JURISDICTIONS WITH A YEAR-TO-DATE LOSS WHERE NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $346.5 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAD  $8.1 MILLION  IN DEPOSITS AS RESTRICTED CASH IN SUPPORT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT, SECURING A LEASE FOR A NEW FACILITY IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. BY COMPARISON, AT  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE HAD  $152.3 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS THE  $8.1 MILLION  IN DEPOSIT AS RESTRICTED CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND OUR ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $14.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $22.0 MILLION  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2018  . CASH USED IN OR PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN AFFECTED BY.  \u2022    THE AMOUNT OF NET INCOME OR LOSS;  \u2022    THE AMOUNT OF NON-CASH EXPENSE ITEMS SUCH AS DEFERRED INCOME TAX, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS;  \u2022    THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS; AND  \u2022    CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS FROM RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $10.9 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED WITH  $7.3 MILLION  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2018  . THE CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $51.2 MILLION  OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $9.1 MILLION  OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT INVESTMENTS AND CAPITALIZED INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $25.6 MILLION.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $249.2 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2019  , COMPARED WITH  $16.4 MILLION  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL  2018  .

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A 132-MONTH LEASE TO RENT APPROXIMATELY 162,000 SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE SPACE IN A NEW BUILDING IN SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA. THE LEASE TERM BEGAN ON JANUARY 1, 2019.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES & ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS SOME OF THE MORE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THESE POLICIES MAY INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY IN THEIR APPLICATION AND REPRESENT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE APPROPRIATE, ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. IF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS WERE TO PREVAIL, THE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR REPORTED RESULTS. THE IMPACT AND ANY ASSOCIATED RISKS RELATED TO THESE POLICIES ON OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS IS DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHERE SUCH POLICIES AFFECT OUR REPORTED AND EXPECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND EQUITY AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE SUCH ESTIMATES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE RELATED TO, REVENUE RECOGNITION, BAD DEBTS, RETURNS RESERVE FOR EXPECTED CANCELLATIONS, INCOME AND SALES TAX, AND LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND EQUITY THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING RISK FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES IS INCLUDED ABOVE UNDER PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS.\"  REVENUE RECOGNITION  OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES ARE ALSO DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AS DESCRIBED BELOW, SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MUST BE MADE AND USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN ANY ACCOUNTING PERIOD. MATERIAL DIFFERENCES MAY RESULT IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE FOR ANY PERIOD IF OUR MANAGEMENT MADE DIFFERENT JUDGMENTS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT ESTIMATES.  WE RECOGNIZE SERVICE REVENUE, MAINLY FROM SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES TO ITS CLOUD-BASED VOICE, CALL CENTER, VIDEO AND COLLABORATION SOLUTIONS USING THE FIVE-STEP MODEL AS PRESCRIBED BY ASU NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (ASC 606), AS AMENDED.

WE IDENTIFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AND RELATED USAGE, PRODUCT REVENUE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED SERVICES OR PRODUCTS TO THE CUSTOMER. THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN THE CONTRACT IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN AN AMOUNT THAT REPRESENTS THE RELATIVE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR SATISFYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED. REVENUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE TRANSACTION PRICE EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES SUCH AS SALES AND TELECOMMUNICATION TAXES, WHICH ARE COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES. WE USUALLY BILL OUR CUSTOMERS ON A MONTHLY BASIS. CONTRACTS TYPICALLY RANGE FROM ANNUAL TO MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS WITH PAYMENT TERMS OF NET 30 DAYS OR LESS. WE OCCASIONALLY ALLOW A 30-DAY PERIOD TO CANCEL A SUBSCRIPTION AND RETURN PRODUCTS SHIPPED FOR A FULL REFUND.  SERVICE REVENUE  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SERVICE REVENUE FROM SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR CLOUD-BASED TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME ON A RATABLE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACTUAL SUBSCRIPTION TERM BEGINNING ON THE DATE THAT THE PLATFORM IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER TILL THE END OF THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD. PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES BEING RENDERED ARE RECORDED AS A DEFERRED REVENUE. USAGE FEES, EITHER BUNDLED OR NOT BUNDLED, ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN WE HAVE A RIGHT TO INVOICE. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FOR CONFIGURATION, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, OPTIMIZATION, CUSTOMER TRAINING OR EDUCATION ARE PRIMARILY BILLED ON A FIXED-FEE BASIS AND ARE PERFORMED BY US DIRECTLY OR, ALTERNATIVELY, CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO PERFORM THESE SERVICES THEMSELVES OR ENGAGE THEIR OWN THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS. PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED. WHEN A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER IS SIGNED, WE ASSESS WHETHER COLLECTION OF THE FEES UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT IS PROBABLE. WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT TO RESERVE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS BASED ON THE AGING OF THE CONTRACT BALANCE, CURRENT AND HISTORICAL CUSTOMER TRENDS, AND COMMUNICATIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. THESE RESERVES ARE RECORDED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AGAINST THE CONTRACT ASSET (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE). IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE RECORD REVENUE REDUCTIONS FOR CUSTOMER CREDITS.  PRODUCT REVENUE  WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUE FOR TELEPHONY EQUIPMENT AT A POINT IN TIME, WHEN TRANSFER OF CONTROL HAS OCCURRED, WHICH IS GENERALLY UPON SHIPMENT. SALES RETURNS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE ESTIMATED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.  COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WE MUST MAKE ESTIMATES OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. MANAGEMENT SPECIFICALLY ANALYZES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING HISTORICAL BAD DEBTS, CUSTOMER CONCENTRATIONS, CUSTOMER CREDITWORTHINESS, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMER PAYMENT TERMS WHEN EVALUATING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS DETERIORATES, OUR ACTUAL LOSSES MAY EXCEED OUR ESTIMATES, AND ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES WOULD BE REQUIRED.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AND MORE OFTEN IF THERE IS AN INDICATOR OF IMPAIRMENT.  WE PERFORM AN ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST ON JANUARY 1 OF EACH YEAR AND DURING THE YEAR, WHENEVER A TRIGGERING EVENT FOR SUCH AN ASSESSMENT IS IDENTIFIED. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE CHANGED OUR PRODUCT AND MARKETING STRATEGY FOR THE USE OF DXI'S TECHNOLOGY AND RE-ASSESSED THE PROFITABILITY OUTLOOK WHICH TRIGGERED US TESTING THE RECORDED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. FIRST, WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR THREE REPORTING UNITS AT THE TIME USING THE MARKET APPROACH. UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE UTILIZED THE MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED SHARES AND COMPARABLE COMPANY INFORMATION TO DETERMINE REVENUE MULTIPLES WHICH WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THIS APPROACH, WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS AN INDICATION OF IMPAIRMENT ONLY FOR OUR DXI REPORTING UNIT IN THE UK AS THE CARRYING VALUE INCLUDING GOODWILL EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. AS LARGELY INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS COULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO ANY ASSETS INDIVIDUALLY WE EVALUATED DXI'S ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS ONE ASSET GROUP. THEN WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF DXI'S USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODS TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL AND ITS CARRYING VALUE WAS RECORDED AS IMPAIRMENT. THE OUTCOME OF THE ANALYSIS RESULTED IN A NON-CASH EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL OF $0.3 MILLION, $1.2 MILLION AND $8.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS RECORDED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD THREE REPORTING UNITS AND ALLOCATED GOODWILL TO THE REPORTING UNITS FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, WE DETERMINED WE HAD ONE REPORTING UNIT. THE CHANGE IN REPORTING UNITS RESULTED FROM THE FOLLOWING EVENTS.  \u2022  AS OF APRIL 1, 2018, THE COMPANY'S DXI OPERATIONS NO LONGER OPERATED ON A STAND ALONE BASIS AND WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING UNITED KINGDOM OPERATIONS, AND  \u2022  DURING THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY ASSESSED IT HAD ONLY ONE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, WHO REVIEWED FINANCIAL RESULTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE EARLY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2017-04,  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  . SEE NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INTERNAL - USE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ACCOUNT FOR COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350-40,  INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE  (ASC 350-40), WHICH REQUIRES CAPITALIZATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED DURING THE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT STAGE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE, WE BEGIN TO CAPITALIZE OUR COSTS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE WHEN PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, MANAGEMENT HAS AUTHORIZED AND COMMITTED PROJECT FUNDING, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED AS INTENDED. ONCE THE PROJECT HAS BEEN COMPLETED, THESE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE RELATED ASSET, GENERALLY ESTIMATED TO BE THREE YEARS. COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO MEETING THESE CRITERIA TOGETHER WITH COSTS INCURRED FOR TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND RECORDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  INCOME AND OTHER TAXES  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THIS PROCESS REQUIRES US TO ESTIMATE OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPENSE AND TO ASSESS TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM BOOK-TAX ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES FOR ITEMS SUCH AS ACCRUED VACATION. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE MUST THEN ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE NET OPERATING LOSS AND TAX CREDIT CARRY FORWARDS. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF TAXABLE INCOME BY JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND THE PERIOD OVER WHICH OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERABLE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, IN DETERMINING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS. WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IF, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. A SIGNIFICANT ITEM OF OBJECTIVE NEGATIVE EVIDENCE CONSIDERED WAS THE HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE PRETAX LOSS AS OF THE END OF OUR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS DURING THAT PERIOD. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. IN ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANNUAL PRE-TAX INCOME, PERMANENT TAX DIFFERENCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AND THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS. WE RECORD THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS, WHICH ARE UNUSUAL OR OCCUR INFREQUENTLY, IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, INCLUDING CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ABOUT DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFIT GENERATED IN CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, JURISDICTIONS WITH A YEAR-TO-DATE LOSS WHERE NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO SALES, USE AND UTILITY TAXES AND OTHER FEES IN MANY JURISDICTIONS. WE ASSESS, COLLECT AND REMIT THESE TAXES AND REPORT THEM TO MUNICIPAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS. WE REGULARLY RECEIVE INQUIRIES, DEMANDS OR AUDIT REQUESTS FROM THESE MUNICIPAL AND STATE TAX AGENCIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH, 31, 2019, WE DETERMINED THAT ADDITIONAL SALES TAXES WERE PROBABLE OF BEING ASSESSED AND ESTIMABLE IN MULTIPLE STATES AS A RESULT OF FINDINGS FROM SALES AND USE TAX AUDITS. AS OF MARCH 31. 2019 WE ESTIMATED THIS INCREMENTAL SALES TAX LIABILITY TO BE $8.0 MILLION.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, AND RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE STOCK UNITS GRANTED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 718 -  STOCK COMPENSATION  . UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 718, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD, AND IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEE'S REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD (GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE EQUITY GRANT), NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES.  COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD AND INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES.  TO VALUE OPTION GRANTS UNDER THE EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, WE USED THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR BUSINESS  HAEMONETICS IS A GLOBAL HEALTHCARE COMPANY DEDICATED TO PROVIDING A SUITE OF INNOVATIVE HEMATOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS TO CUSTOMERS TO HELP IMPROVE PATIENT CARE AND REDUCE THE COST OF HEALTHCARE. OUR TECHNOLOGY ADDRESSES IMPORTANT MEDICAL MARKETS INCLUDING BLOOD AND PLASMA COMPONENT COLLECTION, THE SURGICAL SUITE, AND HOSPITAL TRANSFUSION SERVICES. WHEN USED IN THIS REPORT, THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cTHE COMPANY\u201d MEAN HAEMONETICS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE ORGANIZED INTO THREE CATEGORIES FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING AND DEVELOPING THEIR GROWTH POTENTIAL: PLASMA, BLOOD CENTER AND HOSPITAL. FOR THAT PURPOSE, \u201cPLASMA\u201d INCLUDES PLASMA COLLECTION DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES, PLASMA DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE, AND ANTICOAGULANT AND SALINE SOLD TO PLASMA CUSTOMERS. \u201cBLOOD CENTER\u201d INCLUDES BLOOD COLLECTION AND PROCESSING DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES FOR RED CELLS, PLATELETS AND WHOLE BLOOD AS WELL AS RELATED DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. \"HOSPITAL\", WHICH IS COMPRISED OF HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT AND CELL PROCESSING PRODUCTS, INCLUDES DEVICES AND METHODOLOGIES FOR MEASURING COAGULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF BLOOD, SURGICAL BLOOD SALVAGE SYSTEMS, SPECIALIZED BLOOD CELL PROCESSING SYSTEMS, DISPOSABLES AND BLOOD TRANSFUSION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE.  WE BELIEVE THAT PLASMA AND HOSPITAL HAVE GROWTH POTENTIAL, WHILE BLOOD CENTER COMPETES IN CHALLENGING MARKETS WHICH REQUIRE US TO MANAGE THE BUSINESS DIFFERENTLY, INCLUDING REDUCING COSTS, SHRINKING THE SCOPE OF THE CURRENT PRODUCT LINE, AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES TO EXIT UNFAVORABLE CUSTOMER CONTRACTS.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  DIVESTITURE  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL PLASMA INC. (\u201cCSL\u201d) SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY AND CSL ASSUMED CERTAIN RELATED LIABILITIES PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF A SETTLEMENT, RELEASE AND ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES DATED MAY 13, 2019. AT THE CLOSING, WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION OF PROCEEDS AND WERE CONCURRENTLY RELEASED FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS UNDER A 2014 SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH CSL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING THE ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO OUR SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS. WE EXPECT THAT COST SAVINGS GENERATED FROM THE ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE RELEASE FROM OUR LIQUID SOLUTIONS SUPPLY OBLIGATIONS, WILL BE REALLOCATED TO GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF APPROXIMATELY $49 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  IN MAY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $500 MILLION OF HAEMONETICS COMMON SHARES OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS. THIS NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL HELP TO OFFSET THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF RECENT AND FUTURE EMPLOYEE EQUITY GRANTS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE AT MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCRETION WITH THE INTENT OF BEGINNING ACTIVITY UNDER THE PROGRAM DURING FISCAL 2020.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $260 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH MARCH 30, 2019. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD UTILIZED THE FULL $260 MILLION SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION TOTAL SHARES REPURCHASED AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $86.58 PER SHARE.  TEG 6S TRAUMA INDICATION  IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS.  NEXSYS PCS  \u00ae  AND NEXLYNK DMS  TM  IN FISCAL 2018, WE RECEIVED FDA 510(K) CLEARANCE FOR OUR NEXSYS PCS  PLASMAPHERESIS SYSTEM, INCLUDING OUR EMBEDDED SOFTWARE THAT ACTIVATES YES  TM  TECHNOLOGY, A YIELD-ENHANCING SOLUTION. WE EXPECT TO PURSUE FURTHER REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OVERALL PRODUCT OFFERING.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR PLANNED ROLL OUT OF THIS NEW PLATFORM INCLUDES THE PLACEMENT OF A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW DEVICES. SUCH PLACEMENTS WILL REQUIRE MEANINGFUL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NEW CUSTOMER CONTRACTS THAT REFLECT PRICING AND VOLUMES APPROPRIATE TO THESE INVESTMENTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEVERAL LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS FOR NEXSYS PCS DEVICES AND NEXLYNK DMS DONOR MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE AND ARE SEEKING ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS FROM OUR OTHER PLASMA CUSTOMERS.  RELOCATION OF CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A LEASE FOR OFFICE SPACE IN BOSTON, MA THAT WILL SERVE AS OUR NEW CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND REPLACE OUR EXISTING LOCATION IN BRAINTREE, MA. WE BELIEVE OUR MOVE TO BOSTON, WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WILL ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY TALENT AND PROVIDE A DYNAMIC SPACE TO ENGAGE OUR EMPLOYEES.  DEBT ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENT  ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH CERTAIN LENDERS WHICH PROVIDED FOR A $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN (THE \"TERM LOAN\") AND A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING LOAN (THE \"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\" AND TOGETHER WITH THE TERM LOAN, THE \"CREDIT FACILITIES\"). A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF $347.8 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DOWN THE $253.7 MILLION REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014. THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. ON AUGUST 21, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT $241.9 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES FROM A VARIABLE RATE TO A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST.  LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT  AS PART OF OUR ACQUISITION OF THE WHOLE BLOOD BUSINESS FROM PALL CORPORATION (\u201cPALL\u201d) IN FISCAL 2012, PALL AGREED TO MANUFACTURE AND INSTALL IN ONE OF OUR FACILITIES A FILTER MEDIA MANUFACTURING LINE (THE \u201cHDC LINE\u201d) FOR WHICH WE AGREED TO PAY PALL APPROXIMATELY $15.0 MILLION (PLUS PRE-APPROVED OVERAGES). PALL ALSO AGREED TO SUPPLY MEDIA TO US FOR USE IN LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WE ACCEPTED THE HDC LINE.  IN MAY 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH PALL UNDER WHICH PALL WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY MEDIA TO US FOR USE IN LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS. AS A CONDITION OF THE SUPPLY AGREEMENT, WE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE HDC LINE AND TO MAKE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $9.0 MILLION TO PALL FOR THE HDC LINE.  AS A RESULT OF THE DECISION TO CONTINUE TO SOURCE MEDIA FOR OUR LEUKOREDUCTION FILTERS FROM PALL RATHER THAN PRODUCING THEM INTERNALLY, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO UTILIZE THE HDC LINE FOR FUTURE PRODUCTION AND EXPECT THAT THE ASSET\u2019S FUTURE CASH FLOWS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER ITS CARRYING VALUE OF $19.8 MILLION. ACCORDINGLY, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $19.8 MILLION FOR THE HDC LINE.  PRODUCT RECALLS  IN MARCH 2018, WE ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL OF SPECIFIC LOTS OF OUR ACRODOSE  TM  PLUS AND PL SYSTEMS SOLD TO OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. THE RECALL RESULTED FROM REPORTS OF LOW PH READINGS FOR PLATELETS STORED IN THE CLX HP BAG AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, AN ACCOMPANYING YELLOW DISCOLORATION OF THE STORAGE BAG. FOR A PERIOD OF NINE WEEKS, WE WERE UNABLE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH OUR ACRODOSE PLUS AND PL SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF THE RECALL, OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE DISCARDED COLLECTED PLATELETS AND INCURRED OTHER DAMAGES. DURING  FISCAL 2019  WE ENTERED INTO SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS RESPONSIBLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AGAINST US. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED CUMULATIVE CHARGES OF $2.2 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL WHICH CONSISTS OF $1.3 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER RETURNS AND INVENTORY RESERVES AND $0.9 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER CLAIMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN PAID AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ISSUED A VOLUNTARY RECALL OF CERTAIN WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION KITS SOLD TO OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S. THE RECALL RESULTED FROM SOME COLLECTION SETS' FILTERS FAILING TO ADEQUATELY REMOVE LEUKOCYTES FROM COLLECTED BLOOD. AS A RESULT OF THE RECALL, OUR BLOOD CENTER CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE CONDUCTED TESTS TO CONFIRM THAT THE COLLECTED BLOOD WAS ADEQUATELY LEUKOREDUCED, SOLD THE COLLECTED BLOOD LABELED AS NON-LEUKOREDUCED AT A LOWER PRICE OR DISCARDED THE COLLECTED BLOOD. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED CUMULATIVE CHARGES OF $1.9 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL WHICH CONSISTS OF $0.1 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER RETURNS AND INVENTORY RESERVES AND $1.8 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER CLAIMS. WE MAY RECORD INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR CUSTOMER CLAIMS IN FUTURE PERIODS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RECALL.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE  IN FISCAL 2018, WE LAUNCHED A COMPLEXITY REDUCTION INITIATIVE (THE \"2018 PROGRAM\"), A COMPANY-WIDE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE COST, FREEING UP RESOURCES TO INVEST IN ACCELERATED GROWTH. THIS PROGRAM INCLUDES A REDUCTION OF HEADCOUNT AND OPERATING COSTS TO ENABLE A MORE STREAMLINED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WE EXPECT TO INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $60 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ACTIONS, OF WHICH WE EXPECT $35 MILLION TO $40 MILLION WILL CONSIST OF SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS AND THE REMAINDER WILL CONSIST OF OTHER EXIT COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THIRD PARTY SERVICES. THESE CHARGES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTLAYS, WILL BE INCURRED AS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE ON THESE INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH FISCAL 2020. WE EXPECT SAVINGS FROM THIS PROGRAM OF APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS ONCE THE PROGRAM IS COMPLETED. DURING THE  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE INCURRED  $13.7 MILLION  AND  $36.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  MARKET TRENDS  PLASMA MARKET  THERE ARE TWO KEY ASPECTS TO THE MARKET FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS - THE GROWTH IN DEMAND FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES IN THIS MARKET.  CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS, PARTICULARLY IMMUNOGLOBULIN, ARE THE KEY DRIVER OF PLASMA COLLECTION VOLUMES IN THE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL MARKET. VARIOUS FACTORS RELATED TO THE SUPPLY OF PLASMA AND THE PRODUCTION OF PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS ALSO AFFECT COLLECTION VOLUME, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES ARE SEEKING MORE YIELD FROM THE COLLECTED PLASMA TO MEET GROWING DEMAND FOR BIOPHARMACEUTICALS WITHOUT REQUIRING AN EQUIVALENT INCREASE IN PLASMA SUPPLY.  \u2022  NEWLY APPROVED INDICATIONS FOR AUTO-IMMUNE DISEASES TREATED WITH PLASMA-DERIVED THERAPIES; THE GROWING UNDERSTANDING AND DIAGNOSIS OF THESE DISEASES; LONGER LIFESPANS AND A GROWING AGING PATIENT POPULATION INCREASE THE DEMAND FOR PLASMA.  \u2022  GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF BIOPHARMACEUTICALS ALSO INCREASES DEMAND FOR PLASMA.  DEMAND FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS IN  FISCAL 2019  CONTINUED TO GROW IN NORTH AMERICA AS COLLECTION VOLUMES BENEFITED FROM AN EXPANDING END USER MARKET FOR PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS WITH U.S. PRODUCED PLASMA MEETING AN INCREASING PERCENTAGE OF PLASMA VOLUME DEMAND WORLDWIDE. AS A RESULT, OUR PLASMA BUSINESS\u2019 REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY FROM THE U.S.  DESPITE THE OVERALL GROWTH IN THE MARKET, THE NUMBER OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT COLLECT AND FRACTIONATE THE MAJORITY OF SOURCE PLASMA IS LOW AND INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IS ONGOING. SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY EXIST FOR NEW ENTRANTS DUE TO HIGH CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUIREMENTS FOR FRACTIONATION, LONG REGULATORY PATHWAYS TO THE LICENSING OF COLLECTION CENTERS AND FRACTIONATION FACILITIES AND APPROVAL OF PLASMA-DERIVED BIOPHARMACEUTICALS. WITH THESE FACTORS, WE DO NOT EXPECT MEANINGFUL NEW ENTRIES OR DIVERSIFICATION. AS A RESULT, THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW CUSTOMERS FOR OUR PLASMA PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE U.S. WHERE 80% OF SOURCE PLASMA IS COLLECTED AND ONLY A FEW CUSTOMERS PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF OUR PLASMA REVENUE.  BLOOD CENTER MARKET  IN THE BLOOD CENTER MARKET, WE SELL AUTOMATED BLOOD COMPONENT AND MANUAL WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE BLOOD DRIVE PLANNING, DONOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, BLOOD COLLECTION, COMPONENT MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION. WHILE WE SELL PRODUCTS AROUND THE WORLD, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES ARE TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS DUE TO RELATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF BLOOD COLLECTORS.  WITHIN THE BLOOD CENTER MARKET, WE HAVE SEEN THREE TRENDS THAT HAVE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR GROWTH OF THE OVERALL MARKETPLACE DESPITE THE OVERALL INCREASE IN AGING POPULATIONS. OVERALL WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT A DECLINE IN THIS BUSINESS IN THE LOW TO MID SINGLE-DIGITS.  \u2022  DECLINING TRANSFUSION RATES IN MATURE MARKETS DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES WITH LOWER ASSOCIATED BLOOD LOSS, AS WELL AS BETTER BLOOD MANAGEMENT.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  COMPETITION IN MULTI-UNIT COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY FOR AUTOMATED BLOOD COMPONENT COLLECTION SYSTEMS HAS INTENSIFIED AND HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SALES IN MARKETS WHERE THESE COLLECTIONS ARE PREVALENT.  \u25aa  INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION THROUGH GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS HAS INTENSIFIED PRICING COMPETITION PARTICULARLY IN THE MANUAL WHOLE BLOOD COLLECTION SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS IMPACTING OUR SOFTWARE BUSINESS WHERE SWITCHING LARGE CUSTOMERS TO NEW OR EMERGING TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH COST.  HOSPITAL MARKET  HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT  HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT MARKET -  THE USE OF ROUTINE COAGULATION TESTING IS WELL ESTABLISHED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD IN VARIOUS MEDICAL PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY, ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION, TRAUMA, POST-PARTUM HEMORRHAGE AND PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION. WHILE STANDARD TESTS LIKE PROTHROMBIN TIME, PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME AND PLATELET COUNT HAVE LIMITED ABILITY TO REVEAL A PATIENT\u2019S RISK FOR BLEEDING, THEY DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE PATIENT\u2019S RISK FOR THROMBOSIS. IN ADDITION, THESE ROUTINE TESTS DO NOT PROVIDE SPECIFIC DATA ABOUT CLOT QUALITY OR STABILITY. AS A RESULT OF THESE LIMITATIONS, CLINICIANS ARE INCREASINGLY UTILIZING ADVANCED HEMOSTASIS TESTING TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT A PATIENT\u2019S HEMOSTASIS STATUS, RESULTING IN IMPROVED CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING. IN ADDITION, ADVANCED HEMOSTASIS TESTING SUPPORTS HOSPITAL EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE RISKS, COMPLICATIONS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNNECESSARY BLOOD COMPONENT TRANSFUSIONS.  HAEMONETICS\u2019 TEG  \u00ae  HEMOSTASIS ANALYZER SYSTEMS ARE ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS THAT PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF A PATIENT\u2019S OVERALL HEMOSTASIS. THIS INFORMATION ENABLES CLINICIANS TO DECIDE THE MOST APPROPRIATE CLINICAL TREATMENT FOR THE PATIENT TO MINIMIZE BLOOD LOSS AND REDUCE CLOTTING RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, TEG ANALYZERS HAVE BEEN USED TO SUPPORT CLINICAL DECISION MAKING IN OPEN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION, BECOMING THE \u201cGOLD STANDARD\u201d IN LIVER TRANSPLANTS. IN MORE RECENT YEARS, INTEREST HAS GROWN INTO THE UTILIZATION OF TEG IN TRAUMA AND OTHER PROCEDURES IN WHICH THE RISK OF HEMORRHAGE AND THROMBOSIS ARE HIGH.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, TEG SYSTEMS HAVE ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST MARKET PENETRATION IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND CHINA. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THESE AS WELL AS OTHER MARKETS, AS TEG SYSTEMS BECOME MORE ESTABLISHED AS THE STANDARD OF CARE AROUND THE WORLD.  CELL PROCESSING  CELL SALVAGE MARKET -  IN RECENT YEARS, MORE EFFICIENT BLOOD USE AND LESS INVASIVE SURGERIES HAVE REDUCED DEMAND FOR AUTOTRANSFUSION IN THESE PROCEDURES AND CONTRIBUTED TO INTENSE COMPETITION IN MATURE MARKETS, WHILE INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES HAS PROVIDED NEW MARKETS AND SOURCES OF GROWTH.  ORTHOPEDIC PROCEDURES HAVE SEEN SIMILAR CHANGES WITH IMPROVED BLOOD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, INCLUDING THE USE OF TRANEXAMIC ACID TO TREAT AND PREVENT POST-OPERATIVE BLEEDING, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TRANSFUSIONS AND AUTOTRANSFUSION.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE CELL SAVER  \u00ae  HAS ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST MARKET PENETRATION IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND JAPAN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CONSIDERABLE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN CERTAIN ASIA PACIFIC AND OTHER EMERGING MARKETS AS ADDRESSABLE PROCEDURE VOLUMES GROW AND THE USE OF AUTOTRANSFUSION IS BECOMING ACCEPTED AS A STANDARD OF CARE.  TRANSFUSION MANAGEMENT MARKET -  REVENUES FROM BLOODTRACK  \u00ae  HAVE INCREASED IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE RECENTLY AS HOSPITALS SEEK MEANS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCIES AND MEET COMPLIANCE GUIDELINES FOR TRACKING AND DISPOSITIONING BLOOD COMPONENTS TO PATIENTS.

NET REVENUES FOR  FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  7.0%  COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AS REVENUE INCREASES IN PLASMA AND HOSPITAL WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN OUR BLOOD CENTER BUSINESS UNIT.  NET REVENUES FOR FISCAL  2018  INCREASED  2.0%  COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, NET REVENUES INCREASED 1.1% COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  AS REVENUE INCREASES IN PLASMA AND HOSPITAL WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN BLOOD CENTER.  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED DURING FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE VOLUMES, FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX, LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS AND ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HDC LINE, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION RELATED TO PCS  \u00ae  2 DEVICES, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS DRIVEN BY REVENUE VOLUME GROWTH AND RISING FUEL COSTS AND CARRIER FEES AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR PLASMA AND HOSPITAL BUSINESS UNITS.  WE RECORDED OPERATING INCOME DURING FISCAL  2018  , AS COMPARED WITH AN OPERATING LOSS DURING FISCAL  2017  . OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2017  , AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT. THIS OPERATING INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SALES AND MARKETING PRIMARILY IN OUR HOSPITAL AND PLASMA BUSINESS UNITS.  MANAGEMENT'S USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"U.S. GAAP\"), TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, MAKE INFORMED BUSINESS DECISIONS, ESTABLISH BUDGETS AND FORECAST FUTURE RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SUPPLEMENTAL TO, AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, MEASURES THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS USING A CONSTANT CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE.

HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE WAS $87.6 MILLION, $75.5 MILLION AND $66.1 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 16.0% DURING FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 16.1% DURING FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 14.2% DURING FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017. WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 13.6% DURING FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PLASMA  PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED  15.1%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED  14.8%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN VOLUME OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. AND FAVORABLE NEXSYS PCS PRICING DURING  FISCAL 2019  . INCREASES IN SALES OF LIQUID SOLUTIONS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH DURING  FISCAL 2019  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING THE ASSET TRANSFER AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO OUR SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.  PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED 6.1% DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED 5.5% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SALES OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES AND SOFTWARE DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN LIQUID SOLUTIONS REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EQUIPMENT REVENUE RESULTING FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE, WHICH CONTRIBUTED $6.5 MILLION IN PLASMA REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2017.  BLOOD CENTER  BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DECREASED  5.5%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THERE WAS NO FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACT ON BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER WHOLE BLOOD REVENUE DUE TO CONTINUED MARKET DECLINES, THE STRATEGIC EXIT OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS, PRODUCTS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING UNFAVORABLE ORDER TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THESE EXITS, AS WELL AS PRODUCT RECALLS. DECLINES IN SOFTWARE REVENUE IN THE U.S AND PLATELET REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED SHIFT TOWARD DOUBLE DOSE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES IN JAPAN ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE.  BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DECREASED  6.2%  DURING  FISCAL 2018  COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, BLOOD CENTER REVENUE DECREASED  7.5%  DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN WHOLE BLOOD REVENUE IN BOTH EUROPE AND THE U.S. RESULTING FROM CONTINUED MODERATION IN THE RATE OF COLLECTIONS AND DECLINES IN PLATELET REVENUE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED MARKET SHIFT TOWARD DOUBLE DOSE COLLECTION TECHNIQUES IN JAPAN, AS WELL AS DECREASED SALES IN EUROPE. DECREASES IN EQUIPMENT REVENUE DUE TO A ONE-TIME SALE OF EQUIPMENT TO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND DECLINES IN RED CELL REVENUE DUE TO THE LOSS OF A CUSTOMER CONTRACT IN A PRIOR YEAR ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL DECREASE IN BLOOD CENTER.  HOSPITAL  HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.4%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.3%  DURING  FISCAL 2019.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH OF DISPOSABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TEG  \u00ae  DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE U.S. AND CHINA. THE TEG 6S SYSTEM AND TEG MANAGER  \u00ae  SOFTWARE ARE APPROVED FOR THE SAME SET OF INDICATIONS AS THE TEG 5000 SYSTEM IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA AND JAPAN. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE A BROADER SET OF INDICATIONS FOR TEG 6S IN THE U.S. IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS. THE INCREASE DURING  FISCAL 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN ORTHOPAT  \u00ae  REVENUE DUE TO BETTER BLOOD MANAGEMENT WHICH HAS REDUCED ORTHOPEDIC BLOOD LOSS. WE DISCONTINUED THE SALE OF OUR ORTHOPAT PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2019. WE OFFER THE CELL SAVER ELITE + AS AN ALTERNATIVE AUTOTRANSFUSION SYSTEM FOR ORTHOPEDICS OR OTHER MEDIUM TO LOW BLOOD LOSS PROCEDURES.  HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  6.7%  DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  5.4%  DURING  FISCAL 2018.  THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH OF DISPOSABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TEG  \u00ae  DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE U.S. AND CHINA. GROWTH IN BLOODTRACK REVENUE IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN ORTHOPAT  \u00ae  REVENUE DUE TO BETTER BLOOD MANAGEMENT WHICH HAS REDUCED ORTHOPEDIC BLOOD LOSS.

GROSS PROFIT MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED BY  240  BASIS POINTS FOR  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THE DECREASE IN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY DUE TO PLASMA DEVICES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HDC LINE. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE PRICE AND VOLUME MIX AS WELL AS SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 8.8% DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 6.4% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . GROSS PROFIT MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED BY 290 BASIS POINTS FOR  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . THE INCREASE IN THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING  FISCAL 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED MANUFACTURING CHALLENGES, THE IMPACT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF SEBRA AND INCREASED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, INVENTORY CHARGES AND THE WHOLE BLOOD FILTER RECALL ON THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.

WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED  8.4%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THE DECREASE IN  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES IN CLINICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY IN OUR HOSPITAL BUSINESS UNIT, AS WELL AS CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN OUR PLASMA BUSINESS UNIT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED 4.5% DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCREASED 5.5% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN  FISCAL 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT OF RESOURCES IN CLINICAL PROGRAMS, PRIMARILY IN HOSPITAL. THESE INCREASED COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SPENDING ON CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROJECTS AND SEVERAL PROJECTS IN BLOOD CENTER TO BETTER ALIGN WITH OUR LONG-TERM PRODUCT PLANS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED  5.8%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED  5.6%  DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THE DECREASE IN  FISCAL 2019  WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS AND ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS WITHIN OUR PLASMA AND HOSPITAL BUSINESS UNITS, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS DRIVEN BY REVENUE VOLUME GROWTH AND RISING FUEL COSTS AND CARRIER FEES AND AN INCREASE IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 4.9% DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 4.4% DURING  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN  FISCAL 2018  WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM, AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN HOSPITAL AND NEXT GENERATION PLASMA COLLECTION AND SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, AND AN INCREASE IN VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ANNUALIZED SAVINGS AS A RESULT OF THE PRIOR YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET, INCREASED  5.4 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE TERM LOAN BALANCE AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING FOR THE  FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY  3.8%.  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET, DECREASED  44.1%  DURING  FISCAL 2018  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  DUE TO A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR TERM LOAN AND A REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT LINE.  INCOME TAXES  FISCAL YEAR  2019  2018  2017% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  19 VS. 18% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  18 VS. 17  REPORTED INCOME TAX RATE  25.3%  23.6%  4.4%  1.7%  19.2%  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REPORTED TAX RATE  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES. OUR REPORTED TAX RATE IS IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AS THE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE TAX RATES THAT DIFFER FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE.  WE HAVE ASSESSED, ON A JURISDICTIONAL BASIS, THE AVAILABLE MEANS OF RECOVERING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING THE ABILITY TO CARRY-BACK NET OPERATING LOSSES, THE EXISTENCE OF REVERSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, THE AVAILABILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND AVAILABLE SOURCES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN U.S. STATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT ARE NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT REALIZABLE AND MAINTAINS A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE RECORDED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $18.6 MILLION ON OUR WORLDWIDE PRE-TAX INCOME OF $73.6 MILLION, RESULTING IN A REPORTED TAX RATE OF 25.3%. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  IS HIGHER THAN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES OF 23.6% AND 4.4% FOR THE YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  AND  APRIL 1, 2017  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR INCREASE IN TAX RATE FOR  FISCAL 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  , IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. TAX REFORM PROVISIONS THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN  FISCAL 2019  , INCLUDING GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXCESS STOCK COMPENSATION BENEFITS. THE  FISCAL 2018  RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE  FISCAL 2017  TAX RATE DUE TO THE IMPACT OF U.S. TAX REFORM (TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS) CHANGES IN THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS AND THE IMPACT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS IN  FISCAL 2017.  INCOME TAX REFORM  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \"ACT\") WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, REQUIRED COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED AND CREATED NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCED EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED GUIDANCE UNDER STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT THAT DIRECTED TAXPAYERS TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. LEGISLATION AS \u201cPROVISIONAL\u201d WHEN IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION AVAILABLE, PREPARED OR ANALYZED (INCLUDING COMPUTATIONS) IN REASONABLE DETAIL TO COMPLETE ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CHANGE IN TAX LAW.  DURING  FISCAL 2018  WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AMOUNT OF $2.0 MILLION AS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS). DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT. WE RECOGNIZED A $0.4 MILLION ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISIONAL TAX EXPENSE RECORDED IN  FISCAL 2018.  WE HAVE INCORPORATED THE OTHER IMPACTS OF THE ACT THAT BECAME EFFECTIVE IN  FISCAL 2019  IN THE CALCULATION OF THE TAX PROVISION AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d), FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME (\u201cFDII\u201d), BASE EROSION ANTI ABUSE TAX (\u201cBEAT\u201d), AS WELL AS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH LIMIT TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXPENSES. FOR  FISCAL 2019  , THE GILTI PROVISIONS HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO US. UNDER THE NEW LAW, U.S. TAXES ARE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPOSED ON FOREIGN INCOME IN EXCESS OF A DEEMED RETURN ON TANGIBLE ASSETS OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE ABILITY TO BENEFIT A DEDUCTION AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AGAINST A PORTION OF THE GILTI INCOME MAY BE LIMITED UNDER THE GILTI RULES AS A RESULT OF THE UTILIZATION OF NET OPERATING LOSSES, FOREIGN SOURCED INCOME, AND OTHER POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS WITHIN THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CALCULATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE BELIEVE DEPICT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW POSITION.

DURING FISCAL 2018, WE LAUNCHED THE 2018 PROGRAM, A RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE. DURING  FISCAL 2019  AND 2018, WE INCURRED  $13.7 MILLION  AND  $36.6 MILLION  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE LAUNCHED A MULTI-YEAR RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE (THE \"2017 PROGRAM\") DESIGNED TO REPOSITION OUR ORGANIZATION AND IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE. WE DID NOT INCUR ANY ADDITIONAL CHARGES UNDER THIS PROGRAM DURING  FISCAL 2019  . DURING FISCAL 2018, WE INCURRED  $7.2 MILLION  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND CHARGES UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019  , CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2017 PROGRAM ARE COMPLETE.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. WE BELIEVE THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR EXPECTED CASH OUTLAYS RELATE PRIMARILY TO INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION OF THE NEXSYS PCS AND PLASMA PLANT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT, RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND INITIATIVES AND ACQUISITIONS. THESE ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  BELOW.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $169.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS HELD IN THE U.S. OR IN COUNTRIES FROM WHICH IT CAN BE FREELY REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED FOR A $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE CREDIT FACILITIES EXPIRE ON JUNE 15, 2023. INTEREST ON THE CREDIT FACILITIES IS ESTABLISHED USING LIBOR PLUS 1.13% - 1.75%, DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY NON-FINANCIAL AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS. A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS OF $347.8 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DOWN THE $253.7 REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014. THE REMAINDER OF THE PROCEEDS ARE BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AT  MARCH 30, 2019  ,  $336.9 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND  $15.0 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BOTH, WITH AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF  3.8%  . WE ALSO HAD  $25.1 MILLION  OF UNCOMMITTED OPERATING LINES OF CREDIT TO FUND OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS UNDER WHICH THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , WE PAID $13.1 MILLION IN SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS FOR THE TERM LOAN. WE HAVE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $336.9 MILLION  REQUIRED THROUGH FISCAL 2024. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER BANK COVENANTS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOW OVERVIEW  FISCAL YEAR  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  19 VS. 18% INCREASE/(DECREASE)  18 VS. 17  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE HAVE ELIMINATED THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY THROUGHOUT OUR CASH FLOW STATEMENT, EXCEPT FOR ITS EFFECT ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $159.3 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $61.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW DRIVEN LARGELY BY AN INCREASE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE GROWTH AND COLLECTIONS TIMING, AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICE AND DECREASES IN ACCRUED PAYROLL DUE TO SEVERANCE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM. NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECREASE IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $220.4 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , AN INCREASE OF $60.6 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND A WORKING CAPITAL INFLOW RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES DUE TO AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN OUR DEMAND PLANNING PROCESS. AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, WHICH WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 PROGRAM AND VARIABLE COMPENSATION, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE CASH INFLOW.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $116.1 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , AN INCREASE OF  $53.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD DUE TO THE NEXSYS PCS LAUNCH AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS IN OUR PLASMA BUSINESS AND PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $63.0 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , A DECREASE OF $10.3 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR SEBRA PRODUCT LINE AND TO A LESSER EXTENT A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $50.6 MILLION  DURING  FISCAL 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $70.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL  2018  . CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED THE REPAYMENT OF THE $253.7 REMAINING OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014, AS WELL AS $160.0 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES DURING  FISCAL 2019  . THIS USE IN CASH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS RESULTING FROM THE $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN ENTERED INTO IN JUNE 2018.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $120.6 MILLION DURING  FISCAL 2018  , AN INCREASE OF $60.2 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH  FISCAL 2017  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $100.0 MILLION OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND AN INCREMENTAL $19.0 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ON OUR 2012 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED IN FISCAL 2014, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE INCREASES IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN BORROWINGS ON OUR PREVIOUS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF $50.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2017 AND AN INCREMENTAL $7.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017.

THE ABOVE TABLE DOES NOT REFLECT OUR LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF  $2.9 MILLION  RECORDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 740, INCOME TAXES. WE CANNOT REASONABLY MAKE A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PERIOD IN WHICH WE EXPECT TO SETTLE THESE LONG-TERM LIABILITIES DUE TO FACTORS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, SUCH AS TAX EXAMINATIONS.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  WHILE APPROXIMATELY  52%  OF OUR REVENUE DURING FISCAL 2019 WAS GENERATED BY OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS, CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY LIMITED DUE TO OUR LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THEIR DIVERSITY ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. CERTAIN MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES, HOWEVER, CAN EXPOSE US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PLASMA BUSINESS UNIT, SALES ARE CONCENTRATED WITH SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXTENDED TO ANY ONE OF THESE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL CUSTOMERS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AT ANY POINT IN TIME. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. INCLUDE SALES TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT DELAYS AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAYMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS OF THOSE COUNTRIES' NATIONAL ECONOMIES.  WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE ALL RECEIVABLES FOR POTENTIAL COLLECTION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CUSTOMERS OR THE COUNTRIES' HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DETERIORATE SUCH THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THESE MATTERS WHEN A LOSS IS KNOWN OR CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT MAY BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. ACTUAL SETTLEMENTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN ESTIMATED AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR MATERIAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS REFER TO NOTE  15  ,  COMMITMENTS & CONTINGENCIES  ,  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFLATION  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. HISTORICALLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION BY IMPROVING OUR MANUFACTURING AND PURCHASING EFFICIENCIES, BY INCREASING EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND BY ADJUSTING THE SELLING PRICES OF PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR INFLATION PRESSURES GENERALLY AND RAW MATERIALS INDICES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM DERIVATIVES COULD RESULT IN CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN OUR COSTS TO PROCURE PLASTIC RAW MATERIALS.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  DURING FISCAL  2019  ,  37.3%  OF OUR SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., GENERALLY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, YET OUR REPORTING CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE ALSO INCUR CERTAIN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN LOCAL CURRENCY. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATE TO SALES DENOMINATED IN EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CHINESE YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT. THE YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXPOSURE IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SOURCING PRODUCTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  SINCE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXCEED THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND, CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT OUR PRIMARY CASH FLOWS RELATE TO PRODUCT COSTS OR COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LOCAL OPERATIONS. WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THESE CURRENCIES, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MINIMIZE, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THE UNFORESEEN IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE UTILIZE FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY JAPANESE YEN AND EURO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SWISS FRANCS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS. THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE VOLATILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, BUT BECAUSE WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ONE YEAR OUT, RATES ARE FIXED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, THEREBY FACILITATING FINANCIAL PLANNING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THESE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FINAL IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS HEDGED AND THE ACTUAL LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  STANDARDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") UPDATE NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  . ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 IS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDING THOSE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER CURRENT U.S. GAAP AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLIER ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED AN UPDATE TO THE LEASING GUIDANCE TO ALLOW AN ADDITIONAL TRANSITION OPTION WHICH WOULD ALLOW COMPANIES TO ADOPT THE STANDARD AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION AS OPPOSED TO THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED. WE ADOPTED THE NEW STANDARD ON MARCH 31, 2019.  UPON TRANSITION, WE PLAN TO APPLY THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02 TRANSITION GUIDANCE TO OUR ENTIRE LEASE PORTFOLIO AT MARCH 31, 2019. AS A RESULT, WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO REASSESS (I) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (II) THE CLASSIFICATION OF ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES, AND (III) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXISTING LEASES.  AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-02, WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES FOR OUR EXISTING LEASE PORTFOLIO ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION TO $25 MILLION, WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW LEASE ADMINISTRATION AND LEASE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, AND UPDATING OUR CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES FOR MAINTAINING AND ACCOUNTING FOR OUR LEASE PORTFOLIO UNDER THE NEW STANDARD.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  . ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS TO INTENDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING FORECASTED INFORMATION, TO DEVELOP CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715)  . THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT COST. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES AS OF THE BEGINNING OF AN ANNUAL REPORTING PERIOD. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2017-07 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-07,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718)  . THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING FOR NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS WITH THE EXISTING EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED TRANSACTIONS GUIDANCE. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2020. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS, BUT NO EARLIER THAN THE ENTITY'S ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 606. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-07 ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BEING ASSESSED BY MANAGEMENT.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15,  INTANGIBLES, GOODWILL AND OTHER - INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40)  . THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE  2  ,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. WHILE ALL OF THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE VIEW CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES AS CRITICAL. POLICIES DETERMINED TO BE CRITICAL ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO USE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND/OR ESTIMATES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL ARE AS FOLLOWS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES ARE RECORDED AT THE NET SALES PRICE, WHICH INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO REBATES, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VOLUME DISCOUNTS. THESE RESERVES, WHICH ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS EARNED OR TO BE CLAIMED ON THE RELATED SALES, ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AND A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR ESTIMATES TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONTRACTUAL AND STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, SPECIFIC KNOWN MARKET EVENTS AND TRENDS, INDUSTRY DATA, AND FORECASTED CUSTOMER BUYING AND PAYMENT PATTERNS. OVERALL, THESE RESERVES REFLECT OUR BEST ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE ARE ENTITLED BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE NET SALES PRICE IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS PROBABLE NOT TO RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN A FUTURE PERIOD. REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED IN PRIOR PERIODS WAS NOT MATERIAL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED REBATES REASONABLY, WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL REBATE OR DISCOUNT THAT COULD BE EARNED. IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE PROVIDE UPFRONT REBATE PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS, WE CAPITALIZE THE REBATE PAYMENTS AND AMORTIZE THE RESULTING ASSET AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE USING A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACT. SEE NOTE 2,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AND NOTE 6,  REVENUE  , TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  ALTHOUGH WE USE CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES IN DEVELOPING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES UNDERLYING THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATIONS USED IN OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTS, THESE ESTIMATES ARE UNCERTAIN BY NATURE AND CAN VARY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE VALUATION ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED REVENUE PROJECTIONS, GROWTH RATES, CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT RATES COULD RESULT IN DIFFERENT FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.  FUTURE EVENTS THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE LEVELS OF EXCESS FAIR VALUE OVER CARRYING VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  DECREASES IN ESTIMATED MARKET SIZES OR MARKET GROWTH RATES DUE TO GREATER-THAN-EXPECTED DECLINES IN PROCEDURAL VOLUMES, PRICING PRESSURES, PRODUCT ACTIONS AND/OR COMPETITIVE TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS,  \u2022  DECLINES IN OUR MARKET SHARE AND PENETRATION ASSUMPTIONS DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION, AN INABILITY TO DEVELOP OR LAUNCH NEW AND NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY FEATURES IN LINE WITH OUR COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGIES AND MARKET AND/OR REGULATORY CONDITIONS THAT MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT LAUNCH DELAYS OR PRODUCT RECALLS,  \u2022  DECREASES IN OUR FORECASTED PROFITABILITY DUE TO AN INABILITY TO IMPLEMENT SUCCESSFULLY AND ACHIEVE TIMELY AND SUSTAINABLE COST IMPROVEMENT MEASURES CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS,  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR REPORTING UNITS OR IN THE STRUCTURE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A RESULT OF FUTURE REORGANIZATIONS, ACQUISITIONS OR DIVESTITURES OF ASSETS OR BUSINESSES AND  \u2022  INCREASES IN OUR MARKET-PARTICIPANT RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASES IN OUR MARKET-PARTICIPANT TAX RATE AND/OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  NEGATIVE CHANGES IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, COULD RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  WE REVIEW INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARISE TO DETERMINE IF ANY ADVERSE CONDITIONS EXIST THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, OR THAT A CHANGE IN THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS REQUIRED. CONDITIONS INDICATING THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO A CHANGE IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE, INTERNAL DECISIONS TO PURSUE NEW OR DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY STRATEGIES, A LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER OR A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE MARKETPLACE INCLUDING PRICES PAID FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR THE SIZE OF THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS. SEE NOTE 2,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AND  NOTE  9  ,  GOODWILL & INTANGIBLE ASSETS  ,  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INVENTORY PROVISIONS  WE BASE OUR PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS, EXPIRED AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY PRIMARILY ON OUR ESTIMATES OF FORECASTED NET SALES. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE TIMING OR LEVEL OF DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AS COMPARED WITH FORECASTED AMOUNTS MAY RESULT IN RECORDING ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS, EXPIRED AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, UNCERTAIN TIMING OF NEXT-GENERATION PRODUCT APPROVALS, VARIABILITY IN PRODUCT LAUNCH STRATEGIES, PRODUCT RECALLS AND VARIATION IN PRODUCT UTILIZATION ALL AFFECT OUR ESTIMATES RELATED TO EXCESS, EXPIRED AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY.  INCOME TAXES  THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IS CALCULATED FOR ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE INCOME TAX PROVISION PROCESS INVOLVES CALCULATING CURRENT TAXES DUE AND ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARISING FROM ITEMS THAT ARE TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE IN DIFFERENT PERIODS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR REALIZABILITY AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS MAINTAINED FOR THE PORTION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT ARE NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT REALIZABLE. ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, HAS BEEN CONSIDERED TO DETERMINE WHETHER, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF THAT EVIDENCE, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS NEEDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. REFER TO NOTE  4  ,  INCOME TAXES  ,  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION OF OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION AND BALANCES INCLUDING A DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017.  WE FILE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN ALL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN INCOME TAX RETURNS. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH POSITIONS  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRESUMING THE TAXING AUTHORITIES' FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE POSITION AND ALL RELEVANT FACTS. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE PORTION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS CLAIMED THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT REALIZABLE. THESE TAX RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT AS TO THE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. ALL TAX RESERVES ARE ANALYZED QUARTERLY AND ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE AS EVENTS OCCUR THAT RESULT IN CHANGES IN JUDGMENT.  CONTINGENCIES  WE MAY BECOME INVOLVED IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, PRODUCT LIABILITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. ACCRUALS RECORDED FOR VARIOUS CONTINGENCIES INCLUDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, EMPLOYEE RELATED LITIGATION, SELF-INSURANCE AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE BASED ON JUDGMENT, THE PROBABILITY OF LOSSES AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, THE CONSIDERATION OF OPINIONS OF INTERNAL AND/OR EXTERNAL LEGAL COUNSEL AND ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED ESTIMATES. WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND A RANGE OF LOSS IS ESTABLISHED BUT A BEST ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, WE RECORD THE MINIMUM LOSS CONTINGENCY AMOUNT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE OFTEN INITIALLY DEVELOPED SUBSTANTIALLY EARLIER THAN THE ULTIMATE LOSS IS KNOWN AND THE ESTIMATES ARE REEVALUATED EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD, AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. WHEN WE ARE INITIALLY UNABLE TO DEVELOP A BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSS, WE RECORD THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF LOSS, WHICH COULD BE ZERO. AS INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, ADDITIONAL LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED WHEN EITHER A BEST ESTIMATE CAN BE MADE OR THE MINIMUM LOSS AMOUNT IS INCREASED. WHEN EVENTS RESULT IN AN EXPECTATION OF A MORE FAVORABLE OUTCOME THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED, OUR BEST ESTIMATE IS CHANGED TO A LOWER AMOUNT.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "HAEMONETICS CORP", "CIK": 313143, "Date": "2019-05-22T00:00:00", "Ticker": "HAE", "Name": "Haemonetics Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3841.0, "Business": "MA", "Incorporated": "MA", "IRS": 42882273.0, "key": "20190522HAE", "labelr1": -3.3375622133307323, "labelr2": 1.9787985865724464, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": -2.6235026235026293, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.16802898, "prof1": 0.8319709999999999, "return1&2": 0.9857519273933834, "return1&2&3": 0.9857519273933834, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9598906997169904, "return2": 1.0197879858657244, "return1": 0.9666243778666926, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 0.9737649737649736, "4_day_return": -4.010930028300974, "cumulative_return1": 0.07706876997801274, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0016076941164856098, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.702459923898212e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.082987943198369e-07, "indexx": 2373, "cumreturn1b": 0.7266945718512625, "cumreturndow": 0.9652874955299398, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9644470328276961}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2377, "level_0": 2402, "index": 2126, "text": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  FOUNDED IN 1916, MODINE MANUFACTURING COMPANY IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN THERMAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS, BRINGING HEATING AND COOLING TECHNOLOGY AND  SOLUTIONS TO DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MARKETS.  WE OPERATE ON FIVE CONTINENTS, IN 19 COUNTRIES, AND EMPLOY APPROXIMATELY 12,200 PERSONS WORLDWIDE.  OUR PRIMARY PRODUCT GROUPS INCLUDE I) POWERTRAIN COOLING AND ENGINE COOLING; II) COILS, COOLERS, AND COATINGS; AND III) HEATING, VENTILATION AND AIR  CONDITIONING.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED IN  ON  - AND OFF-HIGHWAY ORIGINAL-EQUIPMENT VEHICULAR APPLICATIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE OUR THERMAL MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS TO  A WIDE ARRAY OF COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND BUILDING HEATING, VENTILATING, AIR CONDITIONING, AND REFRIGERATION MARKETS.  COMPANY STRATEGY  WE LAUNCHED OUR SDG STRATEGY OVER THREE YEARS AGO TO ESTABLISH A MORE GLOBAL, PRODUCT-BASED ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR OUR COMPANY.  WE\u2019RE PROUD OF OUR ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE UNDER SDG\u2019S CORE GUIDING PRINCIPLES.  WE\u2019VE SUCCESSFULLY ACQUIRED AND INTEGRATED THE LUVATA HTS BUSINESS, NOW OPERATING WITHIN OUR CIS SEGMENT.  THE CIS SEGMENT HAS PROPELLED OUR ORGANIZATION FORWARD TOWARD OUR  VISION OF BECOMING A LEADING GLOBAL DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL THERMAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY.  THIS ACQUISITION SUCCEEDED IN BETTER DIVERSIFYING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND IMPROVING OUR CASH FLOW.  WE\u2019VE ALSO TAKEN ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN OUR BUSINESS AND  LOWER OUR OPERATING AND SG&A COST STRUCTURES, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WHICH HAVE ENCOMPASSED PLANT CONSOLIDATION ACTIVITIES, TARGETED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, AND PRODUCT LINE TRANSFERS, AND GLOBAL PROCUREMENT INITIATIVES TO REDUCE COSTS  FOR MATERIALS AND SERVICES.  REFLECTING ON THESE ACHIEVEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT MODINE IS STRONGER THAN EVER.  AS WE LOOK AHEAD, WE AIM TO BUILD UPON OUR SDG STRATEGY BY PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES THAT BEST ALIGN WITH OUR VISION FOR THE FUTURE AND SECURE OUR POSITION AS A  GLOBAL DIVERSIFIED INDUSTRIAL THERMAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY.  WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN EXECUTING OUR MULTI-YEAR STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH MEANINGFUL POSITIONS IN MARKETS WHERE WE CAN DELIVER CONSISTENT, PROFITABLE GROWTH. WE REGULARLY  REVIEW  OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND THE END MARKETS WE SERVE TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT MIX OF BUSINESS TO BUILD AND MOVE MODINE FORWARD.  WE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE EVALUATING  STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS WITHIN OUR VTS SEGMENT IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE THE SEGMENT\u2019S PROFITABILITY AND REPRIORITIZE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.  WE BELIEVE OUR SDG STRATEGY WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP US GROUNDED, THRIVING, AND TRANSFORMING TO OPTIMIZE THE VALUE WE OFFER OUR CUSTOMERS AND TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST RETURNS FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY  OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES BASED UPON OUR BUILDING BLOCK STRATEGY FOR NEW AND EMERGING MARKETS IS ONE OF OUR COMPETITIVE STRENGTHS.  UNDER THIS STRATEGY, WE FOCUS ON CREATING CORE TECHNOLOGIES THAT FORM THE BASIS FOR MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT LINES ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE A STRONG HERITAGE OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND OUR  ENTIRE GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION BENEFITS FROM MUTUAL STRENGTHS.  WE OWN FOUR GLOBAL, STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY CENTERS, DEDICATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  THE CENTERS ARE LOCATED IN RACINE, WISCONSIN,  GRENADA, MISSISSIPPI, POCENIA, ITALY AND BONLANDEN, GERMANY.  OUR REPUTATION FOR PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES HAS BEEN A COMPANY STRENGTH VALUED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF HAVING US PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN PRODUCT DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND  VALIDATION PROCESSES.  THIS HAS RESULTED, AND WE EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO RESULT, IN STRONG, LONG-TERM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMPANIES THAT VALUE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEIR SUPPLIERS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STRATEGIC PLANNING AND CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT  WE EMPLOY BOTH SHORT-TERM (ONE-TO-THREE YEAR) AND LONGER-TERM (FIVE-TO-SEVEN YEAR) STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESSES, WHICH ENABLE US TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR  OPPORTUNITIES, COMPETITIVE THREATS, AND ECONOMIC MARKET CHALLENGES.  WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO GLOBAL STRATEGIC PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO  STRENGTHEN OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE ORGANIC- AND EXTERNAL-GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, PARTICULARLY TO GROW OUR GLOBAL, MARKET LEADING POSITIONS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THE MOMENTUM  AND SUCCESS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED BY OUR CIS AND BHVAC SEGMENTS.  OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE  WE OPERATE IN A DYNAMIC, GLOBAL MARKETPLACE; THEREFORE, WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS WITH A DISCIPLINED FOCUS ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCING WASTE.  THE  NATURE OF THE GLOBAL MARKETPLACE REQUIRES US TO MOVE TOWARD A GREATER MANUFACTURING SCALE IN ORDER TO CREATE A MORE COMPETITIVE COST BASE.  IN ORDER TO OPTIMIZE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND IMPROVE EFFICIENCY OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE HAVE EXECUTED  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES IN OUR VTS AND CIS SEGMENTS DURING RECENT YEARS.  IN ADDITION, AS COSTS FOR MATERIALS AND PURCHASED PARTS MAY RISE FROM TIME TO TIME DUE TO INCREASES IN COMMODITY MARKETS, WE SEEK LOW-COST SOURCING, WHEN APPROPRIATE, AND  ENTER INTO CONTRACTS WITH SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS THAT PROVIDE FOR COMMODITY PRICE ADJUSTMENTS, ON A LAG BASIS.  WE FOLLOW A RIGOROUS FINANCIAL PROCESS FOR INVESTMENT AND RETURNS, INTENDED TO ENABLE INCREASED PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS OVER THE LONG TERM.  WE PLACE  PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND PRIORITIZATION OF OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.  OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE) PLAN FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS  BASED UPON CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME GROWTH AND A CASH FLOW MARGIN METRIC.  THESE PERFORMANCE GOALS DRIVE ALIGNMENT OF MANAGEMENT AND SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 INTERESTS IN BOTH OUR EARNINGS GROWTH AND CASH FLOW TARGETS.  IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE A  LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN FOR OFFICERS AND CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES TO ATTRACT, RETAIN, AND MOTIVATE EMPLOYEES WHO DIRECTLY IMPACT THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMPANY.  THE PLAN IS COMPRISED OF  STOCK AWARDS, STOCK OPTIONS, AND PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK AWARDS.  THE PERFORMANCE-BASED STOCK AWARDS FOR THE FISCAL 2019 THROUGH 2021 PERFORMANCE  PERIOD ARE BASED UPON A TARGET THREE-YEAR AVERAGE ANNUAL REVENUE GROWTH AND A TARGET THREE-YEAR AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL.  SEGMENT INFORMATION \u2013 STRATEGY, MARKET CONDITIONS AND TRENDS  EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IS MANAGED BY A VICE PRESIDENT AND HAS SEPARATE STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL PLANS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE REVIEWED  BY OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER.  THESE PLANS AND RESULTS ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH SEGMENT AND TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THE ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES.  EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, WE MERGED OUR AMERICAS COILS BUSINESS  INTO THE CIS SEGMENT TO ACCELERATE OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND FORMED THE VTS SEGMENT BY COMBINING OUR AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND ASIA OPERATIONS TO ENABLE US TO OPERATE AS A MORE GLOBAL, PRODUCT-BASED ORGANIZATION.  VEHICULAR THERMAL SOLUTIONS (59 PERCENT OF FISCAL 2019 NET SALES)  OUR VTS SEGMENT PROVIDES POWERTRAIN AND ENGINE COOLING PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RADIATORS, CHARGE AIR COOLERS, CONDENSERS, OIL COOLERS, EGR  COOLERS, AND FUEL COOLERS, TO OEMS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE, COMMERCIAL VEHICLE, AND OFF-HIGHWAY MARKETS IN NORTH AMERICA, SOUTH AMERICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA.  IN ADDITION, OUR VTS SEGMENT ALSO SERVES BRAZIL\u2019S AUTOMOTIVE AND COMMERCIAL VEHICLE AFTERMARKETS.  SALES VOLUME IN THE VTS SEGMENT INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES TO CERTAIN KEY END MARKETS IN NORTH  AMERICA AND ASIA.  IN NORTH AMERICA, WE BENEFITED FROM A SUBSTANTIAL RECOVERY IN THE OFF-HIGHWAY MARKET AND EXPERIENCED SALES VOLUME INCREASES TO AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMERS, DESPITE A RELATIVELY FLAT AUTOMOTIVE MARKET.  THE NORTH AMERICAN COMMERCIAL  VEHICLE MARKET EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE YEAR; HOWEVER, OUR SALES GROWTH TO COMMERCIAL VEHICLE CUSTOMERS LAGGED BEHIND THE OVERALL MARKET TREND, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PLANNED WIND-DOWN OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL VEHICLE PROGRAMS.  IN ASIA,  WE BENEFITED FROM GROWTH OF THE OFF-HIGHWAY MARKETS IN CHINA AND KOREA AND MATURING AUTOMOTIVE PROGRAM VOLUMES IN CHINA.  IN ORDER TO MEET GROWING REGIONAL DEMAND, WE EXPANDED OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN CHANGZHOU, CHINA DURING FISCAL 2019.  TARIFFS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR VTS SEGMENT\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS DURING FISCAL 2019, BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY.  IMPACTS OF TARIFFS ON OUR RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCLUDED THE DIRECT COST OF TARIFFS ON CERTAIN IMPORTED ITEMS FROM CHINA; RISING PRICES  FROM DOMESTIC SOURCES, AS CERTAIN SUPPLIERS LEVERAGED TARIFFS TO IMPOSE COST INCREASES; AND RESOURCING COSTS, AS CERTAIN DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS HAVE CHOSEN TO EXIT SUPPLYING CERTAIN PRODUCTS ALTOGETHER DUE TO CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS RESULTING FROM INCREASED  DEMAND.  THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS OF TARIFFS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRICT COST CONTROL IN OTHER AREAS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LOOKING FORWARD TO FISCAL 2020, WE ANTICIPATE VARIED LEVELS OF GROWTH IN OUR KEY END MARKETS.  TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND IN ASIA, WE WILL COMPLETE OUR EXPANSION  OF MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN OUR LOCATIONS NEAR CHENNAI, INDIA AND YANGZHOU, CHINA.  WE EXPECT THE GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS WILL BE RELATIVELY FLAT.  IN REGARD TO THE GLOBAL COMMERCIAL VEHICLE MARKETS, WE EXPECT A DECLINE IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE  AND ASIA AND GROWTH IN SOUTH AMERICA.  WE EXPECT OUR COMMERCIAL VEHICLE SALES WILL DECREASE COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PLANNED WIND-DOWNS OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS IN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA.  HOWEVER, WE EXPECT GROWTH IN OUR  COMMERCIAL VEHICLE BUSINESS IN CHINA, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASING PRODUCTION OF EURO 6 ENGINES THAT HAVE ADDITIONAL MODINE CONTENT.  IN REGARD TO GLOBAL OFF-HIGHWAY MARKETS, WE ANTICIPATE MODEST GROWTH IN THE MAJORITY OF BOTH CONSTRUCTION AND  AGRICULTURAL MARKETS.  AS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED, WE ARE EVALUATING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS.  A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF OUR EVALUATION IS OPTIMIZING OUR VTS  SEGMENT\u2019S PROFITABILITY PROFILE.  THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET EXHIBITS DIFFERENT INDUSTRY DYNAMICS, GROWTH TRAJECTORIES, AND STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, AS COMPARED WITH THE COMMERCIAL VEHICLE AND OFF-HIGHWAY MARKETS WE SERVE, AND GENERALLY REQUIRES HIGHER  CAPITAL INVESTMENT FROM ITS SUPPLY BASE.  WHILE WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES TO BEST SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDE THE GREATEST RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE A SALE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS IS THE MOST  LIKELY PATH FORWARD.  WE REMAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE COMMERCIAL VEHICLE AND OFF-HIGHWAY MARKETS AND MAKING THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO ENSURE OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS IS SUCCESSFUL.

ON JANUARY 29, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE ARE EVALUATING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR OUR AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS WITHIN OUR VTS SEGMENT. OUR PRIMARY OBJECTIVES  INCLUDE OPTIMIZING THE VTS SEGMENT\u2019S PROFITABILITY AND REPRIORITIZING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES. WHILE WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE VARIOUS ALTERNATIVES, WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE A SALE OF THE AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS IS THE MOST LIKELY  PATH FORWARD.  WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE OUR EVALUATION IN FISCAL 2020 TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE AS A RESULT, IF ANY.  FISCAL 2019 NET SALES INCREASED $110 MILLION, OR 5 PERCENT, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.  GROSS PROFIT  INCREASED $9 MILLION, YET GROSS MARGIN DECLINED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 16.5 PERCENT, AS THE BENEFIT FROM HIGHER SALES VOLUME WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MATERIAL COSTS, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF TARIFFS, AND TEMPORARY OPERATING INEFFICIENCIES  LARGELY RESULTING FROM INCREASED VOLUMES AND NEW PROGRAM LAUNCHES AT CERTAIN FACILITIES.  SG&A EXPENSES DECREASED $2 MILLION, OR 70 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED $10 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES,  PRIMARILY RELATED TO TARGETED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS WITHIN THE VTS SEGMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE HIGHER OPERATING INCOME AND THE IMPACT OF INCOME TAXES, OUR FISCAL 2019 NET EARNINGS OF $86 MILLION IMPROVED $62 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE  PRIOR YEAR.  FISCAL 2018 NET SALES INCREASED $600 MILLION, OR 40 PERCENT, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO $444 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL SALES FROM OUR CIS SEGMENT AND  HIGHER SALES IN OUR OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS.  WE OWNED THE LUVATA HTS BUSINESS (CIS SEGMENT) FOR FOUR MONTHS IN FISCAL 2017.  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $103 MILLION, INCLUDING $66 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR CIS SEGMENT.

FISCAL 2019 GROSS PROFIT INCREASED $9 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, YET GROSS MARGIN DECLINED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 16.5 PERCENT.

FISCAL 2019 SG&A EXPENSES OF $244 MILLION DECREASED $2 MILLION, OR 70 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN SG&A  EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEGRATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NOVEMBER 2016 ACQUISITION OF THE LUVATA HTS BUSINESS AND A $3 MILLION FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER THIRD-PARTY  STRATEGIC ADVISORY COSTS RECORDED AT CORPORATE AND HIGHER ENVIRONMENTAL CHARGES WITHIN OUR VTS SEGMENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, WE RECORDED PROVISIONAL INCOME TAX CHARGES TOTALING $38 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, COMPARED WITH INCOME TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $8 MILLION IN THE CURRENT  YEAR.  IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $17 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTING FROM THE RECOGNITION OF TAX ASSETS FOR FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF A $9 MILLION BENEFIT FROM A  DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT IN HUNGARY RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OPERATING EARNINGS.

FISCAL 2018 INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $9 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEBT ISSUED TO FINANCE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ACQUISITION  OF LUVATA HTS.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $40 MILLION AND $6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  THE $34 MILLION INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $38 MILLION  OF PROVISIONAL CHARGES RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018 RELATED TO THE TAX ACT AND INCREASED OPERATING EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME TAX BENEFITS TOTALING $14 MILLION RESULTING FROM I) A DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT IN HUNGARY ($9 MILLION); II) THE REVERSAL  OF A PORTION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN A FOREIGN JURISDICTION ($3 MILLION); AND III) A REDUCTION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM A LAPSE IN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS ($2 MILLION), AND THE ABSENCE OF A $2 MILLION PROVISION RECORDED IN  THE PRIOR YEAR TO ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN A SEPARATE FOREIGN JURISDICTION.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SINCE THE DATE WE ACQUIRED LUVATA HTS (NOVEMBER 30, 2016), WE HAVE INCLUDED FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THIS ACQUIRED BUSINESS WITHIN OUR CIS SEGMENT.

OPERATING INCOME OF $20 MILLION INCREASED $7 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GROSS PROFIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 OF $42 MILLION, AND AN AVAILABLE  BORROWING CAPACITY OF $124 MILLION UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  GIVEN OUR EXTENSIVE INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE HELD BY OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2019 WAS $103 MILLION, A DECREASE OF $21 MILLION FROM $124 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THIS DECREASE IN  OPERATING CASH FLOW PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRONGER EARNINGS.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, INCLUDED HIGHER INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER SALES LEVELS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2018 WAS $124 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $82 MILLION FROM $42 MILLION IN FISCAL 2017.  THIS INCREASE IN  OPERATING CASH FLOW PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR CIS SEGMENT, LOWER PAYMENTS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION OF LUVATA HTS AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES  IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AND FAVORABLE NET CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $74 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019 INCREASED $3 MILLION COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN OUR CIS  SEGMENT, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN SERBIA AND MEXICO.  SIMILAR TO PRIOR YEARS, OUR CAPITAL SPENDING IN FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY OCCURRED IN THE VTS SEGMENT, WHICH TOTALED $56 MILLION, AND INCLUDED TOOLING AND EQUIPMENT  PURCHASES IN CONJUNCTION WITH NEW AND RENEWAL PROGRAMS WITH CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS TO EXPAND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN CHINA AND HUNGARY.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS TOTALED $24 MILLION.  SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS  INCLUDED TOOLING AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES FOR NEW AND RENEWAL PROGRAMS WITH CUSTOMERS IN ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, AND EUROPE WITHIN THE VTS SEGMENT.  DEBT  OUR TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING DECREASED $30 MILLION TO $450 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO REPAYMENTS OF DEBT DURING  FISCAL 2019.  SEE NOTE 17 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS COVENANTS.  AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE TERM LOANS MAY REQUIRE PREPAYMENTS IN THE  EVENT OUR ANNUAL EXCESS CASH FLOW EXCEEDS DEFINED LEVELS, DEPENDING UPON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, OR IN THE EVENT OF CERTAIN ASSET SALES.  IN ADDITION, UNDER OUR PRIMARY DEBT AGREEMENTS IN THE U.S., WE ARE SUBJECT TO LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANTS, THE MOST  RESTRICTIVE OF WHICH REQUIRES US TO LIMIT OUR CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS, LESS A PORTION OF OUR CASH BALANCE, BOTH AS DEFINED BY THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, TO NO MORE THAN THREE AND ONE-QUARTER TIMES CONSOLIDATED NET EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES,  DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS (\u201cADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d).  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN ADJUSTED EBITDA OF AT LEAST THREE TIMES CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR LEVERAGE RATIO AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WERE 2.1 AND 9.0, RESPECTIVELY.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR DEBT COVENANTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE DURING FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.

OUR LIABILITIES FOR PENSIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS TOTALED $119 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  WE ARE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE  ULTIMATE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR THESE LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, WE HAVE EXCLUDED THESE AMOUNTS FROM THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE ABOVE.  WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE $3 MILLION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS DURING FISCAL 2020.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES RESULTS IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF THESE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES IS INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT THE SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES PRESENTED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN ADDITION, RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  IN FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.  SEE NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES  TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, W  E RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED UPON CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CONTRACT AND AS WE SATISFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BY  TRANSFERRING CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH MAY BE AT A POINT IN TIME OR OVER TIME.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME, BASED UPON SHIPMENT TERMS.  A LIMITED NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS PROVIDE AN  ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO PAYMENT FOR PERFORMANCE COMPLETED TO DATE.  FOR THESE CONTRACTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME BASED UPON OUR ESTIMATED PROGRESS TOWARDS THE SATISFACTION OF THE CONTRACT\u2019S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  WE RECORD AN ALLOWANCE FOR  DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES AND WE ACCRUE FOR ESTIMATED WARRANTY COSTS AT THE TIME OF SALE.  WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT BUSINESS TRENDS, AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  ACQUISITIONS  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAKE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS THAT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.  WE ALLOCATE THE  PURCHASE PRICE OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES TO THE IDENTIFIABLE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION BASED UPON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE.  WE DETERMINE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES  USING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US AND ENGAGE THIRD-PARTY VALUATION SPECIALISTS WHEN NECESSARY.  THE ESTIMATES WE USE TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, SUCH AS INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CAN BE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS.  WHILE  WE USE OUR BEST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OUR ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO REFINEMENT.  AS A RESULT, DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, WHICH MAY BE UP TO ONE YEAR FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE, WE RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS  ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL.  UPON CONCLUSION OF THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD OR FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE VALUES OF ASSETS ACQUIRED OR LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS  ARE RECORDED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  WE ALSO ESTIMATE THE USEFUL LIVES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO RECORD IN FUTURE PERIODS.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES ASSIGNED  TO OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES CONTINUE TO BE APPROPRIATE.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  WE PERFORM IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, WHENEVER BUSINESS  CONDITIONS OR EVENTS INDICATE THAT THOSE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED.  WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS OPERATING LOSSES, DECLINING FINANCIAL OUTLOOKS AND MARKET CONDITIONS, WHEN EVALUATING THE NECESSITY FOR AN IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS.  WHEN THE NET ASSET VALUES  EXCEED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSETS, OR THE DECLINE IN VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO BE \u201cOTHER THAN TEMPORARY,\u201d WE WRITE DOWN THE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE AND RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO CURRENT OPERATIONS.  WE ESTIMATE FAIR  VALUE IN VARIOUS WAYS DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.  FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY BASED UPON APPRAISED VALUE, ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUE, OR SELLING PRICES UNDER NEGOTIATION, AS APPLICABLE.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LONG-LIVED ASSETS WE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS WERE PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH TOTALED $485  MILLION AND $116 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT MARCH 31, 2019.  WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSETS EVALUATED ARE BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT.  OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT INTANGIBLE ASSETS EVALUATED ARE  CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TRADE NAMES, AND ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE RELATED TO OUR CIS SEGMENT.  WE EVALUATE IMPAIRMENT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL OF SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE MANUFACTURING PLANT  LEVEL.  WE MONITOR MANUFACTURING PLANT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER INDICATORS EXIST THAT WOULD REQUIRE AN IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION FOR THE FACILITY.  THIS INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGES IN PLANT PROFITABILITY METRICS; SUBSTANTIAL  CHANGES IN THE MIX OF CUSTOMER PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED IN THE PLANT; CHANGES IN MANUFACTURING STRATEGY; AND THE SHIFTING OF PROGRAMS TO OTHER FACILITIES UNDER A MANUFACTURING REALIGNMENT STRATEGY.  WHEN SUCH INDICATORS ARE PRESENT, WE PERFORM AN  IMPAIRMENT EVALUATION.  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL  WE PERFORM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ANNUALLY, AS OF MARCH 31, UNLESS BUSINESS EVENTS OR OTHER CONDITIONS EXIST THAT REQUIRE A MORE FREQUENT EVALUATION.  WE  CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS OPERATING LOSSES, DECLINING FINANCIAL AND MARKET OUTLOOKS, AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION WHEN EVALUATING THE NECESSITY FOR AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS.  WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL.  REPORTING  UNITS RESULTING FROM RECENT ACQUISITIONS GENERALLY REPRESENT THE HIGHEST RISK OF IMPAIRMENT, WHICH TYPICALLY DECREASES AS THE BUSINESSES ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE COMPANY AND POSITIONED FOR FUTURE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  WE TEST GOODWILL  FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING VALUE.  WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BASED UPON THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS  THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S NET ASSETS, GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED.  HOWEVER, IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S NET ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE WOULD CONCLUDE GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED AND WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE  EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT THAT THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT INVOLVES JUDGMENT AND THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING THE  REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGINS USED TO CALCULATE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE, BUSINESS TRENDS AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  WE DETERMINE THE EXPECTED FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING PROFIT  MARGINS AFTER CONSIDERATION OF OUR HISTORICAL REVENUE GROWTH RATES AND EARNINGS LEVELS, OUR ASSESSMENT OF FUTURE MARKET POTENTIAL AND OUR EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.  THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN DETERMINING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS IS A  RATE CORRESPONDING TO OUR COST OF CAPITAL, ADJUSTED FOR COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RISKS WHERE APPROPRIATE.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, OUR GOODWILL TOTALED $169 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CIS AND BHVAC SEGMENTS.  EACH OF THESE SEGMENTS IS COMPRISED OF TWO REPORTING  UNITS.  WE CONDUCTED ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 BY APPLYING A FAIR VALUE-BASED TEST AND DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THE RESPECTIVE BOOK VALUE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WARRANTY COSTS  WE ESTIMATE COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND ACCRUE FOR SUCH COSTS AT THE TIME OF THE SALE, WITHIN COST OF SALES.  WE ESTIMATE WARRANTY COSTS BASED UPON  THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, WHICH INCLUDES STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS OF BOTH HISTORICAL AND CURRENT CLAIM DATA.  WE ADJUST OUR WARRANTY ACCRUALS, WHICH TOTALED $9 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019, IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT EXPECTED CLAIMS WILL  DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES.  PENSION OBLIGATIONS  OUR CALCULATION OF THE EXPENSE AND LIABILITIES OF OUR PENSION PLANS IS DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, OUR PENSION LIABILITIES TOTALED  $104 MILLION.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND MORTALITY RATE TABLES.  WE BASE OUR SELECTION OF ASSUMPTIONS ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME  OF VALUATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, ACTUAL RESULTS THAT DIFFER FROM THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE ACCUMULATED AND AMORTIZED OVER FUTURE PERIODS.  THESE DIFFERENCES IMPACT FUTURE PENSION EXPENSES.  CURRENTLY, PARTICIPANTS IN OUR DOMESTIC PENSION  PLANS ARE NOT ACCRUING BENEFITS BASED UPON THEIR CURRENT SERVICE AS THE PLANS DO NOT INCLUDE INCREASES IN ANNUAL EARNINGS OR FOR FUTURE SERVICE IN CALCULATING THE AVERAGE ANNUAL EARNINGS AND YEARS OF CREDITED SERVICE UNDER THE PENSION PLAN FORMULA.  FOR THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION REGARDING SENSITIVITY OF ASSUMPTIONS, ALL AMOUNTS PRESENTED ARE IN REFERENCE TO OUR DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS, SINCE OUR DOMESTIC  PLANS COMPRISE ALL OF OUR BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS AND THE LARGE MAJORITY OF OUR PENSION PLAN EXPENSE.  TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS (A) THE ACTUAL RETURN EARNED ON PLAN ASSETS, (B) HISTORICAL RATES  OF RETURN ON THE VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES IN THE PLAN PORTFOLIO, (C) PROJECTIONS OF RETURNS ON THOSE ASSET CLASSES, (D) THE AMOUNT OF ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THE ASSETS, (E) CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND ECONOMIC FORECASTS, AND (F) ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  PAID WITH THE PLAN ASSETS.  THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN UTILIZED IN BOTH FISCAL 2019 AND 2018 WAS 7.5 PERCENT.  FOR FISCAL 2020, WE HAVE ALSO ASSUMED A RATE OF 7.5 PERCENT.  A CHANGE OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS WOULD  IMPACT OUR FISCAL 2020 PENSION EXPENSE BY $0.4 MILLION.  THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS RATES AVAILABLE ON LONG-TERM, HIGH-QUALITY FIXED-INCOME CORPORATE BONDS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE OF MARCH 31.  FOR FISCAL 2019 AND  2018, FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING PENSION EXPENSE, WE USED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 4.0 AND 4.1 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.  WE DETERMINED THESE RATES BASED UPON A YIELD CURVE THAT WAS CREATED FOLLOWING AN ANALYSIS OF THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OUR PLANS.  SEE NOTE 18 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  A CHANGE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE OF 25 BASIS POINTS WOULD IMPACT OUR FISCAL 2020 PENSION EXPENSE BY LESS THAN $1 MILLION.  INCOME TAXES  WE OPERATE IN NUMEROUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS; THEREFORE, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR EXAMINATIONS BY FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S. TAXING AUTHORITIES.  DUE TO THE  APPLICATION OF COMPLEX AND SOMETIMES AMBIGUOUS TAX LAWS AND RULINGS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, THERE IS AN INHERENT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY WITHIN OUR WORLDWIDE TAX PROVISIONS.  DESPITE OUR BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE  CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAWS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT TAXING AUTHORITIES COULD CHALLENGE CERTAIN POSITIONS.  THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 AND INCLUDED NUMEROUS CHANGES TO EXISTING U.S. TAX REGULATIONS, INCLUDING U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATES, BUSINESS  DEDUCTIONS, AND TAXES ON INCOME IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  WE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT DURING FISCAL 2019.  ADDITIONAL IMPACTS FROM THE TAX ACT COULD RESULT IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS OR APPLICATIONS OF THE  TAX ACT\u2019S PROVISIONS OR IF SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATORY GUIDANCE IS ISSUED.  OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR FINANCIAL AND TAX REPORTING PURPOSES.  WE  ADJUST THESE AMOUNTS TO REFLECT CHANGES IN TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES REVERSE.  WE RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF WE DETERMINE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN A PARTICULAR  JURISDICTION WILL NOT BE REALIZED.  THIS DETERMINATION INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.  IN PERFORMING THIS ASSESSMENT ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS, WE CONSIDER HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED FINANCIAL RESULTS ALONG WITH OTHER PERTINENT  INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 8 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING INCOME TAXES.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER LOSS RESERVES  WE MAINTAIN LIABILITIES AND RESERVES FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER LOSS EXPOSURES, SUCH AS ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS, SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES, UNCOLLECTIBLE  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, REGULATORY COMPLIANCE MATTERS, AND LITIGATION.  ESTABLISHING LOSS RESERVES FOR THESE EXPOSURES REQUIRES THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE RISK EXPOSURE AND ULTIMATE POTENTIAL LIABILITY.  WE ESTIMATE THESE RESERVE  REQUIREMENTS BY USING CONSISTENT AND SUITABLE METHODOLOGIES FOR THE PARTICULAR TYPE OF LOSS RESERVE BEING CALCULATED.  SEE NOTE 20 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THIS REPORT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE DISCUSSION UNDER ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR AUDITED HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THESE STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISK, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d OF THIS FORM 10-K.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U. S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS.  WE EVALUATE THE ESTIMATES ON AN ON-GOING BASIS.  WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u25aa  WE REPORT INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING BASIS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX LAWS AND TAX RATES THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE.  WE ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED.  A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LEVEL OF HISTORICAL TAXABLE INCOME AND PROJECTIONS FOR FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE DEDUCTIBLE.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES ASSESSING UNCERTAINTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX RULES.  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS MUST MEET A MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON FINAL SETTLEMENT.  SEE NOTE 15 \u2014 INCOME TAXES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  \u25aa  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  SEE NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES -  REVENUE RECOGNITION  OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 FOR DISCUSSION ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND DETERMINATION OF TRANSACTION PRICE, INCLUDING TREATMENT OF REBATES, RIGHT OF RETURNS, WARRANTIES, PRICE PROTECTION AND STOCK ROTATION.  \u25aa  INVENTORIES ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST BEING DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.  WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORIES TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED ON FORECASTED DEMAND WHILE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT PRODUCT RELEASE SCHEDULES AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, WHICH MAY DRIVE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.  WE ALSO REVIEW AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY, AS APPROPRIATE, BASED ON THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE INVENTORY.  ACTUAL DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  SEE NOTE 2 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  \u25aa  WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS USED IN OPERATIONS WHEN INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE PRESENT AND THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ESTIMATED TO BE GENERATED BY THOSE ASSETS ARE LESS THAN THE ASSETS\u2019 CARRYING AMOUNTS.  AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE EVENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE ASSETS.  IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS INVOLVE MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF ASSET USEFUL LIVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  ACTUAL USEFUL LIVES AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. SEE NOTE 6 \u2014 INTANGIBLES, NET AND GOODWILL OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  \u25aa  THE COMPANY EVALUATES GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  GOODWILL IS RECORDED AT THE TIME OF AN ACQUISITION AND IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID FOR AN ACQUISITION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED.  THE COMPANY TESTS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  IMPAIRMENT EVALUATIONS INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED.  IF MANAGEMENT CONCLUDES FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, THEN A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST WILL BE PERFORMED INVOLVING MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF ASSET USEFUL LIVES AND FUTURE CASH FLOWS.  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS THAT ARE USED IN THESE EVALUATIONS.  IF OUR ACTUAL RESULTS, OR THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES USED IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES, ARE LOWER THAN THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATES USED TO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS, WE COULD INCUR ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN A FUTURE PERIOD.  THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  .  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017.  \u25aa  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR VARIOUS LEGAL MATTERS. SEE NOTE 12 \u2014 LEGAL MATTERS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8.  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO US TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY ACCRUALS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE STATUS OF THE CASE, THE RESULTS OF THE DISCOVERY PROCESS AND OTHER FACTORS.  IF WE ULTIMATELY DETERMINE THAT AN ACCRUAL SHOULD BE MADE FOR A LEGAL MATTER, THIS ACCRUAL COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME MAY BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATE.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (ASC TOPIC 606). THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASU IS TO CONVERGE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS PER U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (\u201cIFRS\u201d). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE GUIDANCE IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN AUGUST 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2015-14, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE AFTER PUBLIC COMMENT SUPPORTED A PROPOSAL TO DELAY THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS ASU TO ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, INCLUDING INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS WITHIN THAT REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PROCESS OF REVIEWING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 CONTRACTS IN RESPECT OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IDENTIFICATION AND SATISFACTION, PRICING, WARRANTIES, AND RETURN RIGHTS, AMONG OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. ACCORDING TO THE STANDARD, THE COMPANY COULD ADOPT BY FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH APPLIES RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR PERIOD PRESENTED, OR BY MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RECOGNIZED IN BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION METHOD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NO INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT, AND THEREFORE NO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IMPACT.  SEE NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - REVENUE RECOGNITION AS WELL AS NOTE 8 - REVENUES FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.  THE EFFECTS OF THE CHANGES MADE TO OUR BALANCE SHEET AT ADOPTION WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  BALANCE AT MARCH 31, 2018  IMPACT FROM ASU 2014-09 ADOPTION  BALANCE AT APRIL 1, 2018  FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  $100,801  $5,539  $106,340  INVENTORIES  205,760  (391)  205,369  OTHER CURRENT ASSETS  13,877  391  14,268  OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES  $(12,657  )  $(5,539  )  $(18,196  )  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  . THE FASB ISSUED THIS UPDATE TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY LEASING ARRANGEMENT DETAILS.  LESSEES WOULD RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASES ON THE BALANCE SHEET UNDER THIS ASU - WITH THE FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS RECOGNIZED AS A LIABILITY, MEASURED AT PRESENT VALUE, AND THE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSET RECOGNIZED FOR THE LEASE TERM. A SINGLE LEASE COST WOULD BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE TERM.  FOR INITIAL TERMS OF LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS, A LESSEE WOULD BE PERMITTED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR SUCH LEASES GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED.  THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH WAS PREVIOUSLY THE ONLY ALLOWED ADOPTION METHOD.  IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED THE RELATED ASU 2018-10 -  LEASES (TOPIC 842): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS  . THIS ASU OFFERS A NEW TRANSITION ADOPTION METHOD, WHICH WILL NOT REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO COMPARATIVE PERIODS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED USING THE LATTER METHOD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE NEW STANDARD PROVIDES A NUMBER OF OPTIONAL PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS IN TRANSITION.  WE ELECTED THE USE-OF-HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND THE \u2018PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\u2019 WHICH PERMITS US NOT TO REASSESS UNDER THE NEW STANDARD OUR PRIOR CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS.  THE NEW STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS FOR AN ENTITY\u2019S ONGOING ACCOUNTING.  WE ELECTED THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ALL LEASES THAT QUALIFY.  THIS MEANS, FOR QUALIFYING LEASES, TYPICALLY THOSE WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN TWELVE MONTHS, WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES.  WE ALSO DO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR ALL CLASSES OF ASSETS.  MOST OF OUR OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS WERE SUBJECT TO THE NEW STANDARD AND RECOGNIZED AS RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES UPON ADOPTION, WHICH WILL MATERIALLY INCREASE THE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES THAT WE REPORT RELATIVE TO SUCH AMOUNTS PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THIS ASU.  ON ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL OPERATING LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $158.0 MILLION  , WITH CORRESPONDING ROU ASSETS BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT LEASING CONTRACTS FOR EXISTING OPERATING LEASES.  IN ADDITION, EXISTING CAPITALIZED INITIAL DIRECT COSTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AND ACCRUED LEASE PAYMENTS OF  $11.1 MILLION  WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM PREPAYMENTS AND ACCRUALS TO THE ROU ASSET, RESULTING IN A ROU ASSET OF  $149.7 MILLION  .  THERE WAS NO INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT ON ADOPTION.  IN APPLYING THE USE-OF-HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, WE RE-ASSESSED WHETHER WE WERE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE EXTENSION OPTIONS WITHIN OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS.  THIS RESULTED IN THE LEASE TERM BEING EXTENDED ON A NUMBER OF LEASES.  THE  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED INITIAL DIRECT COSTS AND LEASE CREDITOR WERE RECALCULATED ASSUMING THESE EXTENDED LEASE TERMS HAD ALWAYS APPLIED, RESULTING IN AN ADJUSTMENT OF  $1.0 MILLION  TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS ON TRANSITION.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2014 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  .  THIS ASU REQUIRES CREDIT LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES TO BE PRESENTED AS AN ALLOWANCE RATHER THAN A WRITE-DOWN.  UNLIKE CURRENT U.S. GAAP, THE CREDIT LOSSES COULD BE REVERSED WITH CHANGES IN ESTIMATES, AND RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT YEAR EARNINGS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04,  INTANGIBLES \u2014 GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  .  THIS ASU ELIMINATES STEP TWO OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST.  AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CURRENT VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017 AND SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.  AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE NATURE OF AND REASON FOR THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE UPON TRANSITION.  THAT DISCLOSURE SHOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL PERIOD AND IN THE INTERIM PERIOD WITHIN THE FIRST ANNUAL PERIOD WHEN THE ENTITY INITIALLY ADOPTS THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715): IMPROVING THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST  .  THIS ASU REQUIRES AN EMPLOYER TO DISAGGREGATE THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT FROM THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST.  IT ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON INCOME STATEMENT PRESENTATION FOR SERVICE COST AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION INCLUDED THE BUY-OUT SETTLEMENT OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 9.  IN MAY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): SCOPE OF MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING  .  THIS ASU APPLIES TO ANY COMPANY THAT CHANGES THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF A SHARE-BASED AWARD, CONSIDERED A MODIFICATION.  MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING WOULD BE APPLIED UNLESS CERTAIN CONDITIONS WERE MET RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD, THE VESTING CONDITIONS AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE MODIFIED AWARD.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO AN AWARD MODIFIED ON OR AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NO FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACT AS NO AWARDS WERE MODIFIED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT - REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  .  THIS ASU ALLOWS FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE STANDARD SHOULD BE APPLIED IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PERIOD (OR PERIODS) IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE IN TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  .  THIS ASU EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES AND WILL APPLY TO ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH THE GRANTOR ACQUIRES GOODS AND SERVICES TO BE USED OR CONSUMED IN ITS OWN OPERATIONS BY ISSUING SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ADOPT THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK-CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  .  THIS ASU ADJUSTS CURRENT REQUIRED DISCLOSURES RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE COMMISSION ADOPTED THE FINAL RULE UNDER SEC RELEASE NO. 33-10532, DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION, AMENDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS THAT WERE REDUNDANT, DUPLICATIVE, OVERLAPPING, OUTDATED OR SUPERSEDED.  IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENTS EXPANDED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON THE ANALYSIS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  UNDER THE AMENDMENTS, AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN EACH CAPTION OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY PRESENTED  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE BALANCE SHEET MUST BE PROVIDED IN A NOTE OR SEPARATE STATEMENT.  THE ANALYSIS SHOULD PRESENT A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING BALANCE TO THE ENDING BALANCE OF EACH PERIOD FOR WHICH A STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED. THE FINAL RULE WAS PUBLISHED IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER ON OCTOBER 4, 2018, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2018.  THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE IS NOT REQUIRED UNTIL THE QUARTERLY FILING COVERING THE PERIOD BEGINNING AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENTS, WHICH WILL BE THE COMPANY'S FIRST QUARTER FISCAL YEAR 2020 FILING.  THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  OVERVIEW  CIRRUS LOGIC DEVELOPS HIGH-PRECISION ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL ICS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF INNOVATIVE CUSTOMERS.  WE TRACK OPERATING RESULTS IN ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT, BUT REPORT REVENUE PERFORMANCE BY PRODUCT LINE, CURRENTLY PORTABLE AND NON-PORTABLE AND OTHER PRODUCTS.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE COMPANY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED OUR PENETRATION OF THE ANDROID  TM  MARKET, DRIVEN BY DEMAND FOR OUR BOOSTED AMPLIFIERS, BROADENED OUR CUSTOMER BASE, AND EXECUTED ON NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY ALSO MADE PROGRESS WITH OUR LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS IN MEMS MICROPHONES AND VOICE BIOMETRICS AS CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENTS INCREASED AND EVALUATION ACTIVITY CONTINUED.  WITH AN EXTENSIVE PRODUCT ROADMAP SPANNING AUDIO, VOICE AND OTHER ADJACENT MARKETS SUCH AS HAPTICS, WE ARE DEDICATED TO DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENABLE US TO CAPITALIZE ON THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR COMPLEX ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL PROCESSING, WHICH WE EXPECT TO DRIVE OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS.

OVERALL, GROSS MARGIN FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  WAS  50.4 PERCENT  .  THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX ON CERTAIN PORTABLE PRODUCTS, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DECREASED TO 1,551 AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  .

WESTFIELD HOUSE  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017, THE COMPANY REPORTED AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $9.8 MILLION RELATED TO A BUILDING OWNED BY THE COMPANY IN EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND (\"  WESTFIELD HOUSE  \").  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROPERTY OF THE ASSET WERE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE AT THAT TIME.  CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT THE BUILDING WAS NO LONGER USED AS THE PRIMARY OFFICE SPACE FOR EDINBURGH EMPLOYEES AND THAT MARKET CONDITIONS HAD WEAKENED, THE COMPANY HIRED AN INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT TO ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUILDING.  THE VARIANCE IN THE ASSESSED VALUATION AMOUNT AND THE CARRYING VALUE WAS RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  AND IS PRESENTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER THE CAPTION  \u201cASSET IMPAIRMENT.\u201d  SUBSEQUENTLY, IN FISCAL YEAR 2019, MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVED AND THE COMPANY MARKETED AND SOLD WESTFIELD HOUSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, FOR A GAIN ON THE SALE OF  $4.9 MILLION  - PRESENTED AS \"  GAIN ON SALE OF ASSETS  \" ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  INTEREST INCOME  INTEREST INCOME IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , WAS  $8.0 MILLION  ,  $4.8 MILLION  , AND  $1.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  AND  2018  WAS DUE TO HIGHER YIELDS ON HIGHER AVERAGE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENT, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR VERSUS THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE  THE COMPANY REPORTED INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $1.1 MILLION  ,  $1.2 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  FOR FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PAY DOWN ACTIVITY, DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7.  U.K. PENSION SETTLEMENT  THE COMPANY SETTLED ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  A SETTLEMENT LOSS OF $13.8 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED, WHICH WAS THE AMOUNT OF THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED UNAMORTIZED ACTUARIAL PENSION LOSS IN AOCI.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE LOSS IS PRESENTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER THE CAPTION \"  U.K. PENSION SETTLEMENT  \".  THE COMPANY WILL HAVE NO FURTHER CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS GOING FORWARD.  OTHER EXPENSE  IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , THE COMPANY REPORTED  $0.2 MILLION  AND  $1.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN OTHER EXPENSE, PRIMARILY FOREIGN EXCHANGE COSTS.  THE CORRESPONDING AMOUNT IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS IMMATERIAL.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $3.8 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  ON A PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $93.7 MILLION  , YIELDING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  4.0 PERCENT  .  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0 PERCENT  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROVISIONAL ENACTMENT-DATE EFFECTS OF THE LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), AS WELL AS THE U.S. FEDERAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT AND THE EFFECT OF INCOME EARNED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT IS TAXED BELOW THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE.  THIS OVERALL DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATED TO CERTAIN U.S. FEDERAL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND STATE TAX ATTRIBUTES DUE TO THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL EXPIRE OR GO UNUTILIZED.  THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017.  THE TAX ACT REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, RESTRICTS THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN BUSINESS EXPENSES, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX-DEFERRED, AND CREATES NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCED EARNINGS, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS.  WE RECOGNIZED A PROVISIONAL AMOUNT OF $60.1 MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE ENACTMENT-DATE EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT WAS COMPLETED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  WE RECOGNIZED AN  $11.1 MILLION  ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AT MARCH 31, 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $103.1 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  ON A PRE-TAX INCOME OF  $265.1 MILLION  , YIELDING AN EFFECTIVE TAX PROVISION RATE OF  38.9 PERCENT  .  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS HIGHER THAN THE BLENDED U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 31.6 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCOME EARNED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT IS TAXED BELOW THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND EXCESS BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE WAS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018.  THE RATE CHANGE WAS ADMINISTRATIVELY EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2018, RESULTING IN A BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF 31.6% FOR THE ANNUAL PERIOD.  WE RECORDED $60.1 MILLION OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE OF THE DISCRETE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $53.8 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017 ON A PRE-TAX INCOME OF $315.0 MILLION, YIELDING AN EFFECTIVE TAX PROVISION RATE OF 17.1 PERCENT.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE THEN CURRENT U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 35 PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCOME EARNED IN JURISDICTIONS WITH A LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATE, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK BASED COMPENSATION DUE TO THE EARLY ADOPTION OF THE ASU 2016-09 ACCOUNTING STANDARD, AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS IN THE U.S.  FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR INCOME TAXES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THE TAX ACT, SEE NOTE 15 - INCOME TAXES.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD, WE ANTICIPATE GROSS MARGIN TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OPERATING EXPENSE TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN IMPORTANT R&D PROJECTS THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH.  GIVEN THE WIDE ARRAY OF UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THEIR UNKNOWN IMPACT ON SMARTPHONE VOLUMES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT OUR REVENUE OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020.  CIRRUS LOGIC MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WITH NUMEROUS STRATEGIC INITIATIVES THAT WE BELIEVE POSITION THE COMPANY FOR GROWTH IN THE COMING YEARS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $206.7 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2019  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET INCOME, OFFSET BY A  $23.4 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN PAYABLES AND AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $318.7 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2018  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET INCOME AND A  $29.1 MILLION  FAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE FAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES DURING THE PERIOD.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS  $369.8 MILLION  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW DURING FISCAL YEAR  2017  WAS RELATED TO THE CASH COMPONENTS OF OUR NET  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCOME, OFFSET BY A  $24.9 MILLION  UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE UNFAVORABLE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES DURING THE PERIOD.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , THE COMPANY USED  $54.7 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $28.0 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $35.8 MILLION  .  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , THE COMPANY USED APPROXIMATELY  $184.7 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO  $100.2 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $59.3 MILLION  .  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PURCHASED CERTAIN TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR  $25.2 MILLION  AS PART OF A TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , THE COMPANY USED APPROXIMATELY  $69.9 MILLION  IN CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $18.6 MILLION  IN NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS OF  $51.3 MILLION.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , THE COMPANY USED  $171.5 MILLION  RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , THE COMPANY USED  $249.6 MILLION  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR  2017  , THE COMPANY USED  $117.5 MILLION  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  PAYMENTS AGAINST REVOLVER BALANCES IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  WERE  ZERO  ,  $60.0 MILLION  AND  $100.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  SEE NOTE 7 AND  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW FOR MORE INFORMATION RELATING TO DEBT AGREEMENTS AND TERMS THAT EXISTED DURING THE PERIODS.  ADDITIONALLY, IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  , AND  2017  , THE COMPANY UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY  $160.0 MILLION  ,  $175.8 MILLION  , AND  $15.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN CASH TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE PORTIONS OF ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  SEE NOTE 13 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS.  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE RATE OF SALES GROWTH, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES OR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  WE BELIEVE OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CASH EARNINGS, EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, ALTHOUGH WE COULD BE REQUIRED, OR COULD ELECT, TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING PRIOR TO THAT TIME.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON JULY 12, 2016, CIRRUS LOGIC ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO, FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFINANCING AN EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROVIDING ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND THE NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IN ADDITION TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. YOU SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY DUE TO COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A. \"RISK FACTORS  \"  AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE FACTORS MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT. SEE THE SECTION TITLED \"CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\" THAT APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN PROVIDING SERVICE ASSURANCE AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS THAT ARE USED BY CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE TO ASSURE THEIR DIGITAL BUSINESS SERVICES AGAINST DISRUPTION.  SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, RELY ON OUR SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE THE VISIBILITY NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE NETWORK PERFORMANCE, ENSURE THE DELIVERY OF HIGH-QUALITY, MISSION-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES, GAIN TIMELY INSIGHT INTO THE END USER EXPERIENCE AND PROTECT THE NETWORK FROM ATTACK. WITH OUR OFFERINGS, CUSTOMERS CAN QUICKLY, EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY IDENTIFY AND RESOLVE ISSUES THAT RESULT IN DOWNTIME, INTERRUPTIONS TO SERVICES, POOR SERVICE QUALITY OR COMPROMISED SECURITY, THEREBY DRIVING COMPELLING RETURNS ON THEIR INVESTMENTS IN THEIR NETWORK AND BROADER TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE MIX AND QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD, PRICING, COSTS OF MATERIALS USED IN OUR PRODUCTS, GROWTH IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, AND THE EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS. FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAXIMIZE OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO INTRODUCE AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE MARKETPLACE ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE NEW OR ENHANCED PRODUCTS, CONTINUED EXPANSION INTO INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS, COMPETITION, SUCCESSFUL ACQUISITION INTEGRATION EFFORTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE EXPENSE REDUCTIONS AND MAKE IMPROVEMENTS IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY.  RESULTS OVERVIEW  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY LOWER SPENDING BY CUSTOMERS IN THE SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMER SEGMENT FOR BOTH SERVICE ASSURANCE AND DDOS SOLUTIONS, AND THE TIMING OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2018.  OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE REMAINED FLAT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS COMPARED WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET LOSS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $73.3 MILLION  , AS COMPARED WITH NET INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  OF  $79.8 MILLION  , RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF $153.1 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $78.9 MILLION DECREASE IN THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT, A $35.9 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS, A $13.5 MILLION INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DUE TO THE VOLUNTARY SEPARATION PROGRAM, A $13.5 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS DRAWN DOWN ON THE CREDIT FACILITY AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND A $9.5 MILLION LOSS ON THE DIVESTITURE OF THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS  DURING THE  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET $9.0 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF A DECREASE IN HEADCOUNT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $487.0 MILLION  . THIS REPRESENTS AN  INCREASE  OF  $39.2 MILLION  OVER THE PREVIOUS FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $149.8 MILLION IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $50.0 MILLION USED TO REPAY LONG-TERM DEBT, $23.4 MILLION USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, $14.5 MILLION USED TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND $11.9 MILLION USED FOR TAX WITHHOLDINGS ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE SUPPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) FINANCIAL MEASURES WE REPORT IN QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS, INVESTOR PRESENTATIONS AND OTHER INVESTOR COMMUNICATIONS BY REPORTING THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP MEASURES: NON-GAAP TOTAL REVENUE, NON-GAAP PRODUCT REVENUE, NON-GAAP SERVICE REVENUE, NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT, NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN, NON-GAAP EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (EBITDA) FROM OPERATIONS, NON-GAAP NET INCOME, AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER SHARE (DILUTED). NON-GAAP REVENUE (TOTAL, PRODUCT AND SERVICE) ELIMINATES THE GAAP EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS BY ADDING BACK REVENUE RELATED TO DEFERRED REVENUE REVALUATION, AS WELL AS REVENUE IMPACTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS AND ALSO REMOVES EXPENSES RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATING TO ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING DEPRECIATION COSTS, COMPENSATION FOR POST-COMBINATION SERVICES AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION COSTS AND ADDS BACK TRANSITIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENT INCOME. NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED ADJUSTMENTS AND ALSO REMOVES RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LOSS ON DIVESTITURE AND COSTS RELATED TO NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION. NON-GAAP EBITDA FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDES THE AFOREMENTIONED ITEMS RELATED TO NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND ALSO REMOVES NON-ACQUISITION-RELATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. NON-GAAP NET INCOME INCLUDES THE FOREGOING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO NON-GAAP INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, NET OF RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECTS IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISIONAL ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (TCJA) WHILE REMOVING TRANSITIONAL SERVICE AGREEMENT INCOME AND CHANGES IN CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION. NON-GAAP DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE ALSO EXCLUDES THESE EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE RELATED IMPACT OF ALL THESE ADJUSTMENTS ON THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE FOR MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP (REVENUE, GROSS PROFIT, OPERATING PROFIT, NET INCOME (LOSS) AND DILUTED NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE), AND MAY HAVE LIMITATIONS IN THAT THEY DO NOT REFLECT ALL OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD ONLY BE USED TO EVALUATE OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURES. THE PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP INFORMATION IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, IN ISOLATION FROM, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ENHANCE THE READER'S OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND OUR PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE BY PROVIDING A HIGHER DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES AND PROVIDING A LEVEL OF DISCLOSURE THAT HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND HOW WE PLAN AND MEASURE OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AFFORDS INVESTORS A VIEW OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS THAT MAY BE MORE EASILY COMPARED WITH OUR PEER COMPANIES AND ALSO ENABLES INVESTORS TO CONSIDER OUR OPERATING RESULTS ON BOTH A GAAP AND NON-GAAP BASIS DURING AND FOLLOWING THE INTEGRATION PERIOD OF OUR ACQUISITIONS.

WE APPLY SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND CREATE ESTIMATES WHEN APPLYING THESE POLICIES.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT AND USE ESTIMATES IN CONNECTION WITH DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCT AND SERVICES REVENUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EACH ACCOUNTING PERIOD.  WE DERIVE REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF NETWORK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS FOR SERVICE PROVIDER AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS, WHICH INCLUDE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCT SALES CONSIST OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS WITH EMBEDDED SOFTWARE THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO PROVIDING CUSTOMERS THE INTENDED FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO SELL SOFTWARE OFFERINGS DECOUPLED FROM THE UNDERLYING HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY.  WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE ONCE A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE PARTIES AND THE RELATED PROMISES TO TRANSFER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED. A CONTRACT IS DEFINED TO US AS AN ARRANGEMENT WITH COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE IDENTIFYING PAYMENT TERMS, EACH PARTY\u2019S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS REGARDING THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TO BE TRANSFERRED AND THE AMOUNT WE DEEM PROBABLE OF COLLECTION. CUSTOMER CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE PROMISES TO TRANSFER MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER. DETERMINING WHETHER THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY OR AS ONE COMBINED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  PRODUCT REVENUE IS TYPICALLY RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT, PROVIDED A LEGALLY ENFORCEABLE CONTRACT EXISTS, CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND IN THE CASE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS THE RIGHTS AND ABILITY TO ACCESS THE SOFTWARE, AND COLLECTION OF THE RELATED RECEIVABLE IS PROBABLE. IF ANY SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS TO THE CUSTOMER REMAIN POST-DELIVERY, TYPICALLY INVOLVING OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO INSTALLATION AND ACCEPTANCE BY THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN FULFILLED. OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS INCLUDE INSTALLATION, INTEGRATION, EXTENDED WARRANTY AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES, POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT, STAND-READY SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (SAAS) AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDING CONSULTING AND TRAINING. WE GENERALLY PROVIDE SOFTWARE AND/OR HARDWARE SUPPORT AS PART OF PRODUCT SALES. REVENUE RELATED TO THE INITIAL BUNDLED SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE SUPPORT IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SUPPORT PERIOD. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMERS CAN ELECT TO PURCHASE EXTENDED SUPPORT AGREEMENTS FOR PERIODS AFTER THE INITIAL SOFTWARE/HARDWARE WARRANTY EXPIRATION. SUPPORT SERVICES GENERALLY INCLUDE RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES (WHEN AND IF AVAILABLE), TELEPHONE AND INTERNET-BASED SUPPORT, UPDATES, BUG FIXES AND HARDWARE REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT. CONSULTING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OR COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACT. REIMBURSEMENTS OF OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH PROVIDING CONSULTING SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN SERVICES REVENUE, WITH THE OFFSETTING EXPENSE RECORDED IN COST OF SERVICE REVENUE. TRAINING SERVICES INCLUDE ON-SITE AND CLASSROOM TRAINING. TRAINING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE TRAINING.  GENERALLY, OUR CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR INDIVIDUALLY. HOWEVER, WHEN CONTRACTS ARE CLOSELY INTERRELATED AND DEPENDENT ON EACH OTHER, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR TWO OR MORE CONTRACTS AS ONE TO REFLECT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE GROUP OF CONTRACTS.  BUNDLED ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONCURRENT CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS THAT MAY BE DELIVERED AT VARIOUS POINTS IN TIME. WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN AN AMOUNT THAT DEPICTS THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES (SSP) OF EACH OBLIGATION. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE SSP FOR EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE USE A RANGE OF AMOUNTS TO ESTIMATE SSP WHEN WE SELL EACH OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SEPARATELY BASED ON THE ELEMENT\u2019S HISTORICAL PRICING. WE ALSO CONSIDER OUR OVERALL PRICING OBJECTIVES AND PRACTICES ACROSS DIFFERENT SALES CHANNELS AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. GENERALLY, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SSP FOR A MAJORITY OF OUR SERVICE ELEMENTS BASED ON HISTORICAL STANDALONE SALES. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED SSP FOR SERVICES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF PROFITABILITY AND THE UNDERLYING COST TO FULFILL THOSE SERVICES. FURTHER, FOR CERTAIN SERVICE ENGAGEMENTS, WE CONSIDER QUOTED PRICES AS PART OF MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS OF THOSE ENGAGEMENTS AS A BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING SSP. SSP HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR PRODUCT ELEMENTS AS THE AVERAGE OR MEDIAN SELLING PRICE THE ELEMENT WAS RECENTLY SOLD FOR, WHETHER SOLD ALONE OR SOLD AS PART OF A MULTIPLE ELEMENT TRANSACTION. WE REVIEW SALES OF THE PRODUCT ELEMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND UPDATE, WHEN APPROPRIATE, SSP FOR SUCH ELEMENTS TO ENSURE THAT IT REFLECTS RECENT PRICING EXPERIENCE. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THROUGH ALLIANCES WITH RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS. REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A SELL-IN BASIS; THAT IS, WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT TRANSFERS TO THE RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR. WE RECORD CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO A RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE RECORDED REVENUE FROM THE RESELLER OR DISTRIBUTOR. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, OUR RETURN POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW PRODUCT RETURNS FOR A REFUND. RETURNS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT TO DATE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A HISTORY OF SUCCESSFULLY COLLECTING RECEIVABLES FROM OUR RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  WE MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXCHANGE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR AN ASSET IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET FOR THE ASSET IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AND HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 1 OR 2 WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BY LEVEL 1 INPUTS UTILIZE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACCESSIBLE ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BY LEVEL 2 INPUTS UTILIZE DATA POINTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES, INTEREST RATES AND YIELD CURVES.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OTHER ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE ACCOUNTING ITEMS  WE AMORTIZE ACQUIRED DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT SUBJECT TO ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS; MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR THAT WOULD INDICATE A POTENTIAL DECLINE IN THEIR FAIR VALUE. WE PERFORM THE ASSESSMENT ANNUALLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS IF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARISE. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTING UNITS: (1) SERVICE ASSURANCE AND (2) SECURITY.  TO TEST IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTENCE OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED. IF BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, IF WE CONCLUDE OTHERWISE, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NOT REQUIRED. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS FOR GOODWILL. WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL USING ESTABLISHED INCOME AND MARKET VALUATION APPROACHES. GOODWILL WAS ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY, OR ON AN INTERIM BASIS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD, MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. TO TEST IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EXISTENCE OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE IS IMPAIRED. IF BASED ON OUR QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT WE CONCLUDE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS NOT REQUIRED. WE COMPLETED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AT JANUARY 31, 2019 USING THE QUALITATIVE STEP 0 ASSESSMENT. NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS WERE OBSERVED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMPLETED TWO ACQUISITIONS AND ONE DIVESTITURE DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING REQUIRES AN ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THESE TRANSACTIONS. IN ORDER TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE USE A RELIEF FROM ROYALTY MODEL WHICH REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE: FUTURE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, A ROYALTY RATE WHICH A MARKET PARTICIPANT WOULD PAY RELATED TO THE PROJECTED REVENUE STREAM, A PRESENT VALUE FACTOR WHICH APPROXIMATES A RISK ADJUSTED RATE OF RETURN FOR A MARKET PARTICIPANT PURCHASING THE ASSETS, AND A TECHNOLOGY MIGRATION CURVE REPRESENTING A PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH THE TECHNOLOGY ASSETS OR SOME PORTION THEREOF ARE STILL BEING USED. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO DEVELOP THE FAIR VALUE FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THESE TRANSACTIONS WHICH REQUIRES THAT WE CREATE ESTIMATES FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS: A PROJECTION OF FUTURE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUIRED COMPANY'S EXISTING CUSTOMERS, A TURNOVER RATE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS, A MARGIN RELATED TO THOSE SALES, AND A RISK ADJUSTED RATE OF RETURN FOR A MARKET PARTICIPANT PURCHASING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.  WE HAVE A CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR HANDHELD NETWORK TEST (HNT) TOOLS BUSINESS IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET REPRESENTS POTENTIAL FUTURE EARNOUT PAYMENTS TO US OF UP TO $4.0 MILLION OVER TWO YEARS THAT ARE CONTINGENT ON THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS ACHIEVING CERTAIN MILESTONES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OF $2.3 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE ACQUISITION DATE AND WAS MEASURED USING OBSERVABLE (LEVEL 3) INPUTS. THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION ASSET AT MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $0.8 MILLION.  WE HAD A CONTINGENT LIABILITY AT MARCH 31, 2018 FOR $523 THOUSAND RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EFFLUX SYSTEMS, INC. (EFFLUX) IN JULY 2017 FOR WHICH AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER DAMAGES WE MAY HAVE SUFFERED RELATED TO ANY LIABILITIES THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO ASSUME OR AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER AS DESCRIBED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE $523 THOUSAND WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN JULY 2018.  WE HAD A CONTINGENT LIABILITY AT MARCH 31, 2018 FOR $4.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF SIMENA LLC (SIMENA) IN NOVEMBER 2011, WHICH WAS BASED ON THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION, AND THE FORMER OWNERS' FUTURE PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT WITH US. THE CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF $5.0 MILLION WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN NOVEMBER 2018.  WE HAD $660 THOUSAND OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF AVVASI INCORPORATED (AVVASI) IN AUGUST 2016 FOR WHICH AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WAS ESTABLISHED TO COVER DAMAGES WE MAY HAVE SUFFERED RELATED TO ANY LIABILITIES THAT WE DID NOT AGREE TO ASSUME OR AS A RESULT OF THE BREACH OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER AS DESCRIBED IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE $660 THOUSAND WAS PAID TO THE SELLER IN AUGUST 2017.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS, WE RECOGNIZE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION NET OF AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED FORFEITURE RATE AND ONLY RECOGNIZE EXPENSE FOR THOSE SHARES EXPECTED TO VEST. IF OUR ACTUAL FORFEITURE RATE IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR ESTIMATE, THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE ASSUMED AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF 0% FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR DIRECTORS, AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 2% FOR AWARDS GRANTED TO OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES, AND AN ANNUALIZED FORFEITURE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 5% FOR ALL REMAINING EMPLOYEES. WE WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL EXPENSE IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE LOWER THAN ESTIMATED AND WILL RECORD A RECOVERY OF PRIOR EXPENSE IF THE ACTUAL FORFEITURES ARE HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  REVENUE  PRODUCT REVENUE CONSISTS OF SALES OF OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND LICENSING OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF CUSTOMER SUPPORT AGREEMENTS, CONSULTING, TRAINING AND STAND-READY SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE OFFERINGS.

IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS ON CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE HNT TOOLS BUSINESS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, AND AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $35.9 MILLION DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRUCTURING.

THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJA THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR 2019 TAX RATE INCLUDE THE BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (BEAT), THE DEDUCTION FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME (FDII) AND THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI) INCLUSION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS LOWER THAN THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT, WE RECORDED A SIGNIFICANT TAX BENEFIT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THIS BENEFIT HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE TAX RATE DUE TO LOSSES GENERATED IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY PROVISIONS UNDER THE TCJA, WHICH WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THAT IMPACT US. THE FINAL IMPACT OF THE TCJA, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES REPORTED AT DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE KEY CHANGES FROM THE TCJA THAT WERE REPORTED AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 ARE THE IMPACT DUE TO THE REDUCED U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%, A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS ON WHICH U.S. INCOME TAX WAS DEFERRED, ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE UNDER BEAT, A DEDUCTION FOR FDII, AN INCOME INCLUSION UNDER GILTI AND THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITY DEDUCTION.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO RECORD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE ENACTED TAX RATE WHICH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, ANY U.S. RELATED DEFERRED TAXES WERE RE-MEASURED FROM 35.0% DOWN TO 21.0% BASED ON THE RECORDED BALANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATE RELATED TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX BALANCES, WHICH WAS A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $87 MILLION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE FINALIZED OUR CALCULATION AND DID NOT ADJUST OUR ESTIMATE RECORDED.  ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO CALCULATE A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX BASED ON OUR TOTAL POST-1986 FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' EARNINGS AND PROFITS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FROM U.S. INCOME TAXES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECORDED AN ESTIMATE RELATED TO THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR WE FINALIZED OUR CALCULATION AND DID NOT ADJUST OUR ESTIMATE RECORDED.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE TAX ON THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (GILTI). WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION OF EITHER (1) TREATING TAXES DUE ON FUTURE U.S. INCLUSIONS IN TAXABLE INCOME RELATED TO GILTI AS A CURRENT PERIOD  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (THE \"PERIOD COST METHOD\") OR (2) FACTORING SUCH AMOUNTS INTO OUR MEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAXES (THE \"DEFERRED METHOD\"). WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT TAXES DUE ON FUTURE U.S. INCLUSIONS IN TAXABLE INCOME RELATED TO GILTI AS A CURRENT PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED (THE \"PERIOD COST METHOD\").  AS A RESULT OF TCJA WE EXPECT THAT CURRENT AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS MAY BE REPATRIATED TAX EFFICIENTLY. AFTER FULLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE TCJA, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL NOT BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED WHERE WE CAN REPATRIATE THOSE EARNINGS IN A TAX EFFICIENT MANNER ACCEPTABLE TO MANAGEMENT AND WHICH COMPLY WITH LOCAL STATUTORY AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE INTEND A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY TAXED HISTORICAL EARNINGS BECAUSE OF TCJA WHICH CAN BE REPATRIATED IN A TAX EFFICIENT MANNER. WE CONTINUE TO ASSERT THAT ANY REMAINDER OF ITS HISTORICAL BOOK BASIS IN EXCESS OF TAX BASIS WILL BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED U.S. TAXES ON THESE DIFFERENCES.

THE JUDGMENT ALSO AWARDS PRE- AND POST- JUDGMENT INTEREST, AND A RUNNING ROYALTY ON THE G10 AND GEOBLADE PRODUCTS UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE PATENTS AT ISSUE, THE LAST DATE BEING JUNE 2022. THE COURT DENIED THE PLAINTIFF'S MOTION FOR FEES. FOLLOWING THE ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, WE FILED MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, SEEKING TO BOTH OVERTURN THE VERDICT AND TO REDUCE DAMAGES. WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE RISK OF LOSS FROM THIS MATTER IS CURRENTLY NEITHER REMOTE NOR PROBABLE, AND THEREFORE, UNDER GAAP DEFINITIONS, THE RISK OF LOSS IS TERMED \"REASONABLY POSSIBLE\".

ADDITIONALLY, A PORTION OF OUR CASH MAY BE USED TO ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES OR PRODUCTS OR TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF SUCH BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGIES. IF OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES. THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.

WE THEN DISCUSS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. NEXT, WE DISCUSS OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, AND FOR FISCAL 2018 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2017, WHICH ARE FOLLOWED BY AN ANALYSIS OF LIQUIDITY CHANGES IN OUR BALANCE SHEETS AND CASH FLOWS, AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS IN THE SECTIONS ENTITLED LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND DISCLOSURES ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS. WE CONCLUDE THIS MD&A BY DISCUSSING OUR OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020.  THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE OTHER SECTIONS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING ITEM 1: BUSINESS, ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA AND ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THIS MD&A CONTAIN A NUMBER OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AS DISCUSSED UNDER THE CAPTION, CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES AND RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS ANNUAL REPORT AND PARTICULARLY UNDER THE SECTION ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  AMERCO HAS A FISCAL YEAR THAT ENDS ON THE 31  ST  OF MARCH FOR EACH YEAR THAT IS REFERENCED. OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES HAVE FISCAL YEARS THAT END ON THE 31  ST  OF DECEMBER FOR EACH YEAR THAT IS REFERENCED. THEY HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED ON THAT BASIS. OUR INSURANCE COMPANIES\u2019 FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESSES CONFORM TO CALENDAR YEAR REPORTING AS REQUIRED BY STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT CONSOLIDATING THEIR CALENDAR YEAR INTO OUR FISCAL YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DOES NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DISCLOSE ALL MATERIAL EVENTS, IF ANY, OCCURRING DURING THE INTERVENING PERIOD. CONSEQUENTLY, ALL REFERENCES TO OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 YEARS 2018, 2017 AND 2016 CORRESPOND TO FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017 FOR AMERCO.  OVERALL STRATEGY  OUR OVERALL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN \u201cDO-IT-YOURSELF\u201d MOVING AND STORAGE INDUSTRY. WE ACCOMPLISH THIS BY PROVIDING A SEAMLESS AND INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN TO THE \u201cDO-IT-YOURSELF\u201d MOVING AND STORAGE MARKET. AS PART OF EXECUTING THIS STRATEGY, WE LEVERAGE THE BRAND RECOGNITION OF U-HAUL  WITH OUR FULL LINE OF MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE CONVENIENCE OF OUR BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PRESENCE.  OUR PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A WIDE SELECTION OF MOVING RENTAL EQUIPMENT, CONVENIENT SELF-STORAGE RENTAL FACILITIES AND PORTABLE MOVING AND STORAGE UNITS AND RELATED MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING SEGMENT  LIFE INSURANCE PROVIDES LIFE AND HEALTH INSURANCE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO THE SENIOR MARKET THROUGH THE DIRECT WRITING AND REINSURING OF LIFE INSURANCE, MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT AND ANNUITY POLICIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE UNITED STATES. THE METHODS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WE USE IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE RESULTS WE REPORT IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NOTE 3, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARIZES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE US TO MAKE DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO ESTIMATE MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.  FOLLOWING IS A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE DEEM MOST CRITICAL TO US AND THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT AND SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OBSERVANCE OF TRENDS IN PARTICULAR AREAS, INFORMATION AND VALUATIONS AVAILABLE FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL AMOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.  17  WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POLICIES THAT WE CONSIDER KEY ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SUCH AS REVENUE RECOGNITION; HOWEVER, THESE POLICIES DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, BECAUSE THEY DO NOT GENERALLY REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT OR SUBJECTIVE. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE DEEM MOST CRITICAL TO US, AND INVOLVE THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  WE APPLY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 810 -  CONSOLIDATION  (\u201cASC 810\u201d) IN OUR PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION. ASC 810 ADDRESSES ARRANGEMENTS WHERE A COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING OR SIMILAR INTERESTS OF A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (\u201cVIE\u201d). A COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE A VIE IF IT HAS DETERMINED IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. ASC 810 ALSO ADDRESSES THE POLICY WHEN A COMPANY OWNS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTING OR SIMILAR RIGHTS AND EXERCISES EFFECTIVE CONTROL.  A VIE IS NOT SELF-SUPPORTIVE DUE TO HAVING ONE OR BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS: (I) IT HAS AN INSUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF EQUITY FOR IT TO FINANCE ITS ACTIVITIES WITHOUT RECEIVING ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED FINANCIAL SUPPORT OR (II) ITS OWNERS DO NOT HOLD THE TYPICAL RISKS AND RIGHTS OF EQUITY OWNERS. THIS DETERMINATION IS MADE UPON THE CREATION OF A VARIABLE INTEREST AND IS RE-ASSESSED ON AN ON-GOING BASIS SHOULD CERTAIN CHANGES IN THE OPERATIONS OF A VIE, OR ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY TRIGGER A RECONSIDERATION. AFTER A RECONSIDERATION EVENT OCCURS THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UTILIZED IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY IS A VIE, WHICH OTHER COMPANY(IES) HAVE A VARIABLE INTEREST IN THE ENTITY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE COMPANY\u2019S INTEREST IS SUCH THAT IT IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. DETERMINATION OF THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, IF ANY, IS BASED ON A) THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES OF A VIE THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIE\u2019S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, AND B) THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OF THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE OTHER ENTITIES REGARDING WHO IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, WHICH COULD CHANGE BASED ON FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF ANY RECONSIDERATION EVENTS.  RECOVERABILITY OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  OUR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST. INTEREST EXPENSE, IF ANY, INCURRED DURING THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS IS CONSIDERED PART OF COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE OR AN ACCELERATED METHOD BASED ON A DECLINING BALANCE FORMULA OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: RENTAL EQUIPMENT 2-20 YEARS AND BUILDINGS AND NON-RENTAL EQUIPMENT 3-55 YEARS. ROUTINE MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATING EXPENSE AS THEY ARE INCURRED. GAINS AND LOSSES ON DISPOSITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER THAN REAL ESTATE (\u201cPERSONAL PROPERTY\u201d), ARE NETTED AGAINST DEPRECIATION EXPENSE WHEN REALIZED. EQUIPMENT DEPRECIATION IS RECOGNIZED IN AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN THE RECOVERY OF ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES UPON DISPOSAL, I.E., MINIMIZE GAINS OR LOSSES. IN DETERMINING THE DEPRECIATION RATE, HISTORICAL DISPOSAL EXPERIENCE, HOLDING PERIODS AND TRENDS IN THE MARKET FOR VEHICLES ARE REVIEWED. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN IRS REGULATIONS REGARDING THE CAPITALIZATION OF ASSETS, BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017, WE RAISED THE VALUE THRESHOLD BEFORE CERTAIN ASSETS ARE CAPITALIZED WITHIN OUR DEPRECIATION POLICY. THIS CHANGE IN THRESHOLD, RESULTS IN THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF REPORTED OPERATING COSTS WITH A LAGGING DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE TERM THAT THESE ASSETS WOULD HAVE BEEN DEPRECIATED. THIS CHANGE IN THRESHOLD BENEFITED US THROUGH THE IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION OF TAX DEDUCTIBLE COSTS.  WE REGULARLY PERFORM REVIEWS TO DETERMINE WHETHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST WHICH INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ASSETS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL VALUE, MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE OR THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF ASSETS ARE SHORTER OR LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED. REDUCTIONS IN RESIDUAL VALUES (I.E., THE PRICE AT WHICH WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO DISPOSE OF REVENUE EARNING EQUIPMENT) OR USEFUL LIVES WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT. REVIEWS ARE PERFORMED BASED ON VEHICLE CLASS, GENERALLY SUBCATEGORIES OF TRUCKS AND TRAILERS. WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR ASSETS BY COMPARING THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELATED ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED REMAINING LIVES AGAINST THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS. WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET PRICE TRENDS ON USED VEHICLES AND THE EXPECTED LIFE OF VEHICLES INCLUDED IN THE FLEET. IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE ASSETS. IF ASSET RESIDUAL VALUES ARE DETERMINED TO BE RECOVERABLE, BUT THE USEFUL LIVES ARE SHORTER OR LONGER THAN ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, THE NET BOOK VALUE OF THE ASSETS IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE NEWLY DETERMINED REMAINING USEFUL LIVES.  18  FOR OUR BOX TRUCK FLEET WE UTILIZE AN ACCELERATED METHOD OF DEPRECIATION BASED UPON A DECLINING FORMULA. UNDER THE DECLINING BALANCES METHOD (2.4 TIMES DECLINING BALANCE), THE BOOK VALUE OF A RENTAL TRUCK IS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY 16%, 13%, 11%, 9%, 8%, 7%, AND 6% OF COST DURING YEARS ONE THROUGH SEVEN, RESPECTIVELY, AND THEN REDUCED ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS TO A SALVAGE VALUE OF 15% BY THE END OF YEAR FIFTEEN. COMPARATIVELY, A STANDARD STRAIGHT LINE APPROACH WOULD REDUCE THE BOOK VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 5.7% PER YEAR OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUCK.  ALTHOUGH WE INTEND TO SELL OUR USED VEHICLES FOR PRICES APPROXIMATING BOOK VALUE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REALIZE A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE SALE OF USED VEHICLES IS DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE GENERAL STATE OF THE USED VEHICLE MARKET, THE AGE AND CONDITION OF THE VEHICLE AT THE TIME OF ITS DISPOSAL AND THE DEPRECIATION RATES WITH RESPECT TO THE VEHICLE.  WE TYPICALLY SELL OUR USED VEHICLES AT OUR SALES CENTERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, ON OUR WEBSITE AT UHAUL.COM/TRUCKSALES OR BY PHONE AT 1-866-404-0355. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL A LARGE PORTION OF OUR PICKUP AND CARGO VAN FLEET AT AUTOMOBILE DEALER AUCTIONS.  INSURANCE RESERVES  LIABILITIES FOR LIFE INSURANCE AND CERTAIN ANNUITY AND HEALTH POLICIES ARE ESTABLISHED TO MEET THE ESTIMATED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS OF POLICIES IN FORCE, AND ARE BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY AND WITHDRAWAL ASSUMPTIONS FROM RECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL TABLES WHICH CONTAIN MARGINS FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION. IN ADDITION, LIABILITIES FOR HEALTH, DISABILITY AND OTHER POLICIES INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR REPORTED LOSSES AND ESTIMATES OF LOSSES INCURRED, BUT NOT YET REPORTED (\u201cIBNR\u201d). LIABILITIES FOR ANNUITY CONTRACTS CONSIST OF CONTRACT ACCOUNT BALANCES THAT ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE POLICYHOLDERS.  INSURANCE RESERVES FOR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE AND U-HAUL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOSSES INCURRED BASED UPON ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES AND ARE MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST APPROXIMATION OF FUTURE PAYMENTS.  THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON PAST CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT CLAIM TRENDS AS WELL AS SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS CHANGES IN LEGAL THEORIES AND INFLATION.  THESE RESERVES CONSIST OF CASE RESERVES FOR REPORTED LOSSES AND A PROVISION FOR IBNR LOSSES, BOTH REDUCED BY APPLICABLE REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, RESULTING IN A NET LIABILITY.  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS AND HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DETERMINATION OF THE LIABILITY FOR FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS AND CLAIMS, THE AMOUNTS TO BE ULTIMATELY PAID TO SETTLE THESE LIABILITIES CANNOT BE PRECISELY DETERMINED AND MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY, ESPECIALLY FOR LONG-TAILED CASUALTY LINES OF BUSINESS SUCH AS EXCESS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE LONG-TAILED NATURE OF THE EXCESS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION POLICIES WRITTEN BY REPWEST FROM 1983 THROUGH 2001, IT MAY TAKE A NUMBER OF YEARS FOR CLAIMS TO BE FULLY REPORTED AND FINALLY SETTLED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS INSURANCE RESERVE ADEQUACY IS REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE IF EXISTING ASSUMPTIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED. IN DETERMINING THE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CALCULATING WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RESERVES, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  CLAIMANT LONGEVITY,  COST TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH CLAIMANT TREATMENTS,  CHANGES IN CEDING ENTITY AND THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR REPORTING PRACTICES,  CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INCLUDING LEGAL AND REGULATORY,  CURRENT CONDITIONS AFFECTING CLAIM SETTLEMENTS, AND  FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING INFLATION.  WE HAVE RESERVED EACH CLAIM BASED UPON THE ACCUMULATION OF CURRENT CLAIM COSTS PROJECTED THROUGH EACH CLAIMANT\u2019S LIFE EXPECTANCY, AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR APPLICABLE REINSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.  MANAGEMENT REVIEWS EACH CLAIM BI-ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY, IF THERE ARE CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES TO DETERMINE IF THE ESTIMATED LIFE-TIME CLAIM COSTS HAVE INCREASED AND THEN ADJUSTS THE RESERVE ESTIMATE ACCORDINGLY AT THAT TIME.  WE HAVE FACTORED IN AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL COST INCREASES COULD BE IN OUR IBNR LIABILITY.  WE HAVE NOT ASSUMED SETTLEMENT OF THE EXISTING CLAIMS IN CALCULATING THE RESERVE AMOUNT, UNLESS IT IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF COMPLETION.  19  CONTINUED INCREASES IN CLAIM COSTS, INCLUDING MEDICAL INFLATION AND NEW TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS COULD LEAD TO FUTURE ADVERSE DEVELOPMENT RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL RESERVE STRENGTHENING.  CONVERSELY, SETTLEMENT OF EXISTING CLAIMS OR IF INJURED WORKERS RETURN TO WORK OR EXPIRE PREMATURELY, COULD LEAD TO FUTURE POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT.  IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENTS  INVESTMENTS ARE EVALUATED PURSUANT TO GUIDANCE CONTAINED IN ASC 320 -  INVESTMENTS - DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES  TO DETERMINE IF AND WHEN A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE BELOW AMORTIZED COST IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT MAKES CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS IN ITS ASSESSMENT INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: OUR ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE SECURITY, QUOTED MARKET PRICES, DEALER QUOTES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, INDUSTRY FACTORS, FINANCIAL FACTORS, AND ISSUER SPECIFIC INFORMATION SUCH AS CREDIT STRENGTH. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IN VALUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OPERATING RESULTS. THERE WERE NO WRITE DOWNS IN FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017.  INCOME TAXES  WE FILE A CONSOLIDATED TAX RETURN WITH ALL OF OUR LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR TAX RETURNS ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED BY VARIOUS TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS MAY CAUSE CHANGES THAT COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. PLEASE SEE NOTE 13, PROVISION FOR TAXES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION.  FAIR VALUES  FAIR VALUES OF CASH EQUIVALENTS APPROXIMATE CARRYING VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT PERIOD OF TIME TO MATURITY. FAIR VALUES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MORTGAGE LOANS AND NOTES ON REAL ESTATE, AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES, DEALER QUOTES OR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FAIR VALUES OF TRADE RECEIVABLES APPROXIMATE THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE EXPOSED TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK CONSIST PRIMARILY OF TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS, TRADE RECEIVABLES, REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES AND NOTES RECEIVABLE. LIMITED CREDIT RISK EXISTS ON TRADE RECEIVABLES DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS BROAD GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS. WE PLACE OUR TEMPORARY CASH INVESTMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION.  WE HAVE MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES, WHICH POTENTIALLY EXPOSE US TO CREDIT RISK. THE PORTFOLIO OF NOTES IS PRINCIPALLY COLLATERALIZED BY SELF-STORAGE FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES. WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY MATERIAL LOSSES RELATED TO THE NOTES FROM INDIVIDUAL OR GROUPS OF NOTES IN ANY PARTICULAR INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHIC AREA. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED USING THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD AND USING INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY OFFERED FOR SIMILAR LOANS TO BORROWERS WITH SIMILAR CREDIT RATINGS.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS ARE ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE AS THE ACTUAL INTEREST RATE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE ESTIMATED TO BE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR DEBT OF SIMILAR TERM AND REMAINING MATURITY.  OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CURRENT OR BEAR REASONABLE INTEREST RATES. AS A RESULT, THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  PLEASE SEE NOTE 22, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  PLEASE SEE NOTE 3, ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  20  AMERCO AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES  FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018  LISTED BELOW, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, ARE REVENUES FOR OUR MAJOR PRODUCT LINES FOR FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018.

DURING FISCAL 2019 WE EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED LOCATIONS ALONG WITH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, AND INCREASED THE NUMBER OF TRUCKS, TRAILERS AND TOWING DEVICES IN OUR RENTAL FLEET.  IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS WE SAW REVENUE IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR CORPORATE ACCOUNT BUSINESS.  REVENUE AND TRANSACTIONS FOR BOTH THE ONE-WAY AND IN-TOWN MARKETS IMPROVED COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018.  SELF-STORAGE REVENUES INCREASED $43.4 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  THE AVERAGE MONTHLY AMOUNT OF OCCUPIED SQUARE FEET INCREASED BY 12.0% DURING FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE GROWTH IN REVENUES AND SQUARE FEET RENTED COMES FROM A COMBINATION OF IMPROVED RATES PER SQUARE FOOT, OCCUPANCY GAINS AT EXISTING LOCATIONS AND FROM THE ADDITION OF NEW FACILITIES TO THE PORTFOLIO. OVER THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS, WE ADDED APPROXIMATELY 5.3 MILLION NET RENTABLE SQUARE FEET, A 17.0% INCREASE, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILLION OF THAT OCCURRING ON DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  SALES OF SELF-MOVING AND SELF-STORAGE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $2.6 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY FROM THE SALES OF MOVING SUPPLIES AND PROPANE.  LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS DECREASED $91.2 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OXFORD AGREED TO TERMINATE A REINSURANCE CONTRACT WITH ONE OF OUR REINSURERS (\u201cREINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION\u201d). AS A RESULT THERE WAS A ONE-TIME DECREASE IN LIFE INSURANCE PREMIUMS OF $78.4 MILLION DUE TO THE TRANSFER OF LIABILITIES TO THE REINSURER FOR TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT, ALONG WITH DECREASED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS INCREASED $3.8 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAFETOW  \u00ae  AND SAFESTOR  \u00ae  SALES WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH INCREASED EQUIPMENT AND STORAGE RENTAL TRANSACTIONS.  NET INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $0.5 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO A LARGER INVESTED ASSET BASE AT OUR LIFE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY. UPDATED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOW REQUIRES CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SECURITIES HELD FOR INVESTMENT AT OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME. THIS ACCOUNTED FOR A $5.7 MILLION DECREASE IN FISCAL 2019.  OTHER REVENUE INCREASED $35.3 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, CAUSED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN OUR U-BOX  \u00ae  PROGRAM.  21  LISTED BELOW ARE REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AT EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR FISCAL 2019 AND 2018.

THE MOVING AND STORAGE SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR A $203.2 MILLION INCREASE AND OUR INSURANCE SEGMENTS TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED $86.9 MILLION LARGELY DUE TO A ONE-TIME DECREASE OF $76.4 MILLION IN LIFE BENEFITS DUE TO THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION. OPERATING EXPENSES FOR MOVING AND STORAGE INCREASED $180.0 MILLION, LARGELY FROM INCREASED PERSONNEL, MAINTENANCE REPAIRS, SHIPPING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH U-BOX  \u00ae  , BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY TAXES. REPAIR COSTS ACCOUNTED FOR $45.6 MILLION OF THE INCREASE. NET GAINS FROM THE DISPOSAL OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT INCREASED $15.1 MILLION.

MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS DECREASED BY $9.3 MILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN NEW SALES AND DECLINED PREMIUMS ON THE EXISTING BUSINESS OFFSET BY RATE INCREASES ON RENEWAL PREMIUMS. THE REMAINING LINES OF BUSINESS HAD A NET INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION. DEFERRED ANNUITY DEPOSITS WERE $296.8 MILLION OR $93.7 MILLION ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS DEPOSITS RATHER THAN PREMIUMS.  NET INVESTMENT AND INTEREST INCOME WAS $84.2 MILLION AND $77.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS FROM FIXED MATURITIES INCREASED $10.9 MILLION FROM A LARGER INVESTED ASSET BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.3 MILLION DECREASE IN GAINS FROM OUR MORTGAGE LOAN PORTFOLIO.  NET OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $22.1 MILLION AND $22.4 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN COMMISSION EXPENSE FROM DECREASED MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT PREMIUMS.  BENEFITS AND LOSSES EXPENSES WERE FLAT AT $169.3 MILLION FOR BOTH THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016. A DECREASE OF $9.2 MILLION IN MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT BENEFITS FROM AN IMPROVED BENEFIT TO PREMIUM RATIO WAS OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE REMAINING LINES OF BUSINESS. LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS INCREASED $1.6 MILLION WITH INCREASED MORTALITY WHILE INTEREST CREDITED TO POLICYHOLDERS INCREASED BY $7.3 MILLION FROM A LARGER ANNUITY BASE. OTHER BENEFITS INCREASED $0.3 MILLION.  AMORTIZATION OF DAC, SIA AND VOBA WAS $24.5 MILLION AND $26.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL DAC AMORTIZATION IN THE PRIOR YEAR GENERATED BY ADDED GAINS ON DISCOUNTED MORTGAGE LOAN INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASED AMORTIZATION FROM A LARGER DAC ASSET IN FISCAL 2018.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CHANGES IN REVENUES AND EXPENSES, PRETAX EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS WERE $28.0 MILLION AND $27.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE IS A POSITIVE FACTOR THAT WILL ENABLE US TO PURSUE OUR OPERATIONAL PLANS AND GOALS AND PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THERE ARE MANY FACTORS WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING SOME WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OUR OTHER FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $673.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $759.4 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2018. THE ASSETS OF OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY UNAVAILABLE TO FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS OF NON-INSURANCE OPERATIONS (AMERCO, U-HAUL AND REAL ESTATE). AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 (OR AS OTHERWISE INDICATED), CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS (RECEIVABLES, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, OTHER INVESTMENTS, FIXED MATURITIES, AND RELATED PARTY ASSETS) AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WERE.  MOVING & STORAGE  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE (A)  LIFE INSURANCE (A)  (IN THOUSANDS)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $643,918  $5,757  $24,026  OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS  149,842  463,079  2,207,099  DEBT OBLIGATIONS  4,163,323  \u2013  \u2013  (A) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018  30  AT MARCH 31, 2019, MOVING AND STORAGE HAD AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES OF $80.6 MILLION.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS FOR FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017 IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $975,583  $937,684  $1,059,455  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (1,571,136)  (898,304)  (1,183,908)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  514,582  16,604  223,753  EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE ON CASH  (4,716)  5,598  (2,140)  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH FLOW  (85,687)  61,582  97,160  CASH AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD  759,388  697,806  600,646  CASH AT THE END OF THE PERIOD  $673,701  $759,388  $697,806  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $37.9 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 FROM REDUCED FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018, A $64.6 MILLION CASH TRANSFER AS A RESULT OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION IN OUR LIFE INSURANCE SEGMENT DURING FISCAL 2019 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $53.0 MILLION IN NOTES AND INTEREST FROM BLACKWATER IN FISCAL 2018.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $672.8 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH ARE REPORTED NET OF CASH FROM SALES AND LEASE-BACK TRANSACTIONS, INCREASED $506.2 MILLION. CASH FROM THE SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT DECREASED $93.5 MILLION LARGELY DUE TO REDUCED FLEET SALES. NET CASH DEPOSITED IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS ESCROW ACCOUNTS DECREASED $27.1 MILLION. FOR OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $45.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $498.0 MILLION IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018. THIS WAS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DECREASED DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE REPAYMENTS OF $49.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN CASH FROM BORROWINGS OF $398.8 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN NET ANNUITY DEPOSITS FROM LIFE INSURANCE OF $48.0 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS PAID OF $9.8 MILLION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS  MOVING AND STORAGE  TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, U-HAUL MAINTAINS A LARGE FLEET OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAVE PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF NEW RENTAL EQUIPMENT ACQUISITIONS AND THE BUYOUTS OF EXISTING FLEET FROM LEASES. THE CAPITAL TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN OBTAINED INTERNALLY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE SALE OF USED EQUIPMENT AND EXTERNALLY FROM DEBT AND LEASE FINANCING. IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS WILL BE USED TO SERVICE THE EXISTING DEBT AND FUND OPERATIONS. U-HAUL ESTIMATES THAT DURING FISCAL 2020 THE COMPANY WILL REINVEST IN ITS TRUCK AND TRAILER RENTAL FLEET APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION, NET OF EQUIPMENT SALES AND EXCLUDING ANY LEASE BUYOUTS. FOR FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED, NET OF SALES, APPROXIMATELY $560 MILLION BEFORE ANY LEASE BUYOUTS IN ITS TRUCK AND TRAILER FLEET. FLEET INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, THE TRUCK RENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND THE USED-TRUCK SALES MARKET. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE FISCAL 2020 INVESTMENTS WILL BE FUNDED LARGELY THROUGH DEBT FINANCING, EXTERNAL LEASE FINANCING AND CASH FROM OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING COST AND TAX CONSEQUENCES WHEN SELECTING A METHOD TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR ALLOCATION BETWEEN DEBT AND LEASE FINANCING CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED UPON FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH MAY ALTER THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING OPTIONS.  REAL ESTATE HAS TRADITIONALLY FINANCED THE ACQUISITION OF SELF-STORAGE PROPERTIES TO SUPPORT U-HAUL'S GROWTH THROUGH DEBT FINANCING AND FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S PLAN FOR THE EXPANSION OF OWNED STORAGE PROPERTIES INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF EXISTING SELF-STORAGE LOCATIONS FROM THIRD PARTIES, THE ACQUISITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF BARE LAND, AND THE ACQUISITION AND REDEVELOPMENT OF EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT CURRENTLY USED FOR SELF-STORAGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THESE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ALONG WITH BORROWINGS AGAINST EXISTING PROPERTIES AS THEY OPERATIONALLY MATURE. FOR FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED $1,003 MILLION IN REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS, NEW CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION AND REPAIR. FOR FISCAL 2020, THE TIMING OF NEW PROJECTS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE ENTITLEMENT PROCESS, AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL, WEATHER, AND THE  31  IDENTIFICATION AND SUCCESSFUL ACQUISITION OF TARGET PROPERTIES. U-HAUL'S GROWTH PLAN IN SELF-STORAGE ALSO INCLUDES THE EXPANSION OF THE U-HAUL STORAGE AFFILIATE PROGRAM, WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL.  NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT LESS PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND LEASE PROCEEDS) WERE $1,263.7 MILLION, $663.9 MILLION AND $932.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  YEARS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  PURCHASES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT  $1,162,909  $1,006,503  $1,178,908  EQUIPMENT LEASE BUYOUTS  30,566  6,594  63,505  PURCHASES OF REAL ESTATE, CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATIONS  1,003,030  606,990  484,487  OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  21,831  140,627  139,448  GROSS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  2,218,336  1,760,714  1,866,348  LESS: LEASE PROCEEDS  (348,368)  (396,969)  (446,843)  LESS: SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  (606,271)  (699,803)  (487,475)  NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  1,263,697  663,942  932,030  MOVING AND STORAGE CONTINUES TO HOLD SIGNIFICANT CASH AND WE BELIEVE HAS ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY. MANAGEMENT MAY INVEST THESE FUNDS IN OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, EXPAND OUR PRODUCT LINES OR PURSUE EXTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SELF-MOVING AND STORAGE MARKETPLACE, PAY DIVIDENDS OR REDUCE EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS WHERE POSSIBLE.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE'S ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF AMERCO, OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AT THE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY OPERATING SEGMENT REMAINS SUFFICIENT AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO AMERCO WILL BE RESTRICTED PER STATE REGULATIONS.  OUR PROPERTY AND CASUALTY OPERATING SEGMENT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS $222.4 MILLION, $211.2 MILLION, AND $180.9 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 RESULTED FROM NET EARNINGS OF $21.7 MILLION, A REDUCTION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $20.2 MILLION AND AN INCREASE DUE TO A ONE-TIME RECLASS OF $9.7 MILLION BETWEEN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASU 2016-01. PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE DOES NOT USE DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUES TO INCREASE CAPITAL AND THEREFORE HAS NO DIRECT EXPOSURE TO CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  LIFE INSURANCE  LIFE INSURANCE MANAGES ITS FINANCIAL ASSETS TO MEET POLICYHOLDER AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS INCLUDING INVESTMENT CONTRACT WITHDRAWALS AND DEPOSITS. LIFE INSURANCE'S NET DEPOSIT INCREASE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $267.3 MILLION. STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, LIFE INSURANCE'S ASSETS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF AMERCO  \u00ae  OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR LIFE INSURANCE OPERATING SEGMENT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS $311.7 MILLION, $332.9 MILLION, AND $296.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN 2018 COMPARED WITH 2017 RESULTED FROM EARNINGS OF $20.1 MILLION AND A REDUCTION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $41.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON THE FIXED MATURITY PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. LIFE INSURANCE HAS NOT HISTORICALLY USED DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUES TO INCREASE CAPITAL AND THEREFORE HAS NOT HAD ANY SIGNIFICANT DIRECT EXPOSURE TO CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS OTHER THAN THROUGH ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. HOWEVER, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, OXFORD HAD OUTSTANDING DEPOSITS OF $60.0 MILLION THROUGH ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK (\u201cFHLB\u201d). FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THIS DEPOSIT, PLEASE SEE NOTE 9, BORROWINGS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  32  CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BY OPERATING SEGMENTS  MOVING AND STORAGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $958.9 MILLION, $858.6 MILLION AND $983.6 MILLION IN FISCAL 2018, 2017 AND 2016 FROM OPERATIONS, REDUCED FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN FISCAL 2019 AND THE REPAYMENT OF $53.0 MILLION IN NOTES AND INTEREST FROM BLACKWATER IN FISCAL 2018.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $19.8 MILLION, $21.9 MILLION, AND $19.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTERCOMPANY BALANCES AND THE TIMING OF PAYABLES ACTIVITY.  PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS AMOUNTED TO $11.2 MILLION, $17.0 MILLION, AND $20.7 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THESE BALANCES REFLECT FUNDS IN TRANSITION FROM MATURITY PROCEEDS TO LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS LEVEL OF LIQUID ASSETS, COMBINED WITH BUDGETED CASH FLOW, IS ADEQUATE TO MEET FORESEEABLE CASH NEEDS. CAPITAL AND OPERATING BUDGETS ALLOW PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE TO SCHEDULE CASH NEEDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH INVESTMENT AND UNDERWRITING PROCEEDS.  LIFE INSURANCE  NET CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS ($3.2) MILLION, $57.2 MILLION AND $56.3 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $64.6 MILLION CASH TRANSFER AS A RESULT OF THE REINSURANCE CONTRACT TERMINATION, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN BENEFITS AND COMMISSIONS.  IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF LIQUID FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH LIFE INSURANCE'S SHORT-TERM PORTFOLIO AND ITS MEMBERSHIP IN THE FHLB. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AMOUNTED TO $24.1 MILLION, $50.7 MILLION AND $20.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE OVERALL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET FORESEEABLE CASH NEEDS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - SUMMARY  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO MEET OUR BUSINESS PLANS INCLUDING OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. WE CONTINUE TO HOLD SIGNIFICANT CASH AND HAVE ACCESS TO EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENT IN OUR RENTAL FLEET, RENTAL EQUIPMENT AND STORAGE ACQUISITIONS AND BUILD OUTS.  OUR BORROWING STRATEGY IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ASSET-BACKED FINANCING AND RENTAL EQUIPMENT LEASES. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, WE SEEK TO LADDER MATURITIES AND FIX INTEREST RATES. WHILE EACH OF THESE LOANS TYPICALLY CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING THE AMOUNT THAT CAN BE BORROWED IN RELATION TO SPECIFIC ASSETS, THE OVERALL STRUCTURE IS FLEXIBLE WITH NO LIMITS ON OVERALL COMPANY BORROWINGS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT HAS ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY BETWEEN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY IN EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES TO MEET THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED NEEDS OF THE COMPANY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES OF $80.6 MILLION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL COULD ALTER THE ABILITY OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO LEND US THE UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEVERAGE IN OUR EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY, PLEASE SEE NOTE 9, BORROWINGS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND ARE MEASURED AND CLASSIFIED BASED UPON A THREE TIERED APPROACH TO VALUATION. ASC 820 REQUIRES THAT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BE CLASSIFIED AND DISCLOSED IN A LEVEL 1, LEVEL 2 OR LEVEL 3 CATEGORY. FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE SEE NOTE 15, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.  33  THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES HELD BY THE COMPANY ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE DETERMINED PRIMARILY FROM ACTIVELY TRADED MARKETS WHERE PRICES ARE BASED EITHER ON DIRECT MARKET QUOTES OR OBSERVED TRANSACTIONS. LIQUIDITY IS A FACTOR CONSIDERED DURING THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES. MARKET PRICE QUOTES MAY NOT BE READILY AVAILABLE FOR CERTAIN SECURITIES OR THE MARKET FOR THEM HAS SLOWED OR CEASED. IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE MARKET IS DETERMINED TO BE ILLIQUID, FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED UPON LIMITED AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD $0.2 MILLION OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ASSETS CLASSIFIED IN LEVEL 3.  THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS HELD BY US AS HEDGES AGAINST INTEREST RATE RISK FOR OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING VALUATION MODELS WHICH INCLUDE BROKER QUOTES FOR WHICH SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE. THEY INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS FOR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT QUALITY AND OTHER DEAL-SPECIFIC FACTORS, WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT TO SETTLE BOTH THE CASE RESERVES AND IBNR IS AN ESTIMATE BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT TRENDS AND SUCH ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS DO NOT INCLUDE FUTURE PREMIUMS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  (B) THESE ESTIMATED OBLIGATIONS ARE BASED ON MORTALITY, MORBIDITY, WITHDRAWAL AND LAPSE ASSUMPTIONS DRAWN FROM OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY KNOWN TRENDS. THESE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE EXPECTED INTEREST CREDITING BUT NO AMOUNTS FOR FUTURE ANNUITY DEPOSITS OR PREMIUMS FOR LIFE AND MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT POLICIES.  THE CASH FLOWS SHOWN ABOVE ARE UNDISCOUNTED FOR INTEREST AND AS A RESULT TOTAL OUTFLOWS FOR ALL YEARS SHOWN SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES OF $2,039.4 MILLION INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. LIFE INSURANCE EXPECTS TO FULLY FUND THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM THEIR INVESTED ASSET PORTFOLIO. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  (C) THESE ESTIMATED OBLIGATIONS ARE PRIMARILY THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF INSURANCE ACCRUALS FOR PORTIONS OF THE LIABILITY COVERAGE FOR OUR RENTAL EQUIPMENT. THE ESTIMATES FOR FUTURE SETTLEMENT ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT TRENDS. DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THIS MODEL, THE AMOUNTS SHOWN COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  AS PRESENTED ABOVE, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON DEBT AND GUARANTEES REPRESENT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS WHILE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR OPERATING LEASES REPRESENT THE NOTIONAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  ASC 740 -  INCOME TAXES  LIABILITIES AND INTEREST OF $46.7 MILLION IS NOT INCLUDED ABOVE DUE TO UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING ULTIMATE SETTLEMENTS, IF ANY.  34  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY USES OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN SITUATIONS WHERE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ECONOMICS AND SOUND BUSINESS PRINCIPLES WARRANT THEIR USE.  WE UTILIZE OPERATING LEASES FOR CERTAIN RENTAL EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES WITH TERMS EXPIRING SUBSTANTIALLY THROUGH 2024. IN THE EVENT OF A SHORTFALL IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF THE UNDERLYING RENTAL EQUIPMENT ASSETS, AMERCO HAS GUARANTEED $5.2 MILLION OF RESIDUAL VALUES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 FOR THESE ASSETS AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LEASE TERMS. AMERCO HAS BEEN LEASING RENTAL EQUIPMENT SINCE 1987. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED RESIDUAL VALUE SHORTFALLS RELATED TO THESE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. USING THE AVERAGE COST OF FLEET RELATED DEBT AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE PRESENT VALUE OF AMERCO\u2019S MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS AND RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES WAS $6.4 MILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  DURING THE 1990S, WE USED CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXPANSION OF OUR SELF-STORAGE BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION PLEASE SEE NOTE 19, RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS, OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY USED WHEN OUR OVERALL BORROWING STRUCTURE WAS MORE LIMITED. WE DO NOT FACE SIMILAR LIMITATIONS CURRENTLY AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN UTILIZED IN OUR SELF-STORAGE EXPANSION IN RECENT YEARS. IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY AND CONSIDER OFF-BALANCE SHEET OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXTENT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WOULD BE ECONOMICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS TO US AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS. SAC HOLDINGS, FOUR SAC SELF-STORAGE CORPORATION (\u201c4 SAC\u201d), FIVE SAC SELF-STORAGE CORPORATION (\u201c5 SAC\u201d), GALAXY INVESTMENTS, L.P. (\u201cGALAXY\u201d) AND PRIVATE MINI ARE SUBSTANTIALLY CONTROLLED BY BLACKWATER. BLACKWATER IS WHOLLY-OWNED BY WGHLP, WHICH IS OWNED BY MARK V. SHOEN (A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER) AND VARIOUS TRUSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EDWARD J. SHOEN (OUR CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, PRESIDENT AND A SIGNIFICANT SHAREHOLDER) AND MARK V. SHOEN.  WE CURRENTLY MANAGE THE SELF-STORAGE PROPERTIES OWNED OR LEASED BY BLACKWATER AND MERCURY PURSUANT TO A STANDARD FORM OF MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, UNDER WHICH WE RECEIVE A MANAGEMENT FEE OF BETWEEN 4% AND 10% OF THE GROSS RECEIPTS PLUS REIMBURSEMENT FOR CERTAIN EXPENSES. WE RECEIVED MANAGEMENT FEES, EXCLUSIVE OF REIMBURSED EXPENSES, OF $30.0 MILLION, $29.5 MILLION AND $27.8 MILLION FROM THE ABOVE MENTIONED ENTITIES DURING FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THIS MANAGEMENT FEE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE FEE RECEIVED FOR OTHER PROPERTIES WE PREVIOUSLY MANAGED FOR THIRD PARTIES. MARK V. SHOEN CONTROLS THE GENERAL PARTNER OF MERCURY. THE LIMITED PARTNER INTERESTS OF MERCURY ARE INDIRECTLY OWNED BY MARK V. SHOEN, JAMES P. SHOEN, AND A TRUST BENEFITTING THE CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF EDWARD J. SHOEN.  WE LEASE SPACE FOR MARKETING COMPANY OFFICES, VEHICLE REPAIR SHOPS AND HITCH INSTALLATION CENTERS FROM SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER. TOTAL LEASE PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO SUCH LEASES WERE $2.7 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2019, 2018 AND 2017. THE TERMS OF THE LEASES ARE SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF LEASES FOR OTHER PROPERTIES OWNED BY UNRELATED PARTIES THAT ARE LEASED BY US.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER ACTED AS U-HAUL INDEPENDENT DEALERS. THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER TERMS OF THE DEALERSHIP CONTRACTS WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED COMPANIES AND THEIR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE TERMS OF THOSE WITH OUR OTHER INDEPENDENT DEALERS WHEREBY COMMISSIONS ARE PAID BY US BASED ON EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUES. WE PAID THE ABOVE MENTIONED ENTITIES $61.4 MILLION, $58.6 MILLION AND $57.1 MILLION IN COMMISSIONS PURSUANT TO SUCH DEALERSHIP CONTRACTS DURING FISCAL 2019, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE AGREEMENTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF BLACKWATER, EXCLUDING DEALER AGREEMENTS, PROVIDED REVENUES OF $24.0 MILLION, EXPENSES OF $2.7 MILLION AND CASH FLOWS OF $21.3 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2019. REVENUES AND COMMISSION EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DEALER AGREEMENTS WERE $288.2 MILLION AND $61.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY DURING FISCAL 2019.  FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK  WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR ATTENTION ON INCREASING TRANSACTION VOLUME AND IMPROVING PRICING, PRODUCT AND UTILIZATION FOR SELF-MOVING EQUIPMENT RENTALS.  MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF NEW INVESTMENT IN OUR TRUCK FLEET IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF OUR PLAN TO MEET OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS. REVENUE IN THE U-MOVE  \u00ae  PROGRAM COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED SHOULD WE FAIL TO EXECUTE IN ANY OF THESE AREAS. EVEN IF WE EXECUTE OUR PLANS, WE COULD SEE DECLINES IN REVENUES PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFORESEEN EVENTS INCLUDING ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR HEIGHTENED COMPETITION THAT IS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  35  WITH RESPECT TO OUR STORAGE BUSINESS, IN FISCAL 2019 WE HAVE ADDED NEW LOCATIONS AND EXPANDED EXISTING LOCATIONS. IN FISCAL 2020, WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING TO COMPLETE CURRENT PROJECTS, INCREASE OCCUPANCY IN OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF LOCATIONS AND ACQUIRE NEW LOCATIONS. NEW PROJECTS AND ACQUISITIONS WILL BE CONSIDERED AND PURSUED IF THEY FIT OUR LONG-TERM PLANS AND MEET OUR FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K. SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR SET FORTH ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INCLUDING INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO OUR PLANS AND STRATEGY FOR OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDES FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. YOU SHOULD REVIEW THE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS DESCRIBED IN OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD\u2010LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  OVERVIEW  THE CONTAINER STORE\u00ae IS THE ORIGINAL AND LEADING SPECIALTY RETAILER OF STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE ONLY NATIONAL RETAILER SOLELY DEVOTED TO THE CATEGORY. WE PROVIDE A COLLECTION OF CREATIVE, MULTIFUNCTIONAL AND CUSTOMIZABLE STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS THAT ARE SOLD IN OUR STORES AND ONLINE THROUGH A HIGH-SERVICE, DIFFERENTIATED SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. OUR VISION IS TO BE A BELOVED BRAND AND THE FIRST CHOICE FOR CUSTOMIZED ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES. OUR CUSTOMERS ARE HIGHLY EDUCATED, VERY BUSY AND PRIMARILY HOMEOWNERS WITH A HIGHER THAN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WE SERVICE THEM WITH STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION SOLUTIONS THAT HELP THEM ACCOMPLISH PROJECTS, MAXIMIZE THEIR SPACE, AND MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR HOME. WE BELIEVE AN ORGANIZED LIFE IS A HAPPY LIFE.  OUR OPERATIONS CONSIST OF TWO OPERATING SEGMENTS.  \u00b7  THE CONTAINER STORE (\u201cTCS\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF OUR RETAIL STORES, WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES), AS WELL AS OUR INSTALLATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL SERVICES BUSINESS. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE OPERATED 92 STORES WITH AN AVERAGE SIZE OF APPROXIMATELY 25,000 SQUARE FEET (19,000 SELLING SQUARE FEET) IN 33 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE ALSO OFFER ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR WEBSITE, RESPONSIVE MOBILE SITE, AND CALL CENTER. OUR STORES RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS DIRECTLY FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTER CO-LOCATED WITH OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND CALL CENTER IN COPPELL, TEXAS AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF OPENING A SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN LATE FISCAL 2019.  \u00b7  ELFA,  THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S WHOLLY OWNED SWEDISH SUBSIDIARY, ELFA INTERNATIONAL AB (\u201cELFA\u201d), DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURES COMPONENT\u2010BASED SHELVING AND DRAWER SYSTEMS AND MADE\u2010TO\u2010MEASURE SLIDING DOORS. ELFA WAS FOUNDED IN 1948 AND IS HEADQUARTERED IN MALMO\u0308, SWEDEN. ELFA\u2019S SHELVING AND DRAWER SYSTEMS ARE CUSTOMIZABLE FOR ANY AREA OF THE HOME, INCLUDING CLOSETS, KITCHENS, OFFICES AND GARAGES. ELFA OPERATES THREE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES WITH TWO LOCATED IN SWEDEN AND ONE IN POLAND. THE CONTAINER STORE BEGAN SELLING ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS IN 1978 AND ACQUIRED ELFA IN 1999. TODAY OUR TCS SEGMENT IS THE EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTOR OF  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. ELFA ALSO SELLS ITS PRODUCTS ON A WHOLESALE BASIS TO VARIOUS RETAILERS IN APPROXIMATELY 30 COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, WITH A CONCENTRATION IN THE NORDIC REGION OF EUROPE.  MANAGEMENT TRANSITION  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING LONG-TERM SUCCESSION PLANNING, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT MELISSA REIFF, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WILL SUCCEED WILLIAM A. (\u201cKIP\u201d) TINDELL, III AS CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CONCLUSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (THE \u201c2019 ANNUAL MEETING\u201d).  THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT SHARON TINDELL, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER, WILL RETIRE FROM HER ROLE AS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING. AT THAT TIME, JOHN GEHRE, WHO JOINED THE CONTAINER STORE IN JUNE 2018 AS EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF MERCHANDISING AND PLANNING, WILL SUCCEED MS. TINDELL AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF MERCHANDISING OFFICER, AND MELISSA REIFF WILL ADD PRESIDENT TO HER TITLE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT JODI TAYLOR WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY UNTIL A MUTUALLY AGREED UPON DATE AFTER MARCH 1, 2020, BUT BEFORE SEPTEMBER 1, 2020, AT WHICH POINT SHE WILL NO LONGER SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND A SUCCESSOR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER WILL BE NAMED, BUT MS. TAYLOR WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER AND SECRETARY.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT CHANGES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AMENDED AND RESTATED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS ON JANUARY 23, 2019 WITH MS. REIFF, MS. TINDELL, AND MS. TAYLOR.  EACH OF THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE FOR ANNUAL GRANTS OF EQUITY AWARDS SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY'S 2013 INCENTIVE AWARD PLAN AND AWARD AGREEMENTS THEREUNDER.  HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS  WE CONSIDER A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING MEASURES IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE KEY MEASURES WE USE TO DETERMINE HOW OUR BUSINESS IS PERFORMING ARE NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, GROSS MARGIN, AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO REVIEW OTHER IMPORTANT OPERATING METRICS SUCH AS COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND NON-GAAP MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  OPTIMIZATION PLAN  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ON MAY 23, 2017, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED A FOUR-PART OPTIMIZATION PLAN TO DRIVE IMPROVED SALES AND PROFITABILITY (THE \u201cOPTIMIZATION PLAN\u201d). THIS PLAN INCLUDED SALES INITIATIVES, CERTAIN FULL-TIME POSITION ELIMINATIONS AT TCS, WHICH WERE CONCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017, ORGANIZATIONAL REALIGNMENT AT ELFA AND ONGOING SAVINGS AND EFFICIENCY EFFORTS.  THE COMPANY INCURRED PRE-TAX CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION IN FISCAL 2017. THE ANNUALIZED PRE-TAX SAVINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN WERE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION WAS REALIZED IN FISCAL 2017.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN THROUGH THE EXECUTION OF A PRICE OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE. THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION OF PRE-TAX CHARGES IN FISCAL 2018 ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PRICE OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVE.  NET SALES  NET SALES REFLECT OUR SALES OF MERCHANDISE PLUS OTHER SERVICES PROVIDED, SUCH AS INSTALLATION, SHIPPING, DELIVERY, AND ORGANIZATION SERVICES, LESS RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS. NET SALES ALSO INCLUDE WHOLESALE SALES BY ELFA. REVENUE FROM OUR TCS SEGMENT IS RECOGNIZED UPON RECEIPT OF THE PRODUCT BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ELFA SEGMENT REVENUE IS RECORDED UPON SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE RETAIL AND WHOLESALE BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE CYCLICAL, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR SALES ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PURCHASES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SENSITIVE TO TRENDS IN THE LEVELS OF CONSUMER SPENDING, WHICH ARE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS SUCH AS CONSUMER DISPOSABLE INCOME, HOUSING MARKET CONDITIONS, STOCK MARKET PERFORMANCE, CONSUMER DEBT, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES AND OVERALL CONSUMER CONFIDENCE.  OUR NET SALES ARE MODERATELY SEASONAL. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUES FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER, WHICH OFTEN AFFECTS THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR INTERIM RESULTS. NET SALES ARE HISTORICALLY HIGHER IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF OUR ANNUAL ELFA  \u00ae  SALE, WHICH TRADITIONALLY BEGINS IN LATE DECEMBER AND RUNS INTO FEBRUARY.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IS EQUAL TO OUR NET SALES LESS COST OF SALES. GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES IS REFERRED TO AS GROSS MARGIN. COST OF SALES IN OUR TCS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE PURCHASE COST OF INVENTORY LESS VENDOR REBATES, IN\u2010BOUND FREIGHT, AS WELL AS INVENTORY SHRINKAGE. DIRECT INSTALLATION AND ORGANIZATION COSTS, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED TO SHIP OR DELIVER MERCHANDISE TO CUSTOMERS, ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES IN OUR TCS SEGMENT. ELFA SEGMENT COST OF SALES FROM MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTION, PRIMARILY MATERIAL, WAGES, FREIGHT AND OTHER VARIABLE COSTS, AND APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR COST OF SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPONENTS OF COST OF SALES OR SIMILAR MEASURES BY OTHER RETAILERS. AS A RESULT, DATA IN THIS REPORT REGARDING OUR GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY OTHER RETAILERS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT IS VARIABLE IN NATURE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWS CHANGES IN NET SALES. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, SALES FROM OUR TCS SEGMENT TYPICALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN THAN SALES TO THIRD PARTIES FROM OUR ELFA SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, SALES OF PRODUCTS TYPICALLY PROVIDE A HIGHER GROSS MARGIN THAN SALES OF SERVICES. GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT IS ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS CERTAIN PURCHASES OF ELFA  \u00ae  PRODUCTS FROM OUR ELFA SEGMENT ARE IN SWEDISH KRONA, WHILE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE IN U.S. DOLLARS. WE MITIGATE THIS RISK THROUGH THE USE OF FORWARD CONTRACTS, WHEREBY WE HEDGE PURCHASES OF INVENTORY BY LOCKING IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN ADVANCE. SIMILARLY, GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS CERTAIN PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS ARE TRANSACTED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN SWEDISH KRONA, WHICH IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF ELFA.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE ALL OPERATING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION, AND PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS. FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT, THESE INCLUDE PAYROLL AND PAYROLL\u2010RELATED EXPENSES, MARKETING EXPENSES, OCCUPANCY EXPENSES (WHICH INCLUDE RENT, REAL ESTATE TAXES, COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, TELEPHONE, PROPERTY INSURANCE, AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE), COSTS TO SHIP PRODUCT FROM THE DISTRIBUTION CENTER TO OUR STORES, AND SUPPLIES EXPENSES. WE ALSO INCUR COSTS FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION AND CORPORATE OFFICE OPERATIONS. FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT, THESE INCLUDE SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ALL EXPENSES RELATED TO OPERATIONS AT HEADQUARTERS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE EXCLUDED FROM BOTH GROSS PROFIT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE BOTH FIXED AND VARIABLE COMPONENTS AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT DIRECTLY CORRELATED WITH NET SALES. THE COMPONENTS OF OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPONENTS OF SIMILAR MEASURES OF OTHER RETAILERS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS WITH EXPECTED FUTURE STORE GROWTH AND THE OPENING OF OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN LATE FISCAL 2019.  PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS  NON\u2010CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND RELOCATING STORES, INCLUDING RENT, MARKETING EXPENSES, TRAVEL AND RELOCATION COSTS, TRAINING COSTS, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE OVERHEAD COSTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND ARE INCLUDED IN PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPARABLE STORE SALES  A STORE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES CALCULATION ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE SIXTEENTH FULL FISCAL MONTH FOLLOWING THE STORE\u2019S OPENING. COMPARABLE STORE SALES ARE NET OF DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS. WHEN A STORE IS RELOCATED, WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER SALES FROM THAT STORE TO BE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. A STORE TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE IN THE FISCAL MONTH IT IS CLOSED. THE STORE THEN BECOMES COMPARABLE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL MONTH IN WHICH IT REOPENS. NET SALES FROM OUR WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES) ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN CALCULATIONS OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES ALLOW US TO EVALUATE HOW OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IS PERFORMING BY MEASURING THE CHANGE IN PERIOD\u2010OVER\u2010PERIOD NET SALES IN STORES THAT HAVE BEEN OPEN FOR FIFTEEN MONTHS OR MORE. THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH METRIC IS AN OPERATING MEASURE INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING.  \u00b7  NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC TRENDS IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN OUR MERCHANDISE MIX;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN PRICING;  \u00b7  CHANGES IN TIMING OF PROMOTIONAL EVENTS OR HOLIDAYS; AND  \u00b7  WEATHER.  OPENING NEW STORES IS PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY. AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, WE ANTICIPATE THAT A PORTION OF OUR NET SALES WILL COME FROM STORES NOT INCLUDED IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES CALCULATION. ACCORDINGLY, COMPARABLE STORE SALES IS ONLY ONE MEASURE WE USE TO ASSESS THE SUCCESS OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN CONNECTION WITH COVENANT COMPLIANCE, EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, AND TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY, ITS EXECUTIVES AND OUR COVENANT COMPLIANCE, AS APPLICABLE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION UNDER OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. ADJUSTED EBITDA REFLECTS FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO EBITDA TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN NON\u2010CASH AND OTHER ITEMS, THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER REPRESENTATIVE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FOR RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, REFER TO \u201c  ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA.  \u201d  ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED  WE USE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY. ADJUSTED NET INCOME IS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME BEFORE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, CERTAIN GAINS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, CERTAIN MANAGEMENT TRANSITION COSTS INCURRED AND BENEFITS REALIZED, CHARGES INCURRED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPTIMIZATION PLAN, CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY CLOSURE, AND THE TAX IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT TAX ITEMS. WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED AS ADJUSTED NET INCOME DIVIDED BY THE DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, REFER TO \u201c  ITEM 6: SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATING DATA  .\u201d  ADJUSTMENT FOR CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS  ADDITIONALLY, THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO REFERS TO ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES AFTER THE CONVERSION OF ELFA\u2019S NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DISCLOSURE OF ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE.  NOTE ON DOLLAR AMOUNTS  ALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS, UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DATA REPRESENTS THE AMOUNTS SHOWN IN OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, MARCH 31, 2018 AND APRIL 1, 2017 EXPRESSED IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND CERTAIN OPERATING DATA AND NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH METRIC IS AN OPERATING MEASURE INTENDED ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET SALES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  (2)  WE HAVE PRESENTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\u2014DILUTED AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON\u2010RECURRING ITEMS. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY. THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN EVALUATING THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON\u2010GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS.

ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES DECREASED $4,382 DURING FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, WHICH DECREASED THIRD PARTY NET SALES BY $4,832. AFTER CONVERTING ELFA\u2019S THIRD PARTY NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2017, ELFA THIRD PARTY NET SALES INCREASED $450 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SALES IN THE NORDIC MARKETS.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IN FISCAL 2018 INCREASED BY $26,622, OR 5.4%, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED CONSOLIDATED NET SALES COMBINED WITH HIGHER CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.

OTHER EXPENSES  OTHER EXPENSES WERE $177 IN FISCAL 2018 AS COMPARED TO $5,734 IN FISCAL 2017. THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SEVERANCE COSTS INCURRED IN FISCAL 2017 TO IMPLEMENT THE OPTIMIZATION PLAN.

ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, THE COMPANY RECORDED $2,082 OF LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN FISCAL 2018, COMPARED TO $2,369 OF LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT IN FISCAL 2017 AS A RESULT OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW).

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2018 WAS 1.3%, AS COMPARED TO -189.8% IN FISCAL 2017. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ENACTED IN FISCAL 2017, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $24,210 IN FISCAL 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL ACCRUAL OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $8,521.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2017 WAS -189.8%, AS COMPARED TO 38.6% FOR FISCAL 2016. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ENACTED IN FISCAL 2017, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $24,210 IN FISCAL 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PROVISIONAL ACCRUAL OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $8,521.  THE COMPANY MADE PROVISIONAL ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACT OF REMEASURING ITS DEFERRED TAX BALANCES DURING FISCAL 2017, AS WELL AS THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON THE EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

SEASONALITY  OUR STORAGE AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCT OFFERING MAKES US LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO HOLIDAY SHOPPING PATTERNS THAN MANY RETAILERS. HISTORICALLY, OUR BUSINESS HAS REALIZED A HIGHER PORTION OF NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE, WHICH TRADITIONALLY STARTS IN LATE DECEMBER AND RUNS INTO FEBRUARY. OVER HALF OF OUR ADJUSTED NET INCOME WAS DERIVED IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER IN FISCAL YEARS 2018, 2017, AND 2016.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, A $100,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW), AND THE SEK 140.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $15,062 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d BELOW), AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED THE ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW).  OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, DIRECT MATERIALS, PAYROLL, STORE RENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND UPDATING EXISTING STORES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING BUILDING OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OTHER CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES, TAXES RECEIVABLE AND TAXES PAYABLE. OUR LIQUIDITY FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF OUR BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND AS A RESULT, OUR BORROWINGS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER DURING THESE PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. OUR BORROWINGS GENERALLY INCREASE IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AS WE PREPARE FOR OUR ANNUAL SHELVING SALE, THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM OF LOANS, BONDS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT OR EQUITY, TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AT MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD $7,364 OF CASH, OF WHICH $4,192 WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $66,159 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY $9,551 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT MARCH 30, 2019. THERE WERE $4,428 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE.  PURSUANT TO THE TAX ACT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED. THE COMPANY FINALIZED THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNT FOR THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX IN FISCAL 2018. FUTURE AMOUNTS EARNED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAXES UPON TRANSFER TO THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, IF THESE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN STATES.  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  A SUMMARY OF OUR KEY COMPONENTS AND MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30,  MARCH 31,  APRIL 1,  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $54,896  $62,176  $44,639  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (32,771)  (27,550)  (28,508)  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (22,007)  (37,688)  (13,981)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH  (1,153)  725  (223)  NET (DECREASE) INCREASE IN CASH  $(1,035)  $(2,337)  $1,927  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP) (1)  $21,226  $34,530  $16,124  (1)  SEE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON\u2010CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $54,896 FOR FISCAL 2018. NET INCOME OF $21,680 WAS COMBINED WITH NON-CASH ITEMS OF $41,898 (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS WELL AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) AND A DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $8,682. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY, A DECREASE IN NONCURRENT LIABILITIES AND A DECREASE IN INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASES IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, INCLUDING THE NEW AVERA  TM  CUSTOM CLOSET LINE. THE DECREASE IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY RECORDED IN FISCAL 2017.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $62,176 FOR FISCAL 2017. NET INCOME OF $19,428 WAS COMBINED WITH NON-CASH ITEMS OF $19,941 (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OFFSET BY DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT) AND A DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $22,807. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ALONG WITH INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IS DUE TO IMPROVED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT COMBINED WITH POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN FISCAL 2017. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A SHIFT IN TIMING OF RECEIPT OF REBATE AND LANDLORD RECEIVABLES DURING FISCAL 2017, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR BUSINESS SALES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN OTHER NONCURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE PROVISIONAL ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $44,639 FOR FISCAL 2016, AS NON\u2010CASH ITEMS (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AS WELL AS STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION CHARGES) OF $40,966 WERE COMBINED WITH $14,953 OF NET INCOME AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $11,280. THE INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL DURING FISCAL 2016 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN CADENCY, COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STORES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN TRADE RECEIVABLES FOR BUSINESS SALES, AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN TIMING OF RECEIPT OF REBATE AND LANDLORD RECEIVABLES DURING FISCAL 2016. THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A SHIFT IN THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS DURING FISCAL 2016.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORE OPENINGS, EXISTING STORE REMODELS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.

OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2016 WERE $28,515 WITH NEW STORE OPENINGS AND EXISTING STORE REMODELS ACCOUNTING FOR $16,001. THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $12,514 WERE PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $22,007 FOR FISCAL 2018. THIS INCLUDED NET PAYMENTS OF $37,001 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, $2,384 FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, AND $128 FOR TAXES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $37,688 FOR FISCAL 2017. THIS INCLUDED NET PAYMENTS OF $26,403 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, $11,246 FOR PAYMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, AND $39 FOR TAXES PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $13,981 FOR FISCAL 2016, WHICH WAS MAINLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PAYMENTS OF $5,496 PRIMARILY ON INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MADE NET PAYMENTS OF $5,000 ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2016, AND MADE NET PAYMENTS OF $3,485 ON THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE HAD A TOTAL OF $66,159 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND $4,428 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THERE WERE $12,000 BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF MARCH 30, 2019.  AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, ELFA HAD A TOTAL OF $9,551 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND $5,511 OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  THE COMPANY PRESENTS FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH THE COMPANY DEFINES AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN A PERIOD MINUS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MADE IN THAT PERIOD, BECAUSE IT BELIEVES IT IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL LIQUIDITY, AS THE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW GENERATED IN ANY PERIOD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT REPAYMENT, INVESTMENT, AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY AND NON-DISCRETIONARY CASH USES. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT. OUR DEFINITION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT SOLELY REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS A MEASURE THAT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ALTHOUGH OTHER COMPANIES REPORT THEIR FREE CASH FLOW, NUMEROUS METHODS MAY EXIST FOR CALCULATING A COMPANY\u2019S FREE CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT, THE METHOD USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO CALCULATE OUR FREE CASH FLOW MAY DIFFER FROM THE METHODS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE THEIR FREE CASH FLOW.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A RECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO FREE CASH FLOW.

AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cSENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY\u201d). ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIFTH AMENDMENT (THE \u201cFIFTH AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AMENDED THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO SEPTEMBER 14, 2023, (II) DECREASE THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO 5.00% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 4.00% FOR BASE RATE LOANS, AND BEGINNING FROM THE DATE A COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS DELIVERED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 30, 2019, ALLOW THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO STEP DOWN TO 4.75% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 3.75% FOR BASE RATE LOANS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.75:1.00, AND (III) IMPOSE A 1.00% PREMIUM IF A VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT IS MADE FROM THE PROCEEDS OF A REPRICING TRANSACTION WITHIN 12 MONTHS AFTER SEPTEMBER 14, 2018. IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. REPAID $20,000 OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WHICH REDUCED THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO $272,500.  THE CONTAINER STORE,  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INC. DREW DOWN A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $10,000 ON ITS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT.  UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WE HAD $257,391 IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF MARCH 30, 2019 AND THE INTEREST RATE ON SUCH BORROWINGS IS LIBOR +5.00%, SUBJECT TO A LIBOR FLOOR OF 1.00%. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY PROVIDES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF $1,703 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023, WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2023.  THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTORS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS) (OTHER THAN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS) AND (B) A SECOND PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE ASSETS SECURING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, AND ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, AMONG THESE AN EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) REQUIREMENT. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS SYNDICATION AGENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d). THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS AUGUST 18, 2022.  THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE FACILITY IS $100,000. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST AT LIBOR +1.25%. IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES AN UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL REVOLVING FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF LENDER COMMITMENTS AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT PROCEEDS ARE TO BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND ALLOWS FOR SWING LINE ADVANCES OF UP TO $15,000 AND THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OF UP TO $40,000.  THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS LIMITED BY REFERENCE TO A BORROWING BASE FORMULA BASED UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND RESERVES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. AS A RESULT OF THE BORROWING BASE FORMULA, THE ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE LESS THAN THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY).  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, CONSISTING OF INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND (B) A SECOND-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, AND ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS). OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A CONSOLIDATED FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0 IF EXCESS AVAILABILITY IS LESS THAN $10,000 AT ANY TIME. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON APRIL 1, 2014, ELFA ENTERED INTO A MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK AB (\u201cNORDEA\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF AN SEK 60.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $6,455 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) TERM LOAN FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY\u201d) AND AN SEK 140.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $15,062 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY,\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE \u201c2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES TERM BEGAN ON AUGUST 29, 2014 AND MATURES ON AUGUST 29, 2019. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS PAID ON FEBRUARY 18, 2018, WHICH WAS PRIOR TO THE MATURITY DATE. ELFA WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE 2014 ELFA TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 3.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $323 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019). THE 2014 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA\u2019S BASE RATE +1.4%. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2016, ELFA AND NORDEA AGREED THAT THE STATED RATES WOULD APPLY THROUGH MATURITY.  THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICTED ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES. IN ADDITION, ELFA IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN (I) A CONSOLIDATED EQUITY RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF NOT LESS THAN 30% IN YEAR ONE AND NOT LESS THAN 32.5% THEREAFTER AND (II) A CONSOLIDATED RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF LESS THAN 3.2, THE CONSOLIDATED EQUITY RATIO TESTED AT THE END OF EACH CALENDAR QUARTER AND THE RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA TESTED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. AS OF MARCH 30, 2019, ELFA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS DEFINED IN THE 2014 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) HAD OCCURRED.  2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED THE 2014 ELFA FACILITIES AND ENTERED INTO A MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK ABP, FILIAL I SVERIGE (\u201cNORDEA BANK\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF (I) AN SEK 110.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $11,834 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d), (II) UPON ELFA\u2019S REQUEST, AN ADDITIONAL SEK 115.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $12,372 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ADDITIONAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY, THE \u201c2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES\u201d), AND (III) AN UNCOMMITTED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 25.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $2,690 AS OF MARCH 30, 2019), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF NORDEA BANK\u2019S COMMITMENT AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY\u201d, TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES, THE \u201c2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE TERM FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES BEGAN ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND MATURES ON APRIL 1, 2024. LOANS BORROWED UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA BANK\u2019S BASE RATE +1.40%. ANY LOAN BORROWED UNDER THE INCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT STIBOR +1.70%.  THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SECURED BY THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS OF ELFA. THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES.

MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ON\u2010GOING BASIS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND BELIEVES THAT THE FOLLOWING INVOLVE A HIGHER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT OR COMPLEXITY AND ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT TO REPORTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, AND ARE THEREFORE DISCUSSED AS CRITICAL. THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WITH RESPECT TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, EVEN A RELATIVELY MINOR VARIANCE BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED EXPERIENCE CAN POTENTIALLY HAVE A MATERIALLY FAVORABLE OR UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON SUBSEQUENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. MORE INFORMATION ON ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 1\u2014  NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  TO OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES AND THE RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT WHEN MERCHANDISE IS RECEIVED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH REFLECTS AN ESTIMATE OF SHIPMENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECEIVED BY THE CUSTOMER. THIS ESTIMATE IS BASED ON SHIPPING TERMS AND HISTORICAL DELIVERY TIMES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES AND THE RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT UPON SHIPMENT.  WE RECOGNIZE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FEES AS REVENUE WHEN THE MERCHANDISE IS SHIPPED TO THE CUSTOMER. COSTS OF SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD. WE RECOGNIZE FEES FOR INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES AS REVENUE UPON COMPLETION OF THE SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER. COSTS OF INSTALLATION AND OTHER SERVICES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD.  SALES TAX COLLECTED IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AS IT IS ULTIMATELY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  WE RESERVE FOR PROJECTED MERCHANDISE RETURNS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE. THE RESERVE REDUCES SALES AND COST OF SALES, ACCORDINGLY. MERCHANDISE EXCHANGES OF SIMILAR PRODUCT AND PRICE ARE NOT CONSIDERED MERCHANDISE RETURNS AND, THEREFORE, ARE EXCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING THE SALES RETURNS RESERVE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES AT RETAIL STORES ARE COMPRISED OF FINISHED GOODS AND ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST DETERMINED ON A WEIGHTED\u2010AVERAGE COST METHOD INCLUDING ASSOCIATED IN-BOUND FREIGHT COSTS. MANUFACTURING INVENTORIES ARE COMPRISED OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK IN PROCESS, AND FINISHED GOODS AND ARE VALUED ON A FIRST\u2010IN, FIRST OUT BASIS USING FULL ABSORPTION ACCOUNTING WHICH INCLUDES MATERIAL, LABOR, OTHER VARIABLE COSTS, AND OTHER APPLICABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD. TO DETERMINE IF THE VALUE OF INVENTORY IS RECOVERABLE AT COST, WE CONSIDER CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED DEMAND, CUSTOMER PREFERENCE AND THE MERCHANDISE AGE. THE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES USED IN INVENTORY VALUATION ARE OBSOLESCENCE (INCLUDING EXCESS AND SLOW\u2010MOVING INVENTORY) AND ESTIMATES OF INVENTORY SHRINKAGE. WE ADJUST OUR INVENTORY FOR OBSOLESCENCE BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS, AGING REPORTS, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION AND OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE RETAIL SALES PRICES.  RESERVES FOR SHRINKAGE ARE ESTIMATED AND RECORDED THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF COST OF SALES BASED ON HISTORICAL SHRINKAGE RESULTS AND CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS. ACTUAL SHRINKAGE IS RECORDED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BASED UPON PERIODIC CYCLE COUNTS. ACTUAL INVENTORY SHRINKAGE CAN VARY FROM ESTIMATES DUE TO FACTORS INCLUDING THE MIX OF OUR INVENTORY AND EXECUTION AGAINST LOSS PREVENTION INITIATIVES IN OUR STORES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DUE TO THESE FACTORS, OUR OBSOLESCENCE AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES. BOTH ESTIMATES HAVE CALCULATIONS THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS REGARDING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS, THE SELLING ENVIRONMENT, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND CURRENT INVENTORY TRENDS. IF ACTUAL OBSOLESCENCE OR SHRINKAGE ESTIMATES CHANGE FROM OUR ORIGINAL ESTIMATES, WE WILL ADJUST OUR INVENTORY RESERVES ACCORDINGLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THESE ESTIMATES WOULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OUR INVENTORY BALANCES. WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATIONS OF THE OBSOLESCENCE AND SHRINKAGE RESERVES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  INCOME TAXES  WE ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES UTILIZING THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  (\u201cASC 740\u201d). ASC 740 REQUIRES AN ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN IT IS MORE\u2010LIKELY\u2010THAN\u2010NOT THAT THE REALIZATION OF THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT OCCUR. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE RELEASED AS POSITIVE EVIDENCE OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME SUFFICIENT TO REALIZE THE UNDERLYING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BECOMES AVAILABLE (E.G., THREE\u2010YEAR CUMULATIVE FINANCIAL INCOME).  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS WHEN THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAXES FROM A CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT OF THE CHANGE. CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  WE OPERATE IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASC 740\u201030 PROVIDES THAT THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE UNDER THE PRESUMPTION THAT ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE PARENT COMPANY AS A DIVIDEND. SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF THE INTENT TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST THE EARNINGS IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE EARNED PRECLUDES A COMPANY FROM RECORDING THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE. FOR PURPOSES OF ASC 740\u201030, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EARNINGS SUBJECT TO THE TRANSITION TAX UNDER THE TAX ACT PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  ALL OTHER EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED.  LEASES  RENT EXPENSE ON OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING RENT HOLIDAYS AND SCHEDULED RENT INCREASES, IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT\u2010LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE, COMMENCING ON THE DATE WE TAKE POSSESSION OF THE LEASED PROPERTY. RENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PRE\u2010OPENING RENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN PRE\u2010OPENING COSTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE NET EXCESS OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE ACTUAL CASH PAID HAS BEEN RECORDED AS DEFERRED RENT IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS DEFERRED RENT LIABILITIES AND ARE AMORTIZED AS A REDUCTION OF RENT EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE FROM THE POSSESSION DATE. CONTINGENT RENTAL PAYMENTS, TYPICALLY BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, ARE RECOGNIZED IN RENT EXPENSE WHEN PAYMENT OF THE CONTINGENT RENT IS PROBABLE.  INTANGIBLES AND LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS  GOODWILL  WE EVALUATE GOODWILL ANNUALLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS IMPAIRED. GOODWILL IS ALSO TESTED BETWEEN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET. IF AN IMPAIRMENT INDICATOR EXISTS, WE TEST GOODWILL FOR RECOVERABILITY. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTING UNITS AND WE HAVE SELECTED THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER TO PERFORM OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING.  PRIOR TO TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT. IF THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATE THAT  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMPAIRMENT IS GREATER THAN 50%, THEN WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL. TO TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THAT UNIT, GOODWILL IS CONSIDERED NOT IMPAIRED AND WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO PERFORM FURTHER TESTING. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THEN WE WOULD RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE.  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING THE INCOME APPROACH, AS WELL AS A MARKET APPROACH TO COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE TO COMPARABLE COMPANIES. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES OF MANY CRITICAL FACTORS, INCLUDING AMONG OTHERS, OUR NATURE AND OUR HISTORY, FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AFFECTING US, OUR INDUSTRY AND THE GENERAL ECONOMY, PAST RESULTS, OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS, SALES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES OR CAPITAL STOCK OF PUBLICLY HELD SIMILAR BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS PRICES, TERMS AND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PAST SALES OF SIMILAR BUSINESSES. FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATIONS ARE BASED, IN PART, ON OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS TO ESTIMATE INDUSTRY ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF FUTURE BUSINESS STRATEGIES. IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  TRADE NAMES  WE ANNUALLY EVALUATE WHETHER THE TRADE NAMES CONTINUE TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE LIFE. TRADE NAMES ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER AND MAY BE REVIEWED MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ARE PRESENT. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET, A PRODUCT RECALL OR AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW IS PERFORMED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. IF THE RECORDED CARRYING VALUE OF THE TRADE NAME EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO WRITE THE TRADE NAME DOWN TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE. FACTORS USED IN THE VALUATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATED MARKET ROYALTY RATES THAT COULD BE DERIVED FROM THE LICENSING OF OUR TRADE NAMES TO THIRD PARTIES, AND A RATE USED TO DISCOUNT THE ESTIMATED ROYALTY CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE (OR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE).  THE VALUATION OF TRADE NAMES REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES OF MANY CRITICAL FACTORS, WHICH ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FACTORS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cGOODWILL\u201d ABOVE. FORECASTS OF FUTURE OPERATIONS ARE BASED, IN PART, ON OPERATING RESULTS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS. THESE TYPES OF ANALYSES CONTAIN UNCERTAINTIES BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND TO APPLY JUDGMENTS TO ESTIMATE INDUSTRY ECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF FUTURE BUSINESS STRATEGIES. IF ACTUAL RESULTS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES THAT COULD BE MATERIAL.  LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS  LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS, SUCH AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. CONDITIONS THAT MAY INDICATE IMPAIRMENT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEMAND OR BUSINESS CLIMATE THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF AN ASSET, A PRODUCT RECALL OR AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR. IF THE SUM OF THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE ASSET ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, WE RECOGNIZE A LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THE FAIR VALUE, USUALLY DETERMINED BY THE ESTIMATED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS OF THE ASSET.  FOR OUR TCS SEGMENT, WE GENERALLY EVALUATE LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE STORE LEVEL, WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL AT WHICH INDEPENDENT CASH FLOWS CAN BE IDENTIFIED. WE EVALUATE CORPORATE ASSETS OR OTHER LONG\u2010LIVED ASSETS THAT ARE NOT STORE\u2010SPECIFIC AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. FOR OUR ELFA SEGMENT, WE EVALUATE LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SINCE THERE IS TYPICALLY NO ACTIVE MARKET FOR OUR LONG\u2010LIVED TANGIBLE ASSETS, WE ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES BASED ON THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON STORE\u2010LEVEL HISTORICAL RESULTS, CURRENT TRENDS, AND OPERATING AND CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. OUR ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE REASONABLE, FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED IF THE EXPECTED CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AS PROJECTED, DO NOT OCCUR OR IF EVENTS CHANGE REQUIRING US TO REVISE OUR ESTIMATES.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AT  TRIBUTABLE TO US ARE EXPRESSLY QUALIFIED BY THESE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS.  CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS  OUR GLOBAL ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS, WHICH HAD BEEN IN A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN FOR SEVERAL YEARS, BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF STABILIZATION AND IMPROVEMENT DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AND WHICH CONTINUED THROUGH FISCAL 2019.  SUCH STABILIZATION IN CRUDE OIL PRICES AND IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO INCREASED ACTIVITY BY OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE DOWNSTREAM ENERGY SECTOR.  CUSTOMERS HAVE BEGUN TO INVEST IN UPGRADING AND TURNAROUND MAINTENANCE FOR EXISTING FACILITIES AND, IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES, ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT NEW CAPACITY.  WHILE THIS ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY IS ENCOURAGING, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE PACE AT WHICH A RECOVERY WILL PROGRESS OR IF IT WILL CONTINUE.  OUR LONG-TERM VIEW FOR THE GLOBAL ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS IS THAT GENERAL ECONOMIC FUNDAMENTALS WILL DRIVE INCREASING DEMAND AND RESULT IN CONTINUED CAPITAL INVESTMENT TO SATISFY INCREASING GLOBAL ENERGY DEMAND. THESE FUNDAMENTALS INCLUDE RISING POPULATIONS, STRONG EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC EXPANSION.  OUR NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION MARKET HAS DEMAND TIED TO AIRCRAFT CARRIER AND SUBMARINE VESSEL CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES OF THE PRIMARY SHIPYARDS WHO SERVICE THE U.S. NAVY.  WE EXPECT GROWTH IN OUR NAVAL NUCLEAR PROPULSION BUSINESS TO RESULT FROM OUR STRATEGIC ACTIONS TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE, OUR SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE, AND EXPECTED INCREASES IN DEMAND.  WE BELIEVE THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK IN OUR KEY MARKETS SUPPORTS OUR GROWTH PLANS. IN THE NEAR TERM, NEW ORDER LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN VARIABLE, RESULTING IN BOTH RELATIVELY STRONG AND WEAK PERIODS.  WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, ORDER ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.  THE CHART BELOW SHOWS THE IMPACT OF OUR DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY.  OVER HALF OF OUR CURRENT BACKLOG IS FROM MARKETS NOT SERVED BY US IN THE FISCAL 2007-2009 TIME FRAME.  INCLUDED IN THE GRAPH BELOW IS $8,039 FOR ENERGY STEEL, A BUSINESS WHICH IS CURRENTLY HELD FOR SALE.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018  SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE $91,831, UP 18% AS COMPARED WITH SALES OF $77,534 FOR FISCAL 2018.  DOMESTIC SALES WERE $59,441 OR 65% OF TOTAL SALES, UP FROM $51,950 OR 67% OF TOTAL SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  DOMESTIC SALES INCREASED $7,491, OR 14%, COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2018.  INTERNATIONAL SALES ACCOUNTED FOR $32,390, OR 35% OF TOTAL SALES, FOR FISCAL 2019, UP FROM $25,584, OR 33% OF TOTAL SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  INTERNATIONAL SALES INCREASED $6,806 OR 27%, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  BY MARKET, SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE 50% TO THE REFINING INDUSTRY (UP FROM 28% IN FISCAL 2018), 18% TO THE CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRIES (DOWN FROM 27% IN FISCAL 2018), 11% TO THE POWER MARKETS (DOWN FROM 14% IN FISCAL 2018), AND 21% TO DEFENSE AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS (DOWN FROM 31% IN FISCAL 2018).  OUR GROSS MARGIN FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS 23.9% COMPARED WITH 21.9% FOR FISCAL 2018.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPROVED PRICING ENVIRONMENT AND INCREASED UTILIZATION OF CAPACITY.  GROSS PROFIT FOR FISCAL 2019 INCREASED $4,934, OR 29% COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018 DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND HIGHER GROSS MARGIN AS NOTED ABOVE, COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2018.  SG&A EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $17,878, UP 13% OR $2,109, COMPARED WITH $15,769 IN FISCAL 2018.  SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IN FISCAL 2019 WAS 19.5% OF SALES COMPARED WITH 20.3% OF SALES IN FISCAL 2018.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE DECIDED TO SELL OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS THAT WE OPERATE UNDER OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY ENERGY STEEL.  WE REVIEWED THE MARKET VALUE OF THE BUSINESS AT SUCH TIME AND DETERMINED THE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED BASED ON SUCH MARKET VALUE.  WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS RELATED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF ENERGY STEEL.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE BUSINESS WERE NEGLIGIBLE, DUE TO EROSION OF THE ENERGY STEEL BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY INDUSTRY.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $1,700, $2,000, $1,208, $1,222, AND $319 FOR PERMITS, TRADENAME, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, GOODWILL, AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY.  THE TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS $6,449 BEFORE TAXES AND $5,320 AFTER TAXES.  THE REMAINING VALUE OF THE BUSINESS IS NET WORKING CAPITAL.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT REVIEW.  WE ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL OF OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS RELATED TO THE DECEMBER 2010 ACQUISITION OF ENERGY STEEL.  THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PERMITS, TRADENAME AND GOODWILL OF THE BUSINESS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE DUE TO REDUCED INVESTMENT FROM THE U.S. COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY MARKET, THE STRENGTH OF THE ENERGY STEEL BRAND RELATIVE TO LARGER MORE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED SUPPLIERS, AND THE BANKRUPTCY OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY WHICH RESULTED IN THE STOPPAGE OF WORK AT THE SUMMER, SOUTH CAROLINA NUCLEAR FACILITY.  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED IMPAIRMENT LOSSES OF $8,600, $500, AND $5,716 FOR PERMITS, TRADENAME, AND GOODWILL, RESPECTIVELY.  THE TOTAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS $14,816 BEFORE TAXES AND $12,014 AFTER TAXES.  ADDITIONALLY, WE INCURRED A $46 REVENUE REVERSAL, AND A $234 BAD DEBT CHARGE, RELATED TO THE BANKRUPTCY OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY AND THE STOPPAGE OF WORK AT THE SUMMER, SOUTH CAROLINA NUCLEAR FACILITY.  THE TOTAL BEFORE AND AFTER TAX COST OF THESE TWO CHARGES WAS $280 AND $193, RESPECTIVELY.  ADDITIONALLY, WE RECOGNIZED A BENEFIT OF $786 RELATED TO THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATES FROM THE TAX ACT.  THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF $786 INCLUDED $839 OF EXPENSE FOR ADJUSTING THE RATES ON THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF THE ENERGY STEEL ACQUISITION OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF $1,625 FOR OTHER TAX ITEMS.  IN FISCAL 2018, WE INCURRED A PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $316 ($224 AFTER TAX) FOR SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  THERE WERE NO SUCH CHARGES IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST INCOME FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $1,462, UP FROM $606 IN FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $12, THE SAME AMOUNT AS IN FISCAL 2018.  23  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS NOT MEANINGFUL IN FISCAL 2019, AS WE HAD A TAX EXPENSE DESPITE A PRE-TAX LOSS, DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE GOODWILL PORTION OF THE WRITE DOWN FOR OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WE INCURRED FROM OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2019 WAS 20%.  THIS COMPARES TO AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 OF 23%.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WE INCURRED FROM OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS AND THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS 31%.  NET (LOSS) AND (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL 2019, WERE ($308) AND ($0.03), RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH NET (LOSS) AND (LOSS) PER DILUTED SHARE OF ($9,844) AND ($1.01), RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2018.  EXCLUDING THE IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS IN EACH OF FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT CHANGE AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES IN FISCAL 2018, NET INCOME AND INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE $5,012 AND $0.51, RESPECTIVELY, AND  FOR FISCAL 2018 WERE $1,801 AND $0.18, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPAIRMENT AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS OFFSET PARTIALLY BY EARNINGS.  ON MARCH 31, 2019, OUR NET BOOK VALUE PER SHARE WAS $10.05, DOWN FROM $10.58 AT MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS APPEARING IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  CASH AND INVESTMENTS  $77,753  $76,479  WORKING CAPITAL  (1)  79,896  78,105  WORKING CAPITAL RATIO  (2)  2.5  3.1  WORKING CAPITAL EXCLUDING CASH AND INVESTMENTS  2,143  1,626  WORKING CAPITAL EXCLUDING CASH AND INVESTMENTS AS A  PERCENT OF NET SALES  2.3%  2.1%  (1)  WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES.  (2)  WORKING CAPITAL RATIO EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE USE THE ABOVE RATIOS TO ASSESS OUR LIQUIDITY AND OVERALL FINANCIAL STRENGTH.  NET  CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS $7,917, COMPARED WITH $8,511 FOR FISCAL 2018.  THE $594 DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED WAS DUE TO CASH USAGE FROM UNBILLED REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, WHICH WERE BOTH CASH USAGES IN FISCAL 2019 BUT WERE CASH GENERATORS IN FISCAL 2018, MOSTLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS ADJUSTMENTS, CUSTOMER DEPOSITS AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  CAPITAL SPENDING IN FISCAL 2019 WAS $2,138, COMPARED WITH $2,051 IN FISCAL 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018 WERE APPROXIMATELY 80% FOR FACILITIES ALONG WITH MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT AND THE REMAINING 20% FOR ALL OTHER ITEMS.  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS WERE $3,834 IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED WITH $3,517 I  N FISCAL 2018.  CASH AND INVESTMENTS WERE $77,753 AT MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED WITH $76,479 AT MARCH 31, 2018, UP $1,274 OR 2%.  24  WE INVEST NET CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IN EXCESS OF CASH HELD FOR NEAR-TERM NEEDS IN SHORT-TERM, LESS THAN 365 DAYS, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, MONEY MARKET ACCOUNTS OR U.S. GOVERNMENT INSTRUMENTS, GENERALLY WITH MATURITY PERIODS OF UP TO 180 DAYS.  OUR MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT IS USED TO SECURITIZE OUR OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES OUR COST ON THOSE LETTERS OF CREDIT.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS ARE HELD IN THE U.S.  THE REMAINING 5% IS INVESTED IN OUR CHINA OPERATIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020 (WHICH WE REFER TO AS \"FISCAL 2020\") ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY $2,500 AND $2,800.  APPROXIMATELY 75% TO 80% OF OUR FISCAL 2020 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, WITH THE REMAINING AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE USED FOR OTHER ITEMS.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH JP MORGAN CHASE, N.A. (\"JP MORGAN CHASE\") PROVIDES US WITH A LINE OF CREDIT OF $25,000, INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND BANK GUARANTEES.  IN ADDITION, OUR JP MORGAN CHASE AGREEMENT ALLOWS US TO INCREASE THE LINE OF CREDIT, AT OUR DISCRETION, UP TO ANOTHER $25,000, FOR TOTAL AVAILABILITY OF $50,000.  BORROWINGS UNDER THIS CREDIT FACILITY ARE SECURED BY ALL OF OUR ASSETS.  WE ALSO HAVE A $5,000 UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT WITH HSBC, N.A. (\"HSBC\").  LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING ON MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018 WERE $8,503 AND $8,233, RESPECTIVELY.  THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WERE ISSUED BY JP MORGAN CHASE, HSBC, AS WELL AS BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. (UNDER OUR PREVIOUS CREDIT FACILITY).  THERE WERE NO OTHER AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING ON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018.  THE BORROWING RATE UNDER OUR JP MORGAN CHASE FACILITY AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WAS THE BANK\u2019S PRIME RATE, OR 5.50%.  AVAILABILITY UNDER THE JP MORGAN CHASE AND HSBC LINES OF CREDIT WAS $22,505 AND $24,336 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, COMBINED WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE BOTH TO MEET OUR CASH NEEDS FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR CONTRACTUAL AND COMMERCIAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT FIVE FISCAL YEARS ENDING MARCH 31 AND THEREAFTER WERE AS FOLLOWS.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  TOTAL  LESS THAN  1 YEAR  1 \u2013 3  YEARS  3 \u2013 5  YEARS  THEREAFTER  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (1)  $172  $62  $73  $37  $\u2014  OPERATING LEASES  (1)  879  501  338  40  \u2014  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS  (2)  78  78  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  ACCRUED PENSION LIABILITY  662  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  662  TOTAL  $1,791  $641  $411  $77  $662  (1)  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  (2)  AMOUNTS REPRESENT ANTICIPATED CONTRIBUTIONS DURING FISCAL 2019 TO OUR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN, WHICH PROVIDES HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND ELIGIBLE SURVIVORS OF RETIREES.  ON FEBRUARY 4, 2003, WE TERMINATED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR OUR U.S. EMPLOYEES.  BENEFITS PAYABLE TO RETIREES OF RECORD ON APRIL 1, 2003 REMAINED UNCHANGED.  WE EXPECT TO BE REQUIRED TO MAKE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PLANS BEYOND ONE YEAR, BUT SUCH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED.  NO CONTRIBUTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE MADE TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR FISCAL 2020.  ORDERS AND BACKLOG  ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 10% TO $101,241 FROM $112,230 IN FISCAL 2018.  ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019, EXCLUDING THE BUSINESS HELD FOR SALE, WERE $90,222, DOWN FROM $104,611 IN FISCAL 2018.  ORDERS REPRESENT COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS REQUESTING US TO SUPPLY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON ORDERS RECEIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY DESCRIBED IN NOTES 1 AND 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DOMESTIC ORDERS WERE 61%, OR $62,205, AND INTERNATIONAL ORDERS WERE 39%, OR $39,036, OF OUR TOTAL NET ORDERS IN FISCAL 2019.  THIS COMPARED TO NET DOMESTIC ORDERS OF $77,126, OR 69%, OF TOTAL NET ORDERS, AND INTERNATIONAL ORDERS OF $35,104, OR 31%, OF OUR TOTAL ORDERS IN FISCAL 2018.   DOMESTIC ORDERS DECREASED BY $14,921, OR 19% AS A RESULT OF WEAKER ORDERS FOR THE U.S. NAVY BUSINESS (WE RECEIVED AN ATYPICAL ORDER FOR APPROXIMATELY $25,000 FOR WORK RELATED TO THE U.S. NAVY IN FISCAL 2018) AND REFINING MARKET, OFFSET BY INCREASED DEMAND IN THE PETROCHEMICAL PROCESSING AND NUCLEAR MARKET INDUSTRIES.  NET INTERNATIONAL ORDERS INCREASED BY $3,932, OR 11% IN FISCAL 2019.  25  BACKLOG WAS  $132,127  AT MARCH 31, 2019, UP 12% COMPARED WITH $117,946 AT MARCH 31, 2018.  BACKLOG WAS $124,088, EXCLUDING THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS WHICH IS BEING HEL  D FOR SALE.  BACKLOG IS DEFINED BY US AS THE TOTAL DOLLAR VALUE OF ORDERS RECEIVED FOR WHICH REVENUE HAS NOT YET BEEN RECOGNIZED.  ALL ORDERS IN BACKLOG REPRESENT ORDERS FROM OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS IN ESTABLISHED PRODUCT LINES.  APPROXIMATELY 55% TO 60% O  F ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG ARE EXPECTED TO BE CONVERTED TO SALES WITHIN ONE YEAR.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 22% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EQUIPMENT FOR REFINERY PROJECT WORK, 19% FOR CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL PROJECTS, 7% FOR POWER,  INCLUDING NUCLEAR ENERGY (89% OF WHICH IS NOW CONSIDERED HELD FOR SALE AS NOTED ABOVE), 49% FOR U.S. NAVY PROJECTS AND 3% FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2018, APPROXIMATELY 30% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS ATTRIBUTED TO EQUIPMENT FOR  REFINERY PROJECT WORK, 5% FOR CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL PROJECTS, 5% FOR POWER, INCLUDING NUCLEAR ENERGY, 56% FOR U.S. NAVY PROJECTS AND 4% FOR OTHER INDUSTRIAL OR COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NO PROJECTS ON HOLD.  OUTLOOK  CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE ENERGY MARKETS WE SERVE BEGAN TO INCREASE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AND CONTINUED THROUGH FISCAL 2019. ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS IN THE REFINING MARKET WERE MUCH STRONGER IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 THAN THEY HAD BEEN IN THE THREE YEARS PRIOR.  ORDERS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKET BEGAN TO INCREASE IN FISCAL 2019.  IN GENERAL, REFINING AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRY END MARKETS CONTINUE TO MEASUREDLY RELEASE ORDERS.  WHILE OUR BIDDING ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED A ROBUST PIPELINE OF POTENTIAL ORDERS, FINAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND ORDER PLACEMENTS BY CUSTOMERS REMAIN MEASURED.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, 49% OF OUR BACKLOG WAS FOR THE U.S. NAVY.  OUR PIPELINE CONTINUES TO BE ROBUST, BUT QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS IN ORDER LEVELS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE IN THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS.  COUPLED WITH OUR DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY WITH THE U.S. NAVY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE LONG-TERM STRENGTH OF OUR MARKETS WILL SUPPORT OUR GOAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY GROW OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE INVESTED IN CAPACITY TO SERVE OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS TO EXPAND THE WORK WE DO FOR THE U.S. NAVY.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN BOTH OUR EXISTING AND ANCILLARY MARKETS.  WE ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING EARNINGS VOLATILITY, GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND DIVERSIFYING OUR BUSINESS AND PRODUCT LINES.  WE EXPECT REVENUE IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $95,000 TO $100,000; THIS EXCLUDES THE COMMERCIAL NUCLEAR UTILITY BUSINESS WHICH IS HELD FOR SALE.  THIS WOULD BE AN ANTICIPATED INCREASE OF 14% TO 20% WHEN COMPARED WITH $83,495 FOR FISCAL 2019 WHEN EXCLUDING THE HELD FOR SALE BUSINESS.  WE PROJECT THAT APPROXIMATELY 55% TO 60% OF OUR MARCH 31, 2019 BACKLOG, EXCLUDING BACKLOG HELD FOR SALE, WILL CONVERT TO SALES IN FISCAL 2020.  WE EXPECT THE REMAINING BACKLOG WILL CONVERT BEYOND FISCAL 2020, WHICH INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF U.S. NAVY ORDERS THAT HAVE A LONG CONVERSION CYCLE (UP TO FIVE YEARS) AS WELL AS CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ORDERS, THE CONVERSION OF WHICH HAS BEEN EXTENDED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE EXPECT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE IN THE 23% TO 24% RANGE, COMPARED WITH 23.9% IN FISCAL 2019.  SG&A DURING FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $17,000 AND $18,000.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DURING FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20%.  WE EXPECT THAT CASH FLOW IN FISCAL 2020 WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOLID.  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE ENERGY AND PETROCHEMICAL MARKETS IS GOOD AND EXPECT WE WILL HAVE MORE CLARITY ON THE STRENGTH OF THE ONGOING RECOVERY AS WE WORK THROUGH FISCAL 2020.  CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS  WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY FROM EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS ALLEGEDLY CONTAINED IN, OR ACCOMPANYING, OUR PRODUCTS.  WE ARE A CO-DEFENDANT WITH NUMEROUS OTHER DEFENDANTS IN THESE LAWSUITS AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST THESE CLAIMS.  THE CLAIMS ARE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS ASBESTOS LAWSUITS THAT NAMED US AS A DEFENDANT.  SUCH PREVIOUS LAWSUITS EITHER WERE DISMISSED WHEN IT WAS SHOWN THAT WE HAD NOT SUPPLIED PRODUCTS TO THE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PLACES OF WORK OR WERE SETTLED BY US FOR IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS.  WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT ANY PENDING OR FUTURE MATTERS WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE SAME MANNER AS PREVIOUS LAWSUITS.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THE LAWSUITS TO WHICH WE ARE, OR MAY BECOME, A PARTY TO CANNOT BE DETERMINED AND AN ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS CANNOT BE MADE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE OUTCOMES, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  26  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT REFLECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION 606, \"REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\" (\"ASC 606\"), WHICH IT ADOPTED ON APRIL 1, 2018 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON ALL CONTRACTS WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  CONTROL IS GENERALLY TRANSFERRED WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED, TITLE IS TRANSFERRED, SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE TRANSFERRED, WE HAVE RIGHTS TO PAYMENT, AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP PASS TO THE CUSTOMER.  CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE MAY ALSO BE A FACTOR IN DETERMINING WHETHER CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT HAS TRANSFERRED.  ALTHOUGH REVENUE ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR CONTRACTS, AS MEASURED BY NUMBER OF CONTRACTS, IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE ON LARGER CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE FEWER IN NUMBER BUT GENERALLY REPRESENT THE MAJORITY OF REVENUE, IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME AS THESE CONTRACTS MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA IN ASC 606.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT IF CERTAIN INDICATORS ARE PRESENT.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING ANNUALLY OR EARLIER IF AN EVENT OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT MAY HAVE BEEN REDUCED BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT, IS RECORDED.  FAIR VALUES FOR REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE DEPENDENT ON ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN CALCULATING SUCH AMOUNTS.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, SALARY GROWTH, HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND OTHER ECONOMIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS.  WE BASE THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR OUR PLANS ON MOODY'S OR CITIGROUP PENSION LIABILITY INDEX AA-RATED CORPORATE LONG-TERM BOND YIELD RATE.  THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON THE PLAN\u2019S ASSET ALLOCATION, HISTORICAL RETURNS AND EXPECTATIONS AS TO FUTURE RETURNS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING LIFE OF THE PLAN LIABILITIES THAT WILL BE FUNDED WITH THE PLAN ASSETS.  THE SALARY GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON LONG-TERM ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND FUTURE AND NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK.  THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL COST AND PAYMENT DATA, THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF LIKELY LONG-TERM TRENDS.  INCOME TAXES.  WE USE THE LIABILITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES.  UNDER THIS METHOD, DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF LIABILITIES AND ASSETS MEASURED USING THE ENACTED TAX RATE.  DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING CURRENT TAX RATES.  WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE INFORMATION ABOUT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND OTHER POSSIBLE SOURCES OF REALIZATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND RECORD VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO REDUCE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS TO AN AMOUNT THAT REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNTS OF SUCH DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS THAT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT WILL BE REALIZED.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. DURING THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DO NOT MEET THE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THRESHOLD. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE LAPSE OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESERVE PROVISIONS AND CHANGES TO THE RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  WE HAVE EVALUATED THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND BELIEVE THOSE POLICIES TO BE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE.  27  WE BELIEVE THAT THE MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS RELATE TO LABOR HOUR ESTIMATES AND ESTABLISHMENT OF OPERATIONAL MILESTONES WHICH ARE US  ED TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME, FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES OF GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, UNDER WHICH WE ACCRUE A LOSS WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN  INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, AND ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\" WE RECOGNIZE A MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE USING AN OVER-TIME RECOGNITION METHOD.  THE KEY ESTIMATE FOR THE OVER-TIME RECOGNITION MODEL IS TOTAL LABOR TO BE INCURRED ON EACH CONTRACT AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THIS ESTIMATE CHANGES, IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN EACH PERIOD.  AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE ANTICIPATE CERTAIN LARGE INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS WILL NOT QUALIFY FOR OVER-TIME REVENUE RECOGNITION WHICH MAY CAUSE INORDINATE QUARTER-TO-QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-YEAR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE VOLATILITY.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE ASSESS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS REPORTING UNITS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS.  IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS, LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THAT REPORTING UNIT, IS RECORDED.  FAIR VALUES FOR REPORTING UNITS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON A WEIGHTED COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.  INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE.  CONTINGENCIES, BY THEIR NATURE, RELATE TO UNCERTAINTIES THAT REQUIRE US TO EXERCISE JUDGMENT BOTH IN ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AS WELL AS IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF POTENTIAL LOSS.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS, SEE THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE COST OF BENEFITS TO BE PROVIDED WELL INTO THE FUTURE AND ATTRIBUTING THAT COST OVER THE TIME PERIOD EACH EMPLOYEE WORKS.  TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, EXTENSIVE USE IS MADE OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT INFLATION, INVESTMENT RETURNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER, MEDICAL COSTS AND DISCOUNT RATES.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY.  THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS EXPENSE (INCOME) IS DETERMINED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ACTUARY BY REFERENCE TO A CURRENT YIELD CURVE AND BY CONSIDERING THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.  THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR FISCAL 2019 WAS 3.95% FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND 3.63% FOR OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN.  A REDUCTION IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OF 50 BASIS POINTS, WITH ALL OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE INCREASED FISCAL 2019 NET PERIODIC BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN BY APPROXIMATELY $451 AND $0, RESPECTIVELY.  THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION OF 8.0% USED IN ACCOUNTING FOR OUR PENSION PLAN IS DETERMINED BY EVALUATING THE MIX OF INVESTMENTS THAT COMPRISE PLAN ASSETS AND EXTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS.  A REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF RETURN OF 50 BASIS POINTS, WITH OTHER ASSUMPTIONS HELD CONSTANT, WOULD HAVE INCREASED FISCAL 2019 NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $191.  DURING FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, THE PENSION PLAN RELEASED LIABILITIES FOR VESTED BENEFITS OF CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF NONPARTICIPATING ANNUITY CONTRACTS WITH A THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE COMPANY.  AS A RESULT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS, IN FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION DECREASED $1,589 AND $890, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE PLAN ASSETS DECREASED $1,718 AND $998, RESPECTIVELY.  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL REPORTING PROCESS, A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IS UNDERTAKEN INVOLVING OUR MANAGERS WITH FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR FINANCIAL, CREDIT, TAX, ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND BENEFIT MATTERS, AND OUTSIDE ADVISORS SUCH AS LAWYERS, CONSULTANTS AND ACTUARIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS OF THIS EFFORT PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH THE NECESSARY INFORMATION ON WHICH TO BASE THEIR JUDGMENTS AND TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K RELATED TO REVENUE, CONTINGENCIES, PENSIONS, OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AND OTHER MATTERS REQUIRING THE USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ALTHOUGH ACTUAL OUTCOMES COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ALL NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD, THE SEC, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE, THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS OR ANY OTHER AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING BODY TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THEY MAY HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR  28  DISCUSSION OF THE NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SEE  ''  ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING CHANGES  ''  IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS AN  NUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

THIS SECTION PROVIDES INFORMATION NECESSARY TO EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH AND TO MEET EXISTING AND KNOWN FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER BOTH THE SHORT AND LONG TERM.  REFERENCES TO 2019, 2018 AND 2017 REFER TO THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY \u2013  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  OUR BUSINESS CHALLENGES -  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  IN ADDITION TO THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSION UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT, SOME OF THE KEY CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  18  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES I  N DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A PORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS O  N A PROACTIVE BASIS WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS  ENVIRONMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PR  ESSURE SEAL PRODUCTS, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MOLD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \u2013 THE STRONG U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2018 ATTRACTED CHEAPER MATERIAL INTO THE UNITED STATES, NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPOSITION OF TRADE TARIFFS, WHICH IMPAIRED THE PRICE ADVANTAGE LARGER SUPPLIERS HAD OVER SMALLER COMPETITORS AND HELPED TO MAINTAIN PRICING.  HOWEVER, WITH THE SUBSEQUENT WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, THE PRICE ADVANTAGE OF FOREIGN IMPORTS FOR THE MOST PART DISSIPATED DURING MOST OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH HAS LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  MEANWHILE, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CAPACITY CAME OUT OF THE MARKET THIS TIME, EITHER PLANNED OR UNPLANNED, AS THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY FILING OF SEVERAL MILLS.  IN ADDITION, SOME MILLS MOVED CAPACITY FORMERLY USED FOR COATED PRODUCTION TO UNCOATED PRODUCTION DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO GET HIGHER MARGINS ON THESE PRODUCTS.  EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, THIS LED TO A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL GRADES DURING FISCAL 2019.  AT THIS LEVEL, SUPPLIERS HAVE HISTORICALLY RAISED PRICES IN THE MARKETPLACE, AND FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS NO EXCEPTION, WITH SUPPLIERS RAISING PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIES.  IN THE PAST, PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE PRICING ADJUSTMENTS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR IMPACTED THE ABILITY OF MANUFACTURERS TO TIMELY PASS ALONG THE REQUIRED PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END USERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID ANY POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR.  SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES HAVE STARTED TO CHANGE RECENTLY.  WITH THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE HAVE BEGUN TO INCREASE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING DOMESTIC DEMAND, HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  HISTORICALLY, THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE NORMALIZATION OF PRICING AND COSTS IN THE MARKETPLACE AT MORE TYPICAL LEVELS, BUT WITH THE CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP OF SEVERAL OF THE LARGER DOMESTIC PAPER MILLS, THIS HISTORICAL PENDULUM SWING IN PRICING MAY NOT OCCUR AND MANUFACTURER\u2019S MARGINS MAY CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \u2013 MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTORS, ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  SOME CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND BETTER PRICING AND SERVICES, AND OTHER CUSTOMERS MAY BE FORCED TO RELOCATE THEIR BUSINESS TO THEIR NEW PARENT COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  WHILE WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE HISTORICAL BUSINESS OF THESE CUSTOMERS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE DISCLOSURES AND REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY VALUATIONS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PENSION PLAN OBLIGATIONS, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INCOME TAXES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THE MOST CRITICAL DUE TO THEIR EFFECT ON OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  19  WE MAINTAIN THE PENSION PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES. INCLUDED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE PENSION PLAN COSTS THAT ARE MEASURED USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  AS OUR PENSION PL  AN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS AND ASSOCIATED LIABILITY RECORDED.  AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO INTANGIBLES AND GOODWILL ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION ANALYSIS FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS. AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR EXPECTED USEFUL LIVES. WE EVALUATE THESE AMOUNTS PERIODICALLY (AT LEAST ONCE A YEAR) TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED DURING THE YEAR THAT WOULD INDICATE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT.  WE EXERCISE JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING OUR GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE ASSESS THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AS OF NOVEMBER 30 OF EACH FISCAL YEAR OR EARLIER IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THE COMPANY USES QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT (LIKELIHOOD OF MORE THAN 50%) THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL. SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS CONSIDERED IN APPLYING THIS TEST INCLUDE CONSIDERATION OF MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS, COST FACTORS AFFECTING THE BUSINESS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE SHARE PRICE OF THE COMPANY.  IF QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE NOT DEEMED SUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN A ONE-STEP APPROACH IS APPLIED IN MAKING AN EVALUATION. THE EVALUATION UTILIZES MULTIPLE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, INCLUDING A MARKET APPROACH (MARKET PRICE MULTIPLES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES) AND AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS). THE COMPUTATIONS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SELECTION OF COMPARABLE PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO FUTURE EARNINGS REFLECTING A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AND EARNINGS GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS. A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE SALES, OPERATING MARGINS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, AND GROWTH RATES. IF THE EVALUATION RESULTS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT BEING LOWER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED.  A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 OR FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES UPON SHIPMENT TO THE CUSTOMER IF THE TERMS OF THE SALE ARE FREIGHT ON BOARD (\u201c  FOB  \u201d) SHIPPING POINT (AND THEREFORE TITLE AND ALL RISKS OF OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING RISK OF LOSS, PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER UPON SHIPPING) OR, TO A LESSER EXTENT, UPON DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IF THE TERMS OF THE SALE ARE FOB DESTINATION (AND THEREFORE TITLE AND ALL RISKS OF OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING RISK OF LOSS, PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER UPON DELIVERY).  NET SALES CONSIST OF GROSS SALES INVOICED TO CUSTOMERS, LESS CERTAIN RELATED CHARGES, INCLUDING DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES. RETURNS, DISCOUNTS AND OTHER ALLOWANCES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. IN SOME CASES AND UPON CUSTOMER REQUEST, WE PRINT AND STORE CUSTOM PRINT PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER SPECIFIED FUTURE DELIVERY, GENERALLY WITHIN TWELVE MONTHS. IN THIS CASE, RISK OF LOSS FROM OBSOLESCENCE PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER, THE CUSTOMER IS INVOICED UNDER NORMAL CREDIT TERMS AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN MANUFACTURING IS COMPLETE. APPROXIMATELY $10.3 MILLION, $9.7 MILLION, AND $10.7 MILLION OF REVENUE WERE RECOGNIZED UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DURING FISCAL YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AND FEBRUARY 28, 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  WE MAINTAIN AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL RECEIVABLES TO REFLECT ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED UPON HISTORICAL COLLECTION TRENDS, CURRENT ECONOMIC FACTORS, AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS. WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS USING A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE AGE OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES, EVALUATION OF CUSTOMERS\u2019 CURRENT AND PAST FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CREDIT SCORES, RECENT PAYMENT HISTORY, CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR SALES MANAGERS, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH THE CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY.  20  OUR INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE  LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY VALUES ON HAND, USING SPECIFIC AGING CATEGORIES, AND WRITE DOWN INVENTORY DEEMED OBSOLETE AND/OR SLOW-MOVING BASED ON HISTORICAL USAGE AND ESTIMATED FUTURE USAGE TO ITS ESTIMATED NET REAL  IZABLE VALUE. AS ACTUAL FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY VARY FROM THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT, ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY VALUATIONS MAY BE REQUIRED.  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR INCOME TAXES IN EACH JURISDICTION IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ESTIMATING OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPOSURE TOGETHER WITH ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERENT TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE MUST THEN ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED BASED ON OUR HISTORY OF EARNINGS EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME INCLUDING TAXABLE INCOME IN PRIOR CARRY-BACK YEARS, AS WELL AS FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  TO THE EXTENT WE BELIEVE THAT RECOVERY IS NOT LIKELY, WE MUST ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE. TO THE EXTENT WE ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE MUST INCLUDE AN EXPENSE WITHIN THE TAX PROVISION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE  TAX  CUTS AND JOBS  ACT  (THE \"  TAX  ACT  \"). THE  TAX  ACT  INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME  TAX  SYSTEM INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A FEDERAL CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION FROM 35% TO 21%; LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND THE TRANSITION OF U.S. INTERNATIONAL TAXATION FROM A WORLDWIDE  TAX  SYSTEM TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL  TAX  SYSTEM.  A MAJORITY OF THE PROVISIONS IN THE  TAX  ACT  ARE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. IN RESPONSE TO THE  TAX  ACT  , THE SEC STAFF ISSUED GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR THE  TAX  EFFECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  . THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES A ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD FOR COMPANIES TO COMPLETE THE ACCOUNTING. WE REFLECTED THE INCOME  TAX  EFFECTS OF THOSE ASPECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  FOR WHICH THE ACCOUNTING IS COMPLETE. TO THE EXTENT OUR ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INCOME  TAX  EFFECTS OF THE  TAX  ACT  IS INCOMPLETE BUT WE ARE ABLE TO DETERMINE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE, WE RECORDED A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF A COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE A PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPLY THE PROVISIONS OF THE  TAX  LAWS THAT WERE IN EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE ENACTMENT OF THE  TAX  ACT.  AS A RESULT OF THE REDUCTION OF THE CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 21%, WE RE-VALUED OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF ENACTMENT, WITH RESULTING TAX EFFECTS ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE REPORTING PERIOD OF ENACTMENT. THIS CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE RESULTED IN REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE BEING RECOGNIZED OF $3.6 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 DUE TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES BASED ON THE EXPECTED PREVAILING TAX RATE AT THE EXPECTED TIME OF THEIR REALIZATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE ASSESSMENTS AS TO THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ACCRUED LIABILITIES, MORE SPECIFICALLY OUR LIABILITIES RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AS THESE PLANS ARE SELF-FUNDED. TO HELP US IN THIS EVALUATION PROCESS, WE ROUTINELY GET OUTSIDE THIRD-PARTY ASSESSMENTS OF OUR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES UNDER EACH PLAN.  IN VIEW OF SUCH UNCERTAINTIES, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SINCE SUCH STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE WHEN MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED, THIS FINANCIAL OVERVIEW IS FOR THE CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THE PRODUCTION AND SALES OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS, AND EXCLUDE THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT, WHICH WE SOLD IN MAY 2016.

OUR NET SALES INCREASED FROM $370.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO $400.8 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AN INCREASE OF 8.3%.  THE MARKET CONTINUES TO BE FAIRLY SOFT WITH COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES.  HOWEVER, DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR MADE DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION MORE ATTRACTIVE INTERNATIONALLY.  THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION, COUPLED WITH THE SHRINKING DOMESTIC MILL CAPACITY, RESULTED IN AN ENVIRONMENT CONDUCIVE FOR PAPER AND OTHER MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES DOMESTICALLY.  THOSE INCREASES, IF ABLE TO BE TIMELY PASSED ALONG TO CUSTOMERS, WOULD HELP OFFSET SOME OF THE NORMAL INDUSTRY SALES ATTRITION.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN JULY 2018, AND ABTL, WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN APRIL 2018, ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET NORMAL INDUSTRY REVENUE DECLINES DUE TO PRINT ATTRITION AND OTHER CHANGES.  THESE TWO ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED OVER $44.7 MILLION IN NET SALES DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  OUR NET SALES INCREASED FROM $356.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2017 TO $370.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018, AN INCREASE OF 3.7%.  THE MARKET WAS FAIRLY SOFT WITH COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES.  HOWEVER, THE REVERSAL OF SOME OF THE U.S. DOLLAR\u2019S STRENGTH MADE DOMESTIC PAPER PRODUCTION MORE ATTRACTIVE.  THIS FACTOR, ALONG WITH THE SHRINKING OF SOME DOMESTIC MILL CAPACITY, RESULTED IN PAPER PRICE INCREASES.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT PRINTING COMPANY, INC. AND ITS RELATED ENTITIES (\u201c  INDEPENDENT  \u201d), WHICH WAS COMPLETED IN JANUARY 2017, HAD A COMPARATIVE IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $39.3 MILLION ON OUR NET SALES LAST FISCAL YEAR.  THIS ACQUISITION REMAINS AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET NORMAL INDUSTRY PRINT ATTRITION AND OTHER FACTORS.  22  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS INCREASED FROM $253.  0 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO $277.4 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019, OR 9.6%.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\u201c  MARGIN  \u201d) DECREASED FROM 31.7% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 30.8% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OUR MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD WAS IMPACTED PRIMARIL  Y BY THE INCREASED COST OF RAW MATERIALS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT BY THE ACQUISITION OF ABTL AND WRIGHT, WHICH HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTED MARGIN.  THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED BY RAW MATERIAL AND FREIGHT COST INCREASES.  THE  TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICAL PRICE INCREASES WERE LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PA  SS THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THIS YEAR THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\u2019 ABILITY TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  THESE PRICE INCREASES WIL  L CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR COSTS START TO DECLINE DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE IN FOREIGN IMPORTS OR WEAKENING DOMESTIC DEMAND.  AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ACQUISITION OF WRI  GHT AND ABTL HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS AS NEITHER OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAD MARGINS APPROACHING OUR LEVEL.  WE BELIEVE ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURES AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, THEIR MARGINS WIL  L IMPROVE TO MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS.  OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM $252.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO $253.0 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018, OR 0.3%.  OUR GROSS MARGIN INCREASED FROM 29.3% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO 31.7% FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018. IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, OUR MARGIN WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED MEDICAL EXPENSES DUE TO OUR MEDICAL CLAIMS EXCEEDING HISTORICAL LEVELS.  WE IMPLEMENTED A NEW COST REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES TO OUR HEALTH PLAN, AT THE START OF CALENDAR YEAR 2017.  WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR MARGIN BY OVER $4.0 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201c  SG&A  \u201d) EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6.2%, FROM $69.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO $73.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A EXPENSES DECLINED FROM 18.8% IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 18.3% FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT AND ABTL ADDED APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN SG&A EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE SG&A EXPENSES AFTER ACQUISITIONS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES, WHICH ALLOWS US TO INTEGRATE MANY OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES\u2019 BACK-OFFICE PROCESSES.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018, OUR SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $6.7 MILLION, OR 10.7%, FROM $62.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO $69.2 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 18.8% AND 17.5% FOR THE FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT ADDED APPROXIMATELY $8.0 MILLION IN SG&A EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018, OR 20.3% OF ITS RESPECTIVE NET SALES.  AS WE CONTINUE TO INTEGRATE THIS ACQUISITION INTO OUR CULTURE AND SYSTEMS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE THESE EXPENSES TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORICAL SG&A PERCENTAGE.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY (I) CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING PRACTICE FOR HANDLING ITS TRADEMARKS/TRADE NAMES FROM AN INDEFINITE LIFE TO A FINITE LIFE METHOD ON MARCH 1, 2017 WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION TO SG&A EXPENSE DURING THE PERIOD, (II) PAID A SPECIAL BONUS TO OUR NON-MANAGEMENT LEVEL EMPLOYEES OF $500 PER EMPLOYEE IN DECEMBER 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT WHICH IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSE BY $1.2 MILLION, AND (III) PAID APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION MORE IN PERFORMANCE RELATED BONUSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  (GAIN) LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $0.2 MILLION GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $0.2 MILLION LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS THE CLOSING AND CONSOLIDATION OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. THE $0.3 MILLION LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE $0.5 MILLION LOSS ON THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND ITS ASSOCIATED PROPERTY OFFSET BY THE $0.2 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF A SECOND UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, OUR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $50.1 MILLION, OR 12.4% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $47.8 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT AND ABTL CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $3.4 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR OPERATIONAL INCOME DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, OR 8.8%.  23  OUR  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS $47.8 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $41.9 MILLION, OR 11.7% OF NET SALES, FO  R FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE ACQUISITION OF INDEPENDENT POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 BY  APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION.  OTHER EXPENSE.  OTHER EXPENSE WAS $0.2 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED TO $0.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THIS DECREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE OF INVESTMENT INCOME IN FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OTHER EXPENSE WAS $0.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO $1.9 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THIS DECREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE OF INVESTMENT INCOME IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS WELL AS THE RECLASSIFICATION OF PENSION EXPENSE FROM COST OF GOODS SOLD AND SG&A EXPENSE TO OTHER EXPENSE-NET OF $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WERE 25.03%, 30.2%, AND 34.0%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX ACT.  THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT, DESPITE THE TAX ACT ONLY BEING IN EFFECT FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  NET EARNINGS (LOSS).  OUR NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $26.4 MILLION, OR $1.03 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017, $32.8 MILLION, OR $1.29 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $37.4 MILLION, OR $1.45 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  NET EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH CONSISTED OF A WRITE-OFF OF A $2.0 MILLION RECEIVABLE ($1.4 MILLION, NET OF TAX) RELATING TO THE ESCROWED PURCHASE PRICE FROM THE SALE OF OUR APPAREL SEGMENT AND A $1.6 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE FINAL TAX BASIS ON ASSETS SOLD IN THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT.  NET LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS ($0.96) PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH CONSISTED OF THE NET EARNINGS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT OF $0.09 PER DILUTED SHARE AND THE NET LOSS FROM THE SALE OF $27.1 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR ($1.05) PER DILUTED SHARE.  THE LOSS FROM THE SALE INCLUDED THE WRITE-OFF OF THE BALANCE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS OF $16.1 MILLION, OR $10.7 MILLION, NET OF TAXES.  OVERALL, THE COMPANY REALIZED NET EARNINGS OF $37.4 MILLION, OR $1.45 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, $32.9 MILLION, OR $1.30 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $1.8 MILLION, OR $0.07 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017  WORKING CAPITAL  $134,542  $133,773  $119,282  CASH  $88,442  $96,230  $80,466  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION, OR 0.6%, FROM $133.8 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES BY $13.6 MILLION, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH AND PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $11.2 MILLION, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $1.6 MILLION.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.5-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 5.3-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $14.5 MILLION, OR 12.1%, FROM $119.3 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2017 TO $133.8 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, INCREASED FROM 5.0-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 TO 5.5-TO-1.0 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018.  OUR CURRENT RATIO INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH.  CASH FLOW COMPONENTS  FISCAL YEARS ENDED  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  2017  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $51,335  $45,290  $58,887  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(31,770  )  $(3,953  )  $86,090  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(27,353  )  $(25,573  )  $(72,468  )  24  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $51.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $45.3 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $58.9 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2017, OR AN INCREASE OF $6.0 MILLION IN 2019 OVER 2018 AND A DECREASE OF $13.6 MILLION  IN 2018 OVER 2017.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THREE FACTORS: (I) A $4.5 MILLION INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS; (II) A $1.5 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; AND (III) A $3.4 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  THESE THREE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE OFFSET BY TWO NEGATIVE FACTORS: (I) AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $3.6 MILLION; AND (II) A $2.4 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES.  OUR DECREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IN COMPARISON TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FOUR FACTORS: (I) A DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS RELATED TO OUR APPAREL SEGMENT OF $34.8 MILLION; (II) A DECREASE IN OUR DEFERRED TAXES OF $6.2 MILLION; (III) AN INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID INCOME TAXES OF $2.7 MILLION; AND (IV) INCREASED EARNINGS OF $31.1 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $31.8 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $4.0 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $86.1 MILLION PROVIDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE $27.8 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE A $2.2 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE $26.0 MILLION INCREASE IN THE PURCHASES OF BUSINESSES.  THE DECREASE IN CASH IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET PROCEEDS OF $107.4 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT WHICH TOOK PLACE ON MAY 25, 2016, OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $17.2 MILLION IN CASH USED FOR THE PURCHASES OF BUSINESSES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $27.4 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $25.6 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND $72.5 MILLION USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017.  THE INCREASE IN OUR CASH USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTED FROM TWO FACTORS: (I) $0.4 MILLION MORE IN DIVIDENDS WERE PAID IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018; AND (II) $1.5 MILLION MORE WAS USED TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE BOARD-APPROVED REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  THE DECREASE IN OUR CASH USED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2017 RESULTED FROM THREE FACTORS: (I) NO DEBT WAS PAID DOWN IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO $10.0 MILLION PAID DOWN IN 2017; (II) $34.9 MILLION LESS IN DIVIDENDS WERE PAID IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 COMPARED TO 2017, WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL ONE-TIME DIVIDEND OF $1.50 PER SHARE THAT WAS PAID AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF THE APPAREL SEGMENT; AND (III) $5.1 MILLION LESS WAS USED TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE BOARD-APPROVED REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2018 AS COMPARED TO 2017.  STOCK REPURCHASE \u2013  THE BOARD HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH AUTHORIZED AMOUNT IS CURRENTLY UP TO $40.0 MILLION.  UNDER THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, SHARE PURCHASES MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, SHARE PRICE, TRADING VOLUME AND OTHER FACTORS.  SUCH PURCHASES ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE INSIDER TRADING AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS AND REGULATIONS.  THESE REPURCHASES MAY BE COMMENCED OR SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME OR FROM TIME TO TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  DURING OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 247,788 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.42 PER SHARE.  SINCE THE PROGRAM\u2019S INCEPTION IN OCTOBER 2008, THERE HAVE BEEN 1,690,024 COMMON SHARES REPURCHASED AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $15.64 PER SHARE. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THERE WAS $13.6 MILLION AVAILABLE TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  UNRELATED TO THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY PURCHASED 15 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO REPURCHASE ITS SHARES UNDER ITS REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING FISCAL YEAR 2020 AS IT DETERMINES SUCH REPURCHASES TO BE IN ITS AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS BEST INTEREST.  25  CREDIT FACILITY  \u2013  THE COMPANY IS PARTY TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH HAS BEEN AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, PURSUANT TO WHICH A CREDIT FACILITY HAS BEEN EXTENDED  TO THE COMPANY ( THE \u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \u201d).  THE CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURES ON AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CR  EDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ALSO CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AN  D CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSING OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE  COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (I) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (II) THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LEVER  AGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.50:1.00.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 3.0% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201c  EBITDA  \u201d).  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD $30.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AND $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $69.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL AS ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  WE DID NOT PAY ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT LINE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE AVAILABLE LINE OF CREDIT IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  PENSION PLAN \u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201c  ERISA  \u201d). DUE TO THE RECENT ENACTMENT OF THE MOVING AHEAD FOR PROGRESS IN THE 21  ST  CENTURY (\u201c  MAP-21  \u201d) IN JULY 2012, PLAN SPONSORS CAN CALCULATE THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PENSION PLAN LIABILITY USING A 25-YEAR AVERAGE OF INTEREST RATES PLUS OR MINUS A CORRIDOR.  PRIOR TO MAP-21, THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN MEASURING THE PENSION LIABILITY WAS BASED ON THE 24-MONTH AVERAGE OF INTEREST RATES.  WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING EACH OF OUR LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, GIVEN OUR CURRENT FUNDING STATUS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND ABSENT ANY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EVENT, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTED SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE BETWEEN $1.0 MILLION TO $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDED STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDED, AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD A PREPAID PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE INCREASED THE DISCOUNT RATE WE USED TO CALCULATE OUR PENSION LIABILITY TO 4.1% FROM 4.05% USED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH DECREASED OUR RECORDED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION (EACH 10 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE POTENTIALLY IMPACTS OUR COMPUTED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $900,000).  IN ADDITION, WE ADOPTED THE NEW MP-2018 MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RP-2014 MORTALITY TABLES (WHICH WERE ADOPTED FOUR YEARS AGO), WHICH REDUCED OUR RECORDED PENSION LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION.  THE UPDATED MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE MP-2018 REFLECTS SLIGHTLY LOWER PROJECTED MORTALITY EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS SCALE MP-2017 UTILIZED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018\u2019S VALUATION OF LIABILITIES.  THE PROJECTED RETURN ON OUR PENSION ASSETS REMAINED AT 7.5% FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  INVENTORIES  \u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR CURRENT INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND OTHER NORMAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  26  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \u2013  T  HERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS S  INCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS OUR CONTRA  CTUAL COMMITMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 (IN THOUSANDS).

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016 AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017 SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  CERTAIN YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AND CERTAIN AMOUNTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017, REFLECT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO CERTAIN AMOUNTS FOR SUCH PERIOD AND DATE. SEE NOTE 3 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL MEDIA COMPANY THAT, THROUGH OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO SEGMENTS, REACHES AND ENGAGES U.S. HISPANICS ACROSS ACCULTURATION LEVELS AND MEDIA CHANNELS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR DIGITAL SEGMENT, WHOSE OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN SPAIN, MEXICO, ARGENTINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA, REACHES A GLOBAL MARKET. OUR OPERATIONS ENCOMPASS INTEGRATED MARKETING AND MEDIA SOLUTIONS, COMPRISED OF TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL PROPERTIES AND DATA ANALYTICS SERVICES. FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, WE REPORT IN THREE SEGMENTS BASED UPON THE TYPE OF ADVERTISING MEDIUM: TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO BROADCASTING AND DIGITAL MEDIA. OUR NET REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $297.8 MILLION. OF THAT AMOUNT, REVENUE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR 51%, REVENUE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR 27%, AND REVENUE ATTRIBUTED TO OUR RADIO SEGMENT ACCOUNTED FOR 22%.  WE OWN AND/OR OPERATE 55 PRIMARY TELEVISION STATIONS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, CONNECTICUT, FLORIDA, KANSAS, MASSACHUSETTS, NEVADA, NEW MEXICO, TEXAS AND WASHINGTON, D.C. WE OWN AND OPERATE 49 RADIO STATIONS IN 16 U.S. MARKETS. OUR RADIO STATIONS CONSIST OF 38 FM AND 11 AM STATIONS LOCATED IN ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, FLORIDA, NEVADA, NEW MEXICO AND TEXAS. WE ALSO OPERATE ENTRAVISION SOLUTIONS AS OUR NATIONAL SALES REPRESENTATION DIVISION, THROUGH WHICH WE SELL ADVERTISEMENTS AND SYNDICATE RADIO PROGRAMMING TO MORE THAN 100 MARKETS STATIONS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. WE ALSO PROVIDE DIGITAL ADVERTISING SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ADVERTISERS TO REACH PRIMARILY ONLINE HISPANIC AUDIENCES WORLDWIDE. WE OPERATE A PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PLATFORM THAT DELIVERS DIGITAL ADVERTISING IN VARIOUS ADVERTISING FORMATS THAT ALLOWS ADVERTISERS TO REACH AUDIENCES ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF INTERNET-CONNECTED DEVICES ON OUR OWNED AND OPERATED DIGITAL MEDIA SITES; THE DIGITAL MEDIA SITES OF OUR PUBLISHER PARTNERS; AND ON OTHER DIGITAL MEDIA SITES WE ACCESS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY PLATFORMS AND EXCHANGES.  WE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING TIME ON TELEVISION STATIONS, RADIO STATIONS AND DIGITAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, AND FROM RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO WITH MVPDS. ADVERTISING RATES ARE, IN LARGE PART, BASED ON EACH MEDIUM\u2019S ABILITY TO ATTRACT AUDIENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS TARGETED BY ADVERTISERS. WE RECOGNIZE ADVERTISING REVENUE WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE BROADCAST AND WHEN DISPLAY OR OTHER DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS RECORD IMPRESSIONS ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR THIRD PARTY PUBLISHERS OR AS THE ADVERTISER\u2019S PREVIOUSLY AGREED-UPON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED. WE DO NOT OBTAIN LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS FROM OUR ADVERTISERS AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THEY MAY CANCEL, REDUCE OR POSTPONE ORDERS WITHOUT PENALTIES. WE PAY COMMISSIONS TO AGENCIES FOR LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING. FOR CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH AGENCIES, WE RECORD NET REVENUE FROM THESE AGENCIES. SEASONAL REVENUE FLUCTUATIONS ARE COMMON IN OUR INDUSTRY AND ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO VARIATIONS IN ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES BY BOTH LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISERS. OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER GENERALLY PRODUCES THE LOWEST NET REVENUE FOR THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISING REVENUE IS GENERALLY HIGHER DURING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION YEARS (2016, 2020, ETC.), RESULTING FROM SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND, TO A LESSER DEGREE, CONGRESSIONAL MID-TERM ELECTION YEARS (2018, 2022, ETC.), RESULTING FROM INCREASED POLITICAL ADVERTISING, COMPARED TO OTHER YEARS.  WE REFER TO THE REVENUE GENERATED BY AGREEMENTS WITH MVPDS AS RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS PAYMENTS FROM MVPDS FOR ACCESS TO OUR TELEVISION STATION SIGNALS SO THAT THEY MAY REBROADCAST OUR SIGNALS AND CHARGE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS FOR THIS PROGRAMMING. WE RECOGNIZE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE EARNED AS THE TELEVISION SIGNAL IS DELIVERED TO THE MVPD.  OUR FCC LICENSES GRANT US SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WITHIN EACH OF THE TELEVISION MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE REGARD THESE RIGHTS AS A VALUABLE ASSET. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF MOBILE DEVICES AND ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE FREED UP EXCESS SPECTRUM CAPACITY, THE MONETIZATION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS HAS BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO UTILIZE EXCESS SPECTRUM FOR THE BROADCAST OF THEIR MULTICAST NETWORKS; CHARGING FEES TO ACCOMMODATE THE OPERATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MOVING CHANNEL POSITIONS OR ACCEPTING INTERFERENCE WITH BROADCASTING OPERATIONS; AND MODIFYING AND/OR RELINQUISHING SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WHILE CONTINUING TO BROADCAST THROUGH CHANNEL SHARING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE GENERATED BY SUCH AGREEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LEASE OR WHEN WE HAVE RELINQUISHED ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FOR A STATION OR HAVE RELINQUISHED OUR RIGHTS TO OPERATE A STATION ON THE EXISTING CHANNEL FREE FROM INTERFERENCE.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONSIDER STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF TELEVISION STATIONS TO FURTHER THIS STRATEGY FROM TIME TO TIME, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES EXPECTED TO ARISE AS THE TELEVISION BROADCAST INDUSTRY ANTICIPATES ADVANCES IN ATSC 3.0.  48  OUR PRIMARY EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS PAID TO OUR SALES STAFF AND AMOUNTS PAID TO OUR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVE FIRMS, AS WELL AS EXPENSES FOR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS, PROMOTION AND SELLING, ENGINEERING, MARKETING, AND LOCAL PROGRAMMING. OUR LOCAL PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR TELEVISION CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCING A LOCAL NEWSCAST IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS THAT WERE SURRENDERED IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM. IN ADDITION, COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE COSTS OF ONLINE MEDIA ACQUIRED FROM THIRD-PARTY PUBLISHERS AND THIRD PARTY SERVER COSTS. DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE SALARIES AND COMMISSIONS OF SALES STAFF, AMOUNTS PAID TO NATIONAL REPRESENTATION FIRMS, PRODUCTION AND PROGRAMMING EXPENSES, FEES FOR RATINGS SERVICES, AND ENGINEERING COSTS.  CORPORATE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES RELATED TO CORPORATE OFFICERS AND BACK OFFICE FUNCTIONS, THIRD PARTY LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SERVICES, AND FEES INCURRED AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY.  HIGHLIGHTS  DURING 2018, OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE DECREASED TO $297.8 MILLION FROM $536.0 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, WHICH WERE $263.9 MILLION IN 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWTH IN OUR DIGITAL SEGMENT AND IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT. OUR AUDIENCE SHARES REMAINED STRONG IN THE NATION\u2019S MOST DENSELY POPULATED HISPANIC MARKETS.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $152.9 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $412.0 MILLION IN 2017. THIS DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $259.1 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, WHICH WERE $263.9 MILLION IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM  . IN ADDITION, THE DECREASE WAS DUE TO DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. THE OVERALL DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $35.1 MILLION AND $31.4 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $63.9 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $66.9 MILLION IN 2017. THIS DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP.  NET REVENUE FOR OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $81.0 MILLION IN 2018, FROM $57.1 MILLION IN 2017. THIS INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE ACQUISITION OF 100% OF THE STOCK OF SMADEX, S.L., OR,  SMADEX, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND THE INCREASED USE OF AUTOMATED BUYING PLATFORMS, REFERRED TO IN OUR INDUSTRY AS PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE PROXY AGREEMENT PROVIDES TERMS RELATING TO COMPENSATION TO BE PAID TO US BY UNIVISION WITH RESPECT TO RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH MVPDS.

(2)  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA MEANS NET INCOME (LOSS) PLUS GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OPERATING AND CORPORATE EXPENSES, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NON-RECURRING CASH EXPENSES, GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS. WE USE THE TERM CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THAT MEASURE IS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY AND DOES NOT INCLUDE GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION AND DOES INCLUDE SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS.  SINCE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE GOVERNING SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO OUR INVESTORS.  WE MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING BY AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO $100.0 MILLION PLUS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD RESULT IN OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO, OR THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL SENIOR DEBT (NET OF UP TO $75.0 MILLION OF UNRESTRICTED CASH) TO TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, NOT EXCEEDING 4.0. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2018, AT THE END OF EVERY CALENDAR YEAR, IN THE EVENT OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO IS WITHIN CERTAIN RANGES, WE MUST MAKE A DEBT PREPAYMENT EQUAL TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR EXCESS CASH FLOW, WHICH IS DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, LESS CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, LESS DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, LESS TAXES PAID, LESS OTHER AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE DEFINITION OF EXCESS CASH FLOW IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN EACH CASE AS OF DECEMBER 31): 2018, 3.2 TO 1; 2017, 4.4 TO 1.  WHILE MANY IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND WE CONSIDER CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE IMPORTANT, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OTHER MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SUCH AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME.  AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES NON-CASH GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES AND INCLUDES SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LINE ITEMS.   THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER BOTH NON-GAAP AND GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED TO MAKE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS.  55  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.

NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT INCREASED TO $294.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $272.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.7 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $23.9 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017. ADDITIONALLY, $1.9 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $3.0 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP.  56  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS  DECREASED TO  $3.0  MILLION  FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $263.9  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE FROM THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019, NET REVENUE WILL INCREASE FROM DIGITAL MEDIA, RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, AND SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS, COMPARED TO 2018. WE ANTICIPATE POLITICAL REVENUE WILL DECREASE IN 2019, COMPARED TO 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS).  WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2018. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  COST OF REVENUE-DIGITAL.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $45.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $12.1 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO $125.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $119.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $5.9 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $6.3 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE, AND DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017, AND SMADEX IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. ADDITIONALLY, $2.9 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF STATION KMIR-TV IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN THAT YEAR, AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $3.3 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO 42% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 22% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2019 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE CUTS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $51.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $49.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $3.5 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $0.6 MILLION IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, AND A DECREASE OF $0.4 MILLION IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 17% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2019 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY EXPENSE CUTS, BOTH OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018.  CORPORATE EXPENSES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES DECREASED TO $26.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $27.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $1.0 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM RECORDED IN 2017, WHICH EXPENSES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018, AND DUE DILIGENCE COSTS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND DUE DILIGENCE COSTS RELATED TO THE SMADEX ACQUISITION IN 2018. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CORPORATE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 5% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE INCREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN 2017  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM,  WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  WE BELIEVE THAT CORPORATE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASED SALARY EXPENSE.  57  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DECREASED  TO  $16.3  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $16.4  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , A  DE  CREASE OF  $0.  1  MILLION. THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN ASSETS BECOMING FULLY DEPRECIATED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED AMORTIZATION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE HEADWAY AND SMADEX ACQUISITIONS.  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION, WE RECOGNIZED INCOME OF $1.2  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS.  OUR HISTORICAL REVENUES HAVE PRIMARILY BEEN DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, AND THE MAJORITY OF OUR CURRENT REVENUES CONTINUE TO BE, AND ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN, DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. HOWEVER, OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN THE CURRENCIES OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED, AND WE HAVE OPERATIONS IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE U.S., PRIMARILY THOSE OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE OPERATING EXPENSE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS, THAT IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE OPERATIONS RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS INCREASED TO $1.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $0.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $1.2 MILLION, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS THAT AFFECTED OUR DIGITAL SEGMENT OPERATIONS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HEADWAY BUSINESS.  OTHER OPERATING GAIN.  OTHER OPERATING GAIN INCREASED TO $1.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $0.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $0.9 MILLION, DUE TO GAINS IN CONNECTION WITH THE REQUIRED RELOCATION OF CERTAIN TELEVISION STATIONS TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  OPERATING INCOME.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, OPERATING INCOME WAS $33.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO $277.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED TO $11.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $15.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $4.1 MILLION. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS THAT WERE TERMINATED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017.  LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  . WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $0.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 RELATED TO CAPITALIZED FINANCE COSTS WRITTEN OFF DUE TO PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT. WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 DUE TO THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT FACILITY.  IMPAIRMENT LOSS ON INVESTMENT.  WE DETERMINED THAT  A DECREASE IN VALUE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT OCCURRED. AS SUCH,  WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS $7.9 MILLION OR 37% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS HIGHER THAN OUR STATUTORY RATE DUE TO FOREIGN AND STATE TAXES, AND NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $82.6 MILLION OR 32% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE, ADJUSTS THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON A \u201cMORE LIKELY THAN NOT\u201d THRESHOLD. THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT MAINTAINED IN ANY SUCH ALLOWANCE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT CALLS.  BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED.  SEGMENT OPERATIONS  TELEVISION  REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.  NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $149.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $148.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $1.8 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NATIONAL AND LOCAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AS A RESULT IN PART OF RATINGS DECLINES AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC PREFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS TELEVISION, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $35.1 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO $31.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR  58  ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2019 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS DECREASED TO $3.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE FROM THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH REVENUE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS)  .  WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2018. COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $62.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $59.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $2.9 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUISITION OF STATION KMIR-TV IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN THAT YEAR, AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $21.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $22.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $0.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  RADIO  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $63.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $66.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $3.0 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, AND AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP. WE BELIEVE THAT A NUMBER OF FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING, INCLUDING RATINGS DECLINES AND CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC PREFERENCES. ADDITIONALLY, THE DECREASE IS PART OF A TREND FOR ADVERTISING TO MOVE INCREASINGLY FROM TRADITIONAL MEDIA, SUCH AS RADIO, TO NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS DIGITAL MEDIA  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $41.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $44.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, A DECREASE OF $3.3 MILLION.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.  THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE CURRENT SHIFT TOWARD PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY AND THAT OTHER TRENDS MAY EMERGE, REQUIRING US TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING AND ADAPTING CERTAIN OF OUR DIGITAL OFFERINGS, AND CLOSELY MONITORING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL MEDIA BUSINESS.  COST OF REVENUE  .  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $45.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $33.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $12.1 MILLION.  THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017.  COST OF REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS WAS CONSTANT. BECAUSE OF THIRD PARTY MEDIA COSTS, OUR MARGINS TEND TO BE SMALLER IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT THAN IN OUR OTHER BROADCAST SEGMENTS. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, COST OF REVENUE DECREASED TO 56% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM 58% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES  . DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $21.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $6.2 MILLION.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE, AND DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017, AND SMADEX IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR PREEXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  59  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO  $11.6  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  FROM  $8.1  MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017  , AN INCREASE OF  $3.5  MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE HEADWAY BUSINESS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FULL YEAR IN 2017.

OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $34.0 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO NET REVENUE IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT OF $11.5 MILLION DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN LOCAL REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $8.9 MILLION DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT GENERATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018, NET REVENUE WILL INCREASE FROM DIGITAL MEDIA, RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, AND POLITICAL REVENUE, COMPARED TO 2017. WE ANTICIPATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WILL DECREASE IN 2018.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS).  COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT INCUR COST OF REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.

DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED TO $119.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $113.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $5.9 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $8.8 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT OF $2.6 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR RATINGS SERVICES, AND A DECREASE IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED TO 22% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 44% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE DURING 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OPERATING HEADWAY FOR A FULL YEAR IN 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS IN 2017.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $49.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $46.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $2.3 MILLION. OF THE OVERALL INCREASE, $3.3 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN PRIOR PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION OF THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT AND WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $1.7 MILLION IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DUE TO DECREASES IN EVENT EXPENSE AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED TO 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 18% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE DURING 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF OPERATING HEADWAY FOR A FULL YEAR IN 2018 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS IN 2017.  60  CORPORATE EXPENSES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $27.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $24.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $3.4 MILLION. . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CORPORATE EXPENSES DECREASED TO 5% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE DECREASE IN CORPORATE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WITH RESPECT TO WHICH THERE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED CORPORATE EXPENSES.  WE BELIEVE THAT CORPORATE EXPENSES WILL DECREASE DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 AS A RESULT OF EXPENSES IN THE 2017 PERIOD RELATED TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED TO $16.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $1.1 MILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION ON THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM THE HEADWAY ACQUISITION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AS CERTAIN ASSETS ARE NOW FULLY DEPRECIATED.  OPERATING INCOME.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE FACTORS, AND INCLUDING $0.3 MILLION OF OTHER OPERATING GAIN AS RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT A GAIN AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM, OPERATING INCOME WAS $277.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, COMPARED TO $48.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER INCOME IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF OUR INTEREST SWAP AGREEMENTS.  LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT  . WE RECORDED A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 DUE TO THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT FACILITY. IN 2016, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED FINANCE COSTS WRITTEN OFF DUE TO PARTIAL PREPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 WAS $82.6 MILLION OR 32% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS LOWER THAN OUR STATUTORY RATE DUE TO THE REVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 WAS $13.1 MILLION OR 39% OF OUR PRE-TAX INCOME.  OUR MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND, IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REALIZABLE, ADJUSTS THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ON A \u201cMORE LIKELY THAN NOT\u201d THRESHOLD. THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT MAINTAINED IN ANY SUCH ALLOWANCE IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS, SEVERAL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT CALLS.  BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS, WE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE REALIZED.  SEGMENT OPERATIONS  TELEVISION  REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT.  NET REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING AND RETRANSMISSION CONSENT IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $148.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $159.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $11.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN LOCAL REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN POLITICAL ADVERTISING REVENUE, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2017, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NATIONAL ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN INCREASE IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE. WE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $31.4 MILLION IN RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 COMPARED TO $29.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. WE ANTICIPATE THAT RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE FOR THE FULL YEAR 2018 WILL BE GREATER THAN IT WAS FOR THE FULL YEAR 2017 AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE A GROWING SOURCE OF NET REVENUE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS.  NET REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $263.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE DID NOT GENERATE REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS IN 2016.  COST OF REVENUE-TELEVISION (SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS)  .  COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO REVENUE FROM SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WAS $12.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.

DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT DECREASED TO $59.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $62.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $2.5 MILLION. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AND A DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR RATINGS SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALARY EXPENSE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR TELEVISION SEGMENT INCREASED TO $22.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $21.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $0.7 MILLION.

DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT DECREASED TO $44.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $44.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, A DECREASE OF $0.3 MILLION.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, WHICH DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN PRIOR PERIODS.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NATIONAL REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY SHIFTS IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY TOWARD VIDEO ADVERTISING AND PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE.  THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND UNDERGOING RAPID CHANGE, WHICH INCLUDES THE CURRENT SHIFT TOWARD PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE IN THE DIGITAL ADVERTISING INDUSTRY AND THAT OTHER TRENDS MAY EMERGE, REQUIRING US TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMANDS, WHICH MIGHT INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGING AND ADAPTING CERTAIN OF OUR DIGITAL OFFERINGS, AND CLOSELY MONITORING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL MEDIA BUSINESS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, COST OF REVENUE INCREASED TO 58% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM 41% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016. THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF DIGITAL REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF HEADWAY AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF PROGRAMMATIC REVENUE IN OUR PRE-EXISTING DIGITAL BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH VOLUME AND RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF THESE PROGRAMMATIC PLATFORMS, THE MARGINS TEND TO BE LOWER.  DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES  . DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA SEGMENT INCREASED TO $15.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FROM $6.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, AN INCREASE OF $8.8 MILLION.

WE HAD POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $33.8 MILLION, $301.5 MILLION AND $57.3 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, WITH CASH ON HAND AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CASH ON HAND AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $5.3 MILLION IN ACCOUNTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY ALSO PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  DEFAULT FOR THREE (3) BUSINESS DAYS IN THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY WHEN DUE;  \u2022  DEFAULT IN PAYMENT WHEN DUE OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  FAILURE BY US OR ANY SUBSIDIARY TO COMPLY WITH THE NEGATIVE COVENANTS AND CERTAIN OTHER COVENANTS RELATING TO MAINTAINING THE LEGAL EXISTENCE OF THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES AND COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS;  \u2022  FAILURE BY US OR ANY SUBSIDIARY TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE OTHER AGREEMENTS IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND RELATED LOAN DOCUMENTS THAT CONTINUES FOR THIRTY (30) DAYS (OR TEN (10) DAYS IN THE CASE OF FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVENANTS RELATED TO INSPECTION RIGHTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND LENDERS AND PERMITTED USES OF PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY) AFTER OUR OFFICERS FIRST BECOME AWARE OF SUCH FAILURE OR FIRST RECEIVE WRITTEN NOTICE OF SUCH FAILURE FROM ANY LENDER;  \u2022  DEFAULT IN THE PAYMENT OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS IF THE AMOUNT OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS AGGREGATES TO $15.0 MILLION OR MORE, OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF ANY AGREEMENTS RELATED TO SUCH INDEBTEDNESS IF THE HOLDER OR HOLDERS OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS CAN CAUSE SUCH INDEBTEDNESS TO BE DECLARED DUE AND PAYABLE;  \u2022  CERTAIN EVENTS OF BANKRUPTCY OR INSOLVENCY WITH RESPECT TO US OR ANY SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARY;  \u2022  FINAL JUDGMENT IS ENTERED AGAINST US OR ANY RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OVER $15.0 MILLION, AND EITHER ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS ARE COMMENCED BY ANY CREDITOR OR THERE IS A PERIOD OF 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS DURING WHICH THE JUDGMENT REMAINS UNPAID AND NO STAY IS IN EFFECT;  \u2022  ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OF ANY AGREEMENT OR INSTRUMENT GOVERNING THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY CEASES TO BE IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT; AND  \u2022  ANY REVOCATION, TERMINATION, SUBSTANTIAL AND ADVERSE MODIFICATION, OR REFUSAL BY FINAL ORDER TO RENEW, ANY MEDIA LICENSE, OR THE REQUIREMENT (BY FINAL NON-APPEALABLE ORDER) TO SELL A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION, WHERE ANY SUCH EVENT OR FAILURE IS REASONABLY EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT.  64  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ENTERING INTO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE AND OUR RESTRICTED SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ENTERED INTO A SECURITY AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE AND THE CREDIT PARTIES EACH GRANTED A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL SECURING THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LENDERS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY.  ADDITIONALLY, THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A DEFINITION OF \u201cCONSOLIDATED EBITDA\u201d THAT EXCLUDES REVENUE RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM AND RELATED EXPENSES, AS COMPARED TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d UNDER THE 2013 CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH INCLUDED SUCH ITEMS. AS REPORTED BY US PREVIOUSLY, INCLUDING IN OUR QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FILED WITH THE SEC ON NOVEMBER 9, 2017, WE RECOGNIZED REVENUE OF $263.9 MILLION RELATED TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM (THE \u201cSPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE\u201d) DURING OUR THIRD QUARTER OF 2017. HOWEVER, AS REPORTED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AND AS ANTICIPATED IN FUTURE INVESTOR COMMUNICATIONS, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE \u201cCONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA\u201d EXCLUDES THE SPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE AND RELATED EXPENSES IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH IT MAY RELATE, CONSISTENT WITH THE DEFINITION IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES. THE SPECTRUM AUCTION REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017 WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT TOTALING $263.9 MILLION, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THERE WILL BE ANOTHER TRANSACTION OF A SIMILAR NATURE TO THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM OR ANOTHER TRANSACTION THAT GENERATES NET REVENUE FROM THE MONETIZATION OF SPECTRUM ASSETS IN SIMILARLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE MADE A PREPAYMENT OF $50.0 MILLION TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN B FACILITY.  ON APRIL 30, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT AND LIMITED WAIVER (THE \u201cAMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON MAY 1, 2019. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENT, THE LENDERS WAIVED ANY EVENTS OF DEFAULT THAT MAY HAVE ARISEN UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH OUR FAILURE TO TIMELY DELIVER OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION OF THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d), AND AMENDED THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, GIVING US UNTIL MAY 31, 2019 TO DELIVER THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FAILURE BY US TO DELIVER THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON OR PRIOR TO MAY 31, 2019 WOULD CONSTITUTE AN IMMEDIATE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. BY FILING THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K PRIOR TO THAT DATE, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE COMPLIED WITH THE AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED BY THE AMENDMENT, REGARDING DELIVERY OF THE 2018 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENT, WE AGREED TO PAY TO THE LENDERS CONSENTING TO THE AMENDMENT A FEE EQUAL TO 0.10% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS HELD BY SUCH LENDERS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF MAY 1, 2019. THIS FEE TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON JULY 13, 2017, OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO $15.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  ON APRIL 11, 2018, OUR  BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $15.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CLASS A COMMON STOCK, FOR A TOTAL REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION OF UP TO $30.0 MILLION. UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE SHARES FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR NEGOTIATED PURCHASES, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS  . THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE REPURCHASED TO DATE A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 4.5 MILLION SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $4.23 SINCE THE BEGINNING OF SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $19.1 MILLION. ALL REPURCHASED SHARES WERE RETIRED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA (AS DEFINED BELOW) INCREASED TO $54.0 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FROM $50.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, AN INCREASE OF $3.4 MILLION, OR 7%. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA INCREASED TO 18% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FROM 9% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, MEANS NET INCOME (LOSS) PLUS GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OPERATING AND CORPORATE EXPENSES, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS. WE USE THE TERM CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA BECAUSE THAT MEASURE IS DEFINED IN OUR 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND DOES NOT INCLUDE GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT  65  EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION AND DOES INCLUDE SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS.  SINCE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A MEASURE GOVERNING SEVERAL CRITICAL ASPECTS OF OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO DISCLOSE CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO OUR INVESTORS.  WE MAY INCREASE THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING BY AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT EQUAL TO $100.0 MILLION PLUS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD RESULT IN OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO, OR THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL SENIOR DEBT (NET OF UP TO $75.0 MILLION OF UNRESTRICTED CASH) TO TRAILING-TWELVE-MONTH CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, NOT EXCEEDING 4.0. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2018, AT THE END OF EVERY CALENDAR YEAR, IN THE EVENT OUR TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO IS WITHIN CERTAIN RANGES, WE MUST MAKE A DEBT PREPAYMENT EQUAL TO A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OUR EXCESS CASH FLOW, WHICH IS DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, LESS CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE, LESS DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, LESS TAXES PAID, LESS OTHER AMOUNTS SET FORTH IN THE DEFINITION OF EXCESS CASH FLOW IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN EACH CASE AS OF DECEMBER 31): 2018, 3.2 TO 1; 2017, 4.4 TO 1.  WHILE MANY IN THE FINANCIAL COMMUNITY AND WE CONSIDER CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO BE IMPORTANT, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, BUT NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, OTHER MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SUCH AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME.  AS CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES NON-CASH GAIN (LOSS) ON SALE OF ASSETS, NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER INCOME (LOSS), GAIN (LOSS) ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT, INCOME TAX (EXPENSE) BENEFIT, EQUITY IN NET INCOME (LOSS) OF NONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATE, NON-CASH LOSSES, SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING AMORTIZATION LESS SYNDICATION PROGRAMMING PAYMENTS, REVENUE FROM FCC SPECTRUM INCENTIVE AUCTION LESS RELATED EXPENSES, EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTMENTS, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND CERTAIN PRO-FORMA COST SAVINGS, CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES AND INCLUDES SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LINE ITEMS.   THEREFORE, WE CONSIDER BOTH NON-GAAP AND GAAP MEASURES WHEN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO USED TO MAKE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS.  CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. FOR A RECONCILIATION OF CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, PLEASE SEE PAGE 56.  CASH FLOW  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $33.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $301.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. WE HAD NET INCOME OF $12.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WHICH  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $4.6 MILLION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $16.3 MILLION, AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION  . WE HAD NET INCOME OF $175.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WHICH  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $81.8 MILLION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $16.4 MILLION, AND NON-CASH COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS OF $12.3 MILLION  . WE EXPECT TO HAVE POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 2019 YEAR.  NET CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $159.5 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $76.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE SPENT $159.4 MILLION ON PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, $3.2 MILLION ON THE PURCHASE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, $3.5 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES, AND $17.0 MILLION ON NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE SPENT $32.6 MILLION ON THE PURCHASE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, $29.1 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES, AND $12.1 MILLION ON NET CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $20.3 MILLION DURING THE FULL YEAR 2019. OF THIS AMOUNT, WE EXPECT THAT APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION WILL BE EXPENDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE REQUIRED RELOCATION OF CERTAIN OF OUR TELEVISION STATIONS TO A DIFFERENT CHANNEL AS PART OF THE BROADCAST TELEVISION REPACK FOLLOWING THE FCC AUCTION FOR BROADCAST SPECTRUM, WHICH AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO BE REIMBURSED TO US BY THE FCC. THE AMOUNT OF OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MAY CHANGE BASED ON FUTURE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PLANS AND, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE EXPECT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WITH CASH ON HAND AND NET CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS.  NET CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $88.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, COMPARED TO NET CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $24.8 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE MADE DEBT PAYMENTS OF $53.0 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $17.8 MILLION, AND PAID $13.8 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF STOCK. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE MADE DEBT PAYMENTS OF $293.6 MILLION, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $14.7 MILLION, PAID $5.3 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF STOCK, AND RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $298.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2017 CREDIT FACILITY.  66  COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR MATERIAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  TOTAL AMOUNTS COMMITTED  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  MORE THAN  5 YEARS  LONG TERM DEBT AND RELATED INTEREST (1)  $321,356  $15,911  $31,350  $30,721  $243,374  MEDIA RESEARCH AND RATINGS PROVIDERS (2)  11,588  10,378  760  360  90  OPERATING LEASES (3)  81,828  10,432  19,184  13,697  38,515  OTHER MATERIAL NON-CANCELABLE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS (4)  9,719  2,105  4,353  3,261  \u2014  TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  $424,491  $38,826  $55,647  $48,039  $281,979  (1)  THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS AND MANDATORY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR 2017 CREDIT FACILITY. FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM AMOUNTS INDICATED IN THE TABLE DUE TO FUTURE OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING NEEDS, MARKET FACTORS AND OTHER CURRENTLY UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  (2)  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN MEDIA RESEARCH AND RATINGS PROVIDERS, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH JUNE 2024, TO PROVIDE TELEVISION AND RADIO AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT SERVICES.  (3)  WE LEASE FACILITIES AND BROADCAST EQUIPMENT UNDER VARIOUS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH VARIOUS TERMS AND CONDITIONS, EXPIRING AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH DECEMBER 2059. THESE AMOUNTS DO NOT INCLUDE MONTH-TO-MONTH LEASES.  (4)  THESE AMOUNTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OBLIGATIONS FOR SALES SOFTWARE LICENSES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THEREFORE, $0.5 MILLION OF LIABILITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE.  WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING WALTER F. ULLOA, JEFFERY A. LIBERMAN AND CHRISTOPHER T. YOUNG. OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  OTHER THAN LEASE COMMITMENTS, LEGAL CONTINGENCIES INCURRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS FOR KEY EMPLOYEES, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR LIABILITIES. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OR ANY INTERESTS IN OR RELATIONSHIPS WITH ANY VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE ACCURATE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT AND MAY PRODUCE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED OUR RELATED DISCLOSURE IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GOODWILL  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND OUR ESTIMATES OF THE USEFUL LIVES OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d BECAUSE: (1) GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSETS, AND (2) THE IMPACT THAT RECOGNIZING AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD HAVE ON THE ASSETS REPORTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, AS WELL AS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, COULD BE MATERIAL. ACCORDINGLY, THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE ASSETS UNDER EVALUATION ARE CRITICAL  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE TEST OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON THE FIRST DAY OF OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CERTAIN EVENTS OR CERTAIN CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE MUST MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT SUCH THINGS AS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.  IN TESTING THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS FOR IMPAIRMENT, WE FIRST DETERMINE, BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS LESS THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS.  WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS IS A REPORTING UNIT.  67  IF IT IS DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE BASED ON THIS INITIAL ASSESSMENT, THE NEXT STEP IS A QUANTITATIVE COMPARISON OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THAT REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING VALUE, NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL EXISTS AND THE TESTING IS COMPLETE. IF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT IS GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD $40.5 MILLION OF GOODWILL IN OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT. WE DID NOT REACH A DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ALONE SO WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST AND COMPARED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 48%, RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE.  IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 6%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD $33.7 MILLION OF GOODWILL IN OUR DIGITAL MEDIA REPORTING UNIT. WE DID NOT REACH A DEFINITIVE CONCLUSION ON THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT BASED ON A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ALONE SO WE PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE TEST AND COMPARED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 5%, RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE.  IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 5%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  AS OF OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL TESTING DATE, OCTOBER 1, 2018, WE HAD NO GOODWILL IN OUR RADIO REPORTING UNIT.  WHEN A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE MARKET APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BY APPLYING SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW MULTIPLES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE MULTIPLES ARE DERIVED FROM COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES WITH SIMILAR OPERATING AND INVESTMENT CHARACTERISTICS TO OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE MARKET APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS SELECTING COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE LED TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS, WHICH MAKES THE MARKET APPROACH OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS MORE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK OF THAT REPORTING UNIT. THE INCOME APPROACH ALSO REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATED OUR DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FISCAL POLICY AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES, TRANSACTION PREMIUMS AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS. SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHERMORE, SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IN GENERAL OR THE INDUSTRIES OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADVERTISE ON OUR STATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE AUTOMOTIVE, FINANCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL AND RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED ADVERTISING REVENUE. THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS OTHER BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR OUR AUDIENCE PREFERENCES, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING-BASED MEDIUMS, SUCH AS INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND BROADBAND CONTENT PROVIDERS SERVING THE SAME MARKETS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. FINALLY, THE RISK FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SEC REPORTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS.  68  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF OUR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE OR OF OUR UNITS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, IF MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE AND AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR IF THERE ARE LOWER COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF ANY SUCH FUTURE CHANGE IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION MODELS AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT, OR IF IT DOES, WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE MATERIAL.  INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROADCAST LICENSES ARE INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IS DETERMINED TO HAVE AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE WHEN THERE ARE NO LEGAL, REGULATORY, CONTRACTUAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR ANY OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY LIMIT THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE ASSET IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE EVALUATION OF IMPAIRMENT FOR INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS PERFORMED BY A COMPARISON OF THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING VALUE TO THE ASSET\u2019S FAIR VALUE. WHEN THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE DIFFERENCE. THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING USED TO TEST BROADCAST LICENSES REPRESENTS ALL LICENSES OWNED AND OPERATED WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL MARKET CLUSTER, BECAUSE SUCH LICENSES ARE USED TOGETHER, ARE COMPLIMENTARY TO EACH OTHER AND ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BEST USE OF THOSE ASSETS. OUR INDIVIDUAL MARKET CLUSTERS CONSIST OF CITIES OR NEARBY CITIES. WE TEST OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THESE MARKET CLUSTERS.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. ALTERNATIVELY, SOME STATIONS UNDER EVALUATION HAVE HAD LIMITED RELEVANT CASH FLOW HISTORY DUE TO PLANNED OR ACTUAL CONVERSION OF FORMAT OR UPGRADE OF STATION SIGNAL. THE ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE ABOUT CASH FLOWS AFTER CONVERSION ARE BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SIMILAR STATIONS IN SIMILAR MARKETS AND POTENTIAL PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 3% TO OVER 1,000%. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 0% TO OVER 450%. THREE MARKETS WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $15.2 MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN 10%.  UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FISCAL POLICY AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL POTENTIALLY COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES, TRANSACTION PREMIUMS AND COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS. SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. FURTHERMORE, SUCH UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY IN GENERAL OR THE INDUSTRIES OF THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADVERTISE ON OUR STATIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, THE AUTOMOTIVE, FINANCIAL AND OTHER SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, TRAVEL AND RESTAURANT INDUSTRIES, WHICH IN THE AGGREGATE PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED ADVERTISING REVENUE. THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR COMPETITORS, SUCH AS OTHER BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY OR OUR AUDIENCE PREFERENCES, INCLUDING INCREASED COMPETITION FROM OTHER FORMS OF ADVERTISING-BASED MEDIUMS, SUCH AS INTERNET, SOCIAL MEDIA AND BROADBAND CONTENT PROVIDERS SERVING THE SAME MARKETS, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS. FINALLY, THE RISK FACTORS THAT WE IDENTIFY FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR SEC REPORTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS ABOUT FUTURE PERFORMANCE, TERMINAL VALUE ESTIMATES AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING INTERNAL FORECASTS OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AS A WHOLE OR OF OUR UNITS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, IF MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE AND AFFECT THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR IF THERE ARE LOWER COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS AND TRANSACTION PREMIUMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE IF ANY SUCH FUTURE CHANGE IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION MODELS AND RESULT IN IMPAIRMENT, OR IF IT DOES, WHETHER SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE MATERIAL.  69  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLES SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS PROVIDED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES. CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE PASSAGE OF NEW LAWS OR CHANGES IN REGULATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL OR CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRATEGY COULD RESULT IN THE ACTUAL USEFUL LIVES DIFFERING FROM INITIAL ESTIMATES. IN THOSE CASES WHERE WE DETERMINE THAT THE USEFUL LIFE OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET SHOULD BE REVISED, WE WILL DEPRECIATE THE NET BOOK VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OVER ITS REVISED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE. FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE PLANNED USE OF EQUIPMENT, CUSTOMER ATTRITION, CONTRACTUAL AMENDMENTS OR MANDATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN SHORTENED USEFUL LIVES.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ASSET GROUPS ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND MAY DIFFER FROM ACTUAL CASH FLOWS. LONG-LIVED ASSETS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT ARE GROUPED WITH OTHER ASSETS TO THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER GROUPS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. IF THE SUM OF THE PROJECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS (EXCLUDING INTEREST) IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, THE ASSETS WILL BE WRITTEN DOWN TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DETERMINATION IS MADE.  DEFERRED TAXES  DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED ON A LIABILITY METHOD WHEREBY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND DEFERRED LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES. TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS DETERMINED TO BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES ON THE DATE OF ENACTMENT.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER ALL REASONABLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE INCLUDING OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, TAX STRATEGIES AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. IN CONSIDERING THESE FACTORS, WE MAKE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES USED TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. WE RECOGNIZE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  TELEVISION AND RADIO REVENUE RELATED TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF BROADCAST. REVENUE FOR CONTRACTS WITH ADVERTISING AGENCIES IS RECORDED AT AN AMOUNT THAT IS NET OF THE COMMISSION RETAINED BY THE AGENCY. REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS DIRECTLY WITH THE ADVERTISERS IS RECORDED AS GROSS REVENUE AND THE RELATED COMMISSION OR NATIONAL REPRESENTATION FEE IS RECORDED IN OPERATING EXPENSE. CASH PAYMENTS RECEIVED PRIOR TO SERVICES RENDERED RESULT IN DEFERRED REVENUE, WHICH IS THEN RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE ADVERTISING TIME OR SPACE IS ACTUALLY PROVIDED. DIGITAL RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN DISPLAY OR OTHER DIGITAL ADVERTISEMENTS RECORD IMPRESSIONS ON THE WEBSITES OF OUR THIRD PARTY PUBLISHERS OR AS THE ADVERTISER\u2019S PREVIOUSLY AGREED-UPON PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE SATISFIED.  WE GENERATE REVENUE UNDER ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH SERVICES ARE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS WITHIN A SPECIFIC SEGMENT, AND THOSE THAT ARE SOLD ON A COMBINED BASIS ACROSS MULTIPLE SEGMENTS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT IN SUCH  REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH CONTAIN MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, REVENUES ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ITEM AND RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR THE SPECIFIC UNIT OF ACCOUNTING.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AGREEMENTS THAT ARE ENTERED INTO WITH MVPDS. WE REFER TO SUCH REVENUE AS RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE, WHICH REPRESENTS PAYMENTS FROM MVPDS FOR ACCESS TO OUR TELEVISION STATION SIGNALS SO THAT THEY MAY REBROADCAST OUR SIGNALS AND CHARGE THEIR SUBSCRIBERS FOR THIS PROGRAMMING. WE RECOGNIZE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT REVENUE EARNED AS THE TELEVISION SIGNAL IS DELIVERED TO THE MVPD.  WE ALSO GENERATE REVENUE FROM AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TELEVISION STATIONS\u2019 SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO UTILIZE EXCESS SPECTRUM FOR THE BROADCAST OF THEIR MULTICAST NETWORKS, CHARGING FEES TO ACCOMMODATE THE OPERATIONS OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING MOVING CHANNEL POSITIONS OR ACCEPTING INTERFERENCE WITH BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, AND MODIFYING AND/OR RELINQUISHING SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS WHILE CONTINUING TO BROADCAST THROUGH CHANNEL SHARING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS.  REVENUE FROM SUCH AGREEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE LEASE OR WHEN WE HAVE RELINQUISHED ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR SPECTRUM USAGE RIGHTS FOR A STATION OR HAVE RELINQUISHED OUR RIGHTS TO OPERATE A STATION ON THE EXISTING CHANNEL FREE FROM INTERFERENCE.  70  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CONSIST OF A HOMOGENEOUS POOL OF RELATIVELY SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS FROM A LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. WE EVALUATE THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. WHEN WE ARE AWARE OF A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER\u2019S INABILITY TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO US, A SPECIFIC RESERVE FOR BAD DEBTS IS ESTIMATED AND RECORDED WHICH REDUCES THE RECOGNIZED RECEIVABLE TO THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE BELIEVE WILL ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED. IN ADDITION TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMER IDENTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL BAD DEBTS, BAD DEBT CHARGES ARE RECORDED BASED ON OUR RECENT PAST LOSS HISTORY AND AN OVERALL ASSESSMENT OF PAST DUE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  PRIOR TO NOVEMBER 28, 2017, WE USED DERIVATIVES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTEREST RATE RISK WITH RESPECT TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT. WE WERE PARTY TO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT FIXED THE VARIABLE BENCHMARK COMPONENT (LIBOR) OF OUR INTEREST RATE ON A PORTION OF OUR TERM LOAN BEGINNING DECEMBER 31, 2015. ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017, WE TERMINATED THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REFINANCING OF OUR DEBT. OUR CURRENT POLICY PROHIBITS ENTERING INTO DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR SPECULATION OR TRADING PURPOSES.  WE RECOGNIZE ALL OF OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DEPENDS ON WHETHER IT HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIES AS PART OF A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP, AND FURTHER, ON THE TYPE OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFIED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE; THEREFORE, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WAS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ANY INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WOULD BE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED DIRECTLY TO INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF NON-PERFORMANCE RISK, WHEN MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT WAS DETERMINED BY USING MULTIPLE BROKER QUOTES, ADJUSTED FOR NON-PERFORMANCE RISK, WHEN MATERIAL, WHICH ESTIMATE THE FUTURE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF ANY FUTURE PAYMENTS THAT MAY BE MADE UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS. UPON TERMINATION OF THE SWAP AGREEMENTS, $2.5 MILLION IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PLEASE SEE NOTE 2 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND U.S. TAX REFORM  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842),  WHICH IS INTENDED TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS RELATING TO LEASES. LESSEES WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS AND A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING THE RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM. THE FASB RETAINED A DUAL MODEL FOR LEASE CLASSIFICATION, REQUIRING LEASES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES TO DETERMINE RECOGNITION IN THE EARNINGS STATEMENT AND CASH FLOWS; HOWEVER, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL LEASES WILL BE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. ASU 2016-02 WILL ALSO REQUIRE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. ASU 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THIS STANDARD ALLOWS ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. THE STANDARD ALSO PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED AN ENTERPRISE-WIDE LEASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM TO SUPPORT THE NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AND IS EVALUATING ITS PROCESSES AND INTERNAL CONTROLS TO ENSURE THE COMPANY MEETS THE STANDARD\u2019S REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU ON JANUARY 1, 2019, USING THE OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD AND ALSO ELECTED TO USE THE 'PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS', WHICH ALLOWS US NOT TO CONTINUE TO REASSESS OUR PREVIOUS CONCLUSIONS ABOUT LEASE IDENTIFICATION, LEASE CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES A MATERIAL INCREASE IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE REQUIRED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND CORRESPONDING LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES SUCH AS LEASES ON BROADCAST TOWER SITES AND REAL ESTATE LEASES FOR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, AS WELL AS THE SIGNIFICANT NEW QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE RIGHT OF USE ASSET WILL BE THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS AS NOTED IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT METHODOLOGY.  71  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15,  INTANGIBLES-GOODWILL AND OTHER-INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40): CUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT  . THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ALIGN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITALIZING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A HOSTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITALIZING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED TO DEVELOP OR OBTAIN INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (AND HOSTING ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE AN INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSE). THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE SERVICE ELEMENT OF A HOSTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT IS NOT AFFECTED BY THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR  ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2021. E  ARLY ADOPTION  IS  PERMITTED. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE SHOULD BE APPLIED EITHER RETROSPECTIVELY OR PROSPECTIVELY TO ALL IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED AFTER THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  , WHICH SUPERSEDES SUBTOPIC 505-50, EQUITY\u2014EQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES AND EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ASC TOPIC 718, \u201cCOMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d (\u201cTOPIC 718\u201d) TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS ISSUED TO NONEMPLOYEES FOR GOODS AND SERVICES. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO CLARIFY THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE FINANCING TO THE ISSUER OR AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER ASC TOPIC 606, \u201cREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\u201d (\u201cTOPIC 606\u201d). THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THAT FISCAL YEAR. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, BUT NO EARLIER THAN A COMPANY\u2019S ADOPTION DATE OF TOPIC 606. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT\u2014REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  . ASU 2018-02 ALLOWS A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE 2017 TAX ACT AND ALSO REQUIRES ENTITIES TO DISCLOSE THEIR ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR RELEASING INCOME TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THIS GUIDANCE SHOULD BE APPLIED EITHER IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION OR RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS OF THE CHANGE IN THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE IN THE 2017 TAX ACT IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN OCTOBER 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-16,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFERS OF ASSETS OTHER THAN INVENTORY  WHICH ALLOWS ENTITIES TO RECOGNIZE THE INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES ON AN INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF AN ASSET OTHER THAN INVENTORY WHEN THE TRANSFER OCCURS. CURRENT GAAP PROHIBITS THE RECOGNITION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES FOR AN INTRA-ENTITY ASSET TRANSFER UNTIL THE ASSET HAS BEEN SOLD TO AN OUTSIDE PARTY.  IN ADDITION, THERE HAS BEEN DIVERSITY IN THE APPLICATION OF THE CURRENT GUIDANCE FOR TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN INTANGIBLE AND TANGIBLE ASSETS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE COMPLEXITY IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. ASU 2016-16 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN AN INTERIM PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THE ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326),  WHICH  AMENDS CURRENT GUIDANCE ON OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES. THIS AMENDED STANDARD REQUIRES THE USE OF AN ALLOWANCE TO RECORD ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON THESE ASSETS WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS BELOW THE AMORTIZED COST OF THE ASSET. THIS STANDARD ALSO REMOVES THE EVALUATION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT A SECURITY HAS BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION TO AVOID RECORDING A CREDIT LOSS. THE UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN MAY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): SCOPE OF MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING  , TO CLARIFY AND REDUCE BOTH (I) DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE AND (II) COST AND COMPLEXITY WHEN APPLYING THE GUIDANCE IN TOPIC 718, TO CHANGE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARD. SPECIFICALLY, AN ENTITY WOULD NOT APPLY MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING IF THE FAIR VALUE, VESTING CONDITIONS, AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE AWARDS ARE THE SAME IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE MODIFICATION. ASU 2017-09 IS  EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2017-09 ON JANUARY 1, 2018. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-09 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS THE COMPANY HAS NOT HAD ANY MODIFICATIONS TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. HOWEVER, IF THE COMPANY DOES HAVE A MODIFICATION TO AN AWARD IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2017-09.  72  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-01  , BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (TOPIC 805): CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS,  TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST FRAMEWORK TO USE IN DETERMINING WHEN A SET OF ASSETS AND ACTIVITIES IS CONSIDERED A BUSINESS. ASU 2017-01 IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2018.  IN AUGUST 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-15,  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS (TOPIC 230): CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS (A CONSENSUS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE),  WHICH PROVIDES SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON EIGHT CASH FLOW CLASSIFICATION ISSUES ARISING FROM CERTAIN CASH RECEIPTS AND CASH PAYMENTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2018 AND IS REQUIRED TO APPLY IT ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-01,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 OVERALL (SUBTOPIC 825-10): RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  ,  AND ITS RELATED AMENDMENTS IN FEBRUARY 2018, ASU 2018-03,  TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014OVERALL (SUBTOPIC 825-10): RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  . ASU 2016-01  REQUIRES ENTITIES TO CARRY ALL INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS SUCH AS PARTNERSHIPS, UNINCORPORATED JOINT VENTURES, AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES, AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED WITHIN NET INCOME. THIS ASU DOES NOT APPLY TO EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INVESTMENTS THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE INVESTEE OR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN INVESTMENT COMPANIES. FOR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE, AN ENTITY IS PERMITTED TO ELECT A PRACTICABILITY EXCEPTION, UNDER WHICH THE INVESTMENT WILL BE MEASURED AT COST, LESS IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES FROM ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS OF AN IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. ADDITIONALLY THIS ASU ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT TO ASSESS WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR EQUITY INVESTMENTS SUBJECT TO THIS ELECTION IS NOW A SINGLE-STEP MODEL WHEREBY AN ENTITY PERFORMS A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRMENT. IF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATES THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, THE ENTITY WOULD ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT AND RECOGNIZE IN NET INCOME AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE EQUITY INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY\u2019S EQUITY INVESTMENTS FORMERLY CLASSIFIED AS COST METHOD INVESTMENTS ARE MEASURED AND RECORDED USING THE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED THE PRACTICABILITY EXCEPTION WHEREBY THESE INVESTMENTS ARE MEASURED AT COST, LESS IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES FROM ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS OF IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS OF THE SAME ISSUE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THESE STANDARDS PROSPECTIVELY ON JANUARY 1, 2018, AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION IN RELATION TO ONE OF ITS EQUITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606),  WHICH AMENDED THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. ASU 2014-09 ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE UPON THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STANDARDS RELATED TO ASU 2014-09: ASU 2016-08,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): PRINCIPAL VERSUS AGENT CONSIDERATIONS  ; ASU 2016-10,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): IDENTIFYING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND LICENSING  ; ASU 2016-12,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606): NARROW-SCOPE IMPROVEMENTS AND PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS  ; AND ASU 2016-20,  TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  ON JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC TOPIC 606 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD APPLIED TO THOSE CONTRACTS WHICH WERE NOT COMPLETED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018. RESULTS FOR REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2018 ARE PRESENTED UNDER TOPIC 606, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 605, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION\u201d.  OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018 WERE NOT AFFECTED AS THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF ADOPTING TOPIC 606.  U.S. TAX REFORM  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION CALLED THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d). THE TAX ACT MAKES BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE THAT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% THAT AFFECTS THE CURRENT VALUE OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (\u201cDTAS\u201d) AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES (\u201cDTLS\u201d), A TRANSITION TAX ON UNREPATRIATED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, AND BONUS DEPRECIATION ON QUALIFIED PROPERTY. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (1) A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%; (2) A GENERAL ELIMINATION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES ON DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES; (3) A NEW PROVISION DESIGNED TO TAX GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d); (4) LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION; (5) LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF FEDERAL TAX CREDIT (\u201cFTC\u2019S\u201d) TO REDUCE THE U.S. INCOME TAX LIABILITY; (6) POTENTIAL LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF INTEREST EXPENSE; AND (7) BONUS DEPRECIATION ON QUALIFIED PROPERTY.  73  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INITIAL ANALYSIS OF THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, WE RECORDED A ONE-TIME NET TAX BENEFIT OF $17.3 MILLION FOR THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017. THIS NET TAX BENEFIT PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF THE NET TAX IMPACT TO OUR DEFERRED TAXES FROM THE  U.S. FEDERAL  CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION.  THERE WAS NO MATERIAL CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE IN 2018. SEE NOTE 13 TO  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SENSITIVITY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  WE HAVE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THOSE SENSITIVE ESTIMATES RELATES TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD ARE TESTED ANNUALLY ON OCTOBER 1 FOR IMPAIRMENT, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE MUST MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ASSETS.  TELEVISION  IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES, WE USED MODELS THAT RELY ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES AND MULTIPLES. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSUME THAT THE TELEVISION SEGMENT REVENUES WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THE INCREASE IN THE TELEVISION EXPENSES, AND THEREFORE THE TELEVISION ASSETS WILL ALSO INCREASE IN VALUE. IF ANY OF THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES, MULTIPLES OR ASSUMPTIONS WERE TO CHANGE IN ANY FUTURE VALUATION, IT COULD AFFECT OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CAUSE US TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF OUR TELEVISION INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE DID NOT RECORD IMPAIRMENT IN 2018 AS THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR TELEVISION FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS WAS GREATER THAN THEIR RESPECTIVE CARRYING VALUES. THE FAIR VALUES EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 3% TO OVER 1,000%. ONE MARKET WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN 10%.  WE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL REVIEW OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT AS PART OF OUR GOODWILL TESTING AND DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS IN THE MODELS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS AND PROJECTED TRENDS IN THE TELEVISION INDUSTRY AND HISPANIC MARKET. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE TELEVISION REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 48%,  RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WAS INCREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR AND EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF A COMPONENT OF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE DECREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR TO ACCOUNT FOR RISK WITHIN THE FORECASTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 6%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE  TELEVISION  REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  RADIO  IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES, WE USED MODELS THAT RELY ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES AND MULTIPLES. THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSUME THAT THE RADIO SEGMENT REVENUES WILL INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN THE INCREASE IN THE RADIO EXPENSES, AND THEREFORE THE RADIO ASSETS WILL ALSO INCREASE IN VALUE. IF ANY OF THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, DISCOUNT RATES, MULTIPLES OR ASSUMPTIONS WERE TO CHANGE IN ANY FUTURE VALUATION, IT COULD AFFECT OUR IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CAUSE US TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE FOR IMPAIRMENT.  74  WE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF OUR RADIO INDEFINITE LIFE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY USING AN INCOME APPROACH. THE INCOME APPROACH ESTIMATES FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH MARKET CLUSTER THAT A HYPOTHETICAL BUYER WOULD EXPECT TO GENERATE, DISCOUNTED BY AN ESTIMATED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT REFLECTS CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, WHICH REFLECT THE OVERALL LEVEL OF INHERENT RISK. THE INCOME APPROACH REQUIRES US TO MAKE A SERIES OF ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS DISCOUNT RATES, REVENUE PROJECTIONS, PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS AND TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLES. WE ESTIMATE THE DISCOUNT RATES ON A BLENDED RATE OF RETURN CONSIDERING BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY FOR COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. THESE COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES HAVE SIMILAR SIZE, OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR FINANCIAL PROFILES TO US. WE ALSO ESTIMATED THE TERMINAL VALUE MULTIPLE BASED ON COMPARABLE PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANIES IN THE TELEVISION, RADIO AND DIGITAL MEDIA INDUSTRIES. WE ESTIMATED THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS BASED ON VARIOUS MARKET CLUSTERS SIGNAL COVERAGE OF THE MARKETS AND INDUSTRY INFORMATION FOR AN AVERAGE STATION WITHIN A GIVEN MARKET. THE INFORMATION FOR EACH MARKET CLUSTER INCLUDES SUCH THINGS AS ESTIMATED MARKET SHARE, ESTIMATED CAPITAL START-UP COSTS, POPULATION, HOUSEHOLD INCOME, RETAIL SALES AND OTHER EXPENDITURES THAT WOULD INFLUENCE ADVERTISING EXPENDITURES. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR RADIO FCC LICENSES FOR EACH OF OUR MARKET CLUSTERS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUES IN AMOUNTS RANGING FROM  0% TO OVER 450%.  TWO MARKETS WITH AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.2  MILLION HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEED CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN  10%.  WE DID  NOT HAVE ANY GOODWILL IN OUR RADIO REPORTING UNIT AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  DIGITAL MEDIA  WE CONDUCTED OUR ANNUAL REVIEW OF OUR DIGITAL MEDIA REPORTING UNIT AS PART OF OUR GOODWILL TESTING AND DETERMINED THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY USING A COMBINATION OF A MARKET APPROACH AND AN INCOME APPROACH. THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS AND PROFIT MARGIN PROJECTIONS IN THE MODELS ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS AND PROJECTED TRENDS IN THE DIGITAL INDUSTRY AND HISPANIC MARKET. BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY 5%,  RESULTING IN NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CALCULATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE USED IN THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WAS INCREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR AND EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF A COMPONENT OF THE REPORTING UNIT WERE DECREASED FROM PRIOR YEAR TO ACCOUNT FOR RISK WITHIN THE FORECASTS OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THAT DISCOUNT RATE WERE TO INCREASE BY 1%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 5%.  IF THE LONG TERM PROJECTED GROWTH RATE WERE TO DECREASE BY 0.5%, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DIGITAL REPORTING UNIT WOULD DECREASE BY 1%.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE  BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR EACH OF OUR FISCAL YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . HOWEVER, BASED ON RECENT INFLATION TRENDS, THE ECONOMY IN ARGENTINA HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY. AS A RESULT, WE APPLIED THE GUIDANCE IN ASC 830 BY REMEASURING NON-MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES AND MONETARY-ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING CURRENT EXCHANGE RATES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT FUTURE INFLATION WOULD NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "ENTRAVISION COMMUNICATIONS CORP", "CIK": 1109116, "Date": "2019-05-07T00:00:00", "Ticker": "EVC", "Name": "Entravision Communications Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 4833.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 954783236.0, "key": "20190507EVC", "labelr1": -4.385964912280699, "labelr2": -3.975535168195715, "labelr3": -0.9554140127388614, "labelr4": -7.073954983922821, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.7532976, "prof1": 0.2467024, "return1&2": 1.0853586565802884, "return1&2&3": 1.0957283252737309, "return1&2&3&4": 1.173239653749686, "return2": 1.039755351681957, "return1": 1.043859649122807, "return3": 1.0095541401273886, "return4": 1.0707395498392285, "4_day_return": -15.49707602339181, "cumulative_return1": 0.08744974027227376, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.001189975856442248, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.084700177747699e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 8.481323651464482e-08, "indexx": 2348, "cumreturn1b": 1.056436271401395, "cumreturndow": 0.9819094314606368, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9821793695158676}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2350, "level_0": 2374, "index": 1178, "text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS  REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE  A MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE  MEDICAL DEVICES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE HEALTHCARE. OUR  PRIMARY FOCUS IS THE SALES AND MARKETING OF OUR LUVIVA\u00ae  ADVANCED CERVICAL SCAN NON-INVASIVE CERVICAL CANCER DETECTION  DEVICE. THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY OF LUVIVA PRIMARILY RELATES TO  THE USE OF BIOPHOTONICS FOR THE NON-INVASIVE DETECTION OF CANCERS.  LUVIVA IS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY CERVICAL CANCERS AND PRECANCERS  PAINLESSLY, NON-INVASIVELY AND AT THE POINT OF CARE BY SCANNING THE  CERVIX WITH LIGHT, THEN ANALYZING THE REFLECTED AND FLUORESCENT  LIGHT.  LUVIVA  PROVIDES A LESS INVASIVE AND PAINLESS ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL  TESTS FOR CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING AND DETECTION. ADDITIONALLY,  LUVIVA IMPROVES PATIENT WELL-BEING NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT ELIMINATES  PAIN, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT IS CONVENIENT TO USE AND PROVIDES RAPID  RESULTS AT THE POINT OF CARE. WE FOCUS ON TWO PRIMARY APPLICATIONS  FOR LUVIVA: FIRST, AS A CANCER SCREENING TOOL IN THE DEVELOPING  WORLD, WHERE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT TRADITIONAL CANCER-SCREENING  METHODS IS LIMITED OR NON-EXISTENT, AND SECOND, AS A TRIAGE  FOLLOWING TRADITIONAL SCREENING IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD, WHERE A  HIGH NUMBER OF FALSE POSITIVE RESULTS CAUSE A HIGH RATE OF  UNNECESSARY AND ULTIMATELY COSTLY FOLLOW-UP TESTS.  WE ARE  A DELAWARE CORPORATION, ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN 1992 UNDER THE  NAME \u201cSPECTRX, INC.,\u201d AND, ON FEBRUARY 22, 2008,  CHANGED OUR NAME TO GUIDED THERAPEUTICS, INC. AT THE SAME TIME, WE  RENAMED OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, INTERSCAN, WHICH ORIGINALLY  HAD BEEN INCORPORATED AS \u201cGUIDED  THERAPEUTICS.\u201d  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE SALE OF DEBT AND EQUITY, FUNDING FROM COLLABORATIVE  ARRANGEMENTS, AND GRANTS.  OUR  PROSPECTS MUST BE CONSIDERED IN LIGHT OF THE SUBSTANTIAL RISKS,  EXPENSES AND DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED BY ENTRANTS INTO THE MEDICAL  DEVICE INDUSTRY. THIS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY AN INCREASING  NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS, INTENSE COMPETITION AND A HIGH FAILURE  RATE. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION AND,  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WE HAVE AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  APPROXIMATELY $137.6 MILLION. TO DATE, WE HAVE ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND THE EARLY STAGES OF MARKETING  OUR PRODUCTS. WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN  MANUFACTURING, MARKETING OR SELLING OUR PRODUCTS. WE MAY NOT BE  SUCCESSFUL IN GROWING SALES FOR OUR PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, REQUIRED  REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR APPROVALS MAY NOT BE OBTAINED IN A TIMELY  MANNER, OR AT ALL. OUR PRODUCTS MAY NOT EVER GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE  AND WE MAY NOT EVER GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES OR ACHIEVE  PROFITABILITY. THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR  PRODUCTS REQUIRES SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT, REGULATORY, SALES AND  MARKETING, MANUFACTURING AND OTHER EXPENDITURES. WE EXPECT OUR  OPERATING LOSSES TO CONTINUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS WE  CONTINUE TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO COMPLETE  COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, OBTAIN REGULATORY CLEARANCES OR  APPROVALS, BUILD OUR MARKETING, SALES, MANUFACTURING AND FINANCE  CAPABILITIES, AND CONDUCT FURTHER RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT.  OUR  PRODUCT REVENUES TO DATE HAVE BEEN LIMITED. IN 2018, THE MAJORITY  OF OUR REVENUES WERE FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES AND  DISPOSABLES. WE EXPECT THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IN 2019  WILL BE DERIVED FROM REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES AND  DISPOSABLES.  CURRENT  DEMAND FOR LUVIVA  BASED  ON DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WE EXPECT TO GENERATE  PURCHASE ORDERS FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.5 TO $2.0 MILLION IN LUVIVA  DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES IN 2019 AND EXPECT THOSE PURCHASE ORDERS TO  RESULT IN ACTUAL SALES OF $0.5 TO $1.0 MILLION IN 2019,  REPRESENTING WHAT WE VIEW AS CURRENT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. WE  CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT WE WILL GENERATE ALL OR ANY OF THESE  ADDITIONAL PURCHASE ORDERS, OR THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL NOT BE  CANCELED BY THE DISTRIBUTORS OR THAT PARTS TO BUILD PRODUCT WILL BE  AVAILABLE TO MEET DEMAND, SUCH THAT EXISTING ORDERS WILL RESULT IN  ACTUAL SALES. BECAUSE WE HAVE A SHORT HISTORY OF SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS, WE CANNOT CONFIDENTLY PREDICT FUTURE SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS BEYOND THIS TIME FRAME AND CANNOT BE ASSURED OF ANY  PARTICULAR AMOUNT OF SALES. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY  PARTICULAR TRENDS WITH REGARD TO SALES OF OUR  PRODUCTS.  22  RECENT  DEVELOPMENTS  ON  DECEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A CO-DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH  NEWMARS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\u201cNTI\u201d), WHEREBY NTI WILL  PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE LUVIVA DEVICE FOR ITS CONTRACTED  DISTRIBUTION COUNTRIES IN EASTERN EUROPE AND RUSSIA AT ITS ISO  13485 FACILITY IN HUNGARY.  THE AGREEMENT ENABLES  NEWMARS TO MANUFACTURE LUVIVA\u00ae ADVANCE CERVICAL SCAN DEVICES  IN HUNGARY FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE NINE CENTRAL AND EASTERN  EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR WHICH NEWMARS HAS DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.  GUIDED THERAPEUTICS WILL MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES AND SELL THESE  AND OTHER PARTS TO NEWMARS AND WILL RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL $2,000  ROYALTY FOR EACH DEVICE SOLD IN THOSE COUNTRIES, WHICH INCLUDE  RUSSIA, UKRAINE, POLAND, ROMANIA, HUNGARY, MOLDOVA, KAZAKHSTAN,  BELARUS AND ARMENIA, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS  AND PARTS ORDERS.  THE ADDITIONAL CARVE OUT FOR THESE  TERRITORIES HAS BEEN AGREED TO BY SMI. THE AGREEMENT WITH NEWMARS  DOES NOT ALLOW THEM TO MANUFACTURE SINGLE USE CERVICAL GUIDES,  WHICH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY.  WE RECEIVED REGULATORY APPROVAL FROM THE INDIAN MINISTRY OF HEALTH  & FAMILY WELFARE TO ALLOW COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE LUVIVA  DEVICE AND DISPOSABLES. THE MINISTRY CONCLUDED THAT THE LUVIVA  DEVICE IS \u201cNON INVASIVE\u201d AND AS SUCH IS \u201cNOT  REGULATED UNDER THE DRUGS AND COSMETICS ACT 1940 AND MEDICAL DEVICE  RULES 2017 THEREUNDER.\u201d AS A RESULT, LUVIVA CAN NOW BE  COMMERCIALIZED IN INDIA.  ON  AUGUST 31, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN HOLDERS OF  THE OUR SERIES C1 PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE  \u201cSERIES C1 PREFERRED STOCK\u201d), INCLUDING JOHN IMHOFF,  THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND MARK FAUPEL, THE CHIEF  OPERATING OFFICER AND A DIRECTOR OF OUR COMPANY (THE  \u201cEXCHANGE AGREEMENTS\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THOSE HOLDERS  SEPARATELY AGREED TO EXCHANGE EACH SHARE OF THE SERIES C1 PREFERRED  STOCK HELD FOR ONE (1) SHARE OF OUR NEWLY CREATED SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (THE \u201cSERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK\u201d). IN TOTAL, FOR 3,262 SHARES OF SERIES C1  PREFERRED STOCK TO BE SURRENDERED, WE ISSUED 3,262 SHARES OF SERIES  C2 PREFERRED STOCK.  ON  OCTOBER 19, 2018, WE HELD OUR 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  (THE \u201cANNUAL MEETING\u201d). AS DESCRIBED IN THE OUR  DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14A, AS AMENDED, ORIGINALLY  FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON OCTOBER 11,  2018, AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, STOCKHOLDERS VOTED AND APPROVED THE  FOLLOWING PROPOSALS: (1) THE ELECTION OF THE DIRECTOR-NOMINEES (THE  \u201cDIRECTORS\u201d) OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE  \u201cBOARD\u201d), WITH THE FIVE DIRECTORS RECEIVING THE HIGHEST  NUMBER OF AFFIRMATIVE VOTES CAST BY HOLDERS OF SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK AND HOLDERS OF SERIES C2 PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A SINGLE  CLASS; (2) THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF UHY LLP AS OUR  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM BY A MAJORITY OF THE  VOTES CAST BY THE HOLDERS OF COMMON STOCK AND OF SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A SINGLE CLASS; (3) AN AMENDMENT TO THE  RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE  \u201cCERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION\u201d), TO ENABLE A POTENTIAL  REVERSE SPLIT OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK  AT A RATIO OF BETWEEN 1-FOR-25 AND 1-FOR-800, WITH SUCH RATIO TO BE  DETERMINED AT THE SOLE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD AND WITH SUCH  REVERSE SPLIT TO BE EFFECTED AT SUCH TIME AND DATE ON OR BEFORE  MARCH 31, 2019, IF AT ALL, AS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD IN ITS SOLE  DISCRETION (THE \u201cREVERSE SPLIT AMENDMENT\u201d) BY A  MAJORITY OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND SERIES C2  PREFERRED STOCK VOTING AS A SINGLE CLASS; (4) THE ADOPTION OF AN  AMENDMENT TO THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, TO, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, INCREASE OUR AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK FROM 1,000,000,000  SHARES TO 3,000,000,000 SHARES; AND (5) THE ADOPTION OF OUR 2018  STOCK OPTION PLAN AND THE MATERIAL TERMS THEREUNDER (THE  \u201cPLAN\u201d) BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST BY THE HOLDERS  OF COMMON STOCK AND OF SERIES C2 PREFERRED STOCK, VOTING AS A  SINGLE CLASS.  ON  NOVEMBER 7, 2018, WE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF COMMON STOCK SHARES  AUTHORIZED FROM ONE BILLION TO THREE BILLION.  A 1:800  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF ALL OF OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WAS IMPLEMENTED ON MARCH 29, 2019. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. ALL FRACTIONAL  SHARES CREATED BY THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE ROUNDED TO THE  NEAREST WHOLE SHARE. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK DID NOT CHANGE.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR  MATERIAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST  CRITICAL TO INVESTORS UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND  CONDITION, ARE DISCUSSED BELOW. BECAUSE WE ARE STILL EARLY IN OUR  ENTERPRISE DEVELOPMENT, THE NUMBER OF THESE POLICIES REQUIRING  EXPLANATION IS LIMITED. AS WE BEGIN TO GENERATE INCREASED REVENUE  FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES, WE EXPECT THAT THE NUMBER OF APPLICABLE  POLICIES AND COMPLEXITY OF THE JUDGMENTS REQUIRED WILL  INCREASE.  23  REVENUE  RECOGNITION.  ASC 606  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ESTABLISHES A SINGLE AND  COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH SETS OUT HOW MUCH REVENUE IS TO BE  RECOGNIZED, AND WHEN. THE CORE PRINCIPLE IS THAT A VENDOR SHOULD  RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR  SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION  TO WHICH THE VENDOR EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE  GOODS OR SERVICES. REVENUE WILL NOW BE RECOGNIZED BY A VENDOR WHEN  CONTROL OVER THE GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  IN CONTRAST, REVENUE BASED REVENUE RECOGNITION AROUND AN ANALYSIS  OF THE TRANSFER OF RISKS AND REWARDS; THIS NOW FORMS ONE OF A  NUMBER OF CRITERIA THAT ARE ASSESSED IN DETERMINING WHETHER CONTROL  HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED. THE APPLICATION OF THE CORE PRINCIPLE IN ASC  606 IS CARRIED OUT IN FIVE STEPS: STEP 1 \u2013 IDENTIFY THE  CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER: A CONTRACT IS DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT  (INCLUDING ORAL AND IMPLIED), BETWEEN TWO OR MORE PARTIES, THAT  CREATES ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS AND SETS OUT THE  CRITERIA FOR EACH OF THOSE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS. THE CONTRACT  NEEDS TO HAVE COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE  ENTITY WILL COLLECT THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH IT WILL BE ENTITLED.  STEP 2 \u2013 IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE  CONTRACT: A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN A CONTRACT IS A PROMISE  (INCLUDING IMPLICIT) TO TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER.  EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SHOULD BE CAPABLE OF BEING DISTINCT AND  IS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE IN THE CONTRACT. STEP 3 \u2013  DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE: TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF  CONSIDERATION THAT THE ENTITY CAN BE ENTITLED TO, IN EXCHANGE FOR  TRANSFERRING THE PROMISED GOODS AND SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER,  EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. STEP 4  \u2013 ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT: FOR A CONTRACT THAT HAS MORE THAN ONE  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE ENTITY WILL ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION  PRICE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION SEPARATELY, IN EXCHANGE FOR  SATISFYING EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE ACCEPTABLE METHODS OF  ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDE ADJUSTED MARKET ASSESSMENT  APPROACH, EXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN APPROACH, AND, THE RESIDUAL  APPROACH IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. DISCOUNTS GIVEN SHOULD BE  ALLOCATED PROPORTIONATELY TO ALL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS UNLESS  CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET AND REALLOCATION OF CHANGES IN STANDALONE  SELLING PRICES AFTER INCEPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. STEP 5 \u2013  RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS AND WHEN THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATION: THE ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT A POINT IN TIME,  EXCEPT IF IT MEETS ANY OF THE THREE CRITERIA, WHICH WILL REQUIRE  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OVER TIME: THE ENTITY\u2019S PERFORMANCE  CREATES OR ENHANCES AN ASSET CONTROLLED BY THE CUSTOMER, THE  CUSTOMER SIMULTANEOUSLY RECEIVES AND CONSUMES THE BENEFIT OF THE  ENTITY\u2019S PERFORMANCE AS THE ENTITY PERFORMS, AND THE ENTITY  DOES NOT CREATE AN ASSET THAT HAS AN ALTERNATIVE USE TO THE ENTITY  AND THE ENTITY HAS THE RIGHT TO BE PAID FOR PERFORMANCE TO  DATE.  VALUATION OF DEFERRED  TAXES.  WE ACCOUNT FOR  INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LIABILITY METHOD. UNDER THE  LIABILITY METHOD, WE RECOGNIZE DEFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  BASED UPON ANTICIPATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. WE ESTABLISH A  VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT  THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE UTILIZED AGAINST FUTURE  TAXABLE INCOME.  VALUATION OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS  GRANTED TO EMPLOYEE, SERVICE PROVIDERS AND  INVESTORS.  ON THE DATE OF  ISSUANCE, THE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AS  DETERMINED USING EITHER THE BLACK-SCHOLES VALUATION MODEL OR MONTE  CARLO SIMULATION MODEL.  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURES OF CONVERTIBLE  SECURITIES.  CONVERSION OPTIONS THAT ARE NOT BIFURCATED AS A  DERIVATIVE PURSUANT TO ASC 815 AND NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE  EQUITY COMPONENT UNDER THE CASH CONVERSION GUIDANCE ARE EVALUATED  TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR AT  INCEPTION (A BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE) OR MAY BECOME  BENEFICIAL IN THE FUTURE DUE TO POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS. THE  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE GUIDANCE IN ASC 470-20 APPLIES TO  CONVERTIBLE STOCK AS WELL AS CONVERTIBLE DEBT WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE  SCOPE OF ASC 815. A BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE IS DEFINED AS A  NONDETACHABLE CONVERSION FEATURE THAT IS IN THE MONEY AT THE  COMMITMENT DATE. THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE GUIDANCE  REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE CONVERSION OPTION\u2019S IN-THE-MONEY  PORTION, THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE OPTION, IN EQUITY, WITH AN  OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INSTRUMENT. THE  RESULTING DISCOUNT IS AMORTIZED AS A DIVIDEND OVER EITHER THE LIFE  OF THE INSTRUMENT, IF A STATED MATURITY DATE EXISTS, OR TO THE  EARLIEST CONVERSION DATE, IF THERE IS NO STATED MATURITY DATE. IF  THE EARLIEST CONVERSION DATE IS IMMEDIATELY UPON ISSUANCE, THE  DIVIDEND MUST BE RECOGNIZED AT INCEPTION. WHEN THERE IS A  SUBSEQUENT CHANGE TO THE CONVERSION RATIO BASED ON A FUTURE  OCCURRENCE, THE NEW CONVERSION PRICE MAY TRIGGER THE RECOGNITION OF  AN ADDITIONAL BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE ON  OCCURRENCE.  ALLOWANCE FOR ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  WE ESTIMATE  LOSSES FROM THE INABILITY OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS TO MAKE REQUIRED  PAYMENTS AND PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE PAYMENT HISTORY OF EACH OF OUR  DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS THEIR FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND REVISE OUR  RESERVES AS A RESULT.  INVENTORY  VALUATION.  ALL INVENTORIES  ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, WITH COST  DETERMINED SUBSTANTIALLY ON A \u201cFIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT\u201d  BASIS. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE NOT  INVENTORIED, BUT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN  PURCHASED.  24  REVERSE STOCK  SPLIT.  ON MARCH 29, 2019,  THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A 1:800 REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF ALL OF OUR  ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSE  STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON  STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. ALL FRACTIONAL  SHARES CREATED BY THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE ROUNDED TO THE  NEAREST WHOLE SHARE. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF COMMON  STOCK DID NOT CHANGE. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT DECREASED THE  COMPANY\u2019S ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM  2,135,478,405 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK TO 2,669,348 SHARES AS OF THAT  DATE.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON  OF 2018 AND 2017  SALES REVENUE, COST OF  SALES AND GROSS LOSS FROM DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES.  REVENUES  FROM THE SALE OF LUVIVA DEVICES FOR 2018 AND 2017 WERE  APPROXIMATELY $57,000 AND $244,000, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES IN 2018  WERE APPROXIMATELY, $187,000 OR 77% LOWER WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2017, DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING TO SUPPORT SALES AND  MARKETING EFFORTS. RELATED COSTS OF SALES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $89,000 AND $530,000 IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. COSTS OF SALES  IN 2018, WERE APPROXIMATELY, $441,000 OR 83% LOWER WHEN COMPARED TO  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017, DUE TO INCREASE IN THE INVENTORY COSTS.  THIS RESULTED IN A GROSS LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $32,000 ON THE SALES  OF DEVICES AND DISPOSABLES FOR 2018 COMPARED WITH A GROSS LOSS OF  APPROXIMATELY $286,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR 2018,  DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $244,000, FROM APPROXIMATELY $334,000 IN  2017. THE DECREASE OF $90,000, OR 27%, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO COST  REDUCTION PLANS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PAYROLL  EXPENSES.  SALES AND MARKETING  EXPENSES.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR 2018, DECREASED  TO APPROXIMATELY $195,000, COMPARED TO $245,000 IN 2017. THE  DECREASE, OF APPROXIMATELY $50,000, OR 20% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  COMPANY-WIDE EXPENSE REDUCTION AND COST SAVINGS  EFFORTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR 2018,  DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,077,000, COMPARED TO $2,256,000 FOR  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,179,000,  OR 52%, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO LOWER COMPENSATION AND OPTION  EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE SAME PERIOD. FOR 2018, GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PROFESSIONAL FEES,  INSURANCE, AND PAID AND ACCRUED COMPENSATION COSTS.  OTHER INCOME.  OTHER  INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $54,000 IN 2018, COMPARED TO $18,000 IN  THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017, AN INCREASE OF $36,000 OR 200%. OTHER  INCOME CONSISTS OF REFUNDS FROM PRIOR YEARS FOR INSURANCE  POLICIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR 2018 INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,763,000,  COMPARED TO $1,106,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE INCREASE OF  APPROXIMATELY $657,000, OR 59%, WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF AND INTEREST RECORDED FOR THE VALUE OF THE  BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE ON CONVERTIBLE DEBT OUTSTANDING AND  AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS  RECOVERY AND EXPENSE.  FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECOVERY FOR  2018, INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $3,234,000 COMPARED TO FAIR VALUE  OF WARRANTS EXPENSE OF $6,487,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $9,721,000, OR 150% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE FAVORABLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN WARRANT CONVERSION PRICES AND  DECREASE IN STOCK PRICE, IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018.  GAIN FROM EXTINGUISHMENT OF  DEBT.  GAIN FROM THE RESTRUCTURING AND EXCHANGE OF DEBT DUE  TO OFFICERS FOR 2018 INCREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $1,039,000,  COMPARED TO NIL FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  NET PROFIT / LOSS.  NET PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCREASED TO  APPROXIMATELY $900,000, OR $1.95 PER SHARE, IN 2018, FROM A NET  LOSS OF $10,974,000, OR $997.64 PER SHARE, IN 2017. THE DECREASE IN  THE NET LOSS OF $11,874,000, OR 108% WAS FOR REASONS OUTLINED  ABOVE. AS STATED PREVIOUSLY, OUR NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY REALIZED DUE TO A $3.2 MILLION GAIN  IN THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECORDED IN 2018 AND A $1.0 MILLION  GAIN FROM EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.  THERE  WAS NO INCOME TAX BENEFIT RECORDED FOR 2018 OR 2017, DUE TO  RECURRING NET OPERATING LOSSES.  25  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE PUBLIC AND  PRIVATE SALE OF DEBT AND EQUITY, FUNDING FROM COLLABORATIVE  ARRANGEMENTS, AND GRANTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD CASH OF LESS  THAN $1,000 AND A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $10,530,000.  OUR  MAJOR CASH FLOWS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CONSISTED OF  CASH OUT-FLOWS OF $1.4 MILLION FROM OPERATIONS, INCLUDING  APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION OF NET PROFIT, AND A NET CHANGE FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1.4 MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY REPRESENTED  THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS,  AND PROCEEDS FROM DEBT FINANCING. OUR NET PROFIT FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY REALIZED DUE TO A $3.2 MILLION GAIN  IN THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS RECORDED IN 2018.  ON JUNE  5, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SHENGHUO MEDICAL,  LLC PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED SHENGHUO AN EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO  MANUFACTURE, SELL AND DISTRIBUTE LUVIVA IN TAIWAN, BRUNEI  DARUSSALAM, CAMBODIA, LAOS, MYANMAR, PHILIPPINES, SINGAPORE,  THAILAND, AND VIETNAM. SHENGHUO WAS ALREADY OUR EXCLUSIVE  DISTRIBUTOR IN CHINA, MACAU AND HONG KONG, AND THE LICENSE EXTENDED  TO MANUFACTURING IN THOSE COUNTRIES AS WELL. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  LICENSE AGREEMENT, ONCE SHENGHUO WAS CAPABLE OF MANUFACTURING  LUVIVA IN ACCORDANCE WITH ISO 13485 FOR MEDICAL DEVICES, SHENGHUO  WOULD PAY US A ROYALTY EQUAL TO $2.00 OR 20% OF THE DISTRIBUTOR  PRICE (SUBJECT TO A DISCOUNT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES),  WHICHEVER IS HIGHER, PER DISPOSABLE DISTRIBUTED WITHIN  SHENGHUO\u2019S EXCLUSIVE TERRITORIES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE  LICENSE GRANT, SHENGHUO WOULD UNDERWRITE THE COST OF SECURING  APPROVAL OF LUVIVA WITH CHINESE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION. AT  ITS OPTION, SHENGHUO ALSO WOULD PROVIDE UP TO $1.0 MILLION IN  FURTHERANCE OF OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR LUVIVA  FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, IN EXCHANGE FOR THE  RIGHT TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS EQUAL TO 2% OF OUR FUTURE SALES IN THE  UNITED STATES, UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF $4.0 MILLION. PURSUANT TO THE  LICENSE AGREEMENT, SHENGHUO HAD THE OPTION TO HAVE A DESIGNEE  APPOINTED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS (AND RICHARD BLUMBERG IS THAT  DESIGNEE). AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR, AND AS A CONDITION TO, THE  LICENSE, AND TO FURTHER ALIGN THE STRATEGIC INTERESTS OF THE  PARTIES, WE HAVE AGREED TO ISSUE A CONVERTIBLE NOTE TO SHENGHUO, IN  EXCHANGE FOR AN AGGREGATE CASH INVESTMENT OF $200,000. THE NOTE  WILL PROVIDE FOR A PAYMENT TO SHENGHUO OF $300,000, EXPECTED TO BE  DUE THE EARLIER OF 90 DAYS FROM ISSUANCE AND CONSUMMATION OF ANY  CAPITAL RAISING TRANSACTION BY US WITH NET CASH PROCEEDS OF AT  LEAST $1.0 MILLION.

THE NOTE WILL BE  CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE  PER SHARE OF $11,137, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY ANTI-DILUTION  ADJUSTMENT. THE NOTE WILL BE UNSECURED, AND IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE  FOR CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT. WE WILL ALSO ISSUE SHENGHUO A  FIVE-YEAR WARRANT EXERCISABLE IMMEDIATELY FOR APPROXIMATELY 22  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION  PRICE OF THE NOTE, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY ANTI-DILUTION ADJUSTMENT.  ON JANUARY 22, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH SMI,  PURSUANT TO WHICH WE GRANTED SMI AN EXCLUSIVE GLOBAL LICENSE TO  MANUFACTURE THE LUVIVA DEVICE AND RELATED DISPOSABLES (SUBJECT TO A  CARVE-OUT FOR MANUFACTURE IN TURKEY) AND EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTION  RIGHTS IN THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, MACAU, HONG KONG AND  TAIWAN. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE SMI AGREEMENT, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR  TO ITS EXECUTION WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH SHENGHUO,  REGARDING THE PREVIOUS LICENSE TO SHENGHUO. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE  NEW AGREEMENT, SHENGHUO AGREED TO RELINQUISH ITS MANUFACTURING  LICENSE AND ITS DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS IN SMI\u2019S TERRITORIES, AND  TO WAIVE ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE ORIGINAL SHENGHUO AGREEMENT, ALL FOR  AS LONG AS SMI PERFORMS UNDER THE SMI AGREEMENT. SEE  \u201c\u2014RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.\u201d  BETWEEN  JUNE 13, 2016 AND JUNE 14, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS  WITH HOLDERS OF CERTAIN WARRANTS (INCLUDING JOHN IMHOFF, ONE OF OUR  DIRECTORS) ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN MAY 2013, AND WITH GPB DEBT  HOLDINGS II LLC, HOLDER OF A WARRANT ISSUED FEBRUARY 12, 2016,  PURSUANT TO WHICH EACH HOLDER SEPARATELY AGREED TO EXCHANGE  WARRANTS FOR EITHER (1) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK EQUAL TO 166% OF THE  NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE SURRENDERED  WARRANTS, OR (2) NEW WARRANTS EXERCISABLE FOR 200% OF THE NUMBER OF  SHARES UNDERLYING THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS, BUT WITHOUT CERTAIN  ANTI-DILUTION PROTECTIONS INCLUDED WITH THE SURRENDERED WARRANTS.  AS A RESULT OF THE EXCHANGES, WE EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATE ANY  POTENTIAL EXPONENTIAL INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF UNDERLYING SHARES  ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF OUR OUTSTANDING WARRANTS. IN TOTAL, FOR  SURRENDERED WARRANTS THEN-EXERCISABLE FOR AN AGGREGATE OF  22,460,938 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK (BUT SUBJECT TO EXPONENTIAL  INCREASE UPON OPERATION OF CERTAIN ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS), WE  ISSUED OR ARE OBLIGATED TO ISSUE 21 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AND NEW  WARRANTS THAT, IF EXERCISED AS OF JUNE 14, 2016, WOULD HAVE BEEN  EXERCISABLE FOR AN AGGREGATE OF 4,511 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. IN  CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, IN LIEU OF PRESENTLY ISSUING ALL OF THE  SHARES (FOR EACH HOLDER THAT OPTED FOR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK), WE  AND THE HOLDER FURTHER AGREED THAT WE WILL, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS  AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE APPLICABLE WARRANT EXCHANGE  AGREEMENT, FROM TIME TO TIME, BE OBLIGATED TO ISSUE THE REMAINING  SHARES TO THE HOLDER. NO ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION WILL BE PAYABLE  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE REMAINING SHARES.

WE AGREED THAT,  UPON CONSUMMATION OF OUR NEXT FINANCING, WE WOULD USE $260,000 OF  NET CASH PROCEEDS FIRST, TO REPAY GHS\u2019S PORTION OF THE  SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE AND SECOND, WITH ANY REMAINING AMOUNT FROM  THE $260,000, TO REPURCHASE A PORTION OF GHS\u2019S SHARES OF  SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, GHS HAS AGREED TO EXCHANGE  THE STATED VALUE PER SHARE (PLUS ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID DIVIDENDS)  OF ITS REMAINING SHARES OF SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK FOR NEW  SECURITIES OF THE SAME TYPE THAT WE SEPARATELY ISSUE IN THE NEXT  QUALIFYING FINANCING WE UNDERTAKE, ON A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR BASIS IN  A PRIVATE PLACEMENT EXCHANGE.

AS A RESULT OF THE  REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, EVERY 800 SHARES OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING  COMMON STOCK WERE CONVERTED INTO 1 SHARE OF COMMON STOCK. ALL  FRACTIONAL SHARES CREATED BY THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WERE ROUNDED  TO THE NEAREST WHOLE SHARE. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED SHARES OF  COMMON STOCK DID NOT CHANGE.

BECAUSE AUDIENCE RATINGS IN A STATION\u2019S LOCAL MARKET ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATION\u2019S FINANCIAL SUCCESS, OUR STRATEGY IS TO USE MARKET RESEARCH, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AUDIENCES IN EACH STATION\u2019S CHOSEN DEMOGRAPHIC TARGET GROUP.  OUR REVENUES VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. AS IS TYPICAL IN THE BROADCASTING INDUSTRY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME ARE USUALLY LOWEST IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.  IN ADDITION TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME FOR CASH, STATIONS TYPICALLY EXCHANGE ADVERTISING TIME FOR GOODS OR SERVICES, WHICH CAN BE USED BY THE STATION IN ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THESE BARTER TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE RECEIVED. WE GENERALLY CONFINE THE USE OF SUCH TRADE TRANSACTIONS TO PROMOTIONAL ITEMS OR SERVICES FOR WHICH WE WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE PAID CASH. IN ADDITION, IT IS OUR GENERAL POLICY NOT TO PREEMPT ADVERTISING SPOTS PAID FOR IN CASH WITH ADVERTISING SPOTS PAID FOR IN TRADE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE SOURCES OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS. THE CATEGORY \u201cNON TRADITIONAL\u201d PRINCIPALLY CONSISTS OF TICKET SALES AND SPONSORSHIPS OF EVENTS OUR STATIONS AND MAGAZINES CONDUCT IN THEIR LOCAL MARKETS. THE CATEGORY \u201cOTHER\u201d INCLUDES, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, REVENUES RELATED TO OUR TAGSTATION AND DIGONEX BUSINESSES, NETWORK REVENUES AND BARTER. DURING THE THREE YEAR PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE SOLD ALL OF OUR CITY AND REGIONAL MAGAZINES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . WE ALSO SOLD OUR RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, LOS ANGELES AND ST. LOUIS. THESE SALES IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF NET REVENUES IN FISCAL 2017, 2018 AND 2019.

THESE VARIABLE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATE TO COSTS IN OUR SALES DEPARTMENT, SUCH AS SALARIES, COMMISSIONS AND BAD DEBT. OUR COSTS THAT DO NOT VARY AS MUCH IN RELATION TO REVENUE ARE MOSTLY IN OUR PROGRAMMING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE DEPARTMENTS, SUCH AS TALENT COSTS, SYNDICATED PROGRAMMING FEES, UTILITIES, OFFICE EXPENSES AND SALARIES. LASTLY, OUR COSTS THAT ARE HIGHLY DISCRETIONARY ARE COSTS IN OUR MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS DEPARTMENT, WHICH WE PRIMARILY INCUR TO MAINTAIN AND/OR INCREASE OUR AUDIENCE AND MARKET SHARE.  KNOWN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  THE U.S. RADIO INDUSTRY IS A MATURE INDUSTRY AND ITS GROWTH RATE HAS STALLED. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS IS PRINCIPALLY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: (1) NEW MEDIA, SUCH AS VARIOUS MEDIA DISTRIBUTED VIA THE INTERNET, TELECOMMUNICATION COMPANIES AND CABLE INTERCONNECTS, AS WELL AS SOCIAL NETWORKS, HAVE GAINED ADVERTISING SHARE AGAINST RADIO AND OTHER TRADITIONAL MEDIA AND CREATED A PROLIFERATION OF ADVERTISING INVENTORY AND (2) THE FRAGMENTATION OF THE RADIO AUDIENCE AND TIME SPENT LISTENING CAUSED BY SATELLITE RADIO, AUDIO STREAMING SERVICES AND PODCASTS HAS LED SOME INVESTORS AND ADVERTISERS TO CONCLUDE THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RADIO ADVERTISING HAS DIMINISHED.  ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE RADIO INDUSTRY, THE MAJORITY OF OUR STATIONS HAVE DEPLOYED HD RADIO  \u00ae  . HD RADIO OFFERS LISTENERS ADVANTAGES OVER STANDARD ANALOG BROADCASTS, INCLUDING IMPROVED SOUND QUALITY AND ADDITIONAL DIGITAL CHANNELS. IN ADDITION TO OFFERING SECONDARY CHANNELS, THE HD RADIO SPECTRUM ALLOWS BROADCASTERS TO TRANSMIT OTHER FORMS OF DATA. WE ARE PARTICIPATING IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH OTHER BROADCASTERS TO PROVIDE THE BANDWIDTH THAT A THIRD PARTY USES TO TRANSMIT LOCATION-BASED DATA TO HAND-HELD AND IN-CAR NAVIGATION DEVICES. THE NUMBER OF RADIO RECEIVERS INCORPORATING HD RADIO HAS INCREASED IN THE PAST YEAR, PARTICULARLY IN NEW AUTOMOBILES. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT IMPACT HD RADIO WILL HAVE ON THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGGRESSIVELY WORKED TO HARNESS THE POWER OF BROADBAND AND MOBILE MEDIA DISTRIBUTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES BY DEVELOPING HIGHLY INTERACTIVE WEBSITES WITH CONTENT THAT ENGAGES OUR LISTENERS, DEPLOYING MOBILE APPLICATIONS AND STREAMING OUR CONTENT, HARNESSING THE POWER OF DIGITAL VIDEO ON OUR WEBSITES AND YOUTUBE CHANNELS, AND DELIVERING REAL-TIME TRAFFIC TO NAVIGATION DEVICES.  THE RESULTS OF OUR RADIO OPERATIONS ARE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STATIONS IN THE NEW YORK MARKET, WHICH ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR RADIO NET REVENUES. SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE LARGER STATION CLUSTERS IN THE NEW YORK MARKET ARE ABLE TO LEVERAGE THEIR MARKET SHARE TO EXTRACT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF AVAILABLE ADVERTISING REVENUE THROUGH PACKAGING A VARIETY OF ADVERTISING INVENTORY AT DISCOUNTED UNIT RATES. MARKET REVENUES IN NEW YORK AS MEASURED BY MILLER KAPLAN ARASE LLP (\u201cMILLER KAPLAN\u201d), AN INDEPENDENT PUBLIC  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACCOUNTING FIRM USED BY THE RADIO INDUSTRY TO COMPILE REVENUE INFORMATION, WERE DOWN  2.  0% FOR THE TWELV  E MON  THS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. DURING THIS PERIOD, REVENUES FOR OUR NEW YORK CLUSTER WERE DOWN  3.4%.  OUR UNDERPERFORMANCE IN NEW YORK WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER TICKET SALES REVENUE FOR OUR LARGEST CON  CERT, SUMMER JAM. POOR WEATHER ON THE DAY OF THE CONCERT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TICKET SALES.  AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE HOLD PROMISE FOR LONG-TERM APPRECIATION IN VALUE AND LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS. HOWEVER, EMMIS\u2019 LONG-TERM DEBT AGREEMENTS SUBSTANTIALLY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS AND MAY OPPORTUNISTICALLY DISPOSE OF ASSETS WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. IN THAT RESPECT, OVER THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS WE HAVE SOLD RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, LOS ANGELES AND ST. LOUIS. WE HAVE ALSO SOLD ALL OF OUR PUBLISHING ASSETS, EXCEPT  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE THE SALE OF WLIB-AM IN NEW YORK AND OTHER ASSETS, INCLUDING LAND IN INDIANAPOLIS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ENCOMPASS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND POTENTIALLY DERIVE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  BROADCASTING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE AIRED. PUBLICATION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE MONTH OF DELIVERY OF THE PUBLICATION. BOTH BROADCASTING REVENUE AND PUBLICATION REVENUE RECOGNITION IS SUBJECT TO MEETING CERTAIN CONDITIONS SUCH AS PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE THAT AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS AND COLLECTION IS REASONABLY ASSURED. THESE CRITERIA ARE GENERALLY MET AT THE TIME THE ADVERTISEMENT IS AIRED FOR BROADCASTING REVENUE AND UPON DELIVERY OF THE PUBLICATION FOR PUBLICATION REVENUE. ADVERTISING REVENUES PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE REFLECTED ON A NET BASIS, AFTER THE DEDUCTION OF ADVERTISING AGENCY FEES, USUALLY AT A RATE OF 15% OF GROSS REVENUES.  FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL  WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST FOR WHICH A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL ASSETS. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAVE RECORDED APPROXIMATELY $174.9 MILLION IN GOODWILL AND FCC LICENSES, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 74% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS.  IN THE CASE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES WITHOUT THE RELATED FCC LICENSE FOR EACH PROPERTY. FCC LICENSES ARE RENEWED EVERY EIGHT YEARS; CONSEQUENTLY, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR OUR STATIONS\u2019 COMPLIANCE WITH THE VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. HISTORICALLY, ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES HAVE BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PERIODS, AND WE EXPECT THAT ALL FCC LICENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RENEWED IN THE FUTURE. WE CONSIDER OUR FCC LICENSES TO BE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES.  WE DO NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL OR OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BUT RATHER TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT AN ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. WHEN EVALUATING OUR RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE TESTING IS PERFORMED AT THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING LEVEL AS DETERMINED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 350-30-35. IN OUR CASE, RADIO STATIONS IN A GEOGRAPHIC MARKET CLUSTER ARE CONSIDERED A SINGLE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING, PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE NOT BEING OPERATED UNDER A LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENT BY ANOTHER BROADCASTER.  WE COMPLETE OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR AND PERFORM ADDITIONAL INTERIM IMPAIRMENT TESTING WHENEVER TRIGGERING EVENTS SUGGEST SUCH TESTING IS WARRANTED.  VALUATION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED BROADCASTING LICENSES  FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC LICENSES IS ESTIMATED TO BE THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FCC LICENSES, THE COMPANY USES AN INCOME VALUATION METHOD WHEN IT PERFORMS ITS IMPAIRMENT TESTS. UNDER THIS METHOD, THE COMPANY PROJECTS CASH FLOWS THAT WOULD BE GENERATED BY EACH OF ITS UNITS OF ACCOUNTING ASSUMING THE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WAS COMMENCING OPERATIONS IN ITS RESPECTIVE MARKET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VALUATION PERIOD. THIS CASH FLOW STREAM IS DISCOUNTED TO ARRIVE AT A VALUE FOR THE FCC LICENSE. THE COMPANY ASSUMES THE COMPETITIVE SITUATION THAT EXISTS IN EACH MARKET REMAINS UNCHANGED, WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT ITS UNIT OF ACCOUNTING COMMENCED OPERATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE VALUATION PERIOD. IN DOING SO, THE COMPANY EXTRACTS THE VALUE OF GOING CONCERN AND ANY OTHER ASSETS ACQUIRED, AND STRICTLY VALUES THE FCC LICENSE. MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED IN THIS ANALYSIS INCLUDE MARKET REVENUE, MARKET REVENUE GROWTH RATES, UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AUDIENCE SHARE, UNIT OF ACCOUNTING REVENUE SHARE AND DISCOUNT RATE. EACH OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE BASED UPON CHANGES IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AUDIENCE BEHAVIOR, CONSUMMATED TRANSACTIONS, AND NUMEROUS OTHER VARIABLES THAT MAY BE BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THE PROJECTIONS INCORPORATED INTO OUR LICENSE VALUATIONS TAKE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INTO CONSIDERATION.  BELOW ARE SOME OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE REDUCED LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE BASED ON RECENT INDUSTRY TRENDS AND OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE MARKETS GOING FORWARD. THE METHODOLOGY USED TO VALUE OUR FCC LICENSES HAS NOT CHANGED IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  DECEMBER 1, 2016  DECEMBER 1, 2017  DECEMBER 1, 2018  DISCOUNT RATE  12.2% - 12.5%  12.1% - 12.4%  11.9% - 12.3%  LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATE  1.0% - 2.0%  1.0% - 1.8%  0.3% - 1.0%  MATURE MARKET SHARE  3.1% - 30.4%  12.7% - 31.1%  12.9% - 30.2%  OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN  25.1% - 39.1%  27.0% - 39.1%  26.0% - 38.0%  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO FCC LICENSES IN TWO OF THE PAST THREE YEARS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECOGNIZED AS PART OF OUR DECEMBER 1, 2016 AND 2018 ANNUAL TESTING WERE $6.9 MILLION AND $0.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE IMPAIRMENTS WERE MOSTLY RELATED TO DECLINING MARKET REVENUES COMBINED WITH LOWERED EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATES AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.  VALUATION OF GOODWILL  ASC TOPIC 350-20-35 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS ITS IMPAIRMENT TEST ON DECEMBER 1 OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, UNLESS INDICATIONS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD. WHEN ASSESSING ITS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY USES AN ENTERPRISE VALUATION APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTING UNITS (RADIO STATIONS GROUPED BY MARKET, EXCLUDING ANY STATIONS THAT ARE BEING OPERATED PURSUANT TO AN LMA). MANAGEMENT DETERMINES ENTERPRISE VALUE FOR EACH OF ITS REPORTING UNITS BY MULTIPLYING THE TWO-YEAR AVERAGE STATION OPERATING INCOME GENERATED BY EACH REPORTING UNIT (CURRENT YEAR BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE NEXT YEAR BASED ON BUDGETED RESULTS) BY AN ESTIMATED MARKET MULTIPLE. THE COMPANY USES A BLENDED STATION OPERATING INCOME TRADING MULTIPLE OF PUBLICLY TRADED RADIO OPERATORS AS WELL AS RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS AS A BENCHMARK FOR THE MULTIPLE IT APPLIES TO ITS RADIO REPORTING UNITS. FOR THE ANNUAL ASSESSMENT PERFORMED AS OF DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE COMPANY APPLIED A MARKET MULTIPLE OF 8.0 TIMES THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS METHODOLOGY FOR VALUING RADIO PROPERTIES IS A COMMON APPROACH AND BELIEVES THAT THE MULTIPLES USED IN THE VALUATION ARE REASONABLE GIVEN OUR PEER COMPARISONS AND MARKET TRANSACTIONS. TO CORROBORATE THE FAIR VALUES DETERMINED USING THE MARKET APPROACH DESCRIBED ABOVE, MANAGEMENT ALSO USES AN INCOME APPROACH, WHICH IS A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2017-04, INTANGIBLES - GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF MARCH 1, 2017. PRIOR TO MARCH 1, 2017, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A TWO-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT RECORDED DURING THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2017 WAS RECORDED USING THE TWO-STEP METHODOLOGY. GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED FROM MARCH 1, 2017 FORWARD WILL BE RECORDED USING THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THE COMPANY USED AN INCOME APPROACH TO DETERMINE THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF DIGONEX. DIGONEX IS A DYNAMIC PRICING BUSINESS THAT DOES NOT HAVE WELL-ESTABLISHED INDUSTRY TRADING MULTIPLES, ANALYST ESTIMATES OF VALUATIONS, OR RECENTLY COMPLETED TRANSACTIONS THAT WOULD INDICATE FAIR VALUES OF THESE BUSINESSES. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY USED A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF DIGONEX.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016, THE COMPANY LOWERED ITS GROWTH EXPECTATIONS FOR DIGONEX FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO SLOW CLIENT ADOPTION OF DYNAMIC PRICING SERVICES. WHILE THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN THE LONG-TERM GROWTH PROSPECTS OF DIGONEX, THE LENGTHY SALES CYCLE HAS CAUSED DIGONEX TO PERFORM BELOW EXPECTATIONS TO DATE. THE COMBINATION OF LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS, COUPLED WITH DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE PROJECTIONS, RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT INDICATOR THAT CAUSED THE COMPANY TO ASSESS GOODWILL AND RELATED INTANGIBLES ON AN INTERIM BASIS DURING THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016. THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR DIGONEX INDICATED A NOMINAL ENTERPRISE VALUE. THEREFORE, IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTERIM IMPAIRMENT TEST, EMMIS DETERMINED THAT DIGONEX\u2019S GOODWILL WAS FULLY IMPAIRED AND RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $2.1 MILLION. SUBSEQUENT TO OUR IMPAIRMENT OF DIGONEX GOODWILL AND THE SALE OF  TEXAS MONTHLY  (SEE NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DISCUSSION), THE COMPANY\u2019S GOODWILL RELATES ENTIRELY TO ITS RADIO SEGMENT.  DURING OUR DECEMBER 2017 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF $0.3 MILLION OF GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INDIANAPOLIS RADIO CLUSTER. WEAK RATINGS AND DECLINING MARKET REVENUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN INDIANAPOLIS. THIS RESULTED IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INDIANAPOLIS RADIO CLUSTER EXCEEDING ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE BY MORE THAN THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL WE HAD RECORDED FOR THE CLUSTER ON THE ASSESSMENT DATE. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY FULLY IMPAIRED THE GOODWILL OF THIS CLUSTER.  SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR DECEMBER 1, 2018 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES WAS APPROXIMATELY $203.6 MILLION, WHICH WAS IN EXCESS OF THE $170.5 MILLION CARRYING VALUE BY $33.1 MILLION, OR 19.4%. SHOULD OUR ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS WORSEN, OR SHOULD NEGATIVE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR IN THE UNITS THAT HAVE LIMITED FAIR VALUE CUSHION, ADDITIONAL LICENSE IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE NEEDED.  RADIO BROADCASTING LICENSES  AS OF DECEMBER 1, 2018  UNIT OF ACCOUNTING  CARRYING VALUE  FAIR VALUE  PERCENTAGE BY WHICH FAIR  VALUE EXCEEDS CARRYING VALUE  NEW YORK CLUSTER  71,614  102,976  43.8%  98.7FM (NEW YORK)  46,390  47,112  1.6%  AUSTIN CLUSTER  34,720  35,675  2.8%  INDIANAPOLIS CLUSTER  17,823  17,823  0.0%  TOTAL  170,547  203,586  19.4%  IF WE WERE TO ASSUME A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN ANY OF OUR THREE KEY ASSUMPTIONS (A REDUCTION IN THE LONG-TERM REVENUE GROWTH RATE, A REDUCTION IN LOCAL COMMERCIAL SHARE OR AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE) USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING LICENSES ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE RESULTING IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD HAVE BEEN $21.3 MILLION, $13.4 MILLION AND $9.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ALSO, IF WE WERE TO ASSUME A MARKET MULTIPLE DECREASE OF ONE OR A 10% DECREASE IN THE TWO-YEAR AVERAGE STATION OPERATING INCOME, TWO OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, THE RESULTING ESTIMATES OF ENTERPRISE VALUATIONS WOULD STILL EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE ENTERPRISES. AS SUCH, NO ADDITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IF EITHER OF THESE TWO KEY ASSUMPTIONS WERE LOWERED.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEFERRED TAXES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, WHICH REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR INCOME TAX RETURNS. INCOME TAXES ARE RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. DEFERRED TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AS COMPARED TO AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. AFTER DETERMINING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE COMPANY DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT A DEFERRED TAX ASSET IS NOT LIKELY TO BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WILL BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST THAT ASSET TO RECORD IT AT ITS EXPECTED REALIZABLE VALUE.  INSURANCE CLAIMS AND LOSS RESERVES  THE COMPANY IS SELF-INSURED FOR MOST HEALTHCARE CLAIMS, SUBJECT TO STOP-LOSS LIMITS. CLAIMS INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED ARE RECORDED BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ADJUSTED WHEN WARRANTED BY CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. THE COMPANY HAD $0.4 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION ACCRUED FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE CLAIMS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ALSO MAINTAINS LARGE DEDUCTIBLE PROGRAMS (RANGING FROM $100 THOUSAND TO $250 THOUSAND PER OCCURRENCE) FOR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, EMPLOYMENT LIABILITY, AUTOMOTIVE LIABILITY AND MEDIA LIABILITY CLAIMS.  DISPOSITIONS  THE TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  SALE OF ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS  ON APRIL 30, 2018, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ITS RADIO STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS IN TWO SEPARATE TRANSACTIONS. IN ONE TRANSACTION, EMMIS SOLD THE ASSETS OF KSHE-FM AND KPNT-FM TO AFFILIATES OF HUBBARD RADIO. IN THE OTHER TRANSACTION, EMMIS SOLD THE ASSETS OF KFTK-FM AND KNOU-FM TO AFFILIATES OF ENTERCOM COMMUNICATIONS CORP. EMMIS DECIDED TO SELL ITS STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS TO FURTHER REDUCE OVERALL INDEBTEDNESS. AT CLOSING, EMMIS RECEIVED AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $60.0 MILLION. AFTER DEDUCTING ESTIMATED TAXES PAYABLE AND TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $40.5 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. THE TAXES PAYABLE AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTIONS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY DUE, SO WE REPAID AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVER AND WE HELD EXCESS CASH ON OUR BALANCE SHEET TO ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION UNTIL WE REMIT THE TAXES WHEN DUE. EMMIS RECORDED A $32.1 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF ITS ST. LOUIS STATIONS. OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT. THESE DISPOSALS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS THEY DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF KPWR-FM  ON AUGUST 1, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF KPWR-FM FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $80.1 MILLION TO AFFILIATES OF THE MERUELO GROUP. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE FOURTH AMENDMENT TO EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY, EMMIS WAS REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO SELL ASSETS THAT GENERATED AT LEAST $80 MILLION OF PROCEEDS BY JANUARY 18, 2018 AND TO CLOSE ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF REQUIRED REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE SALE OF KPWR-FM SATISFIED THESE REQUIREMENTS. EMMIS FOUND IT MORE ADVANTAGEOUS TO SELL ITS STANDALONE RADIO STATION IN LOS ANGELES THAN TO SELL OTHER ASSETS TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT. AFTER PAYMENT OF TRANSACTION COSTS AND WITHHOLDING FOR ESTIMATED TAX OBLIGATIONS, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $73.6 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. EMMIS RECORDED A $76.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF KPWR-FM. KPWR-FM HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT. THIS DISPOSAL DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS IT DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE, ATLANTA MAGAZINE, CINCINNATI MAGAZINE AND ORANGE COAST MAGAZINE  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF  LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE  ,  ATLANTA MAGAZINE  ,  CINCINNATI MAGAZINE  AND  ORANGE COAST MAGAZINE  (THE \u201cHOUR MAGAZINES\u201d) FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $6.5 MILLION TO HOUR MEDIA GROUP, LLC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS PUBLISHING DIVISION, EXCLUDING  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . EMMIS DECIDED TO SELL MOST OF ITS PUBLISHING ASSETS TO REDUCE DEBT OUTSTANDING. EMMIS RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $2.9 MILLION, CONSISTING OF THE STATED PURCHASE PRICE OF $6.5 MILLION, LESS $0.7 MILLION HELD IN ESCROW AND DISPOSITION COSTS TOTALING $2.9 MILLION. THE $2.9 MILLION OF DISPOSITION COSTS PRIMARILY RELATE TO $1.6 MILLION OF SEVERANCE COSTS AND TRANSACTION ADVISORY FEES OF $1.0 MILLION. THE FUNDS HELD IN ESCROW SECURE EMMIS\u2019 POST-CLOSING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND WERE SCHEDULED TO BE RELEASED SIX MONTHS AFTER THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. THE RELEASE OF THESE FUNDS FROM ESCROW IS CURRENTLY BEING LITIGATED. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AFTER SETTLING RETENTION BONUSES TO AFFECTED EMPLOYEES, NET PROCEEDS WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. EMMIS RECORDED A $2.7 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE HOUR MAGAZINES. THESE MAGAZINES HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR PUBLISHING SEGMENT. THIS DISPOSAL DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS IT DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DESCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA RADIO STATIONS  ON JANUARY 30, 2017, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF ITS RADIO STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA, IN TWO CONTEMPORANEOUS TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THESE RADIO STATIONS. EMMI  S BELIEVED THAT OPERATING STATIONS IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA WAS NOT A CORE PART OF ITS RADIO STRATEGY AND ITS STRONG MARKET POSITION IN THE TERRE HAUTE MARKET WOULD BE ATTRACTIVE TO POTENTIAL BUYERS. AT CLOSING, EMMIS RECEIVED GROSS PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATEL  Y $5.2 MILLION FOR BOTH TRANSACTIONS. AFTER PAYMENT OF BROKERAGE AND OTHER TRANSACTION COSTS, NET PROCEEDS TOTALED $4.8 MILLION AND WERE USED TO REPAY TERM LOAN INDEBTEDNESS UNDER EMMIS\u2019 SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY. EMMIS RECORDED A $3.5 MILLION GAIN ON THE SAL  E OF ITS TERRE HAUTE RADIO  STATIONS.  THE TERRE HAUTE RADIO STATIONS HAD HISTORICALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR RADIO SEGMENT. THIS DISPOSAL DID NOT QUALIFY FOR REPORTING AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AS IT DID NOT REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT FOR THE COMPANY AS DE  SCRIBED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  CODIFICATION 205-20-45-1C.  SALE OF TEXAS MONTHLY  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2016, EMMIS CLOSED ON ITS SALE OF  TEXAS MONTHLY  FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $25.0 MILLION IN CASH TO A SUBSIDIARY OF GENESIS PARK, LP. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES FOR ITS PUBLISHING DIVISION, EXCLUDING  INDIANAPOLIS MONTHLY  . EMMIS BELIEVED THAT ITS PUBLISHING PORTFOLIO HAD SIGNIFICANT BRAND VALUE AND PLANNED TO USE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS PUBLISHING PROPERTIES TO REPAY DEBT. EMMIS RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $23.4 MILLION, CONSISTING OF THE STATED PURCHASE PRICE OF $25.0 MILLION, NET OF ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TOTALING $0.7 MILLION AND DISPOSITION COSTS TOTALING $0.9 MILLION.

LOUIS RADIO STATIONS ON APRIL 30, 2018. EXCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF RADIO STATION SALES, OUR RADIO NET REVENUES WOULD HAVE BEEN DOWN 3.2% FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. OUR NET REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LOWER TICKET SALES REVENUE FOR OUR LARGEST CONCERT, SUMMER JAM. POOR WEATHER ON THE DAY OF THE CONCERT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TICKET SALES.  WE TYPICALLY MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STATIONS AGAINST THE AGGREGATE PERFORMANCE OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE BASED ON REPORTS FOR THE PERIODS PREPARED BY MILLER KAPLAN. MILLER KAPLAN REPORTS ARE GENERALLY PREPARED ON A GROSS REVENUES BASIS AND EXCLUDE REVENUES FROM BARTER ARRANGEMENTS. A SUMMARY OF MARKET REVENUE PERFORMANCE AND EMMIS\u2019 REVENUE PERFORMANCE IN THOSE MARKETS FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 IS PRESENTED BELOW.

AMONG ITS NUMEROUS CHANGES TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE ACT REDUCED U.S. CORPORATE RATES FROM 35% TO 21%.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY REPAID ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT ON APRIL 12, 2019. CAPITALIZED TERMS IN THIS SECTION NOT DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS 10-K ARE DEFINED IN THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT AND RELATED AMENDMENTS.

THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDED A SUB-FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO $5.0 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT. NO LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE OUTSTANDING DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING RELATED TO THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS 8.7% AND 10.5% AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT DEBT WAS CARRIED NET OF AN UNAMORTIZED ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT OF $1.8 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.

THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WERE SECURED BY A PERFECTED FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, THE BORROWER AND THE SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND CASH AVAILABLE THROUGH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CAPITAL DURING THE PAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN FUTURE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN NEW BUSINESSES.  AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $5.4 MILLION AND NET WORKING CAPITAL OF ($27.4) MILLION. AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $4.1 MILLION AND NET WORKING CAPITAL OF $27.1 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN NET WORKING CAPITAL IS LARGELY DUE TO OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS BEING CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND OUR $25.0 MILLION TERM LOAN, WHICH WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR GIVEN ITS APRIL 2019 MATURITY DATE.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY PROJECTS ITS ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS, WHICH INCLUDE ITS OPERATING NEEDS, CAPITAL NEEDS, AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON ITS INDEBTEDNESS. AS OF THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY CAN MEET ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND AND PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE PROJECTIONS, MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES THE COMPANY WILL BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS DEBT COVENANTS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SINCE WE MANAGE CASH ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, ANY CASH NEEDS OF A PARTICULAR SEGMENT OR OPERATING ENTITY ARE MET BY INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $0.1 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 VERSUS CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $7.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN CASH PAID FOR INTEREST.  DURING THE PAST TWO FISCAL YEARS, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS RADIO STATION IN LOS ANGELES AND ITS RADIO STATIONS IN ST. LOUIS AND USED THE MAJORITY OF THE NET PROCEEDS TO REPAY OUTSTANDING DEBT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $59.7 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 CONSISTED OF $60.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR ST. LOUIS RADIO STATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $0.5 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $78.4 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 CONSISTED OF $80.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF KPWR-FM IN LOS ANGELES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $65.6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 PRIMARILY RELATES TO NET PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OF $60.0 MILLION, DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $5.3 MILLION AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS OF $0.6 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $85.9 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 PRIMARILY RELATES TO NET PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OF $79.1 MILLION, DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS OF $4.9 MILLION, DEBT-RELATED COSTS OF $1.6 MILLION AND THE SETTLEMENT OF TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS OF $0.4 MILLION.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, EMMIS HAD $25.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT, ALL OF WHICH WERE CURRENT, AND $57.4 MILLION OF NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($7.2 MILLION CURRENT AND $50.2 MILLION LONG-TERM). BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT BORE INTEREST, AT OUR OPTION, AT A RATE EQUAL TO THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR AN ALTERNATIVE BASE RATE PLUS A MARGIN. THE NON-RECOURSE DEBT BEARS INTEREST RANGING FROM 2.0% TO 5.0% PER ANNUM. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE UNDER OUR 2014 CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 10.5%.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REFINANCING ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE WAS 6.1%, EXCLUDING OUR VARIOUS NONRECOURSE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REFINANCING ON APRIL 12, 2019, THE DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS OF EMMIS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ARE EXPECTED TO BE $1.7 MILLION RELATED TO OUR MORTGAGE, ($0.4 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $1.3 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS), $9.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR 98.7FM NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($7.3 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $1.7 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS) AND $1.6 MILLION RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN ($1.3 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS AND $0.3 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS). DIGONEX NON-RECOURSE DEBT ($6.2 MILLION FACE AMOUNT, $6.1 MILLION CARRYING AMOUNT AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019) IS DUE IN DECEMBER 2020. NEXTRADIO NON-RECOURSE DEBT OF $4.0 MILLION IS DUE IN DECEMBER 2021. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT PROCEEDS FROM THE 98.7FM LMA WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY ALL DEBT SERVICE RELATED TO THE 98.7FM NON-RECOURSE DEBT. OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT BEARS INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES BASED ON AMOUNTS BORROWED. AS OF MAY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED ANY AMOUNTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF MAY 3, 2019, WE HAD $8.1 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ADDITIONAL BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, $7.0 MILLION OF WHICH MUST BE USED TO PAY REMAINING INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS. AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT DEPENDS UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CONTINUED COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN OPERATING COVENANTS AND FINANCIAL RATIOS. EMMIS WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AS OF MAY 2, 2019.  AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES THAT WE BELIEVE HOLD PROMISE FOR LONG-TERM APPRECIATION IN VALUE AND LEVERAGE OUR STRENGTHS. HOWEVER, EMMIS OPERATING COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY SUBSTANTIALLY LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS. WE ALSO REGULARLY REVIEW OUR PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS AND MAY OPPORTUNISTICALLY DISPOSE OF ASSETS WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO DO SO. SEE NOTE 7 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF DISPOSITIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE THREE YEARS ENDED FEBRUARY 2019.  INTANGIBLES  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 74% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS CONSISTED OF FCC LICENSES AND GOODWILL, THE VALUE OF WHICH DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY UPON THE OPERATIONAL RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESSES. IN THE CASE OF OUR RADIO STATIONS, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OPERATE THE PROPERTIES WITHOUT THE RELATED FCC LICENSE FOR EACH PROPERTY. FCC LICENSES ARE RENEWED EVERY EIGHT YEARS; CONSEQUENTLY, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR STATIONS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. HISTORICALLY, ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES HAVE BEEN RENEWED (OR A WAIVER HAS BEEN GRANTED PENDING RENEWAL) AT THE END OF THEIR RESPECTIVE EIGHT-YEAR PERIODS, AND WE EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR FCC LICENSES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RENEWED IN THE FUTURE.  SEASONALITY  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE USUALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH RESULT IN HIGHER SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. FOR OUR RADIO OPERATIONS, THIS SEASONALITY IS DUE TO THE YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF MANY OF OUR STATIONS. ADVERTISERS INCREASE SPENDING DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS TO TARGET THESE LISTENERS. IN ADDITION, ADVERTISERS GENERALLY INCREASE SPENDING DURING THE MONTHS OF OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER, WHICH ARE PART OF OUR THIRD QUARTER, IN ANTICIPATION OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFLATION  THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON OPERATIONS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT TO DATE.

OVERVIEW  ASTIKA HOLDINGS, INC. WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JANUARY 13, 2011. WE ARE  REFOCUSING AND PREPARING TO RELAUNCH THE COMPANY THROUGH A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN THE TEXTILE, SERVICE, AGRICULTURAL, AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS TO COMPLEMENT AND CAPTURE THE NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA AND NEW ZEALAND.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017  REVENUES.  THE COMPANY DID NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND DID NOT GENERATE ANY REVENUE FOR THE YEARS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  THE COMPANY HAS HAD NOMINAL OPERATIONS AND ONLY INCURRED EXPENSES RELATING TO BEING A PUBLIC REPORTING COMPANY,  AND SEEKING AN ACQUISITION AND FINANCING, INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES FOR PREPARING OUR SEC REPORTS, TRANSFER AGENT FEES, AND CONSULTING FEES FOR MERGER AND ACQUISITION AND INVESTMENT ADVISORY SERVICES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE $55,450, AS COMPARED TO $158,477 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE OF ACCOUNTING, LEGAL AND CONSULTING  FEES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SEC REPORTS AND CONSULTING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE HAD ACTIVELY WORKED ON THE PREPARATION FOR ACQUISITION AND SOUGHT FOR  NEW FINANCING SOURCES WHICH INCURRED ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACQUISITION AND FINANCIAL ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS SEC REPORTS.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE COMPANY ISSUED  1,210,000 SHARES OF ITS SERIES B CONVERTIBLE  PREFERRED STOCK AND RAISED TOTAL GROSS PROCEEDS OF  $515,000.  THE ISSUING COST OF THE SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK WAS RECOGNIZED AS DEDUCTION TO EQUITY (ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL) AND WAS NOT INCLUDED IN GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE.  DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, $0 AND $102,226 WAS RECORDED AS A LOSS ON  MARK-TO-MARKET OF THE CONVERSION OPTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY HAS HAD ONLY NOMINAL OPERATIONS AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY CASH GENERATED FROM  BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  WE FUNDED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES BY ISSUING NOTES TO RELATED AND UNRELATED PARTIES AND BORROWING LOANS FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE ALSO ISSUED CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS  PROCEEDS OF $515,000.  OUR PLAN IS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS AND COMPLETE AN ACQUISITION.  DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL DEFICITS OF  $124,721 AND $111,301, RESPECTIVELY.  4  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $19,857 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 DUE TO THE DECREASE  IN PREPAID EXPENSE OF $42,101. NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $194,044 FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WE EXPERIENCED NO CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE PAID BACK $42,101 OF EARLIER LOANS FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES AND  BORROWED NEW LOANS OF TOTALING $10,408 FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE PAID BACK $142,779 OF EARLIER LOANS FROM OUR  RELATED PARTIES AND BORROWED NEW LOANS OF TOTALING $135,015 FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES.  WE ALSO ISSUED 1,210,000 SHARES OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $515,000.  AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS  BASED ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE WILL NEED ADDITIONAL EQUITY AND/OR DEBT  FINANCING TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. SEE \u201cDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\u201d.  GOING CONCERN  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED USING ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED  STATES OF AMERICA APPLICABLE TO A GOING CONCERN WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND LIQUIDATION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY HAS AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT DECEMBER 31,  2018. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OPERATING COSTS AND ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY  OBTAINING ADEQUATE CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES UNTIL IT BECOMES PROFITABLE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL, IT COULD BE FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO  CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, THE COMPANY WILL NEED, AMONG OTHER THINGS,  ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RESOURCES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLANS FOCUS IS ON A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN SERVICE, AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES TO COMPLIMENT AND GROW ASTIKA HOLDINGS, INC.\u2019S BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS POSITIONING TO CAPTURE THE  NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA. AS THE CENTERPIECES FOR ASTIKA HOLDINGS IN ASIA, THE FOCUS IS ON RAPID ECONOMIC GROWTH AND INCREASED FOREIGN INVESTMENT SECTOR COMPANIES WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS POISED FOR ACCELERATED ECONOMIC GROWTH  WITH NATIONAL MODERNIZATION.  ASTIKA\u2019S PLANNED FOCUS IS ALSO ON ADDING VALUE THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT DEVELOPMENT, EFFICIENT OPERATIONS, AND OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS WHILE MAINTAINING A LOW RISK PROFILE THROUGH PROJECT DIVERSIFICATION, ASTUTE  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING IN SECURE JURISDICTIONS. MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN TO OBTAIN SUCH RESOURCES FOR THE COMPANY INCLUDE (I) OBTAINING CAPITAL FROM MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS MINIMAL OPERATING EXPENSES;  (II) OBTAINING FUNDING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS DEBT AND/OR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (III) COMPLETING A MERGER WITH OR ACQUISITION OF AN EXISTING OPERATING COMPANY.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THE  COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCOMPLISHING ANY OF ITS PLANS.  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED  STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS  COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK, AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  5  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR  LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAVE NO CASH EQUIVALENTS.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT CERTAIN REPORTED AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  SHARE BASED PAYMENTS  WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC  TOPIC 718, OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR EACH SEPARATELY VESTING TRANCHE, AS IF MULTIPLE AWARDS WERE GRANTED. COMPENSATION COST IS BASED ON GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE USING QUOTED MARKET PRICES FOR OUR COMMON STOCK. WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION  COST FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO NONEMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC TOPIC 505.  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  THE COMPANY COMPUTES EARNINGS PER SHARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 260, \u201cEARNINGS PER SHARE\u201d.  UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 260, BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY  DIVIDING THE NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD.  THERE WERE NO POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE  PERIOD.  INCOME TAXES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR INCOME TAXES AS OUTLINED IN ASC 740, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d. UNDER THE ASSET  AND LIABILITY METHOD OF ASC 740, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR  RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE YEAR IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  ASC 820, \u201cFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\u201d (ASC 820) AND ASC 825, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u201d (ASC 825),  REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS WHEN MEASURING FAIR VALUE. IT ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF INDEPENDENT, OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE SURROUNDING THE INPUTS  USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE. A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT'S CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT. IT PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS INTO THREE LEVELS THAT MAY BE  USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE.  LEVEL 1 - LEVEL 1 APPLIES TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THERE ARE QUOTED PRICES IN  ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2 - LEVEL 2 APPLIES TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THERE ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN  QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY SUCH AS QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS WITH INSUFFICIENT VOLUME OR INFREQUENT TRANSACTIONS  (LESS ACTIVE MARKETS); OR MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM, OR CORROBORATED BY, OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.  LEVEL 3 - LEVEL 3 APPLIES TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THERE ARE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS TO  THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  THE CARRYING VALUES OF CASH, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR  VALUE. PURSUANT TO ASC 820 AND 825, THE FAIR VALUE OF CASH IS DETERMINED BASED ON \"LEVEL 1\" INPUTS, WHICH CONSIST OF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS. THE RECORDED VALUES OF ALL OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR  CURRENT FAIR VALUES BECAUSE OF THEIR NATURE AND RESPECTIVE MATURITY DATES OR DURATIONS.  6  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JANUARY 2017, FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-01, \"BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (TOPIC 805) - CLARIFYING THE DEFINITION  OF A BUSINESS\". THE BOARD IS ISSUING THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU TO CLARIFY THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ADDING GUIDANCE TO ASSIST ENTITIES WITH EVALUATING WHETHER TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS ACQUISITIONS (OR  DISPOSALS) OF ASSETS OR BUSINESSES.  THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS AFFECTS MANY AREAS OF ACCOUNTING INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSALS, GOODWILL, AND CONSOLIDATION. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU AFFECT ALL REPORTING ENTITIES THAT MUST DETERMINE WHETHER  THEY HAVE ACQUIRED OR SOLD A BUSINESS.  PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES SHOULD APPLY THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU TO ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE PERIODS. HOWEVER, EARLY APPLICATION OF THE  AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU IF 1) FOR TRANSACTIONS FOR WHICH THE ACQUISITION DATE OCCURS BEFORE THE ISSUANCE DATE OR EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENTS, ONLY WHEN THE TRANSACTION HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED OR MADE  AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE, OR 2) FOR  TRANSACTIONS  IN WHICH A SUBSIDIARY IS DECONSOLIDATED OR A GROUP OF ASSETS IS DERECOGNIZED THAT OCCUR BEFORE THE ISSUANCE DATE OR EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AMENDMENTS, ONLY WHEN THE TRANSACTION HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED  IN  FINANCIALS. THE COMPANY WILL EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS NEW STANDARD ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WHEN THE ACQUISITION PLAN IS EXECUTED IN FUTURE.  IN MAY 10, 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-09, COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718) - SCOPE OF  MODIFICATION. ASU 2017-09 CLARIFIES WHEN TO ACCOUNT FOR A CHANGE TO THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF A SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARD AS A MODIFICATION. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING IS REQUIRED ONLY IF THE FAIR VALUE, THE VESTING  CONDITIONS, OR THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE AWARD (AS EQUITY OR LIABILITY) CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN TERMS OR CONDITIONS. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CHANGE TO THE TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF THE AWARD REQUIRES MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING, THE  EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF GAAP ASSOCIATED WITH MODIFICATIONS, SUCH AS EARNINGS PER SHARE, CONTINUE TO APPLY. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY FOR ALL COMPANIES FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 15,  2017. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW STANDARD HAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UPON ADOPTION.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) RELEASED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO.  118 (THE \u201cBULLETIN\u201d), WHICH PROVIDES ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE REGARDING ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT. THE BULLETIN PROVIDES GUIDANCE IN THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN  INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT WILL BE INCOMPLETE BY THE TIME FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE. FOR THOSE ELEMENTS OF THE TAX ACT THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY THE SEC HAS PROVIDED IN THE  BULLETIN THAT IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE ACCOUNTING IS INCOMPLETE FOR CERTAIN EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT, A MEASUREMENT PERIOD WHICH BEGINS IN THE REPORTING PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT AND ENDS WHEN THE ENTITY HAS OBTAINED, PREPARED  AND ANALYZED THE INFORMATION IS NEEDED IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS. THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD SHALL NOT EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM ENACTMENT. ESTIMATED, NO EFFECT WILL BE RECORDED. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW  STANDARDS HAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK -  CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\u201d, WHICH CHANGES THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 820. THIS UPDATE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THIS GUIDANCE AND THE IMPACT OF THIS UPDATE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  MANAGEMENT  DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED, BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, IF ADOPTED, WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  PURCHASE OF FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT  THERE WERE NO PURCHASES OF COMPUTERS AND ANY OTHER EQUIPMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "ASTIKA HOLDINGS INC.", "CIK": 1511161, "Date": "2019-05-10T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ASKH", "Name": "Astika Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 3652.0, "Business": "FL", "Incorporated": "FL", "IRS": 274601693.0, "key": "20190510ASKH", "labelr1": 24.48979591836734, "labelr2": -22.786885245901637, "labelr3": 6.157112526539277, "labelr4": 9.999999999999996, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.9036794, "prof1": 0.09632067, "return1&2": 0.9271662763466042, "return1&2&3": 0.8700796054038197, "return1&2&3&4": 0.7830716448634377, "return2": 1.2278688524590162, "return1": 0.7551020408163266, "return3": 0.9384288747346072, "return4": 0.9, "4_day_return": 12.244897959183664, "cumulative_return1": 0.10814648285823368, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0017211337056563009, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.7889338429000844e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.361451543271907e-07, "indexx": 2352, "cumreturn1b": 0.9450628980170944, "cumreturndow": 0.9588743089638958, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9578837279886186}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2355, "level_0": 2380, "index": 4868, "text": "ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE \u201cSELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\u201d AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS MAY CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE CERTAIN RISKS, ASSUMPTIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IMPLIED OR DESCRIBED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  FUTURE RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS FOR MANY REASONS, INCLUDING THE FACTORS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, AS WELL AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN FUTURE REPORTS FILED WITH THE SEC.  GENERAL  WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION OF WELL-RECOGNIZED, BRAND NAME OTC HEALTHCARE AND, PRIOR TO THE SALE OF OUR HOUSEHOLD CLEANING SEGMENT ON JULY 2, 2018, HOUSEHOLD CLEANING PRODUCTS TO MASS MERCHANDISERS AND DRUG, FOOD, DOLLAR, CONVENIENCE AND CLUB STORES, AND ECOMMERCE CHANNELS IN NORTH AMERICA (THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA) AND IN AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  WE USE THE STRENGTH OF OUR BRANDS, OUR ESTABLISHED RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, A LOW-COST OPERATING MODEL AND OUR EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM TO CREATE OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  WE HAVE GROWN OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.  WE DEVELOP OUR EXISTING BRANDS BY INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT LINES, BRAND EXTENSIONS AND STRONG ADVERTISING SUPPORT.  ACQUISITIONS OF OTC BRANDS HAVE ALSO BEEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY.  WE HAVE ACQUIRED STRONG AND WELL-RECOGNIZED BRANDS FROM CONSUMER PRODUCTS, PHARMACEUTICAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY COMPANIES.  WHILE CERTAIN OF THESE BRANDS HAVE LONG HISTORIES OF BRAND DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT, WE BELIEVE THAT, AT THE TIME WE ACQUIRED THEM, MOST WERE CONSIDERED \u201cNON-CORE\u201d BY THEIR PREVIOUS OWNERS.  AS A RESULT, THESE ACQUIRED BRANDS DID NOT BENEFIT FROM ADEQUATE MANAGEMENT FOCUS AND MARKETING SUPPORT DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO THEIR ACQUISITION, WHICH CREATED OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO REINVIGORATE THESE BRANDS AND IMPROVE THEIR PERFORMANCE POST-ACQUISITION.  AFTER ADDING A CORE BRAND TO OUR PORTFOLIO, WE SEEK TO INCREASE ITS SALES, MARKET SHARE AND DISTRIBUTION IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW CHANNELS THROUGH OUR ESTABLISHED RETAIL DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.  WE PURSUE THIS GROWTH THROUGH INCREASED SPENDING ON ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL SUPPORT, NEW SALES AND MARKETING STRATEGIES, IMPROVED PACKAGING AND FORMULATIONS AND INNOVATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF BRAND EXTENSIONS.  TAX REFORM  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"TAX ACT\").  THE TAX ACT REPRESENTED SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL TAX REFORM LEGISLATION INCLUDING A PERMANENT REDUCTION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE.  THE PERMANENT REDUCTION TO THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE RESULTED IN A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF  $267.0 MILLION  RELATED TO THE VALUE OF OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND A BENEFIT OF  $3.2 MILLION  RELATED TO THE LOWER BLENDED TAX RATE ON OUR EARNINGS, IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RESULTING IN A NET BENEFIT OF  $270.2 MILLION  .  ADDITIONALLY, THE TAX ACT SUBJECTS CERTAIN OF OUR CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS TO U.S. INCOME TAXES THROUGH A DEEMED REPATRIATION, WHICH RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF  $1.9 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES  ON JULY 2, 2018, WE SOLD THE COMET\u00ae, SPIC AND SPAN\u00ae, CHORE BOY\u00ae, CHLORINOL\u00ae AND CINCH\u00ae BRANDS, AS WELL AS ASSOCIATED INVENTORY.  THESE BRANDS REPRESENTED OUR HOUSEHOLD CLEANING SEGMENT.  AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON SALE OF  $1.3 MILLION.  ON JANUARY 26, 2017, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF FLEET PURSUANT TO A MERGER AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF DECEMBER 22, 2016, FOR  $823.7 MILLION  .  THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS FUNDED BY AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"2012 ABL REVOLVER\"), AND A NEW  $740.0 MILLION  SENIOR SECURED INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN UNDER OUR EXISTING TERM LOAN FACILITY (THE \"2012 TERM LOAN\").  AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, WE ACQUIRED WOMEN'S HEALTH, GASTROINTESTINAL AND DERMATOLOGICAL CARE OTC BRANDS, INCLUDING  SUMMER\u2019S EVE  ,  FLEET  , AND  BOUDREAUX'S BUTT PASTE  , AS WELL AS A \u201cMIX AND FILL\u201d MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA.  THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM THE FLEET  ACQUISITION ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENTS.  ON JULY 7, 2016, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE PEDIACARE\u00ae  ,  NEW SKIN\u00ae  AND  FIBER CHOICE\u00ae BRANDS FOR  $40.0 MILLION  PLUS THE COST OF INVENTORY.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX LOSS ON SALE OF  $56.2 MILLION  .  CONCURRENT WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE SALE OF THESE BRANDS, WE ENTERED INTO AN OPTION AGREEMENT WITH THE BUYER TO PURCHASE DERMOPLAST\u00ae AT A SPECIFIED EARNINGS MULTIPLE AS DEFINED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT.  THE BUYER PAID A  $1.25 MILLION  DEPOSIT FOR THIS OPTION IN SEPTEMBER 2016 AND LATER NOTIFIED US OF ITS ELECTION TO EXERCISE THE OPTION.  IN DECEMBER 2016, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE DERMOPLAST\u00ae  BRAND, AND IN A SEPARATE TRANSACTION, THE E.P.T\u00ae  BRAND, FOR AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF  $59.6 MILLION  .  AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NET GAIN ON THESE DIVESTITURES OF  $3.9 MILLION.  33  HISTORICALLY, WE RECEIVED ROYALTY INCOME FROM THE LICENSING OF THE NAMES OF CERTAIN OF OUR BRANDS IN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR MARKETS IN WHICH WE DO NOT DIRECTLY COMPETE. WE HAD ROYALTY AGREEMENTS FOR THE COMET\u00ae BRAND FOR SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH INCLUDED OPTIONS ON BEHALF OF THE LICENSEE TO PURCHASE LICENSE RIGHTS IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND MARKETS IN PERPETUITY. IN DECEMBER 2014, WE AMENDED THOSE AGREEMENTS, AND WE SOLD RIGHTS TO USE OF THE COMET\u00ae BRAND IN CERTAIN EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO A THIRD PARTY LICENSEE IN EXCHANGE FOR  $10.0 MILLION  AS A PARTIAL EARLY BUYOUT OF THE LICENSE. THE AMENDED AGREEMENT PROVIDED THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO RECEIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS OF  $1.0 MILLION  PER QUARTER FOR THE REMAINING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND ALSO GRANTED THE LICENSEE AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE THE LICENSE RIGHTS IN THE REMAINING GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ANY TIME AFTER JUNE 30, 2016. IN JULY 2016, THE LICENSEE ELECTED TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION. IN AUGUST 2016, WE RECEIVED  $11.0 MILLION  FOR THE PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING LICENSE RIGHTS AND, AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX GAIN OF  $1.2 MILLION  AND REDUCED OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADENAMES BY  $9.0 MILLION  . FURTHERMORE, THE LICENSEE WAS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS TO US, AND AS A RESULT, OUR ROYALTY INCOME WAS REDUCED ACCORDINGLY.  WE SOLD THE COMET\u00ae BRAND ON JULY 2, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  WHILE ALL SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES MAY BE VIEWED AS BEING CRITICAL.  SUCH POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT ARE BOTH MOST IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE OUR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES OR THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  THE FOLLOWING ARE OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.  REVENUE RECOGNITION, CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND VARIABLE CONSIDERATION  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF A PROMISED GOOD IS TRANSFERRED TO A CUSTOMER, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THAT GOOD.  THIS OCCURS EITHER WHEN FINISHED GOODS ARE TRANSFERRED TO A COMMON CARRIER FOR DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER OR WHEN PRODUCT IS PICKED UP BY THE CUSTOMER OR THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CARRIER.  ONCE A PRODUCT HAS TRANSFERRED TO THE COMMON CARRIER OR BEEN PICKED UP BY THE CUSTOMER, THE CUSTOMER IS ABLE TO DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM, THE PRODUCT. IT IS AT THIS POINT THAT WE HAVE A RIGHT TO PAYMENT AND THE CUSTOMER HAS LEGAL TITLE.  PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN REBATES, CUSTOMER PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS, PRODUCT RETURNS, AND DISCOUNTS TO CUSTOMERS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AND RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN SALES.  WE RECORD AN ESTIMATE OF FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS, CHARGEBACKS AND LOGISTIC DEDUCTIONS CONCURRENT WITH RECORDING SALES, WHICH IS MADE USING THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD WHICH INCORPORATES (I) HISTORICAL RETURN RATES, (II) CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, (III) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND, (IV) PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE, (V) SEASONALITY OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AND (VI) THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN PRODUCT FORMULATION, PACKAGING AND ADVERTISING.  WE PARTICIPATE IN THE PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO ENHANCE THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS.  THESE PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS CONSIST OF DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER INCENTIVES, SUCH AS COUPONS AND TEMPORARY PRICE REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS INCENTIVES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, SUCH AS ALLOWANCES FOR NEW DISTRIBUTION, INCLUDING SLOTTING FEES, AND COOPERATIVE ADVERTISING. THE COSTS OF SUCH ACTIVITIES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE RELATED SALE TAKES PLACE.  ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS OF THESE PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS ARE DERIVED USING THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD, WHICH INCORPORATES (I) HISTORICAL SALES EXPERIENCE, (II) THE CURRENT PROMOTIONAL OFFERING, (III) FORECASTED DATA, (IV) CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND (V) COMMUNICATION WITH CUSTOMER PURCHASING/MARKETING PERSONNEL.  AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROMOTIONAL PROGRAM, THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED TO ACTUAL RESULTS.  PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND EXPENSE  CERTAIN EMPLOYEES OF FLEET ARE COVERED BY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S POLICY IS TO CONTRIBUTE AT LEAST THE MINIMUM AMOUNT REQUIRED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\"ERISA\"). THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS.  BENEFITS ARE BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND LEVELS OF COMPENSATION.  ON DECEMBER 16, 2014, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO FREEZE THE BENEFITS UNDER THE COMPANY'S U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 1, 2015.  OUR DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FOR OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS CHANGED TO A RANGE OF  3.80% TO 3.99%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM A RANGE OF  3.93% TO 4.07%  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  . WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE A CHANGE IN OUR FISCAL  2020  ASSUMPTIONS, AS A SENSITIVITY MEASURE, A 0.25% DECLINE OR INCREASE IN OUR QUALIFIED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR QUALIFIED PENSION EXPENSE BY  34  LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION. SIMILARLY, A 0.25% DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THE EXPECTED RETURN ON OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS WOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR QUALIFIED PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION.  THE AMOUNTS THAT WE RECOGNIZE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BY ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS.  INHERENT IN THESE VALUATIONS ARE CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS, THE MORE SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE:  (I) THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE USED FOR DISCOUNTING THE LIABILITY, (II) THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS, (III) THE METHOD USED TO DETERMINE THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS, AND (IV) THE ANTICIPATED MORTALITY RATE TABLES.  WE BELIEVE THE CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND PENSION EXPENSE ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  HOWEVER, AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGE, WE MAY CHANGE SOME OF OUR ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING RETURNS ON INVESTED ASSETS AND THE LEVEL OF CERTAIN MARKET INTEREST RATES. WE REVIEW PENSION ASSUMPTIONS REGULARLY AND WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS THAT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED BY STATUTE. DURING FISCAL  2019  , WE MADE TOTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS OF  $1.4 MILLION  .  WE EXPECT TO MAKE A CONTRIBUTION OF $1.0 MILLION TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN DURING FISCAL  2020  .  CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE SECURITIES HELD BY THE PLANS COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE, POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY, THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS AND AFFECT THE LEVEL OF PENSION EXPENSE AND REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMOUNTED TO  $3,085.8 MILLION  AND  $3,401.0 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE APPORTIONED AMONG SIMILAR PRODUCT GROUPS WITHIN OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS.  MARCH 31, 2019  (IN THOUSANDS)  NORTH AMERICAN OTC  HEALTHCARE  INTERNATIONAL OTC  HEALTHCARE  HOUSEHOLD  CLEANING  CONSOLIDATED  GOODWILL  $547,393  $31,190  $\u2014  $578,583  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  2,195,617  77,574  \u2014  2,273,191  FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  228,743  5,276  \u2014  234,019  TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  2,424,360  82,850  \u2014  2,507,210  TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  $2,971,753  $114,040  $\u2014  $3,085,793  MARCH 31, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  NORTH AMERICAN OTC  HEALTHCARE  INTERNATIONAL OTC  HEALTHCARE  HOUSEHOLD  CLEANING  CONSOLIDATED  GOODWILL  $580,934  $32,919  $6,245  $620,098  TOTAL INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  2,375,736  84,006  30,561  2,490,303  TOTAL FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  265,356  6,068  19,189  290,613  TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  2,641,092  90,074  49,750  2,780,916  TOTAL GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET  $3,222,026  $122,993  $55,995  $3,401,014  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  THE BRANDS WITH THE HIGHEST CARRYING VALUE WERE  MONISTAT, SUMMER'S EVE, BC/GOODY'S, DENTEK AND FLEET  , COMPRISING 61.8% OF OUR TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS VALUE.  35  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS COMPRISE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS.  GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS GENERALLY REPRESENT OUR TRADENAMES, BRAND NAMES AND PATENTS.  WHEN WE ACQUIRE A BRAND, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO THE ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS WELL AS THEIR RESPECTIVE USEFUL LIVES.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS MANY FACTORS BOTH PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE ACQUISITION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IN DETERMINING THE VALUE, AS WELL AS THE USEFUL LIFE, ASSIGNED TO EACH INTANGIBLE ASSET THAT WE ACQUIRE OR CONTINUE TO OWN AND PROMOTE.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS ARE.  \u2022  BRAND HISTORY  A BRAND THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME (E.G., 25, 50 OR 100 YEARS) GENERALLY WARRANTS A HIGHER VALUATION AND LONGER LIFE (SOMETIMES INDEFINITE) THAN A BRAND THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  A BRAND THAT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME GENERALLY HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CONSIDERABLE INVESTMENT BY ITS PREVIOUS OWNER(S) TO SUPPORT PRODUCT INNOVATION AND ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION.  \u2022  MARKET POSITION  CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT RANK NUMBER ONE OR TWO IN THEIR RESPECTIVE MARKET GENERALLY HAVE GREATER NAME RECOGNITION AND ARE KNOWN AS QUALITY PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH WARRANT A HIGHER VALUATION AND LONGER LIFE THAN PRODUCTS THAT LAG IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  RECENT AND PROJECTED SALES GROWTH  RECENT SALES RESULTS PRESENT A SNAPSHOT AS TO HOW THE BRAND HAS PERFORMED IN THE MOST RECENT TIME PERIODS AND REPRESENT ANOTHER FACTOR IN THE DETERMINATION OF BRAND VALUE.  IN ADDITION, PROJECTED SALES GROWTH PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND POTENTIAL LONGEVITY OF THE BRAND.  A BRAND THAT HAS BOTH STRONG CURRENT AND PROJECTED SALES GENERALLY WARRANTS A HIGHER VALUATION AND A LONGER LIFE THAN A BRAND THAT HAS WEAK OR DECLINING SALES.  SIMILARLY, CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE POTENTIAL INVESTMENT, IN THE FORM OF ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION, REQUIRED TO REINVIGORATE A BRAND THAT HAS FALLEN FROM FAVOR.  \u2022  HISTORY OF AND POTENTIAL FOR PRODUCT EXTENSIONS  CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO THE PRODUCT INNOVATION THAT HAS OCCURRED DURING THE BRAND\u2019S HISTORY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUED PRODUCT INNOVATION THAT WILL DETERMINE THE BRAND\u2019S FUTURE.  BRANDS THAT CAN BE CONTINUALLY ENHANCED BY NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS GENERALLY WARRANT A HIGHER VALUATION AND LONGER LIFE THAN A BRAND THAT HAS ALWAYS \u201cFOLLOWED THE LEADER\u201d.  AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, MANAGEMENT PREPARES A DETERMINATION OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET\u2019S VALUE AND USEFUL LIFE BASED ON ITS ANALYSIS.  UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES, GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT MUST BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BELOW THE CARRYING AMOUNT.  IN A SIMILAR MANNER, INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT AMORTIZED.  THEY ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.  ADDITIONALLY, AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD AN EVALUATION MUST BE MADE TO DETERMINE WHETHER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT AN INDEFINITE USEFUL LIFE.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR RESPECTIVE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND MUST ALSO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE AND EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, DURING THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER, CONCURRENT WITH OUR ANNUAL STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF CONDITIONS INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERED, MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A REVIEW OF BOTH THE VALUES AND, IF APPLICABLE, USEFUL LIVES ASSIGNED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND TESTS FOR IMPAIRMENT.  WE CURRENTLY REPORT GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE AND INTERNATIONAL OTC HEALTHCARE.  WE SOLD OUR HOUSEHOLD CLEANING SEGMENT ON JULY 2, 2018; SEE ABOVE UNDER \"ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\" FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WE IDENTIFY OUR REPORTING UNITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FASB ASC SUBTOPIC 280.  THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL FOR A REPORTING UNIT ARE CALCULATED BASED ON KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATION METHODOLOGIES PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED.  AS A RESULT, ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THESE ASSUMPTIONS COULD REQUIRE US TO RECORD ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT IN THE FUTURE.  IN THE PAST, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY OF CERTAIN BRANDS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENT.  SUSTAINED OR SIGNIFICANT FUTURE DECLINES IN REVENUE, PROFITABILITY, OTHER ADVERSE CHANGES IN EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS, AND/OR UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS USED TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN BRANDS COULD INDICATE THAT FAIR VALUE NO LONGER EXCEEDS CARRYING VALUE, IN WHICH CASE ADDITIONAL NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE NORTH AMERICAN WOMEN'S HEALTH REPORTING UNIT, AND ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT TRADENAMES WITHIN THIS REPORTING UNIT, HAD FAIR VALUES THAT EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUES BY LESS THAN 10%.  36  GOODWILL  GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IMPAIRMENT MAY HAVE OCCURRED.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT REVIEW DATE, AND  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD 15 REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL.  AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL TEST FOR IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ESTIMATE THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES.  IN PERFORMING THIS ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS CURRENT INFORMATION AND FUTURE EVENTS, SUCH AS COMPETITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND CHANGES IN ADVERTISING SUPPORT FOR OUR TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES THAT COULD CAUSE SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS.  AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE.  THE DISCOUNT RATE UTILIZED IN THE ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MAY BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND RATES OF INFLATION.  ADDITIONALLY, SHOULD THE RELATED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF DECLINING SALES OR MARGINS CAUSED BY COMPETITION, CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES OR CHANGES IN ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FUTURE.  IN ADDITION, WE CONSIDERED OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, TO ASSESS THE REASONABLENESS OF OUR ESTIMATES PURSUANT TO THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY.  AT FEBRUARY 28,  2019  , IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ANNUAL TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $33.5 MILLION  RELATING TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN ORAL CARE REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS PART OF THE NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENT.  THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF THE  DENTEK  AND  EFFERDENT/EFFERGRIP  TRADENAME IMPAIRMENTS DISCUSSED BELOW.  AS A RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, ALL OTHER REPORTING UNITS TESTED HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE BY AT LEAST 10% WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NORTH AMERICAN WOMEN'S HEALTH REPORTING UNIT.  WE PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS ON OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND DETERMINED THAT A 50 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL WOULD NOT HAVE RESULTED IN ANY OF OUR OTHER REPORTING UNIT\u2019S IMPLIED FAIR VALUE BEING LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  ADDITIONALLY, A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE TERMINAL GROWTH RATE USED FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT WOULD ALSO NOT HAVE RESULTED IN ANY OF OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS\u2019 IMPLIED FAIR VALUE BEING LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHENEVER EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT IMPAIRMENT MAY HAVE OCCURRED.  WE UTILIZE THE EXCESS EARNINGS METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INDIVIDUAL INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE DISCOUNT RATE UTILIZED IN THE ANALYSIS, AS WELL AS FUTURE CASH FLOWS, MAY BE INFLUENCED BY SUCH FACTORS AS CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND RATES OF INFLATION.  AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD, MANAGEMENT ANALYZES CURRENT EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INDEFINITE LIFE CLASSIFICATION FOR A TRADEMARK OR TRADENAME CONTINUES TO BE VALID.  IF CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT A CHANGE TO A FINITE LIFE, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WOULD THEN BE AMORTIZED PROSPECTIVELY OVER THE ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE.  MANAGEMENT TESTS THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  SINCE QUOTED MARKET PRICES ARE SELDOM AVAILABLE FOR TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES SUCH AS OURS, WE UTILIZE PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE.  ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT\u2019S PROJECTIONS ARE UTILIZED TO ASSIMILATE ALL OF THE FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE TRADEMARK OR TRADENAME AND ESTIMATE THE CASH FLOWS OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO GOODWILL, FUTURE EVENTS, SUCH AS COMPETITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND CHANGES IN ADVERTISING SUPPORT FOR OUR TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES, COULD CAUSE SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS.  ONCE THAT ANALYSIS IS COMPLETED, A DISCOUNT RATE IS APPLIED TO THE CASH FLOWS TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE.  IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ANALYSIS, MANAGEMENT.  \u2022  REVIEWS PERIOD-TO-PERIOD SALES AND PROFITABILITY BY BRAND;  \u2022  ANALYZES INDUSTRY TRENDS AND PROJECTS BRAND GROWTH RATES;  \u2022  PREPARES ANNUAL SALES FORECASTS;  \u2022  EVALUATES ADVERTISING EFFECTIVENESS;  \u2022  ANALYZES GROSS MARGINS;  \u2022  REVIEWS CONTRACTUAL BENEFITS OR LIMITATIONS;  \u2022  MONITORS COMPETITORS\u2019 ADVERTISING SPEND AND PRODUCT INNOVATION;  \u2022  PREPARES PROJECTIONS TO MEASURE BRAND VIABILITY OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET; AND  \u2022  CONSIDERS THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL AS INDUSTRY LITIGATION.  37  AS A RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE FAIR VALUES OF THREE OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS,  FLEET  ,  DENTEK  AND  EFFERDENT/EFFERGRIP,  DID NOT EXCEED THE CARRYING VALUES AND AS SUCH, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $155.0 MILLION  WERE RECORDED.  IN ADDITION, IN CONNECTION WITH THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, THE  EFFERDENT  /  EFFERGRIP  INTANGIBLE ASSET WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE A FINITE LIFE, AND AS SUCH IT WILL BE AMORTIZED PROSPECTIVELY OVER ITS ESTIMATED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF 15 YEARS AS WE BELIEVE THIS LIFE BEST REFLECTS THE PERIOD OVER WHICH WE BELIEVE THIS BRAND WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR CASH FLOWS. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE THE RESULT OF OUR REASSESSMENT OF THE LONG-TERM SALES PROJECTIONS FOR THESE BRANDS DURING OUR ANNUAL PLANNING CYCLE AS WELL AS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE THE BRANDS.  WE PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL AND WE DETERMINED THAT A 50 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL USED TO VALUE THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF $17.4 MILLION.  ADDITIONALLY, A 50 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE TERMINAL GROWTH RATE USED FOR EACH OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT OF $8.9 MILLION.  THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IMPAIRED ARE ALL PART OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENT.  FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A REVIEW SIMILAR TO INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND CARRYING VALUES OF OUR TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES.  IF THE ANALYSIS WARRANTS A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET, MANAGEMENT WILL REDUCE THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE AND AMORTIZE THE CARRYING VALUE PROSPECTIVELY OVER THE SHORTER REMAINING USEFUL LIFE.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PROJECTIONS ARE UTILIZED TO ASSIMILATE ALL OF THE FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES AND EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO THE TRADEMARK OR TRADENAME AND ESTIMATE THE CASH FLOWS OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.  FUTURE EVENTS, SUCH AS COMPETITION, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND CHANGES IN ADVERTISING SUPPORT FOR OUR TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES, COULD CAUSE SUBSEQUENT EVALUATIONS TO UTILIZE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS.  IN THE EVENT THAT THE LONG-TERM PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE IS IN EXCESS OF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.  ONCE THAT ANALYSIS IS COMPLETED, A DISCOUNT RATE IS APPLIED TO THE CASH FLOWS TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE.  THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS MEASURED AS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET OVER FAIR VALUE, AS CALCULATED USING THE EXCESS EARNINGS METHOD.  AS A RESULT OF OUR ANALYSIS AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF SEVERAL OF OUR NON-CORE FINITE-LIVED TRADEMARKS DID NOT EXCEED THEIR CARRYING VALUES, AND AS SUCH, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $41.0 MILLION  WERE RECORDED.  THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE THE RESULT OF OUR REASSESSMENT OF THE LONG-TERM SALES PROJECTIONS FOR THE ASSOCIATED BRANDS DURING OUR ANNUAL PLANNING CYCLE, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES THE DISCONTINUANCE OF NON-CORE BRANDS, AS WELL AS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE THE BRANDS.  THE FINITE-LIVED TRADEMARKS IMPAIRED ARE ALL PART OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENT.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPENSATION AND EQUITY TOPIC OF THE FASB ASC 718 REQUIRES US TO MEASURE THE COST OF SERVICES TO BE RENDERED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY AWARD.  COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD DURING WHICH AN EMPLOYEE IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE AWARD, GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.  INFORMATION UTILIZED IN THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  TYPE OF INSTRUMENT (I.E., RESTRICTED SHARES, STOCK OPTIONS, WARRANTS OR PERFORMANCE SHARES);  \u2022  STRIKE PRICE OF THE INSTRUMENT;  \u2022  MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT;  \u2022  DISCOUNT RATES;  \u2022  DURATION OF THE INSTRUMENT; AND  \u2022  VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE PUBLIC MARKET.  ADDITIONALLY, MANAGEMENT MUST ESTIMATE THE EXPECTED ATTRITION RATE OF THE RECIPIENTS TO ENABLE IT TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECORDED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WHILE MANAGEMENT PREPARES VARIOUS ANALYSES TO ESTIMATE THE RESPECTIVE VARIABLES, A CHANGE IN ASSUMPTIONS OR MARKET CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED ATTRITION RATES, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FUTURE AMOUNTS RECORDED AS NON-CASH COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  A DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8, NOTE 1 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT.  38  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  2019  COMPARED TO  2018  TOTAL SEGMENT REVENUES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS TOTAL REVENUE BY SEGMENT, INCLUDING PRODUCT GROUPS, FOR EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018.

E.P.T\u00ae WAS INCLUDED IN THE WOMEN'S HEALTH PRODUCT GROUP, WHILE DERMOPLAST\u00ae WAS INCLUDED IN THE DERMATOLOGICALS PRODUCT GROUP.

IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ON OUR  MASSENGILL  FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE TRADENAME OF $0.6 MILLION BRINGING ITS CARRYING VALUE TO ZERO.  THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE THE RESULT OF OUR REASSESSMENT OF THE LONG-TERM SALES PROJECTIONS FOR THESE BRANDS DURING OUR ANNUAL PLANNING CYCLE.  BEANO  AND  MASSENGILL  ARE PART OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN OTC HEALTHCARE SEGMENT AND  COMET\u00ae  WAS PART OF OUR HOUSEHOLD CLEANING SEGMENT PRIOR TO ITS SALE ON JULY 2, 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $106.3 MILLION  DURING 2018 VERSUS  $93.5 MILLION  DURING 2017.  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER BORROWINGS DUE TO THE FLEET  ACQUISITION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST RATES. THE AVERAGE INDEBTEDNESS OUTSTANDING INCREASED FROM $1.7 BILLION DURING 2017 TO $2.1 BILLION DURING 2018.  THE AVERAGE COST OF BORROWING DECREASED TO 5.0% FOR 2018 FROM 5.6% FOR 2017.  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT  DURING 2018, WE RECORDED A $2.9 MILLION LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, WHICH CONSISTED OF DEFERRED FINANCING FEES WE WROTE OFF PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PREPAYMENT OF OUR 2012 TERM LOAN.  DURING 2017, WE RECORDED A $1.4 MILLION LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, WHICH CONSISTED OF DEFERRED FINANCING FEES WE WROTE OFF PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE 2017 REFINANCINGS.  INCOME TAXES  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE TAX ACT.  THE TAX ACT REPRESENTED SIGNIFICANT U.S. FEDERAL TAX REFORM LEGISLATION THAT INCLUDED A PERMANENT REDUCTION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE.  THE PERMANENT REDUCTION TO THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE RESULTED IN A ONE-TIME GAIN OF  $267.0 MILLION  RELATED TO THE VALUE OF OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES  44  AND A GAIN OF  $3.2 MILLION  RELATED TO THE LOWER BLENDED TAX RATE ON OUR EARNINGS, IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RESULTING IN A NET GAIN OF  $270.2 MILLION  .  ADDITIONALLY, THE TAX ACT SUBJECTS CERTAIN OF OUR CUMULATIVE FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS TO U.S. INCOME TAXES THROUGH A DEEMED REPATRIATION, WHICH RESULTED IN A CHARGE OF  $1.9 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THE PROVISION/BENEFIT FOR INCOME TAXES DURING 2018 WAS A BENEFIT OF $232.5 MILLION VERSUS A PROVISION OF $41.5 MILLION IN 2017.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS (217.1)% DURING 2018 VERSUS 37.4% DURING 2017.  THE CHANGE IN THE PROVISION/BENEFIT FOR 2018 VERSUS 2017 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX ACT DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF CASH COMES FROM OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS.  IN THE PAST, WE HAVE SUPPLEMENTED THIS SOURCE OF CASH WITH VARIOUS DEBT FACILITIES, PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS.  WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WITH A COMBINATION OF FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS.  OUR PRINCIPAL USES OF CASH ARE FOR OPERATING EXPENSES, DEBT SERVICE, SHARE REPURCHASE, AND ACQUISITIONS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT LEVELS OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THROUGH THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN IN THIS REGARD.

REVENUES INCREASED IN 2019 AND 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET GROWTH, INCLUDING EXPANDED BUSINESS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSS OF CUSTOMERS WITHIN OUR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL AND SPECIALTY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR 2018 WAS ALSO OFFSET BY THE 2017 CONTRIBUTION OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR MCKESSON TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES (\u201cCORE MTS BUSINESS\u201d) TO FORM THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE. MARKET GROWTH INCLUDES GROWING DRUG UTILIZATION, PRICE INCREASES AND NEWLY LAUNCHED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE DEFLATION ASSOCIATED WITH BRAND TO GENERIC DRUG CONVERSION.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN INCREASED IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018. GROSS PROFIT INCREASED DUE TO MARKET GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSS OF CUSTOMERS.  THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2019 WAS ALSO DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF NET CASH PROCEEDS REPRESENTING OUR SHARE OF ANTITRUST LEGAL SETTLEMENTS OF $202 MILLION, HIGHER LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cLIFO\u201d) CREDITS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  THESE INCREASES IN 2019 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREMENTAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cU.K.\u201d), GOVERNMENT IMPOSED GENERIC PRICE CUTS IN CANADA AND THE 2018 THIRD QUARTER SALE OF OUR ENTERPRISE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS (\u201cEIS\u201d) BUSINESS.  GROSS PROFIT AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2017 CONTRIBUTION OF THE CORE MTS BUSINESS TO THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE, SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN THE U.K., THE COMPETITIVE SELL-SIDE ENVIRONMENT AND WEAKER PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURER PRICING TRENDS.  THESE DECREASES IN 2018 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARKET GROWTH, PROCUREMENT BENEFITS REALIZED THROUGH THE JOINT SOURCING ENTITY, CLARUSONE SOURCING SERVICES LLP (\u201cCLARUSONE\u201d), HIGHER LIFO CREDITS AND OUR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  GROSS PROFIT FOR 2019, 2018 AND 2017 INCLUDED LIFO CREDITS OF  $210 MILLION  , $99 MILLION AND $7 MILLION. GROSS PROFIT FOR 2017 BENEFITED FROM $144 MILLION OF CASH RECEIPTS REPRESENTING OUR SHARE OF ANTITRUST LEGAL SETTLEMENTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OPERATING EXPENSES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED IN 2019 AND 2018.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WERE AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS.  2019  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $1,776 MILLION  (  $1,756 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) IN OUR CONSUMER SOLUTIONS (\u201cCS\u201d) AND PHARMACY SOLUTIONS (\u201cPS\u201d) REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. OF THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES,  $238 MILLION  WAS RECOGNIZED UPON THE 2019 FIRST QUARTER SEGMENT CHANGES, WHICH RESULTED IN TWO NEW REPORTING UNITS.  THE REMAINING CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE SELECTION OF HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE DECLINES IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WITHIN THE U.K. THE RISK OF SUCCESSFULLY ACHIEVING CERTAIN BUSINESS INITIATIVES WAS THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN THE USE OF A HIGHER DISCOUNT RATE.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, BOTH CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS HAD NO REMAINING GOODWILL BALANCES;  \u2022  PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $331 MILLION  (  $273 MILLION  AFTER-TAX), PRIMARILY REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND EXIT-RELATED COSTS RELATED TO THE 2019 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW;  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $245 MILLION ($207 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY FOR OUR U.K. BUSINESS (MAINLY PHARMACY LICENSES) DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN THE U.K.;  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  \u2022  HIGHER OPIOID-RELATED COSTS OF $151 MILLION ($122 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY RELATED TO LITIGATION EXPENSES.

THERE WERE NO TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR EUROPE WERE TRIGGERED PRIMARILY BY GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS IN THE U.K. AND A MORE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN FRANCE. THE IMPAIRMENTS FOR REXALL HEALTH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT GENERICS REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS ACROSS CANADA AND MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES IN MULTIPLE PROVINCES.  AT MARCH 31, 2018, THE REXALL HEALTH REPORTING UNIT HAD NO REMAINING GOODWILL RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF REXALL HEALTH;  \u2022  NON-CASH PRE-TAX LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $446 MILLION  (  $410 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINES IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN OUR EUROPEAN BUSINESS INCLUDING THOSE DECLINES IN OUR U.K. RETAIL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT REDUCTIONS;  \u2022  PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $74 MILLION ($67 MILLION AFTER-TAX) PRIMARILY REPRESENTING EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND LEASE EXIT COSTS RELATED TO THE 2018 RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR OUR MCKESSON EUROPE BUSINESS.

THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTS.  AS A RESULT OF THE 2019 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCLUDING THE CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  HOWEVER, OTHER RISKS, EXPENSES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, INCREASED REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY MARKET ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AS OF THE TESTING DATE MAY REQUIRE US TO FURTHER REVISE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR MCKESSON CANADA REPORTING UNIT IN OTHER IN FUTURE PERIODS.  FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES  ON APRIL 25, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC GROWTH INITIATIVE INTENDED TO DRIVE LONG-TERM INCREMENTAL PROFIT GROWTH AND INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.

ESTIMATED REMAINING CHARGES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF LEASE AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS, EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND RELOCATION EXPENSES.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY COMMITTED TO ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATING MODEL AND COST OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT CENTRALIZATION OF CERTAIN FUNCTIONS AND OUTSOURCING THROUGH THE EXPANDED ARRANGEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.  THE PROGRAMS ALSO INCLUDE REORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND RELATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS AS WELL AS THE FURTHER CLOSURES OF RETAIL PHARMACY STORES IN EUROPE AND FACILITIES.

FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR REPORTED INCOME TAX RATES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE IMPACT OF NONDEDUCTIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND VARYING PROPORTIONS OF INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE INCOME TAX RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE U.S. RATE.  OUR REPORTED INCOME TAX EXPENSE RATE FOR 2019 WAS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY NON-CASH PRE-TAX CHARGES OF  $1,776 MILLION  (  $1,756 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) TO IMPAIR THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL FOR OUR EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, GIVEN THAT THESE CHARGES ARE GENERALLY NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 2, \u201cGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES,\u201d TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX PROVISION AND EVALUATING INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.  ALTHOUGH OUR MAJOR TAXING JURISDICTIONS INCLUDE THE U.S., CANADA AND THE U.K., WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND UNCERTAIN TAX LIABILITIES REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MADE ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.  ON JULY 24, 2018, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED AN OPINION IN ALTERA CORP. V. COMMISSIONER REQUIRING RELATED PARTIES IN AN INTERCOMPANY COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENT TO SHARE EXPENSES RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THIS OPINION REVERSED THE PRIOR DECISION OF THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT. ON AUGUST 7, 2018, THE OPINION WAS WITHDRAWN AND A REHEARING OF THE CASE TOOK PLACE ON OCTOBER 16, 2018. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS CASE AND THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  INCOME (LOSS) FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAX.

FOREIGN OPERATIONS  OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 18%, 18% AND 17% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  .  FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  WE MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND ADOPT STRATEGIES RESPONSIVE TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS WORLDWIDE IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INCLUDING EURO, BRITISH POUND STERLING AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS CAN BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  IN DISCUSSING OUR OPERATING RESULTS, WE MAY USE THE TERM \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT\u201d, WHICH REFERS TO THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED TO CONVERT THE LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR.  WE PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HOW OUR BUSINESS PERFORMED EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  IN COMPUTING FOREIGN CURRENCY EFFECT, WE TRANSLATE OUR CURRENT YEAR RESULTS IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S DOLLARS BY APPLYING AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OF THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, AND WE SUBSEQUENTLY COMPARE THOSE RESULTS TO THE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS IN U.S. DOLLARS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  WE CONSIDER AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE CRITICAL IF THE ESTIMATE REQUIRES US TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT WERE UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE WAS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT WE REASONABLY COULD HAVE USED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS.

OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN FINANCIAL NOTE 1, \u201cSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.  WE PROVIDE SHORT-TERM CREDIT AND OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING PRIMARILY RELATES TO GUARANTEES PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OR THEIR CREDITORS, REGARDING THE REPURCHASE OF INVENTORIES.  WE ALSO PROVIDE FINANCING TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF PHARMACIES, WHICH SERVE AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANS.  WE ESTIMATE THE RECEIVABLES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT EXPECT FULL COLLECTION BASED ON HISTORICAL COLLECTION RATES AND SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE CURRENT CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND RECORD AN ALLOWANCE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THESE AMOUNTS.  IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH INCLUDES GENERAL AND SPECIFIC RESERVES, THE COMPANY REVIEWS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AGING, INDUSTRY TRENDS, CUSTOMER FINANCIAL STRENGTH, CREDIT STANDING, HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF TRENDS AND PAYMENT HISTORY TO ASSESS THE PROBABILITY OF COLLECTION.  IF THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CUSTOMER DEFAULTS DUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION OR GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGE, OUR ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT.  AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR OUTSTANDING RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CUSTOMER FINANCING AND ADJUST ALLOWANCES FOR ACCOUNTS WHERE COLLECTION MAY BE IN DOUBT.  DURING  2019  , SALES TO OUR  TEN  LARGEST CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING GROUP PURCHASING ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cGPOS\u201d) ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  49.9%  OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.  SALES TO OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER, CVS HEALTH (\u201cCVS\u201d), ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY  19.4%  OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES.  AT MARCH 31,  2019  , TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM OUR  TEN  LARGEST CUSTOMERS WERE APPROXIMATELY  31.9%  OF TOTAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM  CVS  WERE APPROXIMATELY  18.4%  OF TOTAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  AS A RESULT, OUR SALES AND CREDIT CONCENTRATION IS SIGNIFICANT.  WE ALSO HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH GPOS, EACH OF WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A PURCHASING AGENT ON BEHALF OF MEMBER HOSPITALS, PHARMACIES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, AS WELL AS WITH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND AGENCIES.  THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES BALANCES ARE WITH INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS OF THE GPOS, AND THEREFORE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK EXISTS.  A MATERIAL DEFAULT IN PAYMENT, A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN PURCHASES FROM THESE OR ANY OTHER LARGE CUSTOMERS, OR THE LOSS OF A LARGE CUSTOMER OR GPO COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY.  RESERVE METHODOLOGIES ARE ASSESSED ANNUALLY BASED ON HISTORICAL LOSSES AND ECONOMIC, BUSINESS AND MARKET TRENDS.  IN ADDITION, RESERVES ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY AND UPDATED IF UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR TRENDS ARE PRESENT.  WE BELIEVE THE RESERVES MAINTAINED AND EXPENSES RECORDED IN  2019  ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL METHODOLOGIES EMPLOYED.  AT THIS TIME, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY INTERNAL PROCESS OR CUSTOMER ISSUES THAT MIGHT LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  AT MARCH 31,  2019  , TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WERE $15,329 MILLION PRIOR TO ALLOWANCES OF $273 MILLION.  IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , OUR PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS WAS  $132 MILLION  ,  $44 MILLION  AND  $93 MILLION  .  AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  , THE ALLOWANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WAS 1.8% AND 1.3%.  AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF A HYPOTHETICAL 0.1% IN THE  2019  ALLOWANCE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TRADE AND NOTES RECEIVABLES WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION.  THE SELECTED 0.1% HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT COULD BE CONSIDERED THE BEST OR WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MAY BE FOUND IN SCHEDULE II INCLUDED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  INVENTORIES.  INVENTORIES CONSIST OF MERCHANDISE HELD FOR RESALE.  PRIOR TO 2018, WE REPORTED INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET (\u201cLCM\u201d). EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPORT INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE, EXCEPT FOR INVENTORIES DETERMINED USING THE LIFO METHOD.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF DOMESTIC INVENTORIES IS DETERMINED USING THE LIFO METHOD.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COST OF INVENTORIES HELD IN FOREIGN LOCATIONS IS BASED ON FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE PURCHASE PRICES.  REBATES, CASH DISCOUNTS AND OTHER INCENTIVES RECEIVED FROM VENDORS RELATING TO THE PURCHASE OR DISTRIBUTION OF INVENTORY ARE CONSIDERED AS PRODUCT DISCOUNTS AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF INVENTORY AND ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE INVENTORY IS SOLD.  TOTAL INVENTORIES, NET WERE  $16,709 MILLION  AND  $16,310 MILLION  AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018.  THE LIFO METHOD WAS USED TO VALUE APPROXIMATELY  62%  AND  63%  OF OUR INVENTORIES AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  IF WE HAD USED THE MOVING AVERAGE METHOD OF INVENTORY VALUATION, INVENTORIES WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY  $696 MILLION  AND  $906 MILLION  HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  THESE AMOUNTS ARE EQUIVALENT TO OUR LIFO RESERVES.  OUR LIFO VALUATION AMOUNT INCLUDES BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  WE RECOGNIZED LIFO CREDITS OF  $210 MILLION  ,  $99 MILLION  AND  $7 MILLION  IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017 WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  A LIFO CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE NET EFFECT OF PRICE INCREASES ON PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HELD IN INVENTORY EXCEEDS THE IMPACT OF PRICE DECLINES, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF BRANDED PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS THAT HAVE LOST MARKET EXCLUSIVITY.  A LIFO CREDIT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE NET EFFECT OF PRICE DECLINES EXCEEDS THE IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ON PHARMACEUTICAL AND NON-PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS HELD IN INVENTORY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  WE BELIEVE THAT MOVING AVERAGE INVENTORY COSTING METHOD PROVIDES A REASONABLE ESTIMATION OF THE CURRENT COST OF REPLACING INVENTORY (I.E., \u201cMARKET\u201d).  AS SUCH, OUR LIFO INVENTORY IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF LIFO OR MARKET.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, INVENTORIES AT LIFO DID NOT EXCEED MARKET.  IN DETERMINING WHETHER INVENTORY VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS REQUIRED, WE CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING ESTIMATED QUANTITIES OF SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY BY REVIEWING ON-HAND QUANTITIES, OUTSTANDING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND FORECASTED SALES.  SHIFTS IN MARKET TRENDS AND CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN CUSTOMER PREFERENCES DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF GENERIC DRUGS OR NEW PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS OR THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS ARE FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR INVENTORIES.  WE WRITE DOWN INVENTORIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED EXCESS AND OBSOLETE AS A RESULT OF THESE REVIEWS.  THESE FACTORS COULD MAKE OUR ESTIMATES OF INVENTORY VALUATION DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES USING THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WHICH REQUIRES THAT ONCE CONTROL OF A BUSINESS IS OBTAINED, 100% OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, BE RECORDED AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION AT THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES.  ANY EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENSES AND RELATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  SEVERAL VALUATION METHODS MAY BE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED.  FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE TYPICALLY USE A METHOD BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH.  METHODS UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH START WITH A FORECAST OF ALL OF THE EXPECTED FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ASSET.  THESE CASH FLOWS ARE THEN ADJUSTED TO PRESENT VALUE BY APPLYING AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE THAT REFLECTS THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CASH FLOW STREAMS.  SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN METHODS BASED ON THE INCOME APPROACH INCLUDE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE DISCOUNT RATE SELECTED TO MEASURE THE RISKS INHERENT IN THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE ASSET\u2019S LIFE CYCLE AND THE COMPETITIVE TRENDS IMPACTING THE ASSET, INCLUDING CONSIDERATION OF ANY TECHNICAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR ECONOMIC BARRIERS TO ENTRY.  DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ALSO REQUIRES JUDGMENT AS DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL HAVE DIFFERENT USEFUL LIVES.  REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 4, \u201cBUSINESS COMBINATIONS,\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ACQUISITIONS.  GOODWILL AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  AS A RESULT OF ACQUIRING BUSINESSES, WE HAVE  $9,358 MILLION  AND  $10,924 MILLION  OF GOODWILL AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  ,  $3,689 MILLION  AND  $4,102 MILLION  OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET AT MARCH 31,  2019  AND  2018  .  WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON GOODWILL BALANCES ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF INDICATORS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST.  INDICATORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXPECTED OPERATING RESULTS, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE ASSETS, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS, OR A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND/OR MARKET CAPITALIZATION FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS CONDUCTED AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WHICH IS GENERALLY DEFINED AS AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR A COMPONENT, ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND SEGMENT MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THAT REPORTING UNIT.  IN 2018, WE ELECTED TO EARLY ADOPT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS, THE AMENDED GUIDANCE THAT SIMPLIFIES GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING BY ELIMINATING THE SECOND STEP OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST. THE ONE-STEP IMPAIRMENT TEST UNDER THE AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES AN ENTITY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE, IF ANY.  TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A COMBINATION OF THE MARKET APPROACH AND THE INCOME APPROACH.  UNDER THE MARKET APPROACH, WE ESTIMATE FAIR VALUE BY COMPARING THE BUSINESS TO SIMILAR BUSINESSES, OR GUIDELINE COMPANIES WHOSE SECURITIES ARE ACTIVELY TRADED IN PUBLIC MARKETS.  UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, WE USE A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (\u201cDCF\u201d) MODEL IN WHICH CASH FLOWS ANTICIPATED OVER SEVERAL PERIODS, PLUS A TERMINAL VALUE AT THE END OF THAT TIME HORIZON, ARE DISCOUNTED TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING AN APPROPRIATE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN.  IN ADDITION, WE COMPARE THE AGGREGATE OF THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 FAIR VALUES TO OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION AS FURTHER CORROBORATION OF THE FAIR VALUES.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE RESULT FROM A COMPLEX SERIES OF JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AT A POINT IN TIME. JUDGMENTS MADE IN DETERMINING AN ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE VALUATIONS ARE BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW DATE AND ARE BASED ON EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DEEMED REASONABLE BY MANAGEMENT. ANY MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING FAILURE TO MEET BUSINESS PLANS, NEGATIVE CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REIMBURSEMENT RATES, DETERIORATION IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS, AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES OR AN INCREASE IN THE COST OF EQUITY FINANCING BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY OR OTHER UNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, MAY DECREASE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OR INCREASE THE DISCOUNT RATES AND COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INHERENT IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ESTIMATION PROCESS USING THE MARKET APPROACH INCLUDE THE SELECTION OF APPROPRIATE GUIDELINE COMPANIES, THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE MULTIPLES FOR BOTH THE GUIDELINE COMPANIES AND THE REPORTING UNIT, THE DETERMINATION OF APPLICABLE PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS BASED ON ANY DIFFERENCES IN MARKETABILITY BETWEEN THE BUSINESS AND THE GUIDELINE COMPANIES AND FOR THE INCOME APPROACH, THE REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN USED IN THE DCF METHOD, WHICH REFLECTS CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE SPECIFIC RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUSINESS.  UNDER THE INCOME APPROACH, THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES IN THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTING OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REPORTING UNITS.  THE DISCOUNT RATES ARE THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL MEASURING THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S COST OF DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING WEIGHTED BY THE PERCENTAGE OF DEBT AND PERCENTAGE OF EQUITY IN A COMPANY\u2019S TARGET CAPITAL. THE UNSYSTEMATIC RISK PREMIUM IS AN INPUT FACTOR USED IN CALCULATING DISCOUNT RATE THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE REPORTING UNITS\u2019 FUTURE CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. INCREASES IN THE UNSYSTEMATIC RISK PREMIUM INCREASE THE DISCOUNT RATE.  AS A RESULT OF THE 2019 ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS EXCLUDING THE CS AND PS REPORTING UNITS EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING VALUE.  HOWEVER, OTHER RISKS, EXPENSES AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, INCREASED REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND MATERIAL CHANGES IN KEY MARKET ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE WERE UNABLE TO ANTICIPATE AS OF THE TESTING DATE MAY REQUIRE US TO FURTHER REVISE THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR OTHER REPORTING UNITS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR MCKESSON CANADA REPORTING UNIT WITHIN OTHER EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS REPORTING UNIT BY 8% IN 2019.  THE GOODWILL BALANCE OF THIS REPORTING UNIT WAS $1,444 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 OR APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE CONSOLIDATED GOODWILL BALANCE. GENERALLY, A DECLINE IN ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS IN EXCESS OF 12% OR AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE IN EXCESS OF 1.0% COULD RESULT IN AN INDICATION OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR THIS REPORTING UNIT IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS. REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 2, \u201cGOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  CURRENTLY, ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE AND OTHER LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OR DEPRECIATED BASED ON THE PATTERN OF THEIR ECONOMIC CONSUMPTION OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, RANGING FROM ONE TO 38 YEARS.  WE REVIEW INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AT AN ASSET GROUP LEVEL WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  DETERMINATION OF RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF IDENTIFIABLE ESTIMATED FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS RESULTING FROM USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION.  MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.  ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE VALUES AND REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE.  THEY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUR INTERNAL FORECASTS.  OUR ONGOING CONSIDERATION OF ALL THE FACTORS DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY COULD RESULT IN FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET INCOME. REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 3, \u201cRESTRUCTURING AND ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  WE HAVE CERTAIN RESTRUCTURING RESERVES WHICH REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATED TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS TO BE INCURRED WHEN THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TAKE PLACE. WE GENERALLY RECOGNIZE EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE COSTS WHEN PAYMENTS ARE PROBABLE AND AMOUNTS ARE ESTIMABLE. COSTS RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITHOUT FUTURE BENEFIT OR CONTRACT TERMINATION ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE EARLIER OF THE CONTRACT TERMINATION OR THE CEASE-USE DATES. OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WE ALSO ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS USED IN THE BUSINESS, AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY RECOGNIZE ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION REFLECTING SHORTENED USEFUL LIVES OF THE UNDERLYING ASSETS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  SUPPLIER RESERVES.  WE ESTABLISH RESERVES AGAINST AMOUNTS DUE FROM SUPPLIERS RELATING TO VARIOUS PRICE AND REBATE INCENTIVES, INCLUDING DEDUCTIONS OR BILLINGS TAKEN AGAINST PAYMENTS OTHERWISE DUE TO THEM.  THESE RESERVE ESTIMATES ARE ESTABLISHED BASED ON JUDGMENT AFTER CONSIDERING THE STATUS OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING CLAIMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE SUPPLIERS, THE SPECIFIC INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND ANY OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE.  WE EVALUATE THE AMOUNTS DUE FROM SUPPLIERS ON A CONTINUAL BASIS AND ADJUST THE RESERVE ESTIMATES WHEN APPROPRIATE BASED ON CHANGES IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE FINAL OUTCOME OF ANY OUTSTANDING CLAIMS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATE.  THE SUPPLIER RESERVES PRIMARILY PERTAIN TO OUR U.S. PHARMACEUTICAL AND SPECIALTY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT.  INCOME TAXES.  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX PROVISION AND IN EVALUATING INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES.  WE REVIEW OUR TAX POSITIONS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER AND ADJUST THE BALANCES AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.  DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE INCLUDING OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF CUMULATIVE NET OPERATING LOSSES IN THE MOST RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  IN ESTIMATING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WE DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRE-TAX OPERATING INCOME, THE REVERSAL OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEASIBLE AND PRUDENT TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT ABOUT THE FORECASTS OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES WE USE TO MANAGE THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES.  CHANGES IN TAX LAWS AND RATES COULD ALSO AFFECT RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FUTURE.  SHOULD TAX LAWS CHANGE, INCLUDING THOSE LAWS PERTAINING TO LIFO, OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.  IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INCLUDES ESTIMATES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX NEW TAX REGULATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE GLOBAL JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE CONDUCT OUR OPERATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE NEW TAX LEGISLATION REFERRED TO AS THE 2017 TAX ACT. THE 2017 TAX ACT MADE BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE.  REFER TO FINANCIAL NOTE 10, \u201cINCOME TAXES,\u201d TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\u2010K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE RECOGNIZE LIABILITIES FOR TAX AND RELATED INTEREST FOR ISSUES IN THE U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND RELATED INTEREST WILL BE DUE.  IF OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF TAX AND INTEREST LIABILITIES IS LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT, AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY RESULT.  IF OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF TAX AND INTEREST LIABILITIES IS MORE THAN THE ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT, A REDUCTION TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY BE RECOGNIZED.  LOSS CONTINGENCIES.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS WITH CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS, PENDING AND POTENTIAL LEGAL ACTIONS FOR DAMAGES, INVESTIGATIONS RELATING TO GOVERNMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS.  WHEN A LOSS IS CONSIDERED PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF OUR BEST ESTIMATE FOR THE ULTIMATE LOSS.  HOWEVER, THE LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR CONTINGENCY IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND DETERMINING A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS OR A RANGE OF LOSS MAY NOT BE PRACTICABLE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FUTURE EVENTS AND DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES THAT WILL DETERMINE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THE CONTINGENCY.  MOREOVER, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE RESOLVED OVER MANY YEARS, DURING WHICH TIME RELEVANT DEVELOPMENTS AND NEW INFORMATION MUST BE REEVALUATED AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD OF POTENTIAL LOSS AND WHETHER IT IS POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE A RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS.  WHEN A MATERIAL LOSS IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE OR PROBABLE BUT A REASONABLE ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE, DISCLOSURE OF THE PROCEEDING IS PROVIDED.  WE REVIEW ALL CONTINGENCIES AT LEAST QUARTERLY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS HAS CHANGED AND TO ASSESS WHETHER A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE POTENTIAL LOSS OR RANGE OF THE LOSS CAN BE MADE.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, DEVELOPMENT OF A MEANINGFUL ESTIMATE OF LOSS OR A RANGE OF POTENTIAL LOSS IS COMPLEX WHEN THE OUTCOME IS DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH OR DECISIONS BY THIRD PARTIES, SUCH AS REGULATORY AGENCIES, THE COURT SYSTEM AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT OUR AVAILABLE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, TOGETHER WITH OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE MAY ACCESS THE LONG-TERM DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS FROM TIME TO TIME.  NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $4,036 MILLION  IN  2019  COMPARED TO  $4,345 MILLION  IN  2018  AND $4,744 MILLION  IN  2017  . OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN RECEIVABLES DUE TO OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME AND TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2018 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY A DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND LOSS OF CUSTOMERS AND INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE REFLECTING LONGER PAYMENT TERMS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 WERE PRIMARILY AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE REFLECTING LONGER PAYMENT TERMS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES AND INCREASES IN RECEIVABLES PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR REVENUE GROWTH. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY FACTORS SUCH AS THE TIMING OF RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. ADDITIONALLY, WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF SALES AND PURCHASE VOLUMES, INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS AND VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDED CASH GENERATED FROM OUR CORE MTS BUSINESS. OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 WERE ALSO AFFECTED BY  $150 MILLION  OF A SETTLEMENT PAYMENT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1,381 MILLION  IN  2019  COMPARED TO  $2,993 MILLION  IN  2018  AND  $3,269 MILLION  IN  2017  .  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 INCLUDE  $905 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING  $784 MILLION  FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF MSD,  $426 MILLION  AND  $131 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, AND  $101 MILLION  OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDED  $4,212 MILLION  OF NET CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING  $2.1 BILLION  FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF REXALL HEALTH,  $1,226 MILLION  OF NET PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON THE HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY NET ASSET EXCHANGE,  $404 MILLION  AND  $158 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE, AND  $206 MILLION  OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES UTILIZED  $2,227 MILLION  ,  $3,084 MILLION  AND  $2,069 MILLION  OF CASH IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  .  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2019 INCLUDE CASH RECEIPTS OF  $37,265 MILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF  $37,268 MILLION  FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL PAPER).  WE RECEIVED CASH FROM LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES OF  $1,099 MILLION  AND MADE REPAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $1,112 MILLION  IN 2019.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2018 ALSO INCLUDE  $1,650 MILLION  OF CASH PAID FOR STOCK REPURCHASES  $262 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID AND  $112 MILLION  OF PAYMENTS FOR DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR 2017 INCLUDE CASH RECEIPTS OF  $8,294 MILLION  AND PAYMENTS OF  $8,124 MILLION  FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE RECEIVED CASH FROM LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES OF  $1,824 MILLION  AND MADE REPAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $1,601 MILLION  IN 2017. FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN 2017 ALSO INCLUDE  $2,250 MILLION  OF CASH PAID FOR STOCK REPURCHASES AND  $253 MILLION  OF DIVIDENDS PAID.  THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF MCKESSON\u2019S COMMON STOCK FROM TIME-TO-TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE (\u201cASR\u201d) PROGRAMS, OR BY ANY COMBINATION OF SUCH METHODS.  THE TIMING OF ANY REPURCHASES AND THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES REPURCHASED WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS UNDER OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  IN 2017, WE REPURCHASED  14.1 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND  1.4 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH AN ASR PROGRAM.  WE RECEIVED  0.3 MILLION  ADDITIONAL SHARES IN APRIL 2017 FOR THE 2017 ASR PROGRAM.  IN 2018, WE REPURCHASED  3.5 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND 6.7 MILLION OF OUR SHARES THROUGH ASR PROGRAMS. WE RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL  1.0 MILLION  SHARES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 UNDER THE MARCH 2018 ASR PROGRAM. IN 2019, WE REPURCHASED  10.4 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AND  2.1 MILLION  OF OUR SHARES THROUGH THE DECEMBER 2018 ASR PROGRAM.  IN 2019, WE RETIRED  5.0 MILLION  OR  $542 MILLION  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TREASURY SHARES PREVIOUSLY REPURCHASED. UNDER THE APPLICABLE STATE LAW, THESE SHARES RESUME THE STATUS OF AUTHORIZED AND UNISSUED SHARES UPON RETIREMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY, WE ALLOCATE ANY EXCESS OF SHARE REPURCHASE PRICE OVER PAR VALUE BETWEEN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AND RETAINED EARNINGS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RETAINED EARNINGS AND ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL WERE REDUCED BY  $472 MILLION  AND  $70 MILLION  DURING 2019.

THE TOTAL AUTHORIZATION OUTSTANDING FOR REPURCHASE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK WAS  $3.5 BILLION  AT MARCH 31, 2019.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CURRENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS, INCLUDING OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL GIVE US THE ABILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCING NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CONTINUED OR INCREASED VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WILL NOT IMPAIR OUR LIQUIDITY OR INCREASE OUR COSTS OF BORROWING.

CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE.  CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE PRIMARILY INVESTED IN AAA RATED PRIME AND U.S. GOVERNMENT MONEY MARKET FUNDS DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, OVERNIGHT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS COLLATERALIZED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT SECURITIES AND/OR SECURITIES THAT ARE GUARANTEED OR SPONSORED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AN AAA RATED PRIME MONEY MARKET FUND DENOMINATED IN BRITISH POUND STERLING.  THE REMAINING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE DEPOSITED WITH SEVERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE MITIGATE THE RISK OF OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO BY DEPOSITING FUNDS WITH REPUTABLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MONITORING RISK PROFILES AND INVESTMENT STRATEGIES OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $1,450 MILLION OF CASH HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. OUR PRIMARY INTENT IS TO UTILIZE THIS CASH FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME. ALTHOUGH THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IS AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION, DOING SO COULD SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES AND STATE INCOME TAXES.  FOLLOWING ENACTMENT OF THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE REPATRIATION OF CASH TO THE UNITED STATES IS GENERALLY NO LONGER TAXABLE FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY INCLUDES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES NET OF DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO LARGE VARIATIONS DURING THE YEAR AS A RESULT OF INVENTORY PURCHASE PATTERNS AND SEASONAL DEMANDS.  INVENTORY PURCHASE ACTIVITY IS A FUNCTION OF SALES ACTIVITY AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.  CONSOLIDATED WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED AT MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, INVENTORIES AND A DECREASE IN CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A INCREASE IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  CONSOLIDATED WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED AT MARCH 31, 2018 COMPARED TO MARCH 31, 2017 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN DRAFTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND A DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES.  OUR DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO INCREASED FOR 2019 AND 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  IN JULY 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S QUARTERLY DIVIDEND WAS RAISED FROM  $0.34  TO  $0.39  PER COMMON SHARE FOR DIVIDENDS DECLARED ON OR AFTER SUCH DATE BY THE BOARD.  DIVIDENDS WERE  $1.51  PER SHARE IN  2019  ,  $1.30  PER SHARE IN  2018  AND  $1.12  PER SHARE IN  2017  .  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO PAY QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, THE PAYMENT AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS REMAIN WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD AND WILL DEPEND UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  IN  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , WE PAID TOTAL CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $292 MILLION  ,  $262 MILLION  AND $253 MILLION  .  ADDITIONALLY, AS REQUIRED UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY AN ANNUAL RECURRING COMPENSATION AMOUNT OF \u20ac0.83 PER MCKESSON EUROPE SHARE (EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2015) TO THE NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OF MCKESSON EUROPE.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE TABLE AND INFORMATION BELOW PRESENTS OUR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AT MARCH 31,  2019  .

(2)  INCLUDES OUR ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS, INCLUDING ASSUMED EXECUTIVE LUMP SUM PAYMENTS, FOR THE UNFUNDED BENEFIT PLANS AND MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS.  ACTUAL LUMP SUM PAYMENTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF EXECUTIVE RETIREMENTS AND THE LUMP SUM INTEREST RATE IN EFFECT UPON RETIREMENT.  THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT PAYMENTS DO NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THE TERMINATION OF THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN APPROVED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON MAY 23, 2018.  (3)  PRIMARILY REPRESENTS INTEREST THAT WILL BECOME DUE ON OUR FIXED RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  (4)  A PURCHASE OBLIGATION IS DEFINED AS AN ARRANGEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY.  THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY RELATE TO INVENTORY PURCHASES AND CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.  (5)  REPRESENTS MINIMUM RENTAL PAYMENTS FOR OPERATING LEASES.  (6)  INCLUDES AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE REPURCHASE OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INVENTORY AND OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 DEBT IN THE EVENT THESE CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO THOSE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TABLE ABOVE EXCLUDES THE FOLLOWING OBLIGATIONS.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE LIABILITY RECORDED FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, EXCLUDING ASSOCIATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES, WAS APPROXIMATELY  $810 MILLION  . THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY RELATED FUTURE CASH SETTLEMENTS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MCKESSON CORPORATION  FINANCIAL REVIEW (CONTINUED)  DURING 2019, WE RENEGOTIATED THE TERMS OF THE TRA WHICH RESULTED IN THE EXTINGUISHMENT AND DERECOGNITION OF THE  $90 MILLION  NONCURRENT LIABILITY.  IN EXCHANGE FOR THE SHAREHOLDERS OF CHANGE AGREEING TO EXTINGUISH THE LIABILITY, WE AGREED TO AN ALLOCATION OF CERTAIN TAX AMORTIZATION THAT HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF A DISTRIBUTION FROM THE CHANGE HEALTHCARE JOINT VENTURE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO BE MADE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF CHANGE.  AS A RESULT OF THE RENEGOTIATION, MCKESSON WAS RELIEVED FROM ANY POTENTIAL FUTURE OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NONCURRENT LIABILITY AND RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX CREDIT OF  $90 MILLION  (  $66 MILLION  AFTER-TAX) IN OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN 2019.  OUR BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE ISSUED  $165 MILLION  OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY BONDS AT MARCH 31, 2019.  THESE WERE ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF AND ARE MOSTLY RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND TO MEET THE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS FOR STATUTORY LICENSES AND PERMITS, COURT AND FIDUCIARY OBLIGATIONS AND OUR WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND AUTOMOTIVE LIABILITY PROGRAMS.  THE CARRYING VALUE OF REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS RELATED TO MCKESSON EUROPE WAS  $1.39 BILLION  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WHICH EXCEEDED THE MAXIMUM REDEMPTION VALUE OF  $1.23 BILLION  .  THE BALANCE OF REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS REPORTED AT THE GREATER OF ITS CARRYING VALUE OR ITS MAXIMUM REDEMPTION VALUE AT EACH REPORTING DATE.  UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT ON DECEMBER 2, 2014, THE NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OF MCKESSON EUROPE RECEIVED A PUT RIGHT THAT ENABLES THEM TO PUT THEIR MCKESSON EUROPE SHARES TO MCKESSON AT \u20ac22.99 PER SHARE, WHICH PRICE IS INCREASED ANNUALLY FOR INTEREST IN THE AMOUNT OF 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS ABOVE A BASE RATE PUBLISHED SEMIANNUALLY BY THE GERMAN BUNDESBANK, LESS ANY COMPENSATION AMOUNT OR GUARANTEED DIVIDEND ALREADY PAID (\u201cPUT AMOUNT\u201d).  THE REDEMPTION VALUE IS THE PUT AMOUNT ADJUSTED FOR EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS EACH PERIOD.  THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO THE PUT AMOUNT ARE UNCERTAIN. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY AN ANNUAL RECURRING COMPENSATION OF \u20ac0.83 PER MCKESSON EUROPE SHARE (THE \u201cCOMPENSATION AMOUNT\u201d) TO THE NONCONTROLLING SHAREHOLDERS OF MCKESSON EUROPE UNDER THE DOMINATION AGREEMENT.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATION  (A) PLAN OF OPERATION & LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN PROFITABLE AND SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN MARCH 1999 HAS HAD NO REVENUE UNTIL THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. IN APRIL, 2018, THE BOARD ADOPTED A NEW BUSINESS PLAN FOCUSSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE BUSINESSES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF SMALL INVESTMENT FUNDING AND A RANGE OF TECHNICAL AND ADVISORY BUSINESS SERVICES. IN ORDER TO FUND THE NEW BUSINESS PLAN, THE COMPANY CONVERTED $320,000 OF RELATED PARTY DEBT AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND RAISED $1,770,000 IN CASH FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENT UNITS UNDER THE TERMS OF A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERED TO ACCREDITED INVESTORS.  THE COMPANY HAS CREATED A PORTFOLIO OF MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN EARLY-STAGE START-UP COMPANIES AND DERIVES ITS REVENUE OPPORTUNITY FROM THE SALE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS. SUCH SALES ARE OUTSIDE ITS CONTROL AND DEPEND ON M&A TRANSACTIONS WHICH MAY RESULT IN CASH OR EQUITY PROCEEDS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS $388,000 IN THE BANK AND EXPECTS TO SECURE AN ADDITIONAL $300,000 WITHIN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS AS A FINAL CALL ON SALES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK UNITS, AS THE MARKETING OF A $3 MILLION HIGHER-VALUED SERIES B ROUND IS COMMENCED WITH A TARGET CLOSE DATE OF OCTOBER 2019. THE AVERAGE MONTHLY EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $22,000 PER MONTH SO THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT CASH TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF ITS FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 IF IT SIMPLY MANAGES ITS EXISTING INVESTMENTS. HOWEVER, IT PLANS TO RAMP UP MONTHLY EXPENDITURE TO AN AVERAGE OF $48,000 PER MONTH TO MARKET AND ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THE SERIES B ROUND, WHEREUPON, IF SUCCESSFUL IT WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR FURTHER INVESTMENTS AND ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE SERIES B CLOSE IS DELAYED, MANAGEMENT HAS TWO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS TO ENSURE CONTINUITY OF LIQUIDITY AND ONGOING OPERATIONS: THE ABILITY TO SLOW DOWN EXPENDITURE OR DEFER FUTURE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO BALANCE ITS CASH FLOW ACCORDINGLY.  (B) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE: THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE EMERGENCE OF LIQUIDITY SITUATIONS TO REALIZE ITS INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES BUT DOES NOT HAVE ANY ABILITY TO INFLUENCE SUCH EVENTS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THERE WERE NO LIQUIDATION TRANSACTIONS AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANY DID NOT GENERATE ANY REVENUE FROM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES ADVISORY SERVICES TO CERTAIN OF ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES AND DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $9,000 REVENUE FROM ADVISORY FEES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES: GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL FEES INCURRED IN THE COURSE OF SEC FILING AND COMPLIANCE, AND TRAVEL AND CONFERENCE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH FUND RAISING AND REVIEW OF INVESTMENT DEAL-FLOW. THE COMPANY INCURRED EXPENSES OF $239,082 AND $90,827 IN THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE OF 163% REFLECTS THE INCREASED LEVEL OF NEW BUSINESS ACTIVITY AS THE COMPANY RAISED FUNDING FROM PRIVATE PLACEMENTS, AND RESEARCHED AND EVALUATED INVESTMENT CANDIDATES DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LOSS WAS $230,107 AND $90,827, RESPECTIVELY.  5  (C) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WORKING CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY HAD A WORKING CAPITAL SURPLUS OF $65,684 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $(316,956) AS OF MARCH 31, 2018. CASH WAS $93,634 AND $4 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH OUTFLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $205,225 AND $31,319, RESPECTIVELY.  CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $1,796,903 AND $31,323, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RAISED $1,770,000 FROM PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF PREFERRED INVESTMENT UNITS FROM ACCREDITED INVESTORS.  THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED A NEW BUSINESS PLAN TO ASSIST EARLY STAGE TECHNOLOGY AND LIFE SCIENCE COMPANIES BY LEVERAGING ITS NETWORK OF EXPERIENCED INDUSTRY SPECIALISTS TO PROVIDE A COMBINATION OF PROFESSIONAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND INVESTMENT, AND THEREBY ACCELERATE THEIR DEVELOPMENT.

PERIODS PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED UNDER LEGACY GUIDANCE AND THERE WAS NO CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS ON THE MARCH 1, 2018 ADOPTION DATE. ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION, WE RECORDED OPERATING LEASE RIGHT OF USE ASSETS OF $42.1 MILLION AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF $42.8 MILLION TO REFLECT OUR PORTFOLIO OF OPERATING LEASES, WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNRECORDED UNDER LEGACY ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE ANY IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME OR CASH FLOWS. WE HAVE ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE NEW STANDARD, WHICH AMONG SEVERAL OTHER ITEMS, ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO CARRY-FORWARD THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION FROM LEGACY GUIDANCE FOR LEASES THAT EXISTED ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE RECORDED NET SALES OF  $927.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $810.4 MILLION  . OF THE TOTAL NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  52.5%  OF OUR NET SALES WERE GENERATED FROM THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND APPROXIMATELY  47.5%  WERE GENERATED FROM THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. NET INCOME FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $51.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $45.2 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . NET INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS  5.5%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  5.6%  FOR FISCAL  2018  .

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING IMPROVED TURNAROUNDS IN THE U.S. REFINERY MARKET, INCREASED INTERNATIONAL PROJECTS AND AN UPTICK IN OUR ELECTRICAL BUSINESS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 AND FISCAL 2018 BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE NUCLEAR MARKET, WHICH IS DUE IN PART TO THE WESTINGHOUSE BANKRUPTCY DISCUSSED BELOW.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, WHICH CONSISTED OF FORTY-TWO METAL COATING FACILITIES AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, GENERATED NET SALES OF  $440.3 MILLION  , A  13.1%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $389.4 MILLION  . THE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF HIGHER SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER VOLUMES OF STEEL PROCESSED DURING THE PERIODS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR FISCAL 2018 ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATING INCOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).  ENERGY  $31,332  $(1,766  )  METAL COATINGS  83,591  84,332  CORPORATE  (37,967  )  (34,318  )  TOTAL OPERATING INCOME  $76,956  $48,248  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE ENERGY SEGMENT INCREASED  $33.1 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2019  , TO  $31.3 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF  $1.8 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . OPERATING MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT WERE  6.4%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  (0.4)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE POSITIVE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PROJECT MARGINS. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.5 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN COST OF SALES, RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS RETIRED AND A PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $2.9 MILLION, CLASSIFIED WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE, RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION RELATED TO CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. NO SUCH CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT DECREASED  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  0.9%  , FOR FISCAL  2019  TO  $83.6 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $84.3 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING MARGINS WERE  19.0%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO  21.7%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER ZINC AND LABOR COSTS, WHICH WERE NOT FULLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SELLING PRICES, AND A CHARGE OF $1.3 MILLION INCURRED DURING FISCAL 2019 FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND OTHER DISPOSAL COSTS RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF TWO GALVANIZING FACILITIES IN THE GULF COAST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES.  CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE  $38.0 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2019  AND  $34.3 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPEND ON OUTSIDE SERVICES AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE COSTS IN FISCAL  2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PERFORMANCE SHARE UNIT GRANTS THAT WERE FORFEITED WHEN VARIOUS VESTING CONDITIONS WERE NOT SATISFIED DURING FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  8.0%  TO  $15.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $13.9 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SLIGHTLY LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT BALANCES DURING FISCAL 2019. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD GROSS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF  $241.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $301.3 MILLION  AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018  . AZZ'S DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS  0.40  TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO  0.53  TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2018.  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  FOR FISCAL  2019  , WE RECORDED OTHER INCOME, NET OF  $1.0 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE, NET OF  $3.5 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM A DOWNWARD REVISION TO ESTIMATED LOSSES ON THE IMPAIRMENT OF A NON-TRADE NOTE RECEIVABLE, WHICH WAS INITIALLY RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018 UPON THE BANKRUPTCY DECLARATION OF THE NOTE DEBTOR. THE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS PROGRESSED BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF ITS INITIAL LOSS ESTIMATES FOR THE OUTSTANDING NOTE, WHICH ORIGINATED FROM A NON-COMPETE LITIGATION SETTLEMENT WITH A COMPETITOR IN A PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES THAT WERE REALIZED DURING FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EXCHANGE RATES.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES REFLECTED AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  18.7%  FOR FISCAL  2019  AND  (46.2)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cU.S. TAX ACT\u201d), WHICH RESULTED IN A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT FOR FISCAL  2018  RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES AT A LOWER CORPORATE RATE THAT WAS OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES  THE U.S. TAX ACT REQUIRES COMPLEX COMPUTATIONS TO BE PERFORMED THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED BY U.S. TAX LAW, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE IN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT, SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS, AND THE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY RELEVANT.  THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, THE IRS, AND OTHER STANDARD-SETTING BODIES WILL CONTINUE TO INTERPRET OR ISSUE GUIDANCE ON HOW PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT WILL BE APPLIED OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTERED.  AS FUTURE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED, WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE TAX ACT UNDER SAB 118, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.1 MILLION RESULTING FROM REVISED ESTIMATES OF THE MANDATORY DEEMED REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, AND BONUS DEPRECIATION ELECTIONS BASED ON THE FINALIZATION OF OUR 2017 US FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN. THE CHANGE IN BONUS DEPRECIATION ELECTIONS AND OTHER TEMPORARY RETURN TO PROVISIONS ITEMS RESULTED IN $0.8 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE FINALIZATION OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE FINALIZATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS AND PROFITS AND FOREIGN TAX CREDITS RESULTED IN A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT.  WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY CASE  WE HAD EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH SUBSIDIARIES OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY (\u201cWEC\u201d). WEC AND THE RELEVANT SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"DEBTORS\") FILED RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ON MARCH 29, 2017 IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, JOINTLY ADMINISTERED AS IN RE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY, ET AL., CASE NO. 17-10751 (THE \"BANKRUPTCY CASE\"). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLECTING ON POST-PETITION AMOUNTS DUE AND OWED. ON FEBRUARY 22, 2018, THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK APPROVED THE DEBTORS\u2019 MODIFIED FIRST AMENDED DISCLOSURE STATEMENT FOR THE JOINT CHAPTER 11 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION. IN THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, THE DEBTORS ESTIMATED A 98.9% TO 100% DISTRIBUTION ON ALLOWED GENERAL UNSECURED CLAIMS. WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION OF SUCH CLAIMS FILED WITH THE COURT, WHICH INCLUDES 100% OF OUR PRE-PETITION CLAIMS. THE TOTAL CLAIMS FILED EXCEED THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR EXPOSURE AND WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE ALL AMOUNTS DUE. IN APRIL 2019, FOR ONE OF OUR PLANTS, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE THIRD PARTY BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATOR RELATED TO OUTSTANDING CLAIMS. THE AGREEMENT AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION REPRESENTED 100% OF THOSE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS FOR SUCH PLANT. THE BALANCE OF THE $12 MILLION CLAIMS NOTED ABOVE ARE STILL OUTSTANDING.  AT TIME OF THE BANKRUPTCY CASE, WE WERE SUBCONTRACTORS ON VARIOUS WEC ENGAGEMENTS, INCLUDING ONE IN GEORGIA (\"V.C. SUMMER\") AND ONE IN SOUTH CAROLINA (\"PLANT VOGTLE\"). THE OWNERSHIP OF V.C. SUMMER HALTED WORK EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE DE-BOOKED $11.0 MILLION FROM BACKLOG RELATED TO THIS PROJECT. ALSO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE OF CANCELLATION FROM WEC FOR THE PLANT VOGTLE PROJECT, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SALES AND MARGIN FOR THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $6.1 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2017  BACKLOG  WE ENDED FISCAL  2018  WITH A BACKLOG OF  $265.4 MILLION  , A DECREASE OF  $52.5 MILLION  OR  16.5%  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2017  .

THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2018 WAS CAUSED BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING REDUCED TURNAROUNDS IN THE U.S. REFINERY MARKET, CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE PETROCHEMICAL MARKET, NEGATIVE IMPACTS FROM THE ATLANTIC HURRICANE ACTIVITY, CANCELLATIONS AND DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF SEVERAL LARGE PROJECTS IN THE U.S. AND OVERSEAS. IN ADDITION, NET SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS ON THE NUCLEAR MARKET FROM THE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC COMPANY BANKRUPTCY FILED ON MARCH 29, 2017.  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT, WHICH CONSISTED OF FORTY-FIVE METAL COATING FACILITIES AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , GENERATED NET SALES OF  $389.4 MILLION  , A  3.7%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S NET SALES OF  $375.5 MILLION  . THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS DURING THE YEAR AND INCREASED PRICES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED VOLUMES IN STEEL PROCESSED AS A RESULT OF SOFTNESS IN THE SOLAR, PETROCHEMICAL, AND THE OIL AND GAS MARKETS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING INCOME  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS THE BREAKDOWN OF OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) BY SEGMENT (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  FEBRUARY 28, 2017  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS).  ENERGY  $(1,766  )  $52,577  METAL COATINGS  84,332  79,033  CORPORATE  (34,318  )  (32,702  )  TOTAL OPERATING INCOME  $48,248  $98,908  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE ENERGY SEGMENT DECREASED  $54.3 MILLION  , OR  103.4%  , FOR FISCAL  2018  , TO A LOSS OF  $(1.8) MILLION  AS COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $52.6 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2017  . OPERATING MARGINS FOR THIS SEGMENT WERE  (0.4)%  FOR FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED TO  10.8%  FOR FISCAL  2017  . THIS DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCTION IN REFINERY TURNAROUNDS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH TYPICALLY CARRY A HIGHER MARGIN, CANCELLATIONS, MARGIN DEGRADATIONS ON CERTAIN LARGE PROJECTS IN THE U.S. AND OVERSEAS AND THE WESTINGHOUSE BANKRUPTCY. IN ADDITION, FOR FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10.5 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT THAT WAS RETIRED AND A PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF $2.9 MILLION RESULTING FROM AN ADVERSE COURT DECISION RELATED TO CERTAIN OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. NO SUCH CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT INCREASED  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  6.7%  , FOR FISCAL  2018  TO  $84.3 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $79.0 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING MARGINS WERE  21.7%  FOR FISCAL  2018  AS COMPARED TO  21.0%  FOR FISCAL  2017  . EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF REALIGNMENT CHARGES OF $7.3 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL  2017  , OVERALL MARGINS DECREASED IN FISCAL  2018  AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUMES AND INCREASED COSTS FOR ZINC, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL MARGIN EARNED FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE YEAR.  CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE  $34.3 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  AND  $32.7 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2017  . THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER SPEND ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE COSTS IN FISCAL  2018.  INTEREST  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR FISCAL  2018  DECREASED  5.9%  TO  $13.9 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $14.7 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2017  . THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO MORE FAVORABLE INTEREST RATES DURING FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF OUR PARTIAL OR FULL REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE REPLACED WITH BORROWINGS THAT CARRIED LOWER INTEREST RATES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUTSTANDING DEBT, SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , WE HAD GROSS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF $301.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $272.3 MILLION AT THE END OF FISCAL 2017. AZZ'S DEBT TO EQUITY RATIO WAS 0.53 TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO 0.51 TO 1 AT THE END OF FISCAL  2017.  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  FOR FISCAL 2018, A TOTAL OF  $3.5 MILLION  IN EXPENSE WAS RECORDED TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE NON-TRADE NOTE RECEIVABLE DESCRIBED ABOVE UPON THE BANKRUPTCY DECLARATION OF THE NOTE DEBTOR. FOR FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED  $1.1 MILLION  OF INCOME TO OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REIMBURSEMENT OF LEGAL FEES OF $0.6 MILLION FROM A LAWSUIT IN FISCAL 2016 AND NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS.  PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES REFLECTED AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF (46.2)% FOR FISCAL 2018 AND 28.2% FOR FISCAL 2017. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE RATE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017, WHICH RESULTED IN A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES AT A LOWER CORPORATE RATE THAT WAS OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET OUR CASH NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ALONG WITH BANK AND BOND MARKET DEBT. OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENT AND ACQUISITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH POSITION, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXPECTATION OF CONTINUING AVAILABILITY TO DRAW UPON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS BY CATEGORY FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED (IN THOUSANDS).  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $114,668  $78,909  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (32,073  )  (73,939  )  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (78,004  )  3,800  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $114.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $78.9 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2018  IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME AND POSITIVE IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECLINE IN NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT ACCRUALS WHICH WERE RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018 RESULTING FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES DUE TO THE DECREASE OF U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATES AS PART OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017. THIS DECLINE IN NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT ACCRUALS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $32.1 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO  $73.9 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE DECLINE IN CASH USED DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND LOWER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE BREAKDOWN OF CAPITAL SPENDING BY SEGMENT FOR FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $78.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $3.8 MILLION  FOR FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED NET REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER OUR OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT AGREEMENTS.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL  2017 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON MARCH 27, 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND OTHER LENDERS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR A $75.0 MILLION TERM FACILITY AND A $225.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT INCLUDED A $75.0 MILLION \u201cACCORDION\u201d FEATURE. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS USED TO PROVIDE FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DIVIDENDS, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND LETTER OF CREDIT NEEDS.  ON MARCH 21, 2017, THE COMPANY EXECUTED THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH BANK OF AMERICA AND OTHER LENDERS. THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BY THE FOLLOWING: (I) EXTENDING THE MATURITY DATE UNTIL MARCH 21, 2022, (II) PROVIDING FOR A SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $450 MILLION, WITH AN ADDITIONAL $150 MILLION ACCORDION, (III) INCLUDING A $75 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF STANDBY AND COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT, (IV) INCLUDING A $30 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING LINE LOANS, (V) RESTRICTING INDEBTEDNESS INCURRED IN RESPECT OF CAPITAL LEASES, SYNTHETIC LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND PURCHASE MONEY OBLIGATIONS NOT TO EXCEED $20 MILLION, (VI) RESTRICTING INVESTMENTS IN ANY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES NOT TO EXCEED $50 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE, AND (VII) INCLUDING VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS RELATING TO DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES AS SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE BALANCE DUE ON THE $75.0 MILLION TERM FACILITY UNDER THE PREVIOUS CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS PAID IN FULL AS A RESULT OF THE EXECUTION OF THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT, REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS A LEVERAGE RATIO NOT TO EXCEED 3.25:1.0 AND AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 3.00:1.0. THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE USED TO FINANCE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, DIVIDENDS, FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, LETTER OF CREDIT NEEDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST RATES FOR BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BASED ON EITHER A EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE PLUS A MARGIN RANGING FROM 0.875% TO 1.875% DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT). THE EURODOLLAR RATE IS DEFINED AS LIBOR FOR A TERM EQUIVALENT TO THE BORROWING TERM (OR OTHER SIMILAR INTERBANK RATES IF LIBOR IS UNAVAILABLE). THE BASE RATE IS DEFINED AS THE HIGHEST OF THE APPLICABLE FED FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50%, THE PRIME RATE, OR THE EURODOLLAR RATE PLUS 1.0% AT THE TIME OF BORROWING. THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO CARRIES A COMMITMENT FEE FOR THE UNFUNDED PORTION RANGING FROM 0.175% TO 0.30% PER ANNUM, DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE WAS 4.06% AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD $116.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT AGAINST THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING IN THE AMOUNT OF $18.7 MILLION, WHICH LEFT APPROXIMATELY $315.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CREDIT AVAILABLE UNDER THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  2011 SENIOR NOTES  ON JANUARY 21, 2011, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201c2011 AGREEMENT\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED $125.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ITS 5.42% UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES (THE \u201c2011 NOTES\u201d), THROUGH A PRIVATE PLACEMENT (THE \u201c2011 NOTE OFFERING\u201d). AMOUNTS UNDER THE AGREEMENT ARE DUE IN A BALLOON PAYMENT ON THE JANUARY 2021 MATURITY DATE. PURSUANT TO THE 2011 AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY'S PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE 2011 NOTES MAY BE ACCELERATED UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE 2011 NOTES CONTAIN VARIOUS FINANCIAL COVENANTS REQUIRING THE COMPANY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO A) MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS NET WORTH EQUAL TO AT LEAST THE SUM OF $116.9 MILLION PLUS 50.0% OF FUTURE NET INCOME; B) MAINTAIN A RATIO OF INDEBTEDNESS TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT) NOT TO EXCEED 3.25:1.00; C) MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT) OF AT LEAST 2.0:1.0; D) NOT AT ANY TIME PERMIT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF ALL PRIORITY INDEBTEDNESS (AS DEFINED IN THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT) TO EXCEED 10.0% OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH (AS DEFINED IN THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT).  2008 SENIOR NOTES  ON MARCH 31, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cNOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED $100.0 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ITS 6.24% UNSECURED SENIOR NOTES (THE \u201c2008 NOTES\u201d) THROUGH A PRIVATE PLACEMENT (THE \u201c2008 NOTE OFFERING\u201d). AMOUNTS WERE DUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN  SEVEN  ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OF  $14.3 MILLION  COMMENCING IN MARCH OF 2012 THROUGH THE MARCH 2018 MATURITY DATE. ON MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY MADE THE FINAL PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OF $14.3 MILLION TO FULLY SETTLE THE 2008 SENIOR NOTES ON THE SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE.  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF ITS DEBT COVENANTS.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN JANUARY OF 2012, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO TEN PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, AND THE AMOUNT AND PRICES PAID FOR ANY FUTURE SHARE PURCHASES UNDER THE AUTHORIZATION WILL BE BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF THE PURCHASE. REPURCHASES UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION WOULD BE MADE THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS, INCLUDING RULE 10B-18 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE ANY REPURCHASES OF ITS COMMON SHARES DURING THE  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  OTHER EXPOSURES  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY PRICE INCREASES IN BOTH SEGMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS IN THE ENERGY SEGMENT AND ZINC AND NATURAL GAS IN THE METAL COATINGS SEGMENT. WE ATTEMPT TO MINIMIZE THESE INCREASES THROUGH ESCALATION CLAUSES IN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS FOR COPPER, ALUMINUM, STEEL AND NICKEL BASED ALLOYS, WHEN MARKET CONDITIONS ALLOW AND THROUGH FIXED COST CONTRACT PURCHASES ON ZINC. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WE ATTEMPT TO RECOVER OTHER COST INCREASES THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND THROUGH INCREASES IN PRICES WHERE COMPETITIVELY FEASIBLE.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED UNDER SEC RULES. SPECIFICALLY,  THERE WERE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT HAVE, OR MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY.

THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE ISSUED FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, BUT ARE MOST COMMONLY ISSUED IN LIEU OF CUSTOMER RETENTION WITHHOLDING PAYMENTS COVERING WARRANTY OR PERFORMANCE PERIODS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED VALUE OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSIONS. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE INFORMATION USED TO MAKE THESE ESTIMATES AS BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CHANGE. ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES CONSIDERED MOST CRITICAL ARE ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES BELOW HAVE BEEN REVIEWED WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. MORE INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATED BASED ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF COLLECTION. AN ALLOWANCE IS MAINTAINED FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INABILITY TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED BY HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF UNCOLLECTED ACCOUNTS, THE LEVEL OF PAST DUE ACCOUNTS, OVERALL LEVEL OF OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INFORMATION ABOUT SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS AND FUTURE EXPECTATIONS OF CONDITIONS THAT MIGHT IMPACT THE COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES COULD BE REQUIRED.  ACCRUALS FOR CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  THE AMOUNTS WE RECORD FOR ESTIMATED CLAIMS, SUCH AS SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS, WARRANTY, ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, REQUIRES US TO MAKE JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSES THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE INCURRED. WE USE PAST HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AND OTHER SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THESE CLAIMS IN EVALUATING THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY THAT SHOULD BE RECORDED. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATE.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE DETERMINE REVENUE RECOGNITION THROUGH THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  1)  IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER,  2)  IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT,  3)  DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE,  4)  ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AND  5)  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION VARIES BY SEGMENT BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES PROVIDED AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CUSTOMER CONTRACT.  ENERGY SEGMENT  OUR ENERGY SEGMENT IS A PROVIDER OF SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT INDUSTRIAL, NUCLEAR AND ELECTRICAL APPLICATIONS. WITHIN THIS SEGMENT, THE CONTRACT IS GOVERNED BY A CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDER AND AN EXECUTED PRODUCT OR SERVICES AGREEMENT. THE CONTRACT GENERALLY SPECIFIES THE DELIVERY OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSISTING OF EITHER CUSTOM BUILT PRODUCTS, CUSTOM SERVICES, OR OFF-THE-SHELF PRODUCTS. WHEN WE ENTER INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED TO THE CUSTOMER AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UPON THE SATISFACTION OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES THAT ARE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT PURPORT TO BE FOR A SINGLE COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVE.  FOR CUSTOM BUILT PRODUCTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER TIME PROVIDED THAT THE GOODS DO NOT HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE USE TO THE COMPANY AND WE HAVE AN UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO PAYMENT FOR WORK COMPLETED TO DATE PLUS A REASONABLE MARGIN. FOR CUSTOM SERVICES, WHICH CONSIST OF SPECIALIZED WELDING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES OVER TIME AS THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE SERVICES ENHANCE A CUSTOMER OWNED ASSET. FOR OFF-THE-SHELF PRODUCTS, WHICH CONSIST OF TUBING AND LIGHTING PRODUCTS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT A POINT-IN-TIME UPON THE TRANSFER OF THE GOODS TO THE CUSTOMER.  FOR REVENUES RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, WE GENERALLY USE THE COST-TO-COST METHOD OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THIS APPROACH, THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE RATIO OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE VERSUS THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS UPON COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT. THIS REQUIRES THAT WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL CONTRACT REVENUES, PROJECT COSTS AND MARGIN, WHICH CAN INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. AS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ONE OR MORE OF THESE ESTIMATES COULD AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CONTRACTS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS AND UPDATES ITS CONTRACT RELATED ESTIMATES REGULARLY. WE RECOGNIZE ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATED MARGIN ON CONTRACTS UNDER A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS AND SUBSEQUENT REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED USING THE ADJUSTED ESTIMATE. IF THE ESTIMATE OF CONTRACT MARGIN INDICATES AN ANTICIPATED LOSS ON THE CONTRACT, WE RECOGNIZE THE TOTAL ESTIMATED LOSS IN THE PERIOD IT IS IDENTIFIED.  DUE TO THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED, CONTRACTS WITHIN THE ENERGY SEGMENT ARE OFTEN MODIFIED TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS. A CONTRACT MODIFICATION EXISTS WHEN THE MODIFICATION EITHER CREATES NEW, OR CHANGES THE EXISTING, ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT. FOR US, MOST CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS ARE RELATED TO GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE NOT DISTINCT FROM THOSE IN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INTERRELATIONSHIP OR INTERDEPENDENCIES BETWEEN THE DELIVERABLES. SUCH MODIFICATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THEY WERE PART OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. AS A RESULT, THE TRANSACTION PRICE AND THE MEASURE OF PROGRESS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION TO WHICH IT RELATES, IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO REVENUE ON A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS.  IN ADDITION TO FIXED CONSIDERATION, THE CONTRACTS WITHIN OUR ENERGY SEGMENT CAN INCLUDE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING CLAIMS, INCENTIVE FEES, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES OR OTHER PENALTIES. WE RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR VARIABLE CONSIDERATION WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR. WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO BE RECOGNIZED ON VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING THE EXPECTED VALUE OR THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD, WHICHEVER IS EXPECTED TO BETTER PREDICT THE AMOUNT.  METAL COATINGS SEGMENT  OUR METAL COATINGS SEGMENT IS A PROVIDER OF HOT DIP GALVANIZING, POWDER COATING AND OTHER METAL COATING APPLICATIONS TO THE STEEL FABRICATION INDUSTRY. WITHIN THIS SEGMENT, THE CONTRACT IS GOVERNED BY A CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDER OR WORK ORDER. THE CONTRACT GENERALLY SPECIFIES THE DELIVERY OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSISTING OF METAL COATING SERVICES.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION PURPOSES THAT ARE EXECUTED WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER WITHIN A SHORT TIMEFRAME FROM EACH OTHER AND THAT PURPORT TO BE FOR A SINGLE COMMERCIAL OBJECTIVE.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME AS THE METAL COATING IS APPLIED TO THE CUSTOMER PROVIDED MATERIAL AS THE PROCESS ENHANCES A CUSTOMER CONTROLLED ASSET. CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS ARE RARE WITHIN THIS SEGMENT AND MOST CONTRACTS ARE ON A FIXED PRICE BASIS WITH NO VARIABLE CONSIDERATION.  CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BILLINGS AND CASH COLLECTIONS RESULTS IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CONTRACT ASSETS (UNBILLED RECEIVABLES), AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES (CUSTOMER ADVANCES AND DEPOSITS) ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ENERGY SEGMENT. AMOUNTS ARE BILLED AS WORK PROGRESSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH AGREED UPON CONTRACTUAL TERMS, EITHER AT PERIODIC INTERVALS (E.G., WEEKLY OR MONTHLY) OR UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF CONTRACTUAL MILESTONES. BILLING CAN OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, RESULTING IN CONTRACT ASSETS. IN ADDITION, WE CAN RECEIVE ADVANCES OR DEPOSITS FROM ITS CUSTOMERS, BEFORE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, RESULTING IN CONTRACT LIABILITIES. THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ON A CONTRACT-BY-CONTRACT BASIS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  OTHER  NO GENERAL RIGHTS OF RETURN EXIST FOR CUSTOMERS AND WE ESTABLISH PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED WARRANTIES. WE GENERALLY DO NOT SELL EXTENDED WARRANTIES. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED NET OF APPLICABLE SALES AND OTHER TAXES. WE DO NOT ADJUST THE CONTRACT PRICE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT IF WE EXPECT, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, THAT THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN WE TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR THAT GOOD OR SERVICE WILL BE ONE YEAR OR LESS, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE. SALES COMMISSIONS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED REVENUES. SHIPPING AND HANDLING IS TREATED AS A FULFILLMENT OBLIGATION INSTEAD OF A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND SUCH COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL  WE RECORD IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MIGHT BE IMPAIRED AND THE UNDISCOUNTED PROJECTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE ASSETS ARE LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THOSE ASSETS. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OVER THE ASSET\u2019S FAIR VALUE, GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED UPON DISCOUNTED ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN EVENTS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR PROJECTED CASH FLOWS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST OF GOODWILL IS PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. THE TEST IS CALCULATED USING THE ANTICIPATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AFTER TAX FROM OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS. BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN PROJECTED CASH FLOWS OR COST OF CAPITAL FOR FUTURE YEARS COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN FUTURE YEARS. VARIABLES IMPACTING FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND RESPONSE TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER TO THE POWER GENERATION MARKET, THE ELECTRICAL TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION MARKETS, THE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL MARKET AND THE HOT DIP GALVANIZING MARKET, CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF THESE VARIOUS MARKETS, RAW MATERIAL AND NATURAL GAS COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF EXPERIENCED LABOR AND MANAGEMENT TO IMPLEMENT OUR GROWTH STRATEGIES. OUR TESTING CONCLUDED THAT NONE OF OUR GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS REFLECT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED CURRENT AND FUTURE TAXES TO BE PAID. WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ARE REQUIRED IN DETERMINING THE CONSOLIDATED INCOME TAX EXPENSE. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARISE FROM TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR REPORTED AMOUNTS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WILL RESULT IN TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN THE FUTURE.  IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION FROM WHICH THEY ARISE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX-PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND RESULTS OF RECENT OPERATIONS. IN PROJECTING FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, WE BEGIN WITH HISTORICAL RESULTS ADJUSTED FOR THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND INCORPORATE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE STATE, FEDERAL, AND FOREIGN PRETAX OPERATING INCOME ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE TAX CONSEQUENCES. THE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PLANS AND ESTIMATES WE ARE USING TO MANAGE THE UNDERLYING BUSINESSES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS ACROSS OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"GAAP\") STATES THAT A TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION MAY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTIONS OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, ON THE BASIS OF THE TECHNICAL MERITS. WE MAY (1) RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS LIABILITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND (2) ADJUST THESE LIABILITIES WHEN OUR JUDGMENT CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE EVALUATION OF NEW INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY AVAILABLE. BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT LIABILITIES. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BE REFLECTED AS INCREASES OR DECREASES TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH NEW INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.  WE CURRENTLY DO NOT RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE OR, FOREIGN TAX EXPOSURE. WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR TAX EXPOSURE FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT NEED TO RECORD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE FUTURE.  THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cU.S. TAX ACT\u201d) REQUIRES COMPLEX COMPUTATIONS TO BE PERFORMED THAT WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED BY U.S. TAX LAW, SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS TO BE MADE IN INTERPRETATION OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT, SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES IN CALCULATIONS, AND THE PREPARATION AND ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION NOT PREVIOUSLY RELEVANT.  THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT, THE IRS, AND OTHER STANDARD-SETTING BODIES WILL CONTINUE TO INTERPRET OR ISSUE GUIDANCE ON HOW PROVISIONS OF THE U.S. TAX ACT WILL BE APPLIED OR OTHERWISE ADMINISTERED.  AS FUTURE GUIDANCE IS ISSUED, WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO AMOUNTS THAT WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE CONSISTS OF THE EXPENSE FOR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (\"RSUS\"), PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (\"PSUS\"), STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (\"SARS\") AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (\"ESPP\") SHARES GRANTED TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND DIRECTORS. THE COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AWARDS AND IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE RESPECTIVE VESTING PERIODS OF THE AWARDS.  FOR SARS AND ESPP AWARDS, WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE USING A BLACK-SCHOLES PRICING MODEL. FOR PSUS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE PERFORMANCE-BASED AND MARKET-BASED VESTING CONDITIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION. THE INPUTS REQUIRED FOR THESE VALUATION MODELS ARE SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. FOR RSUS WE ESTIMATE THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE CLOSE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE PART II, ITEM 8.

AS A RESULT, THE DISCUSSION BELOW IS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE COMPRISED OF THE AEROSPACE BUSINESS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE OFFICE.  THE COMPANY PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 5, 2019. THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND WAS FUNDED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES. THIS SPECIAL DIVIDEND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER SHARE PAID FEBRUARY 5, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON JANUARY 2, 2019, BRINGS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS TO $24.75 PER SHARE, A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $506 MILLION, SINCE THE COMPANY\u2019S 2005 FISCAL YEAR.  22  IN 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE MAJOR EXPANSION OF ITS AEROSPACE MANUFACTURING, DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN FACILITIES LOCATED AT THE NEWTON CITY-COUNTY AIRPORT IN NEWTON, KANSAS.  THIS EXPANSION WILL INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A REDUNDANT MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED ADJACENT TO PARK\u2019S EXISTING NEWTON, KANSAS FACILITIES.

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES WORLDWIDE IN 2019 WERE 27% HIGHER THAN IN 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE \u201cEND CUSTOMER\u201d OF A MAJOR COMPANY CUSTOMER RAMPING UP COMMERCIAL JET PRODUCTION AND THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMER RESTOCKING DEPLETED INVENTORY, PARTICULARLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, AND TO AN INCREASE IN MILITARY SALES DURING 2019.  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 31.7% IN 2019 FROM 28.1% IN 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS COMBINED WITH THE FIXED NATURE OF CERTAIN OVERHEAD COSTS AND COST REDUCTION EFFORTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 WERE 464% HIGHER THAN IN 2018, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED INCREASES IN SALES AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN AND A 9% REDUCTION IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDED THE ADDITIONAL STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION. THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN 2019 WERE 65% LOWER THAN IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $17.8 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE 2018 YEAR RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 AND TO A LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION INCURRED TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019.

GROSS PROFIT  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 31.7% IN 2019, FROM 28.1% IN 2018, DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND THE PARTIALLY FIXED NATURE OF OVERHEAD EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $0.9 MILLION, OR 9%, DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 2018. SUCH EXPENSES, MEASURED AS PERCENTAGES OF SALES, WERE 17.5% DURING 2019 COMPARED TO 24.5% DURING 2018. THE DECREASE IN SUCH EXPENSES IN 2019 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN SALARY AND RELATED EXPENSES, LOWER TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES, LOWER LEGAL FEES AND LOWER STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, EXCLUDING THE STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGES IN EACH PERIOD.  24  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2019 INCLUDED $1.2 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO $1.4 MILLION OF SUCH EXPENSES IN 2018, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS.  EARNINGS FROM  CONTINUING  OPERATIONS  FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $7.2 MILLION FOR 2019, INCLUDING A PRE-TAX STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.3 MILLION IN 2018, INCLUDING A PRE-TAX STOCK OPTION MODIFICATION CHARGE OF $0.5 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019.  LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES  THE COMPANY RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE LIQUIDATION OF SECURITIES TO FUND THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $4.25 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY RECORDED LOSSES ON THE SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.3 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPATRIATION OF CASH AND THE PREPAYMENT OF ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND THE FUNDING OF A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE PAID IN FEBRUARY 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS $0, COMPARED TO $2.3 MILLION IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF JANUARY 16, 2016, BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND HSBC BANK USA (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) IN 2018. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY PREPAID THE REMAINING LOAN BALANCE OF $68.5 MILLION WITH HSBC BANK AND TERMINATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE PREPAYMENT WAS MADE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RESTRICTED CASH.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WERE $2.4 MILLION AND $2.6 MILLION FOR 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE FROM 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE INVESTED CASH DURING THE PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY PREPAID ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE IN FEBRUARY 2018. DURING 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY EARNED INTEREST INCOME PRINCIPALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY IN SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 22.1% FOR 2019 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE AND STATE INCOME TAXES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO VALUATION ALLOWANCES ON STATE TAX CREDITS AND A DECREASE IN STATE APPORTIONMENT PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FOR 2018, DUE TO THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $17.8 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 PERTAINING TO U.S. TAX LAW CHANGES ENABLING THE REDUCTION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.

GROSS PROFIT  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, MEASURED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, INCREASED TO 28.1% IN 2018 FROM 26.1% IN 2017 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SALES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AEROSPACE PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH THE FIXED NATURE OF CERTAIN OVERHEAD COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $0.4 MILLION, OR 4%, DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 2017. SUCH EXPENSES MEASURED AS PERCENTAGES OF SALES WERE 24.5% DURING 2018 COMPARED TO 32.3% DURING 2017.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN 2018 INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSES, INCLUDING $0.5 MILLION DUE TO THE MODIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO $1.2 MILLION OF SUCH EXPENSES IN 2017.  27  EARNINGS FROM  CONTINUING  OPERATIONS  FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH ABOVE, THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS WERE $1.3 MILLION FOR 2018, INCLUDING PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $0.5 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE MODIFICATION OF STOCK OPTIONS, COMPARED TO NEGATIVE $2.0 MILLION FOR 2017.

INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2018 WAS $2.3 MILLION, COMPARED TO $1.4 MILLION IN 2017. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND THE PRE-TAX DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT. AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY PREPAID THE REMAINING LOAN BALANCE OF $68.5 MILLION WITH HSBC BANK AND TERMINATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE PREPAYMENT WAS MADE WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND RESTRICTED CASH. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY EXPENSED THE REMAINING DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. SEE NOTE 10 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d ELSEWHERE IN THIS ITEM 7 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WERE $2.6 MILLION AND $1.6 MILLION FOR 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE 61% INCREASE IN 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES BASED ON LONGER AVERAGE MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES HELD BY THE COMPANY IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017'S COMPARABLE PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE INVESTED CASH DURING THE PERIOD. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE COMPANY PREPAID ALL OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $68.5 MILLION OF PRINCIPAL AND PAID A SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $3.00 PER SHARE IN FEBRUARY 2018. DURING 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY EARNED INTEREST INCOME PRINCIPALLY FROM ITS INVESTMENTS, WHICH WERE PRIMARILY IN SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES, IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $17.8 MILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF LIABILITIES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX AND THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S POST-1986 EARNINGS AND PROFITS (\u201cE&P\u201d) NOT PREVIOUSLY SUBJECTED TO U.S. TAXATION.  28  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A DISCRETE NON-CASH TAX BENEFIT OF $0.2 MILLION DUE TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY REMEASURED CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE RATES AT WHICH THEY WERE EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FUTURE, WHICH IS GENERALLY 21% FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 9.5% FOR 2017.  NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR 2018 WAS $18.5 MILLION, INCLUDING PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO FACILITY CLOSURE, COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $1.1 MILLION FOR 2017.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES WAS $2.1 MILLION IN 2018 COMPARED TO $10.4 MILLION IN 2017. EARNINGS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES WERE LOWER IN 2018 COMPARED TO 2017 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES AND HIGHER RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. DURING 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $5.0 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATION OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS UNITS IN CALIFORNIA AND ARIZONA, THE CLOSURE, IN 2009, OF ITS FACILITY IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK AND THE CLOSURE, IN 2012, OF ITS FACILITY IN WATERBURY, CONNECTICUT, COMPARED TO PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $0.3 MILLION IN 2017 IN CONNECTION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED FACILITY CLOSURE IN NEWBURGH, NEW YORK.  BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR 2018 WERE $0.91, INCLUDING THE FACILITY CLOSURE MENTIONED ABOVE, COMPARED TO BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF NEGATIVE $0.05 FOR 2017.

THE CHANGE IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRONICS BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID BY THE COMPANY TO ITS SHAREHOLDER IN FEBRUARY 2019 AND A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL FACTORS. THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY 34% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES IN THE LAST MONTH OF 2019;  \u25cf  INVENTORY INCREASED 33% DUE PRIMARILY TO RAW MATERIAL PURCHASED AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2019 FOR USE IN FUTURE PRODUCTION;  \u25cf  PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS INCREASED 15% DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASE IN OTHER RECEIVABLES OFFSET BY A DECREASE TO PREPAID MARKETABLE SECURITIES;  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED 74% DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE AT THE END OF FEBRUARY 2019;  \u25cf  ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCREASED 186% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ACCRUALS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND BONUSES; AND  \u25cf  INCOME TAXES PAYABLE INCREASED 248% AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018 DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $145 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS ELECTRONICS BUSINESS, NET OF TAXES AND TRANSACTION EXPENSES, AND PAID $95.0 MILLION AND $68.8 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS DURING 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING SPECIAL DIVIDENDS OF $86.8 MILLION AND $60.7 MILLION PAID IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY INCURRED $1.5 MILLION OF LOSSES ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN ORDER TO PAY THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND.  WORKING CAPITAL  WORKING CAPITAL AT MARCH 3, 2019 WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 25, 2018. INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORIES WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND TAXES PAYABLE.  THE COMPANY'S CURRENT RATIO (THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES) WAS 15.1 TO 1 AT MARCH 3, 2019 COMPARED TO 11.6 TO 1 AT FEBRUARY 25, 2018.  CASH FLOWS  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY'S NET EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, BEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF BOND PREMIUM AND GAIN ON SALE OF FIXED ASSETS, WERE $9.6 MILLION. SUCH EARNINGS REFLECTED A LOSS ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $1.5 MILLION AND WERE DECREASED BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $1.6 MILLION, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $2.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGH SALES IN THE LAST MONTH OF THE FISCAL YEAR, RESULTING IN $8.1 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS. DURING 2019, THE COMPANY EXPENDED $2.8 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT COMPARED TO $571,000 DURING 2018, AND THE COMPANY PAID $95.1 MILLION AND $68.8 MILLION IN CASH DIVIDENDS IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  30  OTHER LIQUIDITY FACTORS  IN DECEMBER 2018, PATC ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF NEWTON, KANSAS AND THE BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS OF HARVEY COUNTY, KANSAS.  PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT, PATC AGREED TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE AN ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY APPROXIMATELY 90,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND PARTS, STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES FOR AEROSPACE. PATC FURTHER AGREED TO EQUIP THE FACILITY THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF MACHINERY, EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS AND TO CREATE ADDITIONAL NEW FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT OF SPECIFIED LEVELS DURING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.  IN EXCHANGE FOR THESE AGREEMENTS, THE CITY AND THE COUNTY AGREED TO LEASE TO PATC THREE ACRES OF LAND AT THE NEWTON CITY/COUNTY AIRPORT, IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHT ACRES PREVIOUSLY LEASED TO PATC BY THE CITY AND COUNTY.  THE CITY AND THE COUNTY FURTHER AGREED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND OTHER ASSISTANCE TOWARD THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY AS SET FORTH IN THE DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE TOTAL COST OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY TO BE APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL FACILITY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE 2020 CALENDAR YEAR.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED AND SIGNIFICANTLY REVISED U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATES, IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM. AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, THE COMPANY RECORDED TAX PAYABLE TO BE PAID IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS. THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS, AS OF MARCH 3, 2019, WAS APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION TO BE PAID OVER THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT, FOR THE 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT AND FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE THEREAFTER, TO PROVIDE FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER EXPANSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES OR EVENTS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT ITS LIQUIDITY.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS, SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, CONSIST ONLY OF OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS AND COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THE COMPANY HAS NO OTHER LONG-TERM DEBT, CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS, UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, GUARANTEES, STANDBY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS OR CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS, OTHER THAN TWO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT IN THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF $.3 MILLION TO SECURE THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION INSURANCE PROGRAM.  31  AS OF MARCH 3, 2019 THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS DUE BY FISCAL YEAR, WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  TOTAL  2020  2021-2022  2023-2024  2025 AND  THEREAFTER  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  $1,457  $834  $570  $53  $-  EQUIPMENT PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  3,973  -  3,973  -  -  TOTAL  $5,430  $834  $4,543  $53  $-  AT MARCH 3, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $1.0 MILLION. A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENT OF THESE LIABILITIES IS NOT POSSIBLE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY IS NOT DEPENDENT ON THE USE OF, AND THE COMPANY IS NOT ENGAGED IN, ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS SECURITIZATION OF RECEIVABLES OR OBTAINING ACCESS TO ASSETS THROUGH SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES.  ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, AS A GENERAL MATTER, ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES ARE PROPERLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND THAT ITS HANDLING, MANUFACTURE, USE AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES ARE IN ACCORD WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. HOWEVER, MAINLY BECAUSE OF PAST OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTRONICS BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF PREDECESSOR COMPANIES, WHICH WERE GENERALLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AT THE TIME OF THE OPERATIONS IN QUESTION, THE COMPANY, LIKE OTHER COMPANIES ENGAGED IN SIMILAR BUSINESSES, IS A PARTY TO CLAIMS BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND THIRD PARTIES AND HAS INCURRED REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AND COSTS INVOLVING PAST ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS MAY CONTINUE TO ARISE IN THE FUTURE. IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO RECORD APPROPRIATE LIABILITIES FOR SUCH MATTERS WHEN REMEDIAL EFFORTS ARE PROBABLE AND THE COSTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $70,000, $99,000 AND $84,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP COSTS AND RELATED LEGAL FEES, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED, OR EXPECTS TO RECEIVE, REIMBURSEMENT PURSUANT TO GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR APPROXIMATELY $68,000, $92,000 AND $84,000, RESPECTIVELY, OF SUCH AMOUNTS. WHILE ANNUAL ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIAL RESPONSE AND VOLUNTARY CLEANUP EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING LEGAL FEES, HAVE GENERALLY BEEN CONSTANT FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND MAY INCREASE OVER TIME, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL BE ABLE TO FUND SUCH EXPENDITURES FROM CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. THE TIMING OF EXPENDITURES DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING REGULATORY APPROVAL OF CLEANUP PROJECTS, REMEDIAL TECHNIQUES TO BE UTILIZED AND AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER PARTIES. AT MARCH 3, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 25, 2018, THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS RECORDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY. SEE NOTE 12 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.  32  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS PROVIDED REGARDING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THAT ENTAIL, TO A SIGNIFICANT EXTENT, THE USE OF ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT.  GENERAL  THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO SALES ALLOWANCES, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORIES, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, RESTRUCTURINGS, CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT ITS MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT  SEE NOTE 16 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF PART II OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE PROVIDING ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN ALL OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA ARE MET: (1) WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT, (2) THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, (3) THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN DETERMINED, (4) THE TRANSACTION PRICE HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AND (5) THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SHIPPING TERMS PERMIT IT TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT POINT OF SHIPMENT. SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE TREATED AS FULFILLMENT COSTS.  SALES ALLOWANCES AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES  THE COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER RETURNS, ALLOWANCES, AND WARRANTY CLAIMS. PROVISIONS FOR SUCH REDUCTIONS ARE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THE SALE IS RECORDED AND ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL TRENDS AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MADE TO CUSTOMER SPECIFICATIONS AND TESTED FOR ADHERENCE TO SUCH SPECIFICATIONS BEFORE SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS. COMPOSITE STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO \u201cAIRWORTHINESS\u201d ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS AFTER RECEIPT AT THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 LOCATIONS. THERE ARE NO FUTURE PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OTHER THAN THE PRODUCTS\u2019 MEETING THE AGREED SPECIFICATIONS. THE COMPANY\u2019S BASIS FOR PROVIDING SALES ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS ARE KNOWN SITUATIONS IN WHICH PRODUCTS MAY HAVE FAILED DUE TO MANUFACTURING DEFECTS IN THE PRODUCTS SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY IS FOCUSED ON MANUFACTURING THE HIGHEST QUALITY ADVANCED COMPOSITE MATERIALS, STRUCTURES AND ASSEMBLIES AND TOOLING POSSIBLE AND EMPLOYS STRINGENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTROLS AND WORKS WITH RAW MATERIAL SUPPLIERS WHO HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO COMPLYING WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S SPECIFICATIONS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. THE AMOUNTS OF RETURNS AND ALLOWANCES RESULTING FROM DEFECTIVE OR DAMAGED PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 1.0% OF SALES FOR EACH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  33  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE DUE FROM PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS. CREDIT IS EXTENDED BASED ON EVALUATION OF A CUSTOMER\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND, GENERALLY, COLLATERAL IS NOT REQUIRED. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE DUE WITHIN ESTABLISHED PAYMENT TERMS AND ARE STATED AT AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. ACCOUNTS OUTSTANDING LONGER THAN ESTABLISHED PAYMENT TERMS ARE CONSIDERED PAST DUE. THE COMPANY DETERMINES ITS ALLOWANCE BY CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE PAST DUE, THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS LOSS HISTORY, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S CURRENT ABILITY TO PAY ITS OBLIGATION TO THE COMPANY, AND THE CONDITIONS OF THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS WERE TO DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED. THE COMPANY WRITES OFF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WHEN THEY BECOME UNCOLLECTIBLE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD) OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY WRITES DOWN ITS INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED OBSOLESCENCE OR UNMARKETABILITY BASED UPON THE AGE OF THE INVENTORY AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AT LEAST ANNUALLY. IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD TRIGGER AN IMPAIRMENT REVIEW INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE INDUSTRY OR ECONOMIC TRENDS AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE USE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS OR STRATEGY OF THE OVERALL BUSINESS.  INCOME TAXES  AS PART OF THE PROCESSES OF PREPARING ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE INCOME TAXES IN EACH OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH IT OPERATES. THIS PROCESS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPENSE TOGETHER WITH ASSESSING TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES RESULTING FROM DIFFERING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THESE DIFFERENCES RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE PROVIDED FOR TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE REPORTING OF CERTAIN ITEMS, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES COMPARED TO FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION FROM WHICH THEY ARISE, ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE IS CONSIDERED, INCLUDING THE SCHEDULED REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND RESULTS OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS. IF THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CONVERSELY TO FURTHER REDUCE THE EXISTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE, RESULTING IN LESS INCOME TAX EXPENSE. THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND ASSESSES THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES QUARTERLY.  34  TAX BENEFITS ARE RECOGNIZED FOR AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION WHEN, IN THE COMPANY\u2019S JUDGMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY A TAXING AUTHORITY. FOR A TAX POSITION THAT MEETS THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE TAX BENEFIT IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT THAT IS JUDGED TO HAVE A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT WITH A TAXING AUTHORITY. THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY DUE TO CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND WHEN NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED ENTIRELY IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE NET IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS AS CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE BY THE COMPANY. WHILE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME OR THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION OF ANY PARTICULAR TAX MATTER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS ADEQUATE. INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECOGNIZED ON THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS ARE RECORDED AS INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF PROCEEDINGS, LAWSUITS AND OTHER CLAIMS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCT AND OTHER MATTERS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY ADVERSE JUDGMENTS OR OUTCOMES IN THESE MATTERS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL RANGES OF PROBABLE LOSSES. A DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF RESERVES REQUIRED, IF ANY, FOR THESE CONTINGENCIES IS MADE AFTER CAREFUL ANALYSIS OF EACH INDIVIDUAL ISSUE. THE REQUIRED RESERVES MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN EACH MATTER OR CHANGES IN APPROACH, SUCH AS A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY IN DEALING WITH THESE MATTERS.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PROGRAMS  THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATIONS FOR WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS PRIOR TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 ARE EFFECTIVELY SELF-INSURED, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INDIVIDUAL AND AGGREGATE STOP-LOSS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SUCH CLAIMS. THE COMPANY ACCRUES ITS WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION LIABILITY BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL EXPOSURE OF KNOWN CLAIMS USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED LOSS DEVELOPMENT FACTORS LESS AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY PAID OUT.  THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE A NON-CONTRIBUTORY PROFIT SHARING RETIREMENT PLAN COVERING THEIR REGULAR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS BONUS AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, MOST OF WHICH ARE DETERMINED AT MANAGEMENT'S DISCRETION.  THE COMPANY'S RESERVES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE SELF-INSURED LIABILITIES AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS ARE REVIEWED BY MANAGEMENT FOR ADEQUACY AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD.  35", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "PARK ELECTROCHEMICAL CORP", "CIK": 76267, "Date": "2019-05-20T00:00:00", "Ticker": "PKE", "Name": "Park Electrochemical Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3672.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "NY", "IRS": 111734643.0, "key": "20190520PKE", "labelr1": -3.1464530892448552, "labelr2": -2.067336089781461, "labelr3": -2.412545235223152, "labelr4": -0.3708281829418957, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5168527, "prof1": 0.4831473, "return1&2": 1.0527883693928832, "return1&2&3": 1.0781873650356548, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0821855876501256, "return2": 1.020673360897815, "return1": 1.0314645308924486, "return3": 1.0241254523522316, "return4": 1.0037082818294192, "4_day_return": -7.780320366132719, "cumulative_return1": 0.07588770737881112, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0016218966756227904, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.673799053590753e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0675435894886753e-07, "indexx": 2370, "cumreturn1b": 1.0706520316486778, "cumreturndow": 0.9767738920863446, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9787752404432634}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2374, "level_0": 2399, "index": 5738, "text": "ITEM 7.

(TOGETHER, \"MACHINING\"), AND (V) SELLING ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH AVIATION SERVICES - NAAS DIVISION, INC. (\"NAAS\").  COLLECTIVELY, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE REFERRED TO AS THE \"FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES\".  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED COMBINED NET LOSSES OF  $235.3 MILLION  ASSOCIATED WITH THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN LOSS ON DIVESTITURES.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NAAS, THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES ARE INCLUDED IN AEROSPACE STRUCTURES (\"FISCAL 2019 AEROSPACE STRUCTURES DIVESTITURES\") THROUGH THE RESPECTIVE DATES OF DIVESTITURE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR NAAS ARE INCLUDED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT THROUGH THE DATE OF DIVESTITURE.  SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , INCLUDE.  \u2022  NET SALES FOR FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  5.2%  TO  $3.36 BILLION.  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $274.7 MILLION.  \u2022  INCLUDED IN OPERATING LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS LOSS ON DIVESTITURES OF  $235.3 MILLION  RELATED TO THE FISCAL 2019 DIVESTITURES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF  $31.1 MILLION.  \u2022  NET LOSS FOR FISCAL  2019  WAS  $321.8 MILLION.  \u2022  BACKLOG  DECREASED  16.7%  OVER THE PRIOR YEAR TO  $3.74 BILLION  DUE TO DIVESTITURES.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , NET SALES TOTALED  $3.36 BILLION  , A  5.2%  INCREASE  FROM FISCAL YEAR  2018  NET SALES OF  $3.20 BILLION  .  THE NET LOSS FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  DECREASED  24.4%  TO  $321.8 MILLION  , OR  $6.47  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, VERSUS THE NET LOSS OF  $425.4 MILLION  , OR  $8.60  PER DILUTED COMMON SHARE, FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE GENERALLY FUNDED THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE  USED  $174.4 MILLION  OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES,  RECEIVED  $200.5 MILLION  FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND  RECEIVED  $32.5 MILLION  FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  WERE  $(288.9) MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAS COMMITTED TO SEVERAL PLANS (WHICH WERE INITIATED IN FISCAL 2016) THAT INCORPORATED THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN OF ITS BUSINESSES AS WELL AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN OF ITS FACILITIES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO REMAINING FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS TO BE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2020 AND THREE PENDING FACILITY CLOSURES TO BE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2021 OR 2022, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED THESE PLANS. AS A RESULT, SINCE FISCAL 2016, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED ITS FOOTPRINT BY APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO DATE, WITH THE REDUCTION OF AN ADDITIONAL 2.0 MILLION SQUARE FEET TO BE UPON COMPLETION OF THE 747-8 CONTRACT, AND REDUCED HEADCOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY  2,500  EMPLOYEES.  OVER THE COURSE OF THESE COST-REDUCING PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD RECORD AGGREGATE RELATED PRETAX CHARGES OF  $195.0 MILLION  TO  $210.0 MILLION  , WHICH REPRESENTED EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS, CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY CLOSURE AND OTHER EXIT COSTS.  FOR THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017  , THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF  $31.1 MILLION  ,  $43.1 MILLION  AND  $53.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE PROGRAMS.  OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES GENERATE ANNUALIZED SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION PER YEAR ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS FROM FACILITY CONSOLIDATIONS, HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION.  THESE SAVINGS RESULTED FROM OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS - 23%; AEROSPACE STRUCTURES - 72% AND PRODUCT SUPPORT - 5%.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE SAVINGS WERE REINVESTED IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS TO HELP DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH OR TO OFFSET PRICE REDUCTIONS TO CUSTOMERS.  FROM FISCAL 2014 THROUGH FISCAL 2019, OUR AEROSPACE STRUCTURES BUSINESS UNIT HAD BEEN PERFORMING DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL MANUFACTURING ON SEVERAL NEW PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE GLOBAL 7500, THE EMBRAER SECOND GENERATION E-JET (\"E2-JETS\") AND MORE RECENTLY, THE GULFSTREAM G500/G600 PROGRAMS.  HISTORICALLY, LOW-RATE PRODUCTION COMMENCES DURING FLIGHT TESTING, FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASE TO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION, ASSUMING THAT SUCCESSFUL TESTING AND CERTIFICATION ARE ACHIEVED.  WHILE WORK PROGRESSED ON THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN ACHIEVING ESTIMATED COST TARGETS PARTICULARLY IN THE AREAS OF ENGINEERING AND ESTIMATED RECURRING COSTS WHICH RESULTED IN FORWARD LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, FROM FISCAL 2015 TO FISCAL 2019, OUR AEROSPACE STRUCTURES BUSINESS UNIT EXPERIENCED OPERATING AND FORWARD LOSSES ON ITS PRODUCTION OF THE THE BOEING 747-8 FUSELAGE FOR BOEING, GULFSTREAM G280 WING FOR ISRAEL AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES, LTD (\"IAI\") AND GULFSTREAM G650 WING FOR GULFSTREAM.  FURTHER DISCUSSION IS INCLUDED BELOW REGARDING EACH PROGRAM'S IMPACT ON OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS.  GLOBAL 7500  THE INITIAL PROVISION FOR FORWARD LOSSES RECORDED IN FISCAL 2016 ON GLOBAL 7500 RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF COST RECOVERY UNCERTAINTY, HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED NONRECURRING COSTS AND INCREASED FORECASTED COSTS ON RECURRING PRODUCTION.  THE INCREASES IN COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING: CHANGING TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS, INCREASED SPENDING ON THE DESIGN AND ENGINEERING PHASE OF THE PROGRAM AND UNCERTAINTY REGARDING COST REDUCTION AND COST RECOVERY INITIATIVES WITH OUR CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIERS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2016, TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES, LLC, THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY THAT WAS PARTY TO THE GLOBAL 7500 CONTRACT WITH BOMBARDIER (\u201cTRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES\u201d), INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST BOMBARDIER IN THE QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT, DISTRICT OF MONTREAL.  THE LAWSUIT RELATED TO BOMBARDIER\u2019S FAILURE TO PAY TO TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES CERTAIN NONRECURRING EXPENSES INCURRED BY TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE OF A PROGRAM PURSUANT TO WHICH TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES AGREED TO DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SUPPLY THE WING AND RELATED COMPONENTS FOR BOMBARDIER\u2019S GLOBAL 7500 BUSINESS AIRCRAFT.  IN MAY 2017, TRIUMPH AEROSTRUCTURES AND BOMBARDIER ENTERED INTO A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT RESOLVED ALL OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM, INCLUDING ALL PENDING LITIGATION, RELATED TO THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY OF WING COMPONENTS FOR BOMBARDIER\u2019S GLOBAL 7000 BUSINESS AIRCRAFT.  THE SETTLEMENT RESET THE COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMPANIES AND ALLOWED EACH COMPANY TO BETTER ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES GOING FORWARD.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE INCREASE IN COSTS ON THE COMPLETION OF THE FLIGHT TESTING AND ANTICIPATED ONGOING PRODUCTION COSTS THAT RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS CHARGES OF $60.4 MILLION.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE COMPANY TRANSITIONED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE GLOBAL 7500 WING PROGRAM  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES TO BOMBARDIER AT WHICH POINT BOMBARDIER ASSUMED THE PROGRAM\u2019S ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS.  E2-JETS  UNDER OUR CONTRACT WITH EMBRAER, WE HAD THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO DESIGN, DEVELOP AND MANUFACTURE THE CENTER FUSELAGE SECTION III, REAR FUSELAGE SECTION AND VARIOUS TAIL SECTION COMPONENTS (RUDDER AND ELEVATOR) FOR THE E2-JETS OVER THE INITIAL 600 SHIP SETS.  THE CONTRACT PROVIDED FOR FUNDING ON A FIXED AMOUNT OF NONRECURRING COSTS, TO BE PAID OVER A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF PRODUCTION UNITS.  HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SPENDING ON THE E2-JETS PROGRAM RESULTED IN A NEAR BREAK-EVEN ESTIMATED PROFIT MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WITH ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL FUTURE COST PRESSURES AS WELL AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE.  RISKS RELATED TO ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING AS WELL AS THE RECURRING COST PROFILE REMAIN ON THIS PROGRAM.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGIES OF KOREA INC. (\"ASTK\") TO OPTIMIZE THE SUPPLY CHAIN UNDER OUR PORTION OF THE E2 PROGRAM. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ASTK WILL BUILD AND TRANSPORT FUSELAGE SHIPSETS TO EMBRAER AND ESTABLISH A FACILITY IN BRAZIL TO MANAGE STOCK AND REPAIRS LOCALLY.  AT THE TIME, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED ITS ROLE AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATOR ON THE PROGRAM.  IN APRIL 2019, WE ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO ASSIGN OUR CONTRACT WITH EMBRAER FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS FOR THEIR PROGRAM TO ASTK.  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL REMAIN A SUPPLIER TO ASTK FOR THE RUDDER AND ELEVATOR COMPONENTS.  WE ANTICIPATE COMPLETION OF THE ASSIGNMENT TO ASTK IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020.  G500/G600  WE ARE IN THE FINAL DEVELOPMENT STAGES FOR THE GULFSTREAM G500/G600 PROGRAMS, AS THESE AIRCRAFT ARE EXPECTED TO ENTER SERVICE IN FISCAL 2020. TRANSITION OF EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS FROM DEVELOPMENT TO RECURRING PRODUCTION LEVELS IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SUCCESS OF EACH PROGRAM AT ACHIEVING FLIGHT TESTING AND CERTIFICATION, AS WELL AS THE ABILITY OF THE OEM TO GENERATE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF AIRCRAFT SALES.  FURTHER COST INCREASES OR AN INABILITY TO MEET REVISED RECURRING COST FORECASTS ON THE G500/G600 PROGRAM MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS RESERVES IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHILE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUTURE COSTS COMPARED TO CURRENT ESTIMATES OR ADDITIONAL COST RECOVERY MAY RESULT IN FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS IF FORWARD LOSS RESERVES ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED.  BOEING 747-8  AS DISCLOSED DURING FISCAL 2016, BOEING ANNOUNCED A RATE REDUCTION TO THE 747-8 PROGRAM, WHICH LOWERED PRODUCTION TO ONE PLANE EVERY TWO MONTHS.  THE IMPACT OF THE RATE REDUCTION RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2016.  IN MARCH 2017, THE COMPANY SETTLED SEVERAL OUTSTANDING CHANGE ORDERS AND OPEN PRICING ON A NUMBER OF ITS PROGRAMS WITH BOEING.  THE AGREEMENT INCLUDED PRICING SETTLEMENTS, ADVANCED PAYMENTS, DELIVERY SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THE MUTUAL RELATIONSHIP ON FUTURE PROGRAMS.  THE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDED FOR CONTINUED BUILD AHEAD ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM THROUGH THE END OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM.  THIS PROGRAM HAS STABILIZED WITH NO ADDITIONAL FORWARD LOSSES BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OR 2018 AND IS ANTICIPATED TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION BY MID-FISCAL 2021.  G280  WE ACQUIRED BOTH THE G280 AND G650 WING PROGRAMS IN FISCAL 2015 AND RECEIVED PROCEEDS FOR $160.0 MILLION AS BOTH CONTRACTS WERE OPERATING AT A LOSS. WHILE OPERATIONS HAVE IMPROVED ON THE G650 SINCE ACQUISITION AS NOTED FURTHER BELOW, THE COST PROFILE OF THE G280 WING PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO RESULT IN FORWARD LOSS CHARGES, INCLUDING $29.1 MILLION IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  IN APRIL 2019, THE COMPANY AND IAI REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO TRANSITION THE MANUFACTURE OF THE G280 WING TO IAI. THE TWO COMPANIES HAVE  DEVELOPED DETAILED TRANSITION PLANS TO ENABLE A SEAMLESS TRANSITION OF WORK. OUR CONTRACT WITH IAI WILL TERMINATE UPON COMPLETION OF THE TRANSITION OF WORK. OUR FORWARD LOSS RECOGNIZED IN  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NOTED ABOVE INCLUDES THE COST TO TRANSITION,  WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED IN MID-FISCAL 2021.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  G650  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH GULFSTREAM TO OPTIMIZE THE SUPPLY CHAIN ON THE COMPANY'S G650 WORK SCOPE. THE G650 WING BOX AND WING COMPLETION WORK, WHICH HAD BEEN CO-PRODUCED ACROSS THREE FACILITIES AT BOTH COMPANIES, ARE BEING CONSOLIDATED INTO GULFSTREAM\u2019S FACILITIES IN SAVANNAH, GEORGIA. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS ROLE AS THE SUPPLY CHAIN INTEGRATOR ON THE PROGRAM AND HAS SINCE RETURNED THIS CONTRACT TO MODEST PROFITABILITY.  ALTHOUGH NONE OF THE DEVELOPMENT OR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS NOTED ABOVE INDIVIDUALLY ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR NET REVENUES, THEY DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL, EITHER INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, TO MATERIALLY AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IF FUTURE CHANGES IN ESTIMATES RESULT IN THE NEED FOR A FORWARD LOSS PROVISION. ABSENT ANY SUCH LOSS PROVISIONS, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DILUTE OUR FUTURE CONSOLIDATED MARGINS.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT IN ITS FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS OR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A REPORTING UNIT'S CARRYING VALUE MAY BE LESS THAN ITS FAIR VALUE.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO COMBINE THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRECISION COMPONENTS REPORTING SEGMENTS INTO ONE REPORTING SEGMENT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 350-20-35-3C, THERE ARE SEVERAL POTENTIAL EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD BE INDICATORS OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.  A CHANGE IN A COMPANY'S REPORTING UNIT STRUCTURE IS ONE OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHEN THIS DOES OCCUR, A COMPANY MUST PERFORM A \"BEFORE AND AFTER\" TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S ENHANCED VISIBILITY INTO ITS FUTURE CASH FLOWS BASED ON ITS ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS WAS ALSO AN INDICATOR.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, IT PERFORMED THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WHICH INCLUDES USING A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT.  AFTER PERFORMING THE \"BEFORE\" PORTION OF THE TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE FORMER PRECISION COMPONENTS' REPORTING UNIT HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT OF  $190.2 MILLION  .  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, OF  $190.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE COMPANY THEN PERFORMED THE \"AFTER\" PORTION OF THE TEST OF THE REPORTING UNITS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE NEW REPORTING UNIT OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURES' GOODWILL HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED THE REMAINING GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT. FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OF  $345.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS (SEE NOTE 2 FOR DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE LEVELS).  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL RELATED TO THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED AS OF THE ANNUAL TESTING DATE.  WE RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2017, OF  $535.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL ASSESSMENT, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE FOR THE VOUGHT TRADENAME SHOULD BE REDUCED FROM A USEFUL LIFE OF  20  YEARS TO A USEFUL LIFE OF  10  YEARS, AS IT BETTER REPRESENTS THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  IN THE EVENT OF SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF REVENUES AND RELATED EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VOUGHT TRADENAME, FURTHER IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2016, WE SETTLED A STRIKE AND AGREED TO A NEW COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH OUR UNION EMPLOYEES WITH IAM DISTRICT 751 AT OUR SPOKANE, WASHINGTON FACILITY WHICH HAD EXPIRED DURING THE QUARTER, RESULTING IN A CHARGE OF $15.7 MILLION DUE TO DISRUPTION COSTS.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, THE COMPANY RATIFIED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS UNION EMPLOYEES WITH UNITED AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA AND ITS LOCAL UNION 848 AT ITS RED OAK, TEXAS FACILITY.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RATIFIED A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT WITH ITS UNION EMPLOYEES WITH UNITED AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA AND ITS LOCAL UNION 952 AT ITS TULSA, OKLAHOMA FACILITY.  DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE STUART, FLORIDA FACILITY PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE EMPLOYEES ELECTED THE UNITED  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AUTOWORKERS OF AMERICA, LOCAL #2505, TO REPRESENT THEM IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WITH THE COMPANY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE UNION AND THE COMPANY WERE STILL ENGAGED IN INITIAL CONTRACT DISCUSSIONS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , NONE OF THE COMPANY'S COLLECTIVELY BARGAINED WORKFORCE ARE WORKING UNDER CONTRACTS THAT ARE EXPIRED OR WILL EXPIRE WITHIN ONE YEAR.  UPON THE EXPIRATION OF A CONTRACT, WE MAY BECOME UNABLE TO NEGOTIATE A CONTRACT WITH A WORKFORCE, THEREFORE OUR OPERATIONS MAY BE DISRUPTED AND WE MAY BE PREVENTED FROM COMPLETING PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS FROM THOSE FACILITIES, WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.  CONTINGENCY PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT WOULD ALLOW PRODUCTION TO CONTINUE IN THE EVENT OF A STRIKE.  DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF THE SHARES OF (I) TRIUMPH PROCESSING - EMBEE DIVISION, INC. (\"EMBEE\") AND (II) TRIUMPH STRUCTURES - LONG ISLAND (\"TS-LI\"), (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"FISCAL 2018 DIVESTITURES\") FOR TOTAL CASH PROCEEDS OF $74.5 MILLION AND A COMBINED LOSS OF $28.3 MILLION PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS LOSS ON DIVESTITURES AND IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EMBEE WERE INCLUDED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND THE OPERATING RESULTS OF TS-LI WERE INCLUDED IN AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH THEIR DATES OF DISPOSAL.  DURING FISCAL 2017, THE COMPANY SOLD (I) TRIUMPH AIR REPAIR, THE AUXILIARY POWER UNIT OVERHAUL OPERATIONS OF TRIUMPH AVIATIONS SERVICES - ASIA, LTD. AND TRIUMPH ENGINES - TEMPE (\"ENGINES AND APU\") AND (II) ALL OF THE SHARES OF TRIUMPH AEROSPACE SYSTEMS-NEWPORT NEWS, INC. (\"TAS-NEWPORT NEWS\"), (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"FISCAL 2017 DIVESTITURES\") FOR TOTAL CASH PROCEEDS OF $69.4 MILLION AND A COMBINED LOSS OF $19.1 MILLION PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS LOSS ON DIVESTITURES AND IS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE.  THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ENGINES AND APU WERE INCLUDED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT AND THE OPERATING RESULTS TAS-NEWPORT NEWS WERE INCLUDED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH THEIR DATES OF DISPOSAL.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S DIVERSE STRUCTURE AND CUSTOMER BASE DO NOT PROVIDE FOR PRECISE COMPARISONS OF THE IMPACT OF PRICE AND VOLUME CHANGES TO OUR RESULTS.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE DISCLOSED THE SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE PREPARE AND PUBLICLY RELEASE ANNUAL AUDITED AND QUARTERLY UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  U.S. GAAP.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \"SEC\") RULES, WE ALSO DISCLOSE AND DISCUSS CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN OUR PUBLIC FILINGS AND EARNING RELEASES.  CURRENTLY, THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE DISCLOSE ARE ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS OUR NET LOSS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, LOSS ON DIVESTITURES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP, WHICH IS ADJUSTED EBITDA, BEFORE PENSION EXPENSE OR BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CURTAILMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, AND OTHER EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES.  WE DISCLOSE ADJUSTED EBITDA ON A CONSOLIDATED AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ON A CONSOLIDATED AND A REPORTABLE SEGMENT BASIS IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASES, INVESTOR CONFERENCE CALLS AND FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE USE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  ALSO, IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY DISCLOSE DIFFERENT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ORDER TO HELP OUR INVESTORS MORE MEANINGFULLY EVALUATE AND COMPARE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WITH OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE VIEW ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP AS OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND, AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO SUCH MEASURES IS NET LOSS.  IN CALCULATING ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP, WE EXCLUDE FROM NET LOSS THE FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL COMPONENTS OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE OUTLINED BELOW THE TYPE AND SCOPE OF THESE EXCLUSIONS AND THE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS A RESULT OF THESE EXCLUSIONS. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE NOT MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER U.S. GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET LOSS, OR AS AN INDICATOR OF ANY OTHER MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES SHOULD NOT RELY ON ADJUSTED EBITDA OR ADJUSTED EBITDAP AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANY U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, INCLUDING NET LOSS.  IN ADDITION, WE URGE INVESTORS AND POTENTIAL INVESTORS IN OUR SECURITIES TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP TO NET LOSS SET FORTH BELOW, IN OUR EARNINGS RELEASES AND IN OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC AND TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED AS PART OF OUR QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND OUR ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K THAT ARE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS OUR QUARTERLY EARNINGS RELEASES, AND COMPARE THE U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITH OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA AND  ADJUSTED EBITDAP.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE USED BY MANAGEMENT TO INTERNALLY MEASURE OUR OPERATING AND MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE AND BY INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS THAT, WHEN  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  VIEWED WITH OUR U.S. GAAP RESULTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATION, WE BELIEVE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS.  WE HAVE SPENT MORE THAN 20 YEARS EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE CAPABILITIES, PARTIALLY THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES.  DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDED ACQUISITIONS, OUR NET LOSS HAS INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CHARGES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP EXCLUDE THESE CHARGES AND PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, APART FROM CHARGES FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  WE BELIEVE THE DISCLOSURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP HELPS INVESTORS MEANINGFULLY EVALUATE AND COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  WE ALSO BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP ARE MEASURES OF OUR ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE ISOLATION OF NON-CASH CHARGES, SUCH AS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND NON-OPERATING ITEMS, SUCH AS INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COST STRUCTURE AND, OVER TIME, HELPS TRACK OUR OPERATING PROGRESS.  IN ADDITION, INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND OTHERS HAVE REGULARLY RELIED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL MEASURES BY WHICH TO COMPARE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  SET FORTH BELOW ARE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE FINANCIAL ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OUR NET INCOME TO CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDAP AND THE MATERIAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH USING THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AS COMPARED WITH NET LOSS OR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  \u2022  GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DIVESTITURES MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE THEY REFLECT GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALE OF OPERATING UNITS.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, WHEN APPLICABLE, MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REFLECTS GAINS OR LOSSES FROM DISPUTES WITH THIRD PARTIES.  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  NON-SERVICE DEFINED BENEFIT INCOME OR EXPENSE FROM OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS (INCLUSIVE OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07 AND CERTAIN PENSION RELATED TRANSACTIONS SUCH AS CURTAILMENTS, SETTLEMENTS, AND EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES) MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT THE COST OF POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS, NET OF THE ASSUMPTION OF RETURNS ON THE PLAN'S ASSETS AND ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF THE CASH PAID FOR SUCH BENEFITS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS (EXPENSES) NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE NON-CASH EARNINGS ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OFF-MARKET CONTRACTS ACQUIRED THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE EARNINGS NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH EARNINGS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE (INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS) MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED ATTRITION OF OUR ACQUIRED CUSTOMER BASE AND THE DIMINISHING VALUE OF PRODUCT RIGHTS AND LICENSES. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CHARGES NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE WEAR AND TEAR ON OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT USED IN OUR OPERATIONS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THESE CHARGES NECESSARILY REFLECT THE CURRENT AND ONGOING CASH CHARGES RELATED TO OUR OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.  \u2022  THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER WE INCUR MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER AND MAY RESULT IN CURRENT CASH INFLOWS OR OUTFLOWS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE COMPONENT OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  \u2022  INCOME TAX EXPENSE MAY BE USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO CONSIDER BECAUSE IT GENERALLY REPRESENTS THE TAXES WHICH MAY BE PAYABLE FOR THE PERIOD AND THE CHANGE IN DEFERRED INCOME TAXES DURING THE PERIOD AND MAY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS OTHERWISE AVAILABLE FOR USE IN OUR BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, WE DO NOT CONSIDER THE AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE TO BE A REPRESENTATIVE COMPONENT OF THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.

WE INTEND TO CONTINUE MAINTAINING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS UNTIL THERE IS SUFFICIENT POSITIVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE REVERSAL OF ALL OR SOME PORTION OF THESE ALLOWANCES.  A REDUCTION IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD THAT THE RELEASE IS RECORDED.

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE  WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, AND PRODUCT SUPPORT.  THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\"CODM\") UTILIZES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PRIMARY MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE OF ITS SEGMENTS AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES.  THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AMONG OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, VARY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN COMPETITORS, CUSTOMERS, EXTENT OF PROPRIETARY DELIVERABLES AND PERFORMANCE.  FOR EXAMPLE, INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDES PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND/OR ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE BECOME THE PRIMARY SOURCE OR ONE OF A FEW PRIMARY SOURCES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR UNIQUE MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES COMMAND A HIGHER MARGIN.  ALSO OEMS ARE INCREASINGLY FOCUSING ON ASSEMBLY ACTIVITIES WHILE OUTSOURCING MORE MANUFACTURING AND REPAIR TO THIRD PARTIES, AND AS A RESULT, ARE LESS OF A COMPETITIVE FORCE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS.  THIS COMPARES TO AEROSPACE STRUCTURES, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDES LONG-TERM SOLE-SOURCE OR PREFERRED SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND THE SUCCESS OF THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDES A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR OUR BUSINESS AND POSITIONS US WELL FOR FUTURE GROWTH ON NEW PROGRAMS AND NEW DERIVATIVES.    IN CONTRAST, PRODUCT SUPPORT PROVIDES MRO SERVICES ON COMPONENTS AND ACCESSORIES MANUFACTURED BY THIRD PARTIES, WITH MORE DIVERSE COMPETITION, INCLUDING AIRLINES, OEMS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.  IN ADDITION, VARIABILITY IN THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF CUSTOMER REQUESTS PERFORMED IN PRODUCT SUPPORT CAN PROVIDE FOR GREATER VOLATILITY AND LESS PREDICTABILITY IN REVENUE AND EARNINGS THAN THAT EXPERIENCED IN INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AND AEROSPACE STRUCTURES SEGMENTS.  INTEGRATED SYSTEMS CONSISTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS THAT PROVIDE INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPORT OF PROPRIETARY COMPONENTS, SUBSYSTEMS AND SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX ASSEMBLIES USING EXTERNAL DESIGNS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2021 NOTES, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $6.3 MILLION OF COSTS, WHICH WERE DEFERRED AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED ON THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM DEBT, SEE NOTE 10 OF \"NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\"  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE HAD A NET CASH OUTFLOW OF $288.9 MILLION FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AN DECREASE OF $570.4 MILLION, COMPARED WITH A NET CASH INFLOW OF $281.5 MILLION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017. DURING FISCAL 2018, THE NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS ($873.1 MILLION), OFFSET BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED EXPENSES DRIVEN BY DECREASED PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS, AND NET SPENDING ON THE G280 AND G650 PROGRAMS ($407.2 MILLION).  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INVENTORY FOR NEW PROGRAMS, WHICH IMPACTS OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. DURING FISCAL 2018, EXPENDITURES FOR INVENTORY COSTS ON NEW PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING PROGRESS PAYMENTS, INCLUDING THE BOMBARDIER GLOBAL 7000/8000 AND THE EMBRAER E-JET PROGRAMS, WERE $384.9 MILLION AND $35.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, INVENTORY FOR MATURE PROGRAMS DECLINED DUE TO DECREASED PRODUCTION RATES AND THE UTILIZATION OF BUILD AHEAD INVENTORY, BY APPROXIMATELY $144.4 MILLION. UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS NETTED AGAINST INVENTORY INCREASED $162.5 MILLION DUE TO TIMING OF RECEIPTS AND RESOLUTION OF OPEN ASSERTIONS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, INCREASED $3.9 MILLION FROM THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, INCLUDED CASH FROM THE DIVESTITURES OF TS-LI AND EMBEE OF $83.1 MILLION OFFSET BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $42.1 MILLION. CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, INCLUDED CASH FROM THE DIVESTITURES OF TAS - NEWPORT NEWS AND ENGINES AND APU OF $86.2 MILLION, OFFSET BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $51.8 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $47.1 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  .  WE FUNDED THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $50.0 MILLION  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO $60.0 MILLION FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2020.  THE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED MAINLY TO EXPAND CAPACITY OR REPLACE OLD EQUIPMENT AT SEVERAL FACILITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS FOR THE AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  LOANS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, BY REFERENCE TO A BASE RATE OR A RATE BASED ON LIBOR, IN EITHER CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN DETERMINED QUARTERLY BASED ON THE COMPANY'S TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY) AS OF THE LAST DAY OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A QUARTERLY COMMITMENT FEE ON THE AVERAGE DAILY UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR EACH FISCAL QUARTER AND FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  ALL OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND COVENANTS CUSTOMARY FOR FINANCINGS OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, A CERTAIN MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND MAXIMUM SENIOR LEVERAGE RATIO (IN EACH CASE AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATES BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND MANAGEMENT'S JUDGMENT. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN SUCH ESTIMATES, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. BELOW ARE THOSE POLICIES APPLIED IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE THE MOST DEPENDENT ON THE APPLICATION OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 2 OF \"NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\"  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS  TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE PRESENTED NET OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, SUCH AS INDUSTRY TRENDS, OUR CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND CREDIT STANDING, AND PAYMENT AND DEFAULT HISTORY. THE CALCULATION OF THE REQUIRED ALLOWANCE REQUIRES A JUDGMENT AS TO THE IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS ON THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF OUR TRADE RECEIVABLES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE AND HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT RESULTED IN MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS WHEN THE ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED TO ACTUAL AMOUNTS.  INVENTORIES  THE COMPANY RECORDS INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST (AVERAGE-COST OR SPECIFIC-IDENTIFICATION METHODS) OR MARKET.  THE COMPANY EXPENSES GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED ESSENTIALLY UNDER COMMERCIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS INCURRED.  THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE COSTS OF INVENTORIES BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT OR AVERAGE COST METHODS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09, WORK-IN-PROCESS INVENTORY WAS CAPITALIZED AS PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09 CHANGES THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING FOR THESE PRE-PRODUCTION COSTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT BALANCES  THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS PRINCIPALLY FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, AND SUPPORT SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC CUSTOMER PROGRAMS.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY ENTERS INTO LONG-TERM MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENTS THAT ESTABLISH GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND MAY DEFINE SPECIFIC PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.  MANY AGREEMENTS INCLUDE CLAUSES THAT PROVIDE SOLE SUPPLIER STATUS TO THE COMPANY FOR THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAM\u2019S LIFE.  PURCHASE ORDERS (OR AUTHORIZATIONS TO PROCEED) ARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO THE MASTER SUPPLY AGREEMENTS.  ADDITIONALLY, A MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS INCLUDE OPTIONS FOR FUTURE PURCHASES.  SUCH OPTIONS PRIMARILY REDUCE THE ADMINISTRATIVE EFFORT OF ISSUING SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE ORDERS AND DO NOT REPRESENT MATERIAL RIGHTS GRANTED TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH ITS CUSTOMERS AND IS THE PRINCIPAL IN ALL CURRENT CONTRACTS.  THE IDENTIFICATION OF A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER FOR PURPOSES OF ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIRES AN EVALUATION OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AGREEMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PRESENTLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS EXIST.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN MAKING THIS EVALUATION THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE OF THE BUSINESS EXCHANGE, THE SPECIFIC CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THE PROMISED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE TERMINATION PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT, AS WELL AS THE NATURE AND EXECUTION OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S ORDERING PROCESS AND HOW THE COMPANY IS AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM WORK.  GENERALLY, PRESENTLY ENFORCEABLE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT CREATED UNTIL A PURCHASE ORDER IS ISSUED BY A CUSTOMER FOR A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF UNITS OF PRODUCT OR SERVICES.  THEREFORE, THE ISSUANCE OF A PURCHASE ORDER IS GENERALLY THE POINT AT WHICH A CONTRACT IS IDENTIFIED FOR ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.  MANAGEMENT IDENTIFIES THE PROMISES TO THE CUSTOMER.  PROMISES ARE GENERALLY EXPLICITLY STATED IN EACH CONTRACT, BUT MANAGEMENTS ALSO EVALUATES WHETHER ANY PROMISES ARE IMPLIED BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, PAST BUSINESS PRACTICE, OR OTHER FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  EACH PROMISE IS EVALUATED TO DETERMINE IF IT IS A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHEN DETERMINING WHETHER A PROMISE IS CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, INCLUDING WHETHER THE CUSTOMER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE GOOD OR SERVICE ON ITS OWN OR TOGETHER WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER, WHETHER THE COMPANY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT SERVICE OF INTEGRATING GOODS OR SERVICES TO DELIVER A COMBINED OUTPUT TO THE CUSTOMER, OR WHETHER THE GOODS OR SERVICES ARE HIGHLY INTERDEPENDENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST OF A WIDE RANGE OF ENGINEERING DESIGN SERVICES AND MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS, AS WELL AS SPARE PARTS AND REPAIRS FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS).  THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR A CONTRACT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FOR FULLY SATISFYING THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT.  TYPICALLY, THE TRANSACTION PRICE CONSISTS SOLELY OF FIXED CONSIDERATION BUT MAY INCLUDE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS SUCH AS UNPRICED CONTRACT MODIFICATIONS, COST-SHARING PROVISIONS, AND OTHER RECEIPTS OR PAYMENTS TO CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY IDENTIFIES AND ESTIMATES VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, TYPICALLY AT THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE FROM ITS CUSTOMERS.  VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS ONLY INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE CONTRACT WILL NOT OCCUR, OR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RESOLVED.  THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT UNDER NORMAL COMMERCIAL TERMS AFTER DELIVERY WITH PAYMENT TYPICALLY REQUIRED WITHIN 30 TO 120 DAYS OF DELIVERY.  HOWEVER, A SUBSET OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENTS BECAUSE THE TIMING OF THE TRANSFER OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER CONTRACT ARE AT THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 DISCRETION.  FOR THESE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY IS NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTING SALES TAX AND HAS MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EXCLUDE FROM THE TRANSACTION PRICE ANY SALES AND OTHER SIMILAR TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS.  AS A RESULT, ANY SUCH COLLECTIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A NET BASIS.  THE TOTAL TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH OF THE IDENTIFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS USING THE RELATIVE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE.  THE OBJECTIVE OF THE ALLOCATION IS TO REFLECT THE CONSIDERATION THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE IS THE PRICE AT WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD SELL A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE SEPARATELY TO A CUSTOMER.  STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES ARE ESTABLISHED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, AND SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICE ARE ALLOCATED ON THE SAME BASIS AS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION.  WHEN STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE NOT OBSERVABLE, THE COMPANY USES EITHER THE \u201cEXPECTED COST PLUS A MARGIN\u201d OR \"ADJUSTED MARKET ASSESSMENT\" APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE.  EXPECTED COSTS ARE TYPICALLY DERIVED FROM THE AVAILABLE PERIODIC FORECAST INFORMATION.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES TRANSFERS TO A CUSTOMER AND IS RECOGNIZED AT THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFERRED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  SERVICE SALES, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTING REPAIR, MAINTENANCE, AND ENGINEERING ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. SALES UNDER LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME ARE RECOGNIZED USING EITHER AN INPUT OR OUTPUT METHOD.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE OVER TIME AS IT PERFORMS ON THESE CONTRACTS BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUOUS TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER AS REPRESENTED BY CONTRACTUAL TERMS THAT ENTITLE THE COMPANY TO THE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT FOR WORK PERFORMED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS NO ALTERNATE USE OR FOR WORK PERFORMED ON A CUSTOMER-OWNED ASSET.  WITH CONTROL TRANSFERRING OVER TIME, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY GENERALLY USES THE COST-TO-COST INPUT METHOD OF PROGRESS FOR OUR CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER THAT OCCURS AS WORK PROGRESSES.  UNDER THE COST-TO-COST METHOD, THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARD COMPLETION IS MEASURED BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF COSTS INCURRED TO DATE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS AT COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS COST ESTIMATES ON SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS ON A PERIODIC BASIS, OR WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND WARRANT A MODIFICATION TO A PREVIOUS ESTIMATE.  COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.  REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES ARE REGULARLY MONITORED AND REVISED BASED ON CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES.  IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON A CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP BASIS, WHICH RECOGNIZES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGES ON CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS BASED ON A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION\u2019S PERCENTAGE OF COMPLETION. FORWARD LOSS RESERVES FOR ANTICIPATED LOSSES ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN FULL WHEN SUCH LOSSES BECOME EVIDENT, TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED, AND ARE INCLUDED IN CONTRACT LIABILITIES ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN CONTRACT VALUES AND ESTIMATED COSTS THAT AROSE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR INCREASED NET SALES,  DECREASED  OPERATING LOSS, NET LOSS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $7.9 MILLION  ,  $(68.7) MILLION  ,  $(68.7) MILLION  AND  $(1.38)  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $46.1 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $114.8 MILLION  .  THESE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE A NON-CASH CHARGE THE COMPANY RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07 OF  $87.2 MILLION  DUE TO A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE FROM A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN COST OF SALES.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES  DECREASED  OPERATING LOSS, NET LOSS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $19.7 MILLION  ,  $13.5 MILLION  AND  $0.27  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.8 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $66.2 MILLION.  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  , CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN ESTIMATES  DECREASED  OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY  $57.2 MILLION  ,  $52.6 MILLION  AND  $1.07  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CUMULATIVE CATCH-UP ADJUSTMENTS TO OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  , INCLUDED GROSS FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $163.3 MILLION  AND GROSS UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $106.1 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDES A REDUCTION TO THE PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FORWARD LOSSES OF  $131.4 MILLION  FOR THE 747-8 PROGRAM.  REVENUES FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE NOT RECOGNIZED OVER TIME ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER.  FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE POINT IN TIME WHEN THE CUSTOMER CAN DIRECT THE USE OF AND OBTAIN THE BENEFITS FROM THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  GENERALLY, THE SHIPPING TERMS DETERMINE THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL TRANSFERS TO CUSTOMERS.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES AS INCURRED.  DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACTUAL BILLING AND PAYMENT TERMS RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  REFER TO NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  THE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE RESULTING FROM TRANSACTIONS OTHER THAN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS PERTAINS TO THE AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR PURCHASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") 350,  INTANGIBLES\u2014GOODWILL AND OTHER  .  UNDER ASC 350, PURCHASED GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED; RATHER, THEY ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES.  UPON ACQUISITION, CRITICAL ESTIMATES ARE MADE IN VALUING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: FUTURE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, CUSTOMER LISTS, AND ESTIMATING CASH FLOWS FROM PROJECTS WHEN COMPLETED; TRADENAME AND MARKET POSITION, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS WILL CONTINUE; AND DISCOUNT RATES.  MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUES.  THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS, AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRODUCT SUPPORT ARE ALSO ITS REPORTING UNITS.  THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\"CODM\").  THE COMPANY'S CODM EVALUATES PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES BASED UPON REVIEW OF SEGMENT INFORMATION. EACH OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS IS COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF OPERATING UNITS WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMPONENTS.  THE COMPONENTS, FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION EXISTS, ARE AGGREGATED FOR PURPOSES OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING INTO THREE REPORTING UNITS.  THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION STRATEGY IS TO ACQUIRE COMPANIES THAT COMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE THE CAPABILITIES OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS OF THE COMPANY. EACH ACQUISITION IS ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE INTEGRATED SYSTEMS REPORTING UNIT, THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT OR THE PRODUCT SUPPORT REPORTING UNIT.  THE GOODWILL THAT RESULTS FROM EACH ACQUISITION IS ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE REPORTING UNIT TO WHICH THE ACQUISITION IS ALLOCATED, BECAUSE IT IS THAT REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS INTENDED TO BENEFIT FROM THE SYNERGIES OF THE ACQUISITION.  THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS USING BOTH THE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS.  THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INVOLVES DETERMINING WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXIST THAT INDICATE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING GOODWILL.  IF BASED ON THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT OR IF THE COMPANY ELECTS NOT TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED AS REQUIRED BY ASC 350 TO DETERMINE WHETHER A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTS AT THE REPORTING UNIT.  THE QUANTITATIVE TEST IS USED TO COMPARE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDS THE CARRYING VALUE, NO FURTHER EVALUATION IS REQUIRED AND NO IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED.  IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE, THEN AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OCCURS.  THE IMPAIRMENT IS MEASURED BY USING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE NOT TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF RECORDED GOODWILL.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS BASED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BEING VALUED.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AN IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND RECORD ANY RESULTING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES AT LEAST ANNUALLY.  CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THESE ESTIMATES AND REQUIRE INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENTS.  WHEN PERFORMING THE QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY'S METHODOLOGY INCLUDES THE USE OF AN INCOME APPROACH WHICH DISCOUNTS FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE AT A RATE THAT REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S COST OF CAPITAL, OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD (\"DCF\").  THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE BUSINESSES.  FACTORS AFFECTING THESE FUTURE CASH FLOWS INCLUDE THE CONTINUED MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED BY THE BUSINESSES, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY THE BUSINESSES AND THE UNDERLYING COST OF DEVELOPMENT, THE FUTURE COST STRUCTURE OF THE BUSINESSES, AND FUTURE TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES.  THE COMPANY ALSO INCORPORATES MARKET MULTIPLES FOR COMPARABLE COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS.  ANY SUCH IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN FULL IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED.  CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL ASSESSMENT IN ITS FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER AND ON AN INTERIM BASIS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF EVENTS OR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE A REPORTING UNIT'S CARRYING VALUE MAY BE LESS THAN ITS FAIR VALUE.  NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, AS REQUIRED BY ASC 350-20-35-3C, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DECISION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, TO COMBINE THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES AND PRECISION COMPONENTS REPORTING SEGMENTS INTO ONE REPORTING SEGMENT.  AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST WHICH INCLUDED USING A COMBINATION OF BOTH THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT.   AS A RESULT OF THE IMPAIRMENT TEST OF EACH REPORTING UNIT, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, OF  $190.2 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN IMPAIRMENT TEST OF THE NEW REPORTING UNIT OF AEROSPACE STRUCTURE AND RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT OF  $345.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS WITHIN IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM SUSTAINED PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS AND SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  THE ASSESSMENT FOR THE COMPANY'S INTEGRATED SYSTEMS AND PRODUCT SUPPORT REPORTING UNITS INDICATED THAT THEIR FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2017, CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S POLICY, THE COMPANY PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL.  THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL RELATED TO THE AEROSPACE STRUCTURES REPORTING UNIT WAS IMPAIRED AS OF THE ANNUAL TESTING DATE.  THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL HAD A FAIR VALUE THAT WAS LOWER THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE BY AN AMOUNT THAT EXCEEDED THE REMAINING GOODWILL FOR THE REPORTING UNIT.  ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31, 2017, OF  $266.3 MILLION  , WHICH IS PRESENTED ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS THE RESULT OF DECLINING REVENUES FROM PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS ON SUN-SETTING PROGRAMS AND THE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED RAMP IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE TIMING OF ASSOCIATED EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS.  FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM  7  TO  30  YEARS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES WHETHER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE REMAINING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MAY WARRANT REVISION OR THAT THE REMAINING BALANCE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EVALUATED FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.  WHEN FACTORS INDICATE THAT LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT, AN ESTIMATE OF THE RELATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IS USED TO MEASURE RECOVERABILITY BASED ON THE PRIMARY ASSET OF THE ASSET GROUP.  SOME OF THE MORE IMPORTANT FACTORS MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS INCLUDE THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXPECTED AND HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE WAY THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS, NEGATIVE EVENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED, AND NEGATIVE INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC TRENDS.  IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING AMOUNT, MEASUREMENT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WILL BE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP, GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE ASSET.  ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET  IN CONNECTION WITH SEVERAL OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, WE ASSUMED EXISTING LONG-TERM CONTRACTS.  BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THESE CONTRACTS, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TERMS OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS TO BE EITHER MORE OR LESS FAVORABLE THAN COULD BE REALIZED IN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AS OF THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION.  AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET OF ACQUIRED CONTRACT ASSETS AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE OF EACH RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL CASH FLOWS OF THE EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS HAD THE CONTRACTS BEEN EXECUTED AT THE ACQUISITION DATE.  THE LIABILITIES PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS THAT WERE INITIALLY EXECUTED AT SEVERAL YEARS PRIOR TO THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION (SEE NOTE 3 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  THE ACQUIRED CONTRACT LIABILITIES, NET, ARE BEING AMORTIZED AS NON-CASH REVENUES OVER THE TERMS OF THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACTS.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET AMORTIZATION OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $67.3 MILLION  ,  $125.1 MILLION  AND  $121.0 MILLION  IN THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017  , RESPECTIVELY, AND SUCH AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN REVENUES IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE BALANCE OF THE LIABILITY AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , IS APPROXIMATELY  $184.6 MILLION  AND, BASED ON THE EXPECTED DELIVERY SCHEDULE OF THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF THE LIABILITY AS FOLLOWS  2020  \u2014  $68.5 MILLION  ;  2021  \u2014  $64.6 MILLION  ;  2022  \u2014  $23.7 MILLION  ;  2023  \u2014  $6.8 MILLION  ;  2024  \u2014  $7.5 MILLION  ;  THEREAFTER  \u2014  $13.4 MILLION.  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  THE LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN AND RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS.  THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE THESE COSTS ARE REVIEWED ANNUALLY OR WHEN A RE-MEASUREMENT IS NECESSARY.  ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATES, AFTER CONSULTING WITH OUTSIDE INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND ACTUARIES, AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST OF ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS BY USING THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO DISCOUNT THE CASH FLOWS REFLECTED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS APPROACH PROVIDES A PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS DUE TO THE CORRELATION BETWEEN PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS TO THE CORRESPONDING SPOT YIELD CURVE RATES.  THE COMPANY AMORTIZES ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES OVER THE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF INACTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS BECAUSE ALMOST ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE INACTIVE.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE ACCOUNTING CORRIDOR IS A DEFINED RANGE WITHIN WHICH AMORTIZATION OF NET GAINS AND LOSSES IS NOT REQUIRED.  THE DISCOUNT RATES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , RANGED FROM  2.54 - 3.88%  COMPARED WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE OF  2.65 - 4.01%  AT  MARCH 31, 2018.  THE ASSUMED EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IS THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE OF EARNINGS EXPECTED ON THE FUNDS INVESTED OR TO BE INVESTED TO PROVIDE FOR THE BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (\"PBO\").  THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS IS BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTUAL HISTORICAL MARKET INDEX RETURNS, ANTICIPATED LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE RELATED INVESTMENT STRATEGY, PLAN EXPENSES AND THE POTENTIAL TO OUTPERFORM MARKET INDEX RETURNS.  THIS RATE IS UTILIZED PRINCIPALLY IN CALCULATING THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENT OF THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE.  TO THE EXTENT THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN ON ASSETS REALIZED OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR DIFFERS FROM THE ASSUMED RATE, THAT YEAR'S ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE IS NOT AFFECTED.  THE GAIN OR LOSS REDUCES OR INCREASES FUTURE PENSION EXPENSE OVER THE AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE EXPECTANCY OF INACTIVE PLAN PARTICIPANTS.  THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR FISCAL  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , WAS  5.00 - 8.00%  .  THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR FISCAL  2020  WILL BE  5.00 - 8.00%.  IN ADDITION TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SOME RETIRED EMPLOYEES.  SUCH BENEFITS ARE UNFUNDED AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  EMPLOYEES ACHIEVE ELIGIBILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THESE CONTRIBUTORY PLANS UPON RETIREMENT FROM ACTIVE SERVICE IF THEY MEET SPECIFIED AGE AND YEARS OF SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.  ELECTION TO PARTICIPATE FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES MUST BE MADE AT THE DATE OF RETIREMENT.  QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS AT THE DATE OF RETIREMENT ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE.  CURRENT PLAN DOCUMENTS RESERVE OUR RIGHT TO AMEND OR TERMINATE THE PLANS AT ANY TIME, SUBJECT TO APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE MADE CHANGES TO THE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO VARIOUS GROUPS OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS.  PREMIUMS CHARGED TO MOST RETIREES FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE PRIOR TO AGE 65 ARE BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND ARE ADJUSTED ANNUALLY FOR CHANGES IN THE COST OF THE PLANS AS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT ACTUARY. IN ADDITION TO THIS MEDICAL INFLATION COST-SHARING FEATURE, THE PLANS ALSO HAVE PROVISIONS FOR DEDUCTIBLES, CO-PAYMENTS, COINSURANCE PERCENTAGES, OUT-OF-POCKET LIMITS, SCHEDULES OF REASONABLE FEES, PREFERRED PROVIDER NETWORKS, COORDINATION OF BENEFITS WITH OTHER PLANS, AND A MEDICARE CARVE-OUT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 715,  COMPENSATION\u2014RETIREMENT BENEFITS  , WE RECOGNIZED THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR BENEFIT OBLIGATION.  THIS FUNDED STATUS IS REMEASURED AS OF OUR ANNUAL REMEASUREMENT DATE.  THE FUNDED STATUS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN'S ASSETS AND THE PBO OR ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE PLAN. IN ORDER TO RECOGNIZE THE FUNDED STATUS, WE DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PLAN ASSETS.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR PLAN ASSETS ARE PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE VALUED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE AS OF THE DATE OF REMEASUREMENT.  INVESTMENTS THAT ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE VALUED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THOSE INVESTMENTS AS OF THE REMEASUREMENT DATE BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF DATA FROM FUND MANAGERS AND COMPARABLE MARKET DATA.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCES EVENTS OR MAKES CHANGES TO ITS BENEFIT PLANS THAT RESULT IN CURTAILMENT OR SPECIAL CHARGES. CURTAILMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN EVENTS OCCUR THAT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE EXPECTED YEARS OF FUTURE SERVICE OF PRESENT EMPLOYEES OR ELIMINATES THE BENEFITS FOR A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES FOR SOME OR ALL OF THEIR FUTURE SERVICE.  CURTAILMENT LOSSES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE CURTAILMENT WILL OCCUR AND THE EFFECTS ARE REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. CURTAILMENT GAINS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RELATED EMPLOYEES ARE TERMINATED OR A PLAN AMENDMENT IS ADOPTED, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE.  AS REQUIRED UNDER ASC 715, THE COMPANY REMEASURES PLAN ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS DURING AN INTERIM PERIOD WHENEVER A SIGNIFICANT EVENT OCCURS THAT RESULTS IN A MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST.  THE DETERMINATION OF SIGNIFICANCE IS BASED ON JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERATION OF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IMPACTING THE PENSION COSTS.  SEE NOTE 15 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THE KEY EVENTS THAT AFFECTED OUR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AND OBLIGATIONS THAT OCCURRED DURING THE  FISCAL YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017.  PENSION INCOME, EXCLUDING CURTAILMENTS, SETTLEMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS (EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVES) FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WAS  $51.5 MILLION  COMPARED WITH PENSION INCOME OF  $61.6 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , AND  $66.5 MILLION  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2017  .  FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 31,  2020  , THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE PENSION INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $44.2 MILLION.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT \u2014 REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220): RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  (\u201cASU 2018-02\u201d).  THE GUIDANCE IN ASU 2018-02 ALLOWS AN ENTITY TO ELECT TO RECLASSIFY THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cACT\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO RETAINED EARNINGS. ASU 2018-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED.  WE ADOPTED ASU 2018-02 EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2019, AND HAVE ELECTED NOT TO RECLASSIFY ANY AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO ACCUMULATED DEFICIT.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  (\"ASC 842\"), WHICH REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET FOR MOST LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS FOR BOTH LESSEES AND LESSORS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS.  THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WHICH MAKES THE NEW STANDARD EFFECTIVE FOR US ON APRIL 1, 2019.  THE COMPANY MAY APPLY THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF ASU 2016-02, AS AMENDED, EITHER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED IN OUR FISCAL YEAR 2020 FORM 10-K, WHICH WOULD BE APRIL 1, 2018, OR ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION, WHICH WOULD BE APRIL 1, 2019.  AMONG OTHER REQUIREMENTS, THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS REQUIRE THE LESSEE TO RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LIABILITY FOR MOST EXISTING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ON THE DATE THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS ARE APPLIED.  THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON APRIL 1, 2019.  THEREFORE, PERIODS PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ADOPTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED USING CURRENT GAAP.  THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED THE KEY TERMS OF ALL OF ITS ACTIVE LEASES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AND HAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED THE APPROPRIATE CONTROLS TO COMPLY WITH THE ADOPTION REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 842.  THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING AND IMPLEMENTING CONTROLS TO COMPLY WITH THE PROSPECTIVE ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 842 AND WILL COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE STANDARD BY APPLYING THE \"PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS\" PROVIDED BY ASC 842 AND DID NOT ELECT TO APPLY THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT PERTAINING TO THE USE OF HINDSIGHT.  THE COMPANY WILL ALSO MAKE CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UNDER ASC 842, INCLUDING (I) THE SHORT-TERM LEASE RECOGNITION EXEMPTION FOR ALL LEASES THAT QUALIFY, MEANING THAT FOR THESE LEASES, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE RIGHT-OF-USE (\"ROU\") ASSETS OR LEASE LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND (II) THE ELECTION TO USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR CERTAIN CLASSES OF ASSETS, MEANING THAT FOR THESE LEASES, THE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF THE ROU ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY BALANCES ON ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S OPERATING LEASES IN THE RANGE OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.0 MILLION  TO  $95.0 MILLION  , FOR WHICH THE MAJORITY PERTAIN TO REAL ESTATE LEASES.  RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS WILL ALSO BE RECOGNIZED WITH A BALANCE COMPARABLE TO THE LEASE LIABILITIES, ADJUSTED FOR PREPAID AND DEFERRED RENT BALANCES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE.  AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 10, THE COMPANY HAS A CAPITAL LEASE LIABILITY OF  $31.3 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  .  THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS TO BE MATERIAL.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ASU 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\"ASU 2014-09\"). SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB ISSUED SEVERAL UPDATES TO ASU 2014-09, WHICH ARE CODIFIED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 606.  ASC 606 ALSO INCLUDES NEW GUIDANCE ON COSTS RELATED TO A CONTRACT, WHICH IS CODIFIED IN ASC SUBTOPIC 340-40,  OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED COSTS - CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU 2017-07 ON APRIL 1, 2018, AND THE REVENUE RECOGNITION AND CONTRACT BALANCES ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE IS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS STANDARD.  REFER TO NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  IN MARCH 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-07,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715).  IMPROVING THE PRESENTATION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION COST AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST  (\"ASU 2017-07\").  ASU 2017-07 REQUIRES ENTITIES TO REPORT THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST IN THE SAME LINE ITEM OR ITEMS AS OTHER COMPENSATION COSTS ARISING FROM SERVICES RENDERED BY THE PERTINENT EMPLOYEES DURING THE PERIOD. FURTHER, ASU 2017-07 REQUIRES THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST TO BE PRESENTED ON THE INCOME STATEMENT SEPARATELY FROM THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT AND OUTSIDE A SUBTOTAL OF INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, IF ONE IS PRESENTED. ADDITIONALLY, ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR CAPITALIZATION, WHEN APPLICABLE.  THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASU 2017-07 ON APRIL 1, 2018.  REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-07.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-12,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR HEDGING  (\"ASU 2017-12\"), WHICH INTENDS TO IMPROVE AND SIMPLIFY ACCOUNTING RULES AROUND HEDGE ACCOUNTING. ASU 2017-12 REFINES AND EXPANDS HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR BOTH FINANCIAL (I.E., INTEREST RATE) AND COMMODITY RISKS. IN ADDITION, IT CREATES MORE TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW ECONOMIC RESULTS ARE PRESENTED, BOTH ON THE FACE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN THE  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOOTNOTES. THE NEW GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON APRIL 1, 2018.  THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW  VF CORPORATION (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS \u201cVF\u201d OR THE \"COMPANY\u201d) IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE DESIGN, PRODUCTION, PROCUREMENT, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF BRANDED LIFESTYLE APPAREL, FOOTWEAR AND RELATED PRODUCTS. VF\u2019S DIVERSE PORTFOLIO MEETS CONSUMER NEEDS ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITIES AND LIFESTYLES. OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON FOUR DRIVERS \u2014 RESHAPE OUR PORTFOLIO, TRANSFORM OUR MODEL, ELEVATE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AND DISTORT ASIA.  VF IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS BRANDS, PRODUCT CATEGORIES, CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION, GEOGRAPHIES AND CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS. WE OWN A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS IN THE OUTERWEAR, FOOTWEAR, DENIM,  BACKPACK, LUGGAGE, ACCESSORY AND APPAREL CATEGORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE MARKETED TO CONSUMERS SHOPPING IN SPECIALTY STORES, DEPARTMENT STORES, NATIONAL CHAINS, MASS MERCHANTS, INDEPENDENTLY-OPERATED PARTNERSHIP STORES AND WITH STRATEGIC DIGITAL PARTNERS, AND OUR OWN DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDES VF-OPERATED STORES, CONCESSION RETAIL STORES AND BRAND E-COMMERCE SITES.  VF IS ORGANIZED BY GROUPINGS OF BUSINESSES REPRESENTED BY ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES. THE FOUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE OUTDOOR, ACTIVE, WORK AND JEANS.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  VF CHANGED TO A 52/53 WEEK FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO MARCH 31 OF EACH YEAR. VF PREVIOUSLY USED A 52/53 WEEK FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO DECEMBER 31 OF EACH YEAR.

ADDITIONALLY, VF CONDUCTS BUSINESS IN OTHER DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD WITH EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO, SUCH AS ARGENTINA, WHICH IS A HIGHLY INFLATIONARY ECONOMY.  IN LIGHT OF THE RECENTLY COMPLETED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND ORGANIZATIONAL REALIGNMENTS, THE COMPANY REALIGNED ITS  22  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  INTERNAL REPORTING STRUCTURE TO REFLECT THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO BETTER SUPPORT AND ASSESS THE OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS.

THE INCREASE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE ACTIVE, OUTDOOR AND WORK SEGMENTS, CONTINUED STRENGTH IN OUR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACQUISITIONS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION, INTEGRATION AND SEPARATION OF BUSINESSES, COSTS RELATED TO RELOCATION AND OTHER STRATEGIC BUSINESS DECISIONS AND DECLINES IN THE JEANS SEGMENT.  \u2022  VF INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND RATE BY 11% IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019, MARKING THE 46  TH  CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF INCREASE IN THE RATE OF DIVIDENDS PAID PER SHARE.  \u2022  VF REPURCHASED  $150.7 MILLION  OF ITS COMMON STOCK AND PAID  $767.1 MILLION  IN CASH DIVIDENDS, RETURNING $917.8 MILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS.

OTHER PROVISIONAL CHARGES OF $42.6 MILLION WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE TAX ON FOREIGN INCOME AND DIVIDENDS AND ESTABLISHING A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FOR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES AS THE COMPANY IS NOT ASSERTING INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT ON SHORT-TERM LIQUID ASSETS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. ALL OTHER FOREIGN EARNINGS, INCLUDING BASIS DIFFERENCES OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, CONTINUE TO BE CONSIDERED INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED 230 BASIS POINTS IN  2017  COMPARED TO  2016  . THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR KEY GROWTH PRIORITIES, WHICH INCLUDE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER, PRODUCT INNOVATION, DEMAND CREATION AND TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES. THE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS IN  2017.  IN  2017  , OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED 40 BASIS POINTS, TO  12.8%  FROM  13.2%  IN 2016. IN ADDITION TO THE ITEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE OPERATING MARGIN DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 70 BASIS POINT INCREASE FROM GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN  2016  THAT DID NOT RECUR IN  2017.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $0.3 MILLION TO $85.9 MILLION IN  2017  . THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND HIGHER INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT BALANCES DUE TO A FULL YEAR OF INTEREST ON THE \u20ac850 MILLION EURO-DENOMINATED 0.625% FIXED-RATE NOTES ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2016, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PAYOFF OF THE $250.0 MILLION OF 5.95% FIXED-RATE NOTES ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017 AND AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT RATES.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IN  2017  WHEN COMPARED TO  2016  PRIMARILY DUE TO DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX ACT. THE TAX ACT REDUCES THE FEDERAL TAX RATE ON U.S. EARNINGS TO 21% AND MOVES FROM A GLOBAL TAXATION REGIME TO A MODIFIED TERRITORIAL REGIME. AS PART OF THE LEGISLATION, U.S. COMPANIES ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A TAX ON HISTORICAL EARNINGS GENERATED OFFSHORE THAT HAVE NOT BEEN REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. ADDITIONALLY, REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY POSITIONS AT THE LOWER FEDERAL BASE RATE OF 21% IS ALSO REQUIRED.

WITHOUT DISCRETE ITEMS, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DURING  2017  DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 1.3% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THE  2016  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

WITHOUT DISCRETE ITEMS, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  2018  DECREASED BY 4.5% COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE APPLIED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  2017  PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF INCOME IN LOWER TAX RATE JURISDICTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM THE TAX ACT.

CASH FROM OPERATIONS IS TYPICALLY LOWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR AS INVENTORY BUILDS TO SUPPORT PEAK SALES PERIODS IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR. CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE CALENDAR YEAR IS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER AS INVENTORIES ARE SOLD AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE COLLECTED. ADDITIONALLY, DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES ARE HIGHEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  41  IN SUMMARY, OUR CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019  TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018  (UNAUDITED)  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  (IN MILLIONS)  2017  2016  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $1,664.2  $1,441.6  $1,474.7  $1,480.6  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (220.6  )  (763.9  )  (776.3  )  (112.4  )  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,591.0  )  (609.7  )  (1,363.0  )  (1,076.9  )  THE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND HELD-FOR-SALE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED, AND REMAIN INCLUDED IN THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE INFORMATION IN THE TABLE ABOVE AND CASH FLOW DISCUSSION BELOW INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOW RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS DEPENDENT ON NET INCOME, ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET CASH USAGE FOR WORKING CAPITAL.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2017  COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2016  AS LOWER NET INCOME WAS OFFSET BY WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN ACCRUED INCOME TAX PAYABLE RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT.  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  RELATED PRIMARILY TO $320.4 MILLION OF NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 COMPARED WITH $740.5 MILLION OF NET CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITIONS DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018. INVESTING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDED $430.3 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019, WHICH IS $215.3 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALES OF BUSINESSES DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES INCREASED $67.6 MILLION COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018.  VF\u2019S INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2017  RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE WILLIAMSON-DICKIE ACQUISITION OF $740.5 MILLION, NET OF CASH RECEIVED. ADDITIONALLY, THE ACTIVITIES INCLUDED $215.0 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF LSG, WHICH IS $99.0 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF THE FORMER CONTEMPORARY BRANDS SEGMENT IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2016  . CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $169.6 MILLION AND SOFTWARE PURCHASES OF $65.2 MILLION OFFSET THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $6.3 MILLION COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2016  . SOFTWARE PURCHASES INCREASED $21.0 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2017  PRIMARILY DUE TO SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR DIGITAL PLATFORM.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $2.1 BILLION NET DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED BY SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET BORROWINGS DURING THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $861.7 MILLION DECREASE IN TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES AND A $248.6 MILLION DECREASE IN PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT.  THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2017  COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER  2016  WAS DRIVEN BY (I) NO LONG-TERM DEBT BORROWINGS IN  2017  COMPARED TO $951.8 MILLION IN PROCEEDS DURING 2016, (II) THE $250.0 MILLION REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT, AND (III) A $199.9 MILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH GENERATED BY SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS.  DURING THE YEARS ENDED MARCH  2019  , DECEMBER  2017  AND DECEMBER  2016  , VF PURCHASED 1.9 MILLION, 22.2 MILLION AND 15.9 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY VF'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THE COST WAS $150.7 MILLION, $1.2 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION WITH AN AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $80.62 , $54.04 AND $62.80 IN THE YEARS ENDED MARCH  2019  , DECEMBER  2017  AND DECEMBER  2016  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $3.8 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE REPURCHASES UNDER ITS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. VF WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS USE OF CAPITAL, GIVING FIRST PRIORITY TO BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND THEN TO DIRECT SHAREHOLDER RETURN IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  VF RELIES ON CONTINUED STRONG CASH GENERATION TO FINANCE ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, VF HAS SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY FROM ITS AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES AND CREDIT FACILITIES. IN DECEMBER 2018, VF ENTERED INTO A $2.25 BILLION SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT (THE \u201cGLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) THAT EXPIRES IN DECEMBER 2023. THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY REPLACED VF'S $2.25 BILLION REVOLVING FACILITY WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN APRIL 2020. VF MAY REQUEST AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF ONE YEAR EXTENSIONS SO LONG AS EACH EXTENSION DOES NOT CAUSE THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS, SUBJECT TO STATED TERMS AND CONDITIONS. THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE USED TO BORROW FUNDS IN BOTH U.S. DOLLAR AND CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR CURRENCIES, AND HAS A $50.0 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT. IN ADDITION, THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY SUPPORTS VF\u2019S U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM FOR SHORT-TERM, SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. OUTSTANDING SHORT-TERM BALANCES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF CORPORATE REQUIREMENTS. BORROWINGS UNDER THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY ARE PRICED AT A CREDIT SPREAD OF 81.0 BASIS POINTS OVER THE APPROPRIATE LIBOR BENCHMARK FOR EACH CURRENCY. VF IS ALSO REQUIRED TO PAY A FACILITY FEE TO THE LENDERS, CURRENTLY EQUAL TO 6.5 BASIS POINTS OF THE COMMITTED AMOUNT OF THE FACILITY. THE CREDIT SPREAD AND FACILITY FEE ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED ON VF\u2019S CREDIT RATINGS.  VF HAS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS FOR BORROWINGS UP TO $2.25 BILLION TO THE EXTENT THAT IT HAS BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY. COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED AS OF MARCH  2019  WERE $650.0  42  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  MILLION AND $15.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING AGAINST THE GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY AT MARCH  2019.  VF HAS $179.5 MILLION OF INTERNATIONAL LINES OF CREDIT WITH VARIOUS BANKS, WHICH ARE UNCOMMITTED AND MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME BY EITHER VF OR THE BANKS. TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS WERE $15.1 MILLION, $25.1 MILLION AND $24.4 MILLION AT MARCH  2019  , MARCH 2018 AND DECEMBER  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. BORROWINGS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 24.6%, 12.0% AND 9.9% AT MARCH  2019  , MARCH 2018 AND DECEMBER  2017  , RESPECTIVELY, EXCLUDING ACCEPTED LETTERS OF CREDIT WHICH ARE NON-INTEREST BEARING TO VF. THE INTEREST-BEARING BORROWINGS INCLUDE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN ARGENTINA.  VF REPAID $250.0 MILLION OF 5.95% FIXED-RATE NOTES ON NOVEMBER 1, 2017, USING A COMBINATION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.  VF\u2019S FAVORABLE CREDIT AGENCY RATINGS ALLOW FOR ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY AT COMPETITIVE RATES. AT THE END OF MARCH  2019  , VF\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE \u2018A\u2019 BY STANDARD & POOR\u2019S RATINGS SERVICES AND \u2018A3\u2019 BY MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, AND COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS BY THOSE RATING AGENCIES WERE \u2018A-1\u2019 AND \u2018PRIME-2\u2019, RESPECTIVELY.  NONE OF VF\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN ACCELERATION OF MATURITY CLAUSES BASED SOLELY ON CHANGES IN CREDIT RATINGS. HOWEVER, IF THERE WERE A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF VF AND, AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, THE 2021, 2023 AND 2037 NOTES WERE RATED  BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE BY RECOGNIZED RATING AGENCIES, VF WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO REPURCHASE THE NOTES AT 101% OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ANY ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST.  CASH DIVIDENDS TOTALED $1.94 PER SHARE IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  AS COMPARED TO $1.72 AND $1.53 IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER  2017  AND  2016  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO WAS 61.7% OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  , AS COMPARED TO 96.2% AND 59.9% IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER  2017  AND  2016  , RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.51 PER SHARE THAT IS PAYABLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REDUCE ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND FOLLOWING THE SPIN-OFF OF THE JEANS BUSINESS IN A MANNER THAT RESULTS IN VF PAYING AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND WITH A LONG-TERM TARGETED PAYOUT RATIO OF 50% TO 55%.  ON MAY 22, 2019, VF COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF ITS JEANS BUSINESS WITH THE NEW COMPANY NOW OPERATING AS AN INDEPENDENT, PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANY UNDER THE NAME KONTOOR BRANDS, INC. (\"KONTOOR BRANDS\"). THE SPIN-OFF IS EFFECTED THROUGH A DISTRIBUTION TO VF SHAREHOLDERS OF ONE SHARE OF KONTOOR BRANDS COMMON STOCK FOR EVERY SEVEN SHARES OF VF COMMON STOCK HELD ON THE RECORD DATE OF MAY 10, 2019. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIN-OFF, KONTOOR BRANDS TRANSFERRED NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.0 BILLION  TO VF AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FROM ITS NEW DEBT ISSUANCE, WHICH VF INTENDS TO USE TO PAY OFF ITS SHORT TERM BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, VF EXPECTS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2020 DRIVEN BY INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS.  TRANSITION PERIOD THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  2018  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  2017  (UNAUDITED)  IN SUMMARY, OUR CASH FLOWS WERE AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH  (IN MILLIONS)  2018  2017  (UNAUDITED)  CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(243.2  )  $(210.2  )  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (56.0  )  (68.3  )  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  406.8  (346.5  )  THE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN SEGREGATED, AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ACCORDINGLY, THE INFORMATION IN THE TABLE ABOVE AND CASH FLOW DISCUSSION BELOW INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF CONTINUING AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FLOW RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS DEPENDENT ON NET INCOME, ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET CASH USAGE FROM WORKING CAPITAL DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND CASH COLLECTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET INCOME IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018.  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $20.8 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $13.5 MILLION COMPARED TO THE 2017 PERIOD.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 WAS DRIVEN BY A $533.8 MILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH GENERATED BY SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND A $188.0 MILLION DECLINE IN TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018, VF PURCHASED 3.4 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AT A TOTAL COST OF $250.3 MILLION (AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $74.46) UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZED BY VF\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 2017. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2017, VF PURCHASED 8.2 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS AT A TOTAL COST OF $438.3 MILLION (AVERAGE PRICE PER SHARE OF $53.32). AS OF THE END OF MARCH 2018, THE COMPANY HAD $4.0 BILLION REMAINING FOR FUTURE REPURCHASES UNDER ITS CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  43  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF VF\u2019S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS AT THE END OF MARCH  2019  THAT WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF FUNDS.  PAYMENT DUE OR FORECASTED BY FISCAL YEAR  (IN MILLIONS)  TOTAL  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  THEREAFTER  RECORDED LIABILITIES.  LONG-TERM DEBT  (1)  $2,138  $5  $5  $502  $1  $955  $670  OTHER  (2)  463  157  71  58  50  43  84  UNRECORDED COMMITMENTS.

(2)  OTHER RECORDED LIABILITIES REPRESENT PAYMENTS DUE FOR LONG-TERM LIABILITIES IN VF\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RELATED TO DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED BENEFITS, PRODUCT WARRANTY CLAIMS AND OTHER LIABILITIES. THESE AMOUNTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED CASH OUTFLOWS. AMOUNTS EXCLUDE LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED INCOME TAX BENEFITS AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS FOR THESE PLANS CANNOT BE DETERMINED DUE TO THE NUMBER OF ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR FUTURE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING RETURN ON ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATE AND FUTURE COMPENSATION INCREASES. THE LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE PRESENTED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY  $17.7 MILLION  TO OUR PENSION PLANS DURING FISCAL 2020. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR PLANNED CONTRIBUTIONS DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN TAX AND OTHER BENEFIT LAWS, CHANGES TO THE PLAN, OR SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPECTED AND ACTUAL PENSION ASSET PERFORMANCE OR INTEREST RATES.  (3)  INTEREST PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT REQUIRED INTEREST PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT AND THE INTEREST PORTION OF PAYMENTS ON CAPITAL LEASES. AMOUNTS EXCLUDE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS, DEBT DISCOUNTS AND ACQUISITION COSTS THAT WOULD BE INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (4)  OPERATING LEASES REPRESENT REQUIRED MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS DURING THE NONCANCELABLE LEASE TERM. MOST REAL ESTATE LEASES ALSO REQUIRE PAYMENT OF RELATED OPERATING EXPENSES SUCH AS TAXES, INSURANCE, UTILITIES AND MAINTENANCE, WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED ABOVE.  (5)  MINIMUM ROYALTY PAYMENTS REPRESENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER LICENSE AGREEMENTS TO USE TRADEMARKS OWNED BY THIRD PARTIES AND INCLUDE REQUIRED MINIMUM ADVERTISING COMMITMENTS. ACTUAL PAYMENTS COULD EXCEED MINIMUM ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS.  (6)  INVENTORY OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT BINDING COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE FINISHED GOODS, RAW MATERIALS AND SEWING LABOR THAT ARE PAYABLE UPON DELIVERY OF THE INVENTORY TO VF. THIS OBLIGATION EXCLUDES THE AMOUNT INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AT MARCH  2019  RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES.  (7)  OTHER OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT OTHER BINDING COMMITMENTS FOR THE EXPENDITURE OF FUNDS, INCLUDING (I) AMOUNTS RELATED TO CONTRACTS NOT INVOLVING THE PURCHASE OF INVENTORIES, SUCH AS THE NONCANCELABLE PORTION OF SERVICE OR MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND (II) CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR APPROVED PROJECTS.  VF HAD OTHER FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE BUT MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF FUNDS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  \u2022  $116.2 MILLION  OF SURETY BONDS, CUSTOM BONDS, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND INTERNATIONAL BANK GUARANTEES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT CONTINGENT GUARANTEES OF PERFORMANCE UNDER SELF-INSURANCE AND OTHER PROGRAMS AND WOULD ONLY BE DRAWN UPON IF VF WERE TO FAIL TO MEET ITS OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  \u2022  PURCHASE ORDERS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT AUTHORIZATIONS TO PURCHASE RATHER THAN BINDING COMMITMENTS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT VF\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND FUNDS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS ITS GLOBAL CREDIT FACILITY, ADDITIONAL BORROWING CAPACITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, TAKEN AS A WHOLE, PROVIDE (I) ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY TO MEET ALL OF ITS CURRENT AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS WHEN DUE, (II) ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TO MAINTAIN THE PLANNED DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATE, AND (III) FLEXIBILITY TO MEET INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES THAT MAY ARISE.  VF DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER LIMITED PURPOSES.  44  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  RISK MANAGEMENT  VF IS EXPOSED TO RISKS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY ASSESSES AND MANAGES EXPOSURES TO THESE RISKS THROUGH OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND, WHEN APPROPRIATE, BY (I) TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL HEDGES WITHIN VF, (II) PURCHASING INSURANCE FROM COMMERCIAL CARRIERS, OR (III) USING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. SOME POTENTIAL RISKS ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  INSURED RISKS  VF IS SELF-INSURED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS EMPLOYEE MEDICAL, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, VEHICLE AND GENERAL LIABILITY EXPOSURES. VF PURCHASES INSURANCE FROM HIGHLY-RATED COMMERCIAL CARRIERS TO COVER OTHER RISKS, INCLUDING DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, PROPERTY AND UMBRELLA, AND TO ESTABLISH STOP-LOSS LIMITS ON SELF-INSURANCE ARRANGEMENTS.  CASH AND EQUIVALENTS RISKS  VF HAD  $543.0 MILLION  OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  . MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT RATINGS OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHOM VF CONDUCTS BUSINESS. SIMILARLY, MANAGEMENT MONITORS THE CREDIT QUALITY OF CASH EQUIVALENTS.  DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN RISKS  AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  , VF\u2019S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED BY A NET TOTAL OF $67.8 MILLION. THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS INCLUDES A $118.4 MILLION LIABILITY RELATED TO OUR UNFUNDED U.S. NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN, $62.9 MILLION OF NET LIABILITIES RELATED TO OUR NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, AND A $113.5 MILLION ASSET RELATED TO OUR U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN. VF HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT CASH CONTRIBUTIONS IN RECENT YEARS TO IMPROVE THE FUNDED STATUS OF ITS PLANS. VF WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE FUNDED STATUS AND FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THESE PLANS, WHICH DEPENDS IN PART ON THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF THE PLANS\u2019 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT VF HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MAKE ANY REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PENSION PLANS IN FUTURE YEARS.  VF\u2019S REPORTED EARNINGS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF ITS PENSION EXPENSE, WHICH HAS RANGED IN RECENT YEARS FROM $34.8 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2017 TO $113.0 MILLION IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016, INCLUDING THE $50.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT CHARGE DISCUSSED BELOW. THESE FLUCTUATIONS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO VARYING AMOUNTS OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES THAT ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO FUTURE YEARS\u2019 EXPENSE. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT IMPACT ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDE THE RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PENSION PLANS, THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO VALUE PARTICIPANT LIABILITIES AND DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PARTICIPANTS.  IN FISCAL 2019, VF APPROVED A FREEZE OF ALL FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS UNDER THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2018. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016, VF TOOK AN ADDITIONAL STEP IN MANAGING PENSION RISK BY OFFERING FORMER EMPLOYEES IN THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN A ONE-TIME OPTION TO RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR DEFERRED VESTED BENEFITS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE PLAN PAID $197.1 MILLION IN LUMP-SUM DISTRIBUTIONS TO SETTLE $224.7 MILLION OF PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY RECORDED $50.9 MILLION IN SETTLEMENT CHARGES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016 TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED DEFERRED ACTUARIAL LOSSES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF THE PENSION PLAN WAS REQUIRED AS ALL DISTRIBUTIONS WERE  PAID OUT OF EXISTING PLAN ASSETS, AND THE PLAN\u2019S FUNDED STATUS REMAINED MATERIALLY UNCHANGED AS A RESULT OF THIS OFFER. HOWEVER, ASSUMING OTHER KEY ASSUMPTIONS REMAIN UNCHANGED, PENSION EXPENSE WILL DECREASE IN FUTURE YEARS DUE TO LOWER AMORTIZATION OF NET DEFERRED ACTUARIAL LOSSES. REFER TO NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d SECTION BELOW.  VF HAS TAKEN A SERIES OF STEPS TO MANAGE THE RISK AND VOLATILITY IN THE PENSION PLANS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN 2005, VF\u2019S U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WERE CLOSED TO NEW ENTRANTS, WHICH DID NOT AFFECT THE BENEFITS OF EXISTING PLAN PARTICIPANTS AT THAT DATE OR THEIR ACCRUAL OF FUTURE BENEFITS. IN MORE RECENT YEARS, THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN HAS BEEN REVISED TO DEFINE DYNAMIC ASSET ALLOCATION TARGETS THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPON CHANGES IN THE PLAN\u2019S FUNDED STATUS, CAPITAL MARKET EXPECTATIONS, AND RISK TOLERANCE. ADDITIONALLY, VF COMPLETED THE ONE-TIME LUMP-SUM OFFERING NOTED ABOVE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016 WHICH REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN BY 23%. ALSO, IN FISCAL 2019, VF APPROVED A FREEZE OF ALL FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS UNDER THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2018. MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ACTIONS THAT MAY HELP TO REDUCE VF\u2019S RISKS RELATED TO ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS.  INTEREST RATE RISKS  VF LIMITS THE RISK OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS BY MANAGING THE MIX OF FIXED AND VARIABLE INTEREST RATE DEBT. IN ADDITION, VF MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISK. SINCE ALL OF VF\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT HAS FIXED INTEREST RATES, THE EXPOSURE RELATES TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ON VARIABLE RATE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (WHICH AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION DURING FISCAL  2019  ). HOWEVER, ANY CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD ALSO AFFECT INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON VF\u2019S CASH EQUIVALENTS. BASED ON THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING FISCAL  2019  , THE EFFECT OF A HYPOTHETICAL 1% INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD BE A DECREASE IN REPORTED NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $8.8 MILLION.  FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS  VF IS A GLOBAL ENTERPRISE SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. APPROXIMATELY  41%  OF VF\u2019S REVENUES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH  2019  WERE GENERATED IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. MOST OF VF\u2019S FOREIGN BUSINESSES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN PERIODS WHERE THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE EURO OR OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES WHERE VF HAS OPERATIONS, THERE IS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON VF\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS UPON TRANSLATION OF THOSE FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS SECTION, MANAGEMENT HEDGES VF\u2019S INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.  THE REPORTED VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THESE FOREIGN BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR NET ADVANCES TO AND INVESTMENTS IN VF\u2019S FOREIGN BUSINESSES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE LONG-TERM, THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON THOSE LONG-TERM ADVANCES IS DEFERRED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OCI IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES FLUCTUATES WITH CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. ON SEPTEMBER 20, 2016, VF ISSUED \u20ac850  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  45  MILLION OF EURO-DENOMINATED FIXED-RATE NOTES WHICH IT HAS DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE OF VF\u2019S INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. BECAUSE THIS DEBT QUALIFIED AS A NONDERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENT, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OR LOSSES OF THE DEBT ARE DEFERRED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND OTHER COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OCI AS AN OFFSET TO THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ON THE HEDGED INVESTMENTS. ANY AMOUNTS DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OCI WILL REMAIN UNTIL THE HEDGED INVESTMENT IS SOLD OR SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED.  VF MONITORS NET FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKET EXPOSURES AND ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE EFFECTS OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS OR SPECIFIC FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS (RELATING TO CROSS-BORDER INVENTORY PURCHASES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCT SALES, OPERATING COSTS AND INTERCOMPANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS). VF\u2019S PRACTICE IS TO BUY OR SELL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS THAT COVER UP TO 80% OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES FOR PERIODS OF UP TO 24 MONTHS. CURRENTLY, VF USES ONLY FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS BUT MAY USE OPTIONS OR COLLARS IN THE FUTURE. THIS USE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO REDUCE THE OVERALL EXPOSURE TO RISKS FROM EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON VF\u2019S CASH FLOWS AND EARNINGS, SINCE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS WILL OFFSET LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED.  FOR CASH FLOW HEDGING CONTRACTS OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  , IF THERE WERE A HYPOTHETICAL 10% CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COMPARED TO RATES AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  , IT WOULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $245 MILLION. HOWEVER, ANY CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGING CONTRACTS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY A CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED EXPOSURE IMPACTED BY THE CURRENCY RATE CHANGES.  COUNTERPARTY RISKS  VF IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES TO DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. TO MANAGE THIS RISK, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COUNTERPARTY CREDIT GUIDELINES AND ONLY ENTER INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE \u2018A MINUS/A3\u2019 INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS OR BETTER. VF CONTINUALLY MONITORS THE CREDIT RATING OF, AND LIMITS THE AMOUNT HEDGED WITH, EACH COUNTERPARTY. ADDITIONALLY, MANAGEMENT UTILIZES A PORTFOLIO OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL COUNTERPARTY DEFAULTS AND ADJUSTS POSITIONS AS NECESSARY. VF ALSO MONITORS COUNTERPARTY RISK FOR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITHIN THE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  COMMODITY PRICE RISKS  VF IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISKS FOR THE PRICING OF COTTON, LEATHER, RUBBER, WOOL AND OTHER MATERIALS, WHICH WE EITHER PURCHASE DIRECTLY OR IN A CONVERTED FORM SUCH AS FABRIC OR SHOE SOLES. TO MANAGE RISKS OF COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES, MANAGEMENT NEGOTIATES PRICES IN ADVANCE WHEN POSSIBLE. VF HAS NOT HISTORICALLY MANAGED COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURES BY USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND RELATED INVESTMENT SECURITY RISKS  VF HAS NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS IN WHICH LIABILITIES TO THE PLANS\u2019 PARTICIPANTS ARE BASED ON THE MARKET VALUES OF THE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 SELECTION OF A HYPOTHETICAL PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT FUNDS. VF INVESTS IN A PORTFOLIO OF SECURITIES THAT SUBSTANTIALLY MIRRORS THE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 INVESTMENT SELECTIONS. THE INCREASES AND DECREASES IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITIES ARE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING INCREASES AND DECREASES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF VF\u2019S INVESTMENTS, RESULTING IN AN INSIGNIFICANT NET EXPOSURE TO OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  VF HAS CHOSEN ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE APPROPRIATE TO ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REPORT VF\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. VF APPLIES THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN A CONSISTENT MANNER. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE APPLICATION OF THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRES THAT VF MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND APPLY JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES, CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. THESE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. BECAUSE VF\u2019S BUSINESS CYCLE IS RELATIVELY SHORT (I.E., FROM THE DATE  THAT INVENTORY IS RECEIVED UNTIL THAT INVENTORY IS SOLD AND THE TRADE RECEIVABLE IS COLLECTED), ACTUAL RESULTS RELATED TO MOST ESTIMATES ARE KNOWN WITHIN A FEW MONTHS AFTER ANY BALANCE SHEET DATE. IN ADDITION, VF MAY RETAIN OUTSIDE SPECIALISTS TO ASSIST IN VALUATIONS OF BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS, IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, EQUITY COMPENSATION, PENSION BENEFITS AND SELF-INSURED LIABILITIES. IF ACTUAL RESULTS ULTIMATELY DIFFER FROM PREVIOUS ESTIMATES, THE REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHEN THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS BECOME KNOWN.  VF BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES INVOLVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS USED IN PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE TO CHANGE FROM OUTSIDE FACTORS. THE APPLICATION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IS DISCUSSED WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  INVENTORIES  VF\u2019S INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. COST INCLUDES ALL MATERIAL, LABOR AND OVERHEAD COSTS INCURRED TO MANUFACTURE OR PURCHASE THE FINISHED GOODS. OVERHEAD ALLOCATED TO MANUFACTURED PRODUCT IS BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF PLANTS AND DOES NOT INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATED TO IDLE CAPACITY OR ABNORMAL PRODUCTION INEFFICIENCIES. VF PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW AT EACH BUSINESS UNIT, AT LEAST QUARTERLY, OF ALL INVENTORIES ON THE BASIS OF  INDIVIDUAL STYLES OR INDIVIDUAL STYLE-SIZE-COLOR STOCK KEEPING UNITS TO IDENTIFY SLOW MOVING OR EXCESS PRODUCTS, DISCONTINUED AND TO-BE-DISCONTINUED PRODUCTS, AND OFF-QUALITY MERCHANDISE. THIS REVIEW MATCHES INVENTORY ON HAND, PLUS CURRENT PRODUCTION AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WITH CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE SALES ORDERS. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS AN EVALUATION TO ESTIMATE NET REALIZABLE VALUE USING A SYSTEMATIC AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGY OF  46  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  FORECASTING FUTURE DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS AND SELLING PRICES LESS COSTS OF DISPOSAL. IF THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, VF PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE TO REFLECT THE LOWER VALUE OF THAT INVENTORY. THIS METHODOLOGY RECOGNIZES INVENTORY EXPOSURES AT THE TIME SUCH LOSSES ARE EVIDENT RATHER THAN AT THE TIME GOODS ARE ACTUALLY SOLD. HISTORICALLY, THESE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMAND AND SELLING PRICES HAVE NOT VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ACTUAL RESULTS DUE TO VF\u2019S TIMELY IDENTIFICATION AND ABILITY TO RAPIDLY DISPOSE OF THESE DISTRESSED INVENTORIES.  EXISTENCE OF PHYSICAL INVENTORY IS VERIFIED THROUGH PERIODIC PHYSICAL INVENTORY COUNTS AND ONGOING CYCLE COUNTS AT MOST LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. VF PROVIDES FOR ESTIMATED INVENTORY LOSSES THAT HAVE LIKELY OCCURRED SINCE THE LAST PHYSICAL INVENTORY DATE. HISTORICALLY, PHYSICAL INVENTORY SHRINKAGE HAS NOT BEEN MATERIAL.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL  VF ALLOCATES THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WITH ANY EXCESS PURCHASE PRICE RECORDED AS GOODWILL. VF EVALUATES FAIR VALUE AT ACQUISITION USING THREE VALUATION TECHNIQUES - THE REPLACEMENT COST, MARKET AND INCOME METHODS - AND WEIGHTS THE VALUATION METHODS BASED ON WHAT IS MOST APPROPRIATE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE PROCESS OF ASSIGNING FAIR VALUES, PARTICULARLY TO ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE.  FAIR VALUE FOR ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS GENERALLY BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK OR TRADE NAME INTANGIBLE ASSETS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREIN AS \u201cTRADEMARKS\u201d) REPRESENT INDIVIDUALLY ACQUIRED TRADEMARKS, SOME OF WHICH ARE REGISTERED IN MULTIPLE COUNTRIES. DEFINITE-LIVED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE BASED ON THE VALUE OF RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHOLESALE CUSTOMERS AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION. DEFINITE-LIVED LICENSE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATE TO VF'S LICENSING CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET TANGIBLE ASSETS AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED, AND IS ASSIGNED AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL.  VF\u2019S DEPRECIATION POLICIES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT JUDGMENTS ON THEIR ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIVES AND RESIDUAL VALUE, IF ANY. VF\u2019S AMORTIZATION POLICIES FOR DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS REFLECT JUDGMENTS ON THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS AND DURATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THOSE ASSETS. IN EVALUATING THE AMORTIZABLE LIFE FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS HISTORICAL ATTRITION PATTERNS FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS. FOR LICENSE-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS HISTORICAL TRENDS AND ANTICIPATED LICENSE RENEWAL PERIODS.  TESTING OF DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS  VF\u2019S POLICY IS TO REVIEW PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. VF TESTS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT AT THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP LEVEL, WHICH IS THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT. VF MEASURES RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET OR ASSET GROUP BY COMPARISON TO THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET. IF THE FORECASTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO BE GENERATED BY THE ASSET ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE ADEQUATE TO RECOVER THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING VALUE, A FAIR VALUE ANALYSIS MUST BE PERFORMED, AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED IF THERE IS AN EXCESS OF THE ASSET\u2019S CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WHEN TESTING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, VF USES THE INCOME-BASED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD USING THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OF THE RESPECTIVE ASSET OR  ASSET GROUP. THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP THROUGH THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE ARE COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP EXCEED ITS CARRYING VALUE, THERE IS NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE AFTER-TAX DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USING AN APPROPRIATE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL (\"WACC\"), AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.  WHEN TESTING DEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARKS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, MANAGEMENT USES THE INCOME-BASED RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, FORECASTED REVENUES FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WITH THE TRADEMARK ARE ASSIGNED A ROYALTY RATE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO LICENSE THE TRADEMARK (IN LIEU OF OWNERSHIP), AND THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE TRADEMARK (REPRESENTING FORECASTED ROYALTIES AVOIDED BY OWNING THE TRADEMARK) ARE COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE TRADEMARK EXCEED ITS CARRYING VALUE, THERE IS NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IF THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF THE TRADEMARK ARE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK IS CALCULATED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DISCUSSED BELOW, AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK AND ITS CARRYING VALUE.  WHEN TESTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS HISTORICAL CUSTOMER ATTRITION RATES AND PROJECTED REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THAT EXISTED AT ACQUISITION. MANAGEMENT USES THE MULTI-PERIOD EXCESS EARNINGS METHOD, WHICH IS A SPECIFIC APPLICATION OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD, TO VALUE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP ASSETS. UNDER THIS METHOD, VF CALCULATES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE AFTER-TAX CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED BY THE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP ASSET AFTER DEDUCTING CONTRIBUTORY ASSET CHARGES.  ROCK & REPUBLIC  \u00ae  IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS  THE  ROCK & REPUBLIC  \u00ae  BRAND HAS AN EXCLUSIVE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENT WITH KOHL'S CORPORATION THAT COVERS ALL BRANDED APPAREL, ACCESSORIES AND OTHER MERCHANDISE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, VF PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF THE  ROCK & REPUBLIC  \u00ae  AMORTIZING TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET TO DETERMINE IF THE CARRYING VALUE WAS RECOVERABLE. WE DETERMINED THIS TESTING WAS NECESSARY BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACT TERMS WOULD BE MODIFIED. MANAGEMENT USED THE INCOME-BASED RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD AND THE CONTRACTUAL 4% ROYALTY RATE TO CALCULATE THE PRE-TAX UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS PERFORMED, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET DID NOT REQUIRE FURTHER TESTING  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  47  AS THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE OF $49.0 MILLION.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VF'S CONCLUSION REGARDING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ANALYSIS AS OF JUNE 30, 2018 WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE.  TESTING OF INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS AND GOODWILL  VF\u2019S POLICY IS TO EVALUATE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS MAY BE BELOW THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT. AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, VF MAY ELECT TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS AS A BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER IT IS NECESSARY TO PERFORM QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT TESTING. IF MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF THESE QUALITATIVE FACTORS INDICATES THAT IT IS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET OR REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THEN NO FURTHER TESTING IS REQUIRED. OTHERWISE, THE INTANGIBLE ASSET OR REPORTING UNIT MUST BE QUANTITATIVELY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT.  AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS QUANTITATIVELY TESTED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK IS BASED ON AN INCOME APPROACH USING THE RELIEF-FROM-ROYALTY METHOD. UNDER THIS METHOD, FORECASTED REVENUES FOR PRODUCTS SOLD WITH THE TRADEMARK ARE ASSIGNED A ROYALTY RATE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO LICENSE THE TRADEMARK (IN LIEU OF OWNERSHIP), AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED AS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THOSE FORECASTED ROYALTIES AVOIDED BY OWNING THE TRADEMARK. THE APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE IS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S WACC THAT CONSIDERS MARKET PARTICIPANT ASSUMPTIONS, PLUS A SPREAD THAT FACTORS IN THE RISK OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE ROYALTY RATE IS SELECTED BASED ON CONSIDERATION OF (I) ROYALTY RATES INCLUDED IN ACTIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS, IF APPLICABLE, (II) ROYALTY RATES RECEIVED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS IN THE APPAREL INDUSTRY, AND (III) THE CURRENT PERFORMANCE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THERE IS NO IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.  GOODWILL IS QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATED FOR POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. REPORTING UNITS ARE BUSINESSES WITH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION THAT IS AVAILABLE AND REVIEWED BY SEGMENT MANAGEMENT.  FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, VF ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT USING BOTH INCOME-BASED AND MARKET-BASED VALUATION METHODS. THE INCOME-BASED APPROACH IS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE USING THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S WACC AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. FOR THE MARKET-BASED APPROACH, MANAGEMENT USES BOTH THE GUIDELINE COMPANY AND SIMILAR TRANSACTION METHODS. THE GUIDELINE COMPANY METHOD ANALYZES MARKET MULTIPLES OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) FOR A GROUP OF COMPARABLE PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE MARKET MULTIPLES USED IN THE VALUATION ARE BASED ON THE RELATIVE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE REPORTING UNIT COMPARED TO THE SELECTED GUIDELINE COMPANIES. UNDER THE SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS METHOD, VALUATION MULTIPLES ARE CALCULATED UTILIZING ACTUAL  TRANSACTION PRICES AND REVENUE/EBITDA DATA FROM TARGET COMPANIES DEEMED SIMILAR TO THE REPORTING UNIT.  BASED ON THE RANGE OF ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES DEVELOPED FROM THE INCOME AND MARKET-BASED METHODS, VF DETERMINES THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR THE REPORTING UNIT. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE GOODWILL IS NOT IMPAIRED AND NO FURTHER REVIEW IS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, VF CALCULATES THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  THE INCOME-BASED FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY REQUIRES MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH VF OPERATES AND CONDITIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONTROL. AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION REQUIRES MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT, ALONG WITH ASSESSMENT OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S STRATEGIES AND FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. FORECASTS OF INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNIT CASH FLOWS INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING.  \u2022  ANNUAL CASH FLOWS, ON A DEBT-FREE BASIS, ARISING FROM FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY, CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL SPENDING AND INCOME TAXES FOR AT LEAST A 10-YEAR FORECAST PERIOD.  \u2022  A TERMINAL GROWTH RATE FOR YEARS BEYOND THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE TERMINAL GROWTH RATE IS SELECTED BASED ON CONSIDERATION OF GROWTH RATES USED IN THE FORECAST PERIOD, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE REPORTING UNIT AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  \u2022  A DISCOUNT RATE THAT REFLECTS THE RISKS INHERENT IN REALIZING THE FORECASTED CASH FLOWS. A DISCOUNT RATE CONSIDERS THE RISK-FREE RATE OF RETURN ON LONG-TERM TREASURY SECURITIES, THE RISK PREMIUM ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTING IN EQUITY SECURITIES OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES, THE BETA OBTAINED FROM COMPARABLE COMPANIES AND THE COST OF DEBT FOR INVESTMENT GRADE ISSUERS. IN ADDITION, THE DISCOUNT RATE MAY CONSIDER ANY COMPANY-SPECIFIC RISK IN ACHIEVING THE PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  UNDER THE MARKET-BASED FAIR VALUE METHODOLOGY, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING MARKET MULTIPLES AND RECENT TRANSACTIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR ITS IMPAIRMENT TESTS ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF THOSE THAT WOULD BE USED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS PERFORMING SIMILAR VALUATIONS OF VF\u2019S REPORTING UNITS.  TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS  THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT INCLUDED THE  TIMBERLAND PRO  \u00ae  BRAND AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE FORMER OUTDOOR & ACTION SPORTS SEGMENT. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEGMENT REPORTING CHANGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TIMBERLAND PRO WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEW REPORTING UNIT. ACCORDINGLY, VF WAS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY IMPAIRMENT AT THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT, AND ALLOCATE TO TIMBERLAND PRO A PORTION OF THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL OF $844.6 MILLION AT THE APRIL 1, 2018 ASSESSMENT DATE.  MANAGEMENT PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT, AND THUS THE GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED.  48  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  MANAGEMENT ALLOCATED $51.5 MILLION OF THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL BALANCE TO TIMBERLAND PRO, BASED ON ESTIMATED RELATIVE FAIR VALUES. THE GOODWILL FOR THE TIMBERLAND PRO REPORTING UNIT IS INCLUDED IN THE WORK REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE REMAINING GOODWILL FROM THE HISTORICAL TIMBERLAND REPORTING UNIT IS INCLUDED IN THE OUTDOOR REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR THE NEW REPORTING UNITS AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NONE.  JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS  THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT INCLUDED THE  WRANGLER  \u00ae  RIGGS  BRAND AND WAS INCLUDED IN THE FORMER JEANSWEAR SEGMENT. IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEGMENT REPORTING CHANGES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WRANGLER RIGGS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEW REPORTING UNIT. ACCORDINGLY, VF WAS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE WHETHER THERE WAS ANY IMPAIRMENT AT THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT, AND ALLOCATE TO WRANGLER RIGGS A PORTION OF THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL OF $142.1 MILLION AT THE APRIL 1, 2018 ASSESSMENT DATE.  MANAGEMENT PERFORMED A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT, AND THUS THE GOODWILL WAS NOT IMPAIRED.  MANAGEMENT ALLOCATED $7.4 MILLION OF THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT GOODWILL BALANCE TO WRANGLER RIGGS, BASED ON ESTIMATED RELATIVE FAIR VALUES. THE GOODWILL FOR THE WRANGLER RIGGS REPORTING UNIT IS INCLUDED IN THE WORK REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE REMAINING GOODWILL FROM THE HISTORICAL JEANSWEAR NORTH AMERICA REPORTING UNIT IS INCLUDED IN THE JEANS REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED WHETHER THERE WERE ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR THE NEW REPORTING UNITS AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NONE.  REEF  \u00ae  IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS  IN MAY 2018, MANAGEMENT COMMENCED A STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT OF THE  REEF  \u00ae  BRAND, WHICH WAS CONSIDERED A TRIGGERING EVENT THAT REQUIRED MANAGEMENT TO PERFORM A QUANTITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET FOR THE  REEF  \u00ae  REPORTING UNIT. BASED ON THE ANALYSES, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK WERE NOT IMPAIRED. FOR GOODWILL, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY 16%. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADEMARK EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.  THE  REEF  \u00ae  BRAND, ACQUIRED IN 2005, SOLD SURF-INSPIRED PRODUCTS INCLUDING SANDALS, SHOES, SWIMWEAR, CASUAL APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN. PRODUCTS WERE SOLD GLOBALLY THROUGH SPECIALTY STORES, SPORTING GOODS CHAINS, DEPARTMENT STORES, INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE. AS PART OF THE 2009 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSES, VF RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $31.1 MILLION AND $5.6 MILLION RELATED TO THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK, RESPECTIVELY. THE REMAINING CARRYING VALUES OF THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK AT THE MAY 26, 2018 TESTING DATE WERE $48.3 MILLION AND $74.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. UNTIL ITS SALE IN OCTOBER 2018, THE  REEF  \u00ae  BRAND WAS INCLUDED IN THE ACTIVE REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY FORECASTS USED IN THE  REEF  \u00ae  REPORTING UNIT AND INTANGIBLE ASSET VALUATIONS CONSIDERED HISTORICAL  REEF  \u00ae  PERFORMANCE, STRATEGIC INITIATIVES FOR THE  REEF  \u00ae  REPORTING UNIT AND INDUSTRY TRENDS. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE VALUATIONS WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT WOULD BE USED BY MARKET PARTICIPANTS PERFORMING INDEPENDENT VALUATIONS OF THE BUSINESS.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS DEVELOPED BY VF MANAGEMENT AND USED IN THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES OF THE  REEF  \u00ae  REPORTING UNIT AND TRADEMARK INCLUDE.  \u2022  MODEST GROWTH IN THE WHOLESALE CHANNEL DRIVEN BY NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND DOOR EXPANSION WITH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS;  \u2022  MODEST GROWTH IN THE E-COMMERCE BUSINESS;  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TRENDING CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL  REEF  \u00ae  PERFORMANCE;  \u2022  ROYALTY RATES BASED ON ACTIVE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OF THE BRAND; AND,  \u2022  MARKET-BASED DISCOUNT RATES.  MANAGEMENT MADE ITS ESTIMATES BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF OUR ASSESSMENT, USING ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PERFORMING AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF THE BUSINESS. VF COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE  REEF  \u00ae  BRAND BUSINESS ON OCTOBER 26, 2018.  FISCAL  2019  ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING  MANAGEMENT PERFORMED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . MANAGEMENT PERFORMED A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS AND TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW IN THE \u201cQUALITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS\u201d SECTION.  QUALITATIVE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS  FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS, VF ELECTED TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN THOSE REPORTING UNITS WERE IMPAIRED. IN THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, VF CONSIDERED RELEVANT EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT, INCLUDING (I) CURRENT YEAR RESULTS, (II) FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE VERSUS MANAGEMENT\u2019S ANNUAL AND FIVE-YEAR STRATEGIC PLANS, (III) CHANGES IN THE REPORTING UNIT CARRYING VALUE SINCE PRIOR YEAR, (IV) INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNIT OPERATES, (V) MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING DISCOUNT RATE CHANGES, AND (VI) CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY THE REPORTING UNIT. IF APPLICABLE, PERFORMANCE IN RECENT YEARS WAS COMPARED TO FORECASTS INCLUDED IN PRIOR VALUATIONS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, VF CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE GOODWILL AND TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE GREATER THAN THEIR FAIR VALUES, AND THAT FURTHER QUANTITATIVE TESTING WAS NOT NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S USE OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  MANAGEMENT MADE ITS ESTIMATES BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF OUR ASSESSMENT, USING ASSUMPTIONS WE BELIEVE MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PERFORMING AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF THE BUSINESS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT VF\u2019S CONCLUSIONS REGARDING IMPAIRMENT OR RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS IN ANY REPORTING UNIT COULD CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED IN OUR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE, IF, FOR EXAMPLE, (I) THE  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  49  BUSINESSES DO NOT PERFORM AS PROJECTED, (II) OVERALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN FISCAL 2020 OR FUTURE YEARS VARY FROM CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS (INCLUDING CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES), (III) BUSINESS CONDITIONS OR STRATEGIES FOR A SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING LOSS OF MAJOR CUSTOMERS, (IV) INVESTORS REQUIRE HIGHER RATES OF RETURN ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN THE MARKETPLACE, OR (V) ENTERPRISE VALUES OF COMPARABLE PUBLICLY  TRADED COMPANIES, OR ACTUAL SALES TRANSACTIONS OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES, WERE TO DECLINE, RESULTING IN LOWER MULTIPLES OF REVENUES AND EBITDA.  A FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSETS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON VF\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  STOCK OPTIONS  VF USES A LATTICE OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. VF BELIEVES THAT A LATTICE MODEL PROVIDES A REFINED ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS BECAUSE IT CAN INCORPORATE (I) HISTORICAL OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS AND MULTIPLE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS FOR EACH OF SEVERAL GROUPS OF OPTION HOLDERS, AND (II) INPUTS THAT VARY OVER TIME, SUCH AS ASSUMPTIONS FOR INTEREST RATES AND VOLATILITY. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF ALL ASSUMPTIONS EMPLOYED IN THE VALUATION OF OPTION GRANTS AND BELIEVES THEY ARE REFLECTIVE OF THE OUTSTANDING OPTIONS AND UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AND OF GROUPS OF OPTION PARTICIPANTS. THE LATTICE VALUATION INCORPORATES THE ASSUMPTIONS LISTED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ONE OF THE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS IN THE VALUATION PROCESS IS ESTIMATING THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THE OPTIONS BEFORE THEY ARE EXERCISED. FOR EACH OPTION GRANT, VF ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE BASED ON EVALUATIONS OF THE HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED  OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS FOR EACH OF THE GROUPS OF OPTION HOLDERS THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY EXHIBITED DIFFERENT OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS. THESE EVALUATIONS INCLUDED (I) VOLUNTARY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF VF COMMON STOCK AND PERIODS OF TIME THAT OPTIONS ARE OUTSTANDING BEFORE EXERCISE, AND (II) INVOLUNTARY EXERCISE PATTERNS RESULTING FROM TURNOVER, RETIREMENT AND DEATH.  VOLATILITY IS ANOTHER CRITICAL ASSUMPTION REQUIRING JUDGMENT. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES OF FUTURE VOLATILITY ON A COMBINATION OF IMPLIED AND HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. IMPLIED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON SHORT-TERM (6 TO 9 MONTHS) PUBLICLY TRADED NEAR-THE-MONEY OPTIONS ON VF COMMON STOCK. VF MEASURES HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OVER A TEN-YEAR PERIOD, CORRESPONDING TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE OPTIONS, USING DAILY STOCK PRICES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSUMPTION FOR VALUATION PURPOSES IS THAT EXPECTED VOLATILITY STARTS AT A LEVEL EQUAL TO THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND THEN TRANSITIONS TO THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE TEN-YEAR OPTION TERM.  PENSION OBLIGATIONS  VF SPONSORS A QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN COVERING MOST FULL-TIME U.S. EMPLOYEES HIRED BEFORE 2005 AND AN UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN (\"U.S. PENSION PLANS\") THAT PROVIDES BENEFITS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY INCOME TAX REGULATIONS. IN FISCAL 2019, VF APPROVED A FREEZE OF ALL FUTURE BENEFIT ACCRUALS UNDER THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2018. VF ALSO SPONSORS CERTAIN NON-U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. THE SELECTION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS FOR DETERMINING THE PROJECTED PENSION BENEFIT LIABILITIES AND ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE IS SIGNIFICANT DUE TO AMOUNTS INVOLVED AND THE LONG TIME PERIOD OVER WHICH BENEFITS ARE ACCRUED AND PAID.  ANNUALLY, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS THE PRINCIPAL ECONOMIC ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND REVISES THEM AS APPROPRIATE BASED ON CURRENT RATES AND TRENDS AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. VF ALSO PERIODICALLY REVIEWS AND REVISES, AS NECESSARY, OTHER PLAN ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS RATES OF COMPENSATION INCREASES, RETIREMENT, TERMINATION, DISABILITY AND MORTALITY. VF BELIEVES THE ASSUMPTIONS APPROPRIATELY REFLECT THE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 DEMOGRAPHICS AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PLANS AND RESULT IN THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PLANS\u2019 FUTURE EXPERIENCE. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM THE ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED.  THE BELOW DISCUSSION OF DISCOUNT RATE, RETURN ON ASSETS AND MORTALITY ASSUMPTIONS RELATES SPECIFICALLY TO THE U.S. PENSION PLANS, AS THEY COMPRISE APPROXIMATELY  91%  OF VF\u2019S TOTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS AND APPROXIMATELY  88%  OF VF\u2019S TOTAL PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMBINED U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PLANS.  ONE OF THE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE ACTUARIAL MODEL IS THE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICH IS USED TO ESTIMATE THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS NECESSARY TO MEET PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SPECIFIC PLAN. IT IS THE ESTIMATED INTEREST RATE THAT VF COULD USE TO SETTLE ITS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE VALUATION DATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES. VF SELECTS A DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH OF THE U.S. PENSION PLANS BY MATCHING HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND YIELDS TO THE TIMING OF PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO PARTICIPANTS IN EACH PLAN. VF USES THE POPULATION OF U.S. CORPORATE BONDS RATED \u2018AA\u2019 BY MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR\u2019S RATINGS SERVICES. VF EXCLUDES THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST YIELDING BONDS FROM THIS POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,046 SUCH BONDS. THE BONDS MUST BE NONCALLABLE/NONPUTABLE UNLESS MAKE-WHOLE PROVISIONS EXIST. EACH PLAN\u2019S PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS ARE MATCHED TO CURRENT MARKET INTEREST RATES OVER THE EXPECTED PAYMENT PERIOD TO CALCULATE AN ASSOCIATED PRESENT VALUE. A SINGLE EQUIVALENT DISCOUNT RATE IS THEN DETERMINED THAT PRODUCES THE SAME PRESENT VALUE. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE IS REFLECTIVE OF BOTH THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT AND THE PLAN\u2019S DISTINCT LIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS. VF BELIEVES THAT THOSE \u2018AA\u2019 RATED ISSUES MEET THE \u201cHIGH QUALITY\u201d INTENT OF THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND THAT THE FISCAL 2019 DISCOUNT RATES OF 3.98% FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND 3.99% FOR THE UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN APPROPRIATELY REFLECT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE U.S. PENSION PLANS. THESE HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES, COMPARED WITH THE RATES OF 3.66% FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AND 3.70% FOR THE UNFUNDED SUPPLEMENTAL DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AT THE END OF DECEMBER 2017, REFLECT THE GENERAL INCREASE IN YIELDS  50  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  OF U.S. GOVERNMENT OBLIGATIONS AND HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS DURING FISCAL 2019.  VF UTILIZES THE SPOT RATE APPROACH TO MEASURE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS. UNDER THE SPOT RATE APPROACH, THE FULL YIELD CURVE IS APPLIED SEPARATELY TO CASH FLOWS FOR EACH PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, SERVICE COST, AND INTEREST COST FOR A MORE PRECISE CALCULATION.  ANOTHER CRITICAL ASSUMPTION OF THE ACTUARIAL MODEL IS THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON INVESTMENTS. VF\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO INVEST IN A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS WITH AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK TO MAXIMIZE THE LONG-TERM RETURN WHILE MINIMIZING VOLATILITY IN THE VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS RELATIVE TO THE VALUE OF PLAN LIABILITIES. THESE RISKS INCLUDE MARKET, INTEREST RATE, CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, REGULATORY AND FOREIGN SECURITIES RISKS. INVESTMENT ASSETS CONSIST OF CASH EQUIVALENTS, U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY, CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENTAL FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, INSURANCE CONTRACTS, AND ALTERNATIVE ASSETS. VF DEVELOPS A PROJECTED RATE OF RETURN FOR EACH OF THE INVESTMENT ASSET CLASSES BASED ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS, THE ESTIMATED INFLATION RATE, THE PREMIUM TO BE EARNED IN EXCESS OF A RISK-FREE RETURN, THE PREMIUM FOR EQUITY RISK AND THE PREMIUM FOR LONGER DURATION FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE PROJECTED LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN OF THE VARIOUS ASSETS HELD BY THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTION. VF\u2019S RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION WAS 5.70% IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019, 5.85% IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 AND 6.00% IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2017 AND 2016. IN RECENT YEARS, VF HAS ALTERED THE INVESTMENT MIX BY (I) INCREASING THE ALLOCATION TO FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS AND REDUCING THE ALLOCATION TO EQUITY INVESTMENTS, AND (II) INCREASING THE ALLOCATION IN EQUITIES TO MORE INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. THE CHANGES IN ASSET ALLOCATION ARE ANTICIPATED, OVER TIME, TO REDUCE THE YEAR-TO-YEAR VARIABILITY OF THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN\u2019S FUNDED STATUS AND RESULTING PENSION EXPENSE. MANAGEMENT MONITORS THE PLAN\u2019S ASSET ALLOCATION TO BALANCE RISK WITH ANTICIPATED INVESTMENT RETURNS IN A GIVEN YEAR. BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND PROJECTED MARKET RETURNS, VF WILL BE USING A RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION OF 5.70% FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN FOR FISCAL 2020.  WE CONSISTENTLY REVIEW ALL OF OUR DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS AS PART OF THE NORMAL MANAGEMENT OF OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS, AND UPDATE THESE ASSUMPTIONS AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY PERFORMED A DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS STUDY IN 2017 AND UPDATED THE ASSUMPTIONS, AS NECESSARY, IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 VALUATIONS.  IN 2014, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (SOA) ISSUED NEW MORTALITY TABLES (RP-2014) AND MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALES (MP-2014) WHICH REFLECT LONGER LIFE EXPECTANCIES THAN THE PREVIOUS TABLES. IN 2017, THE SOA ISSUED UPDATED SCALES (MP-2017), WHICH WERE ADJUSTED FOR CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR PLAN-SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND OTHER DATA WHERE APPROPRIATE, IN DEVELOPING OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED MORTALITY RATES OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE U.S. PENSION PLANS. MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE MORTALITY ASSUMPTION AND CONCLUDED NO CHANGE WAS NEEDED FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL RESULTS IN A GIVEN YEAR AND THE ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED ASSUMED RESULTS FOR THAT YEAR (E.G., INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE, DISCOUNT RATES AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS) DO NOT AFFECT THAT YEAR\u2019S PENSION EXPENSE, BUT INSTEAD ARE DEFERRED AS UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AT THE END OF FISCAL 2019 FOR ALL PENSION PLANS, THERE WERE  $399.1 MILLION  OF PRETAX ACCUMULATED DEFERRED ACTUARIAL LOSSES, PLUS  $0.6 MILLION  OF PRETAX DEFERRED PRIOR SERVICE COSTS, RESULTING IN AN AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF $243.2 MILLION  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN THE MARCH 2019 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THESE DEFERRED LOSSES WILL BE AMORTIZED AS A COMPONENT OF PENSION EXPENSE.  PENSION EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WAS  $39.7 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019,  $4.6 MILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018  AND  $34.8 MILLION  AND  $113.0 MILLION  IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. PENSION EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016 WAS HIGHER AS IT INCLUDED A $50.9 MILLION SETTLEMENT CHARGE RESULTING FROM 9,400 PARTICIPANTS ACCEPTING A ONE-TIME OPTION TO RECEIVE A DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR DEFERRED VESTED BENEFITS (REFER TO NOTE 15). THE COST OF PENSION BENEFITS ACTUALLY EARNED EACH YEAR BY COVERED ACTIVE EMPLOYEES (COMMONLY CALLED \u201cSERVICE COST\u201d) WAS  $22.4 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019,  $5.9 MILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018  ,  $24.9 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2017 AND  $25.8 MILLION  IN THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2016. PENSION EXPENSE WAS HIGHER IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 2017 DUE TO SETTLEMENT AND CURTAILMENT CHARGES IN THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 2019 (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 15) AND HIGHER INTEREST COSTS RESULTING FROM HIGHER INTEREST RATES FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AMORTIZATION OF UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL LOSSES. LOOKING FORWARD, VF EXPECTS PENSION INCOME FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION AS A RESULT OF LOWER AMORTIZATION OF UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL LOSSES AND LOWER SERVICES COSTS.  THE SENSITIVITY OF CHANGES IN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ON FISCAL  2019  PENSION EXPENSE AND ON PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN AT THE END OF FISCAL  2019  , ALL OTHER FACTORS BEING EQUAL, IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FOLLOWING.  INCREASE (DECREASE) IN  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  PENSION EXPENSE  PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS  0.50% DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE  $15  $91  0.50% INCREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE  (9  )  (83  )  0.50% DECREASE IN EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURN  8  \u2014  0.50% INCREASE IN EXPECTED INVESTMENT RETURN  (8  )  \u2014  0.50% DECREASE IN RATE OF COMPENSATION CHANGE  (1  )  \u2014  0.50% INCREASE IN RATE OF COMPENSATION CHANGE  1  \u2014  AS DISCUSSED IN THE \u201cRISK MANAGEMENT\u201d SECTION ABOVE, VF HAS TAKEN A SERIES OF STEPS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY IN THE PENSION PLANS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ON A LONGER-TERM BASIS, VF BELIEVES THE YEAR-TO-YEAR VARIABILITY OF THE RETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE SHOULD DECREASE.  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  51  INCOME TAXES  AS A GLOBAL COMPANY, VF IS SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES AND FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN OVER 100 U.S. AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS EACH YEAR. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, VF HAS BEEN GRANTED A LOWER EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ON TAXABLE EARNINGS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. DUE TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TAX RATES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN ITS TAX RATES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES. VF MAKES AN ONGOING ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE RELATED TO INCREASES IN TAX RATES IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH VF OPERATES.  IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE EUROPEAN UNION COMMISSION (\u201cEU\u201d) OPENED A STATE AID INVESTIGATION INTO BELGIUM\u2019S RULINGS. ON JANUARY 11, 2016, THE EU ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION THAT THESE RULINGS WERE ILLEGAL AND ORDERED THAT TAX BENEFITS GRANTED UNDER THESE RULINGS SHOULD BE COLLECTED FROM THE AFFECTED COMPANIES, INCLUDING VF. ON MARCH 22, 2016, THE BELGIUM GOVERNMENT FILED AN APPEAL SEEKING ANNULMENT OF THE EU DECISION. ADDITIONALLY, ON JUNE 21, 2016, VF EUROPE BVBA FILED ITS OWN APPLICATION FOR ANNULMENT OF THE EU DECISION. ON DECEMBER 22, 2016, BELGIUM ADOPTED A LAW WHICH ENTITLED THE BELGIUM TAX AUTHORITIES TO ISSUE TAX ASSESSMENTS AND DEMAND TIMELY PAYMENTS FROM COMPANIES WHICH BENEFITED FROM THE EXCESS PROFITS REGIME. ON JANUARY 10, 2017, VF EUROPE BVBA RECEIVED AN ASSESSMENT FOR \u20ac31.9 MILLION TAX AND INTEREST RELATED TO EXCESS PROFITS BENEFITS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS. VF EUROPE BVBA REMITTED \u20ac31.9 MILLION ($33.9 MILLION) ON JANUARY 13, 2017, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS AN INCOME TAX RECEIVABLE IN 2017 BASED ON THE EXPECTED SUCCESS OF THE AFOREMENTIONED REQUESTS FOR ANNULMENT. AN ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENT OF \u20ac3.1 MILLION ($3.8 MILLION) WAS RECEIVED AND PAID IN JANUARY 2018. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2019 THE GENERAL COURT ANNULLED THE EU DECISION AND ON APRIL 26, 2019 THE EU APPEALED THE GENERAL COURT\u2019S ANNULMENT. BOTH LISTED REQUESTS FOR ANNULMENT REMAIN OPEN AND UNRESOLVED. IF THIS MATTER IS ADVERSELY RESOLVED, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT BE COLLECTED BY VF.  THE CALCULATION OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO LEGAL INTERPRETATION AND SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. VF\u2019S INCOME TAX RETURNS ARE REGULARLY EXAMINED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES, AND THOSE AUDITS MAY RESULT IN PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS. VF HAS REVIEWED ALL ISSUES RAISED UPON EXAMINATION, AS WELL AS ANY EXPOSURE FOR ISSUES THAT MAY BE RAISED IN FUTURE EXAMINATIONS. VF HAS EVALUATED THESE POTENTIAL ISSUES UNDER THE \u201cMORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT\u201d STANDARD OF THE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE. A TAX POSITION IS RECOGNIZED IF IT MEETS THIS STANDARD AND IS MEASURED AT THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED. SUCH JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE BASED ON AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, COURT CASES AND INTERPRETATION OF TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS. INCOME TAX EXPENSE COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED TO THE EXTENT VF PREVAILS IN A TAX POSITION OR WHEN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRES FOR A TAX POSITION FOR WHICH A LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OR VALUATION ALLOWANCES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED, OR TO THE EXTENT VF IS REQUIRED TO PAY AMOUNTS GREATER THAN THE ESTABLISHED LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. VF DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS FROM THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF INCOME TAX UNCERTAINTIES. THERE ARE NO ACCRUALS FOR GENERAL OR UNKNOWN TAX EXPENSES.  VF HAS $249.4 MILLION OF GROSS DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS RELATED TO OPERATING LOSS AND CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, AND $178.3 MILLION OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES AGAINST THOSE ASSETS. REALIZATION OF  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RELATED TO OPERATING LOSS AND CAPITAL LOSS CARRYFORWARDS IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN SPECIFIC JURISDICTIONS, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN, AND ON POSSIBLE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS. IF MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT VF WILL NOT BE ABLE TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME OR CAPITAL GAINS TO OFFSET LOSSES DURING THE CARRYFORWARD PERIODS, VF RECORDS VALUATION ALLOWANCES TO REDUCE THOSE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE ULTIMATELY REALIZED. IF IN A FUTURE PERIOD MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO BE REALIZED DIFFERS FROM THE NET RECORDED AMOUNT, VF WOULD RECORD AN ADJUSTMENT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THAT FUTURE PERIOD.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED THE TAX ACT. THE TAX ACT INCLUDED A BROAD RANGE OF COMPLEX PROVISIONS IMPACTING THE TAXATION OF MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES. GENERALLY, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACTS OF NEWLY ENACTED TAX LEGISLATION IS REQUIRED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT; HOWEVER, IN RESPONSE TO THE COMPLEXITIES AND AMBIGUITY SURROUNDING THE TAX ACT, THE SEC RELEASED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) TO PROVIDE COMPANIES WITH RELIEF AROUND THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX ACT. PURSUANT TO SAB 118, THE SEC PROVIDED A ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD FOR COMPANIES TO ANALYZE AND FINALIZE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX ACT. DURING THE ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD, SAB 118 ALLOWED COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS WHEN REASONABLE ESTIMATES COULD BE MADE FOR THE IMPACTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT.  VF FINALIZED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX ACT DURING THE ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD UNDER SAB 118, AND RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL NET CHARGES OF $18.2 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $14.3 MILLION TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX, ADDITIONAL TAX BENEFITS OF $0.3 MILLION RELATED TO REVALUING U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING THE NEW U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 21%, AND $4.2 MILLION TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO ESTABLISHING A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY FOR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES, RESULTING IN A CUMULATIVE NET CHARGE OF $483.7 MILLION. THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE $5.1 MILLION OF NET TAX BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2018 AND $23.3 MILLION OF NET TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING FISCAL 2019.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019 FINAL REGULATIONS UNDER SECTION 965 RELATED TO THE TRANSITION TAX WERE RELEASED. AFTER ANALYZING THESE REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL NET CHARGE OF $13.9 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $20.7 MILLION TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO TRANSITION TAX AND A NET TAX BENEFIT OF $6.8 MILLION RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THE FINAL REGULATIONS.  THE INCOME TAX PAYABLE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TRANSITION TAX IS DUE OVER AN 8-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN 2018. AT MARCH 30, 2019, A NONCURRENT INCOME TAX PAYABLE OF APPROXIMATELY $416.1 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TRANSITION TAX IS REFLECTED IN \"OTHER LIABILITIES\" OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  THE TAX ACT CREATED A NEW TAX ON CERTAIN GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAX INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d) FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS. UNDER GAAP, COMPANIES MAY MAKE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION TO EITHER TREAT TAXES RESULTING FROM GILTI AS A CURRENT-PERIOD EXPENSE WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED OR FACTOR SUCH AMOUNTS INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAXES. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND DETERMINED IT WILL TREAT THE TAXES RESULTING FROM GILTI AS A CURRENT-PERIOD EXPENSE, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE TREATMENT PRIOR TO THE ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION.  52  VF CORPORATION FISCAL 2019 FORM 10-K  RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

OVERVIEW  FOUNDED IN 1975, SONO-TEK CORPORATION DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURES ULTRASONIC  COATING SYSTEMS THAT APPLY PRECISE, THIN FILM COATINGS TO A MULTITUDE OF PRODUCTS FOR THE MICROELECTRONICS/ELECTRONICS, ALTERNATIVE  ENERGY, MEDICAL AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS, INCLUDING SPECIALIZED GLASS APPLICATIONS IN CONSTRUCTION AND AUTOMOTIVE. WE ALSO SELL OUR  PRODUCTS TO EMERGING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER MARKETS. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE OUR MARKET DIVERSITY  BY LEVERAGING OUR CORE ULTRASONIC COATING TECHNOLOGY. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, THE INDUSTRIES  WE SERVE AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS.  OUR ULTRASONIC NOZZLE SYSTEMS USE HIGH FREQUENCY, ULTRASONIC VIBRATIONS THAT  ATOMIZE LIQUIDS INTO MINUTE DROPS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO SURFACES AT LOW VELOCITY PROVIDING THIN LAYERS OF PROTECTIVE MATERIALS  OVER A SURFACE SUCH AS GLASS OR METALS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT AND HIGHLY RELIABLE. THEY ENABLE  DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN OVERSPRAY, SAVINGS IN RAW MATERIAL, WATER AND ENERGY USAGE AND PROVIDE IMPROVED PROCESS REPEATABILITY, TRANSFER  EFFICIENCY, HIGH UNIFORMITY AND REDUCED EMISSIONS.  WE BELIEVE PRODUCT SUPERIORITY IS IMPERATIVE AND THAT IT IS ATTAINED THROUGH  THE EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WE HAVE IN THE COATINGS INDUSTRY, OUR PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING KNOW-HOW AND SKILLS AND OUR UNIQUE WORK  FORCE WE HAVE BUILT OVER THE YEARS. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE OUR INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, PROPRIETARY KNOW-HOW, UNIQUE  TALENT AND EXPERIENCE, AND GLOBAL REACH TO FURTHER ADVANCE THE USE OF ULTRASONIC COATING TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE MICROSCOPIC COATING  OF SURFACES IN A BROADER ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS THAT ENABLE BETTER OUTCOMES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES.  9  WE ARE A GLOBAL BUSINESS WITH APPROXIMATELY 65% OF OUR SALES GENERATED FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND  CANADA. OUR DIRECT SALES TEAM AND OUR DISTRIBUTOR AND SALES REPRESENTATIVE NETWORK IS LOCATED IN NORTH AMERICA, LATIN AMERICA,  EUROPE AND ASIA. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR SALES CAPABILITIES BY INCREASING THE SIZE OF OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE,  ADDING NEW DISTRIBUTORS AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES (\u201dREPS\u201d). IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED TESTING LABS AT OUR DISTRIBUTION  PARTNER SITES IN CHINA, TAIWAN, GERMANY, TURKEY, KOREA AND JAPAN, WHILE ALSO EXPANDING OUR FIRST TESTING LAB THAT IS CO-LOCATED  WITH OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN NEW YORK. THESE LABS PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT VALUE FOR DEMONSTRATING TO PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS  THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR EQUIPMENT AND ENABLING US TO DEVELOP CUSTOM SOLUTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS.  OVER THE LAST DECADE, WE HAVE SHIFTED OUR BUSINESS FROM PRIMARILY  SELLING OUR ULTRASONIC NOZZLES AND COMPONENTS TO A MORE COMPLEX BUSINESS PROVIDING COMPLETE MACHINE SOLUTIONS AND HIGHER  VALUE SUBSYSTEMS TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (\u201cOEMS\u201d). THE RANGE FOR OUR AVERAGE UNIT SELLING PRICE HAS  BROADENED AS A RESULT FROM LESS THAN $8,000 FOR A NOZZLE AND GENERATOR PACKAGE TO A RANGE OF $50 THOUSAND PER UNIT TO OVER  $240 THOUSAND PER UNIT. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSITION, WE HAVE BROADENED OUR ADDRESSABLE MARKET AND WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN  GROW SALES ON A LARGER SCALE AND WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL EXPERIENCE WIDE VARIATIONS IN BOTH ORDER FLOW AND SHIPMENTS FROM  QUARTER TO QUARTER.  HIGHLIGHTS  HIGHLIGHTS FOR FISCAL 2019 INCLUDE.  \u2022  NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE $11,610,000, UP 5.5% COMPARED WITH $11,008,000 FOR FISCAL 2018. HIGHER NET SALES WERE DRIVEN  BY DEMAND FOR HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED ULTRASONIC COATING SYSTEMS IN CHINA FOR THE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY MARKET, SPECIFICALLY FUEL CELLS,  AS WELL AS ADVANCED ULTRASONIC COATING SOLUTIONS FOR THE MEDICAL MARKET.  \u2022  GROSS PROFIT AND OPERATING MARGINS FOR FISCAL 2019 DECREASED TO 45.2% AND 0.7%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM 48.1% AND  3.5%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FISCAL 2018. LOWER GROSS PROFIT MARGIN REFLECTS THE CHANGE IN MIX TOWARD COMPLEX COATING MACHINES WITH  INCREASED OUTSOURCED CONTENT COMBINED WITH AN AGGRESSIVE PRICING STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH A LEADING MARKET POSITION IN THE CHINA FUEL  CELL MARKET. WE BELIEVE OUR PRICING STRATEGY FOR THE FUEL CELL INDUSTRY IN CHINA COULD RESULT IN GAINING A SIZABLE SHARE OF A SIGNIFICANT  POTENTIAL MARKET. THIS COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO HIGH PRODUCTION VOLUMES AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR REDUCTION IN MANUFACTURING COSTS  AND REALIZATION OF OPERATING LEVERAGE.  \u2022  BASIC EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $0.01 IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $0.02, FOR FISCAL 2018  \u2022  BACKLOG ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 ACHIEVED A RECORD $3,038,000, UP 145% FROM BACKLOG OF $1,238,000 ON FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  BACKLOG GROWTH RESULTED FROM AN ORDER FOR A HIGHLY AUTOMATED, COMPLEX ULTRASONIC COATING SOLUTION FOR THE  ELECTRONICS/MICROELECTRONICS INDUSTRY AS WELL AS CONTINUED DEMAND FOR MORE ADVANCED COATING SOLUTIONS FROM THE ALTERNATIVE  ENERGY AND MEDICAL MARKETS.  \u2022  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WERE $5,510,000 COMPARED WITH $6,422,000 AS OF FEBRUARY  28, 2019, A DECREASE OF $912,000. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2019 WERE $547,000, UP FROM $189,000 IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR,  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE $337,000 PURCHASE OF CNC MACHINE TOOLS FOR EXPANDING PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES. THE EQUIPMENT  PROVIDES THE NEEDED PRECISION MACHINING REQUIRED FOR OUR LATEST GENERATION OF PROPRIETARY ULTRASONIC NOZZLES. CASH USED IN OPERATING  ACTIVITIES WAS RELATED TO HIGHER RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, REFLECTING THE GROWTH IN DEMAND.  \u2022  WE HAVE A STRONG BALANCE SHEET WITH DEBT ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 10% OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION. WE BELIEVE THAT  PROVIDES US WITH                                                                     THE  FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY                                                                     FOR  GROWTH.  10  MARKET AND GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY  WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ENHANCE OUR MARKET DIVERSITY. LEVERAGING  OUR CORE ULTRASONIC COATING TECHNOLOGY, WE EXPANDED OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, THE INDUSTRIES WE SERVE, AND THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS.  TODAY, WE SERVE FIVE INDUSTRIES: MICROELECTRONICS/ELECTRONICS, MEDICAL, ALTERNATIVE  ENERGY, EMERGING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER, AS WELL AS THE INDUSTRIAL MARKETS.  WE ARE A GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE COMPANY WITH A PRESENCE DIRECTLY AND THROUGH  DISTRIBUTORS AND TRADE REPRESENTATIVES, IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA , EMEA (EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA), APAC (ASIA  PACIFIC) AND LATIN AMERICA (INCLUDING MEXICO). IN FISCAL 2019, APPROXIMATELY 65% OF SALES ORIGINATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED  STATES AND CANADA. WE ESTABLISHED AN INFRASTRUCTURE TO DRIVE OUR GEOGRAPHIC DIVERSITY INCLUDING A NEWLY EQUIPPED, APPLICATION  PROCESS DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY IN APAC, A STRENGTHENED SALES ORGANIZATION OF APPLICATION ENGINEERS, EXPANDED TALENT ON OUR  ENGINEERING TEAM, THE LATEST, MOST SOPHISTICATED DESIGN SOFTWARE TOOLS, AS WELL AS AN EXPANDED, HIGHLY TRAINED INSTALLATION  AND SERVICE ORGANIZATION.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE NEW PRODUCTS WE HAVE INTRODUCED, THE NEW MARKETS WE HAVE PENETRATED,  AND THE REGIONS IN WHICH WE NOW SELL OUR PRODUCTS, ARE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR OUR FUTURE SALES GROWTH AND ENHANCED PROFITABILITY.

THESE SERVICE-BASED CUSTOMERS ARE GUIDED BY OUR APPLICATIONS ENGINEERING TEAM, TO DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL COATING PROCESSES FOR  THEIR UNIQUE NEEDS. UPON ACHIEVING COATING RESULTS THAT MEET THE APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS, THE CUSTOMER'S NEXT STEP IS TYPICALLY  TO PURCHASE THE NEWLY DEFINED COATING SOLUTION. WE BELIEVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PROSPECTS AND CUSTOMERS THAT USE OUR LAB SERVICES  TO DEVELOP THEIR PRODUCTS RESULTS IN SALES OF OUR ULTRASONIC COATING SOLUTIONS.  12  AS EXPECTED, THE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY MARKET CONTINUED TO GROW AS APPLICATIONS AND  NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR FUEL CELL MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT INCREASED. ASIA, SPECIFICALLY CHINA, HAS BEEN DRIVING DEMAND FOR FUEL CELLS  BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENTS BEING MADE BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT. OUR EQUIPMENT IS USED TO PRODUCE HIGHLY DURABLE, UNIFORM, PINHOLE-FREE  COATINGS OF CARBON-BASED CATALYST INKS ONTO FUEL CELL PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANES, REDUCING WASTE AND IMPROVING FUNCTIONALITY. OVER  THE LONG TERM, DEMAND FROM THIS MARKET IS POISED FOR SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH AS THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO SCALE UP FROM R&D PROTOTYPE  PRODUCTION TO LOW RATE PRODUCTION.  THE INDUSTRIAL MARKET SHOWED A SMALL DECLINE IN SALES DUE TO REDUCED ORDERS  IN THE FLOAT GLASS INDUSTRY, WHICH IS TYPICAL DUE TO VARIATIONS IN DEMAND AND APPLICATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

THIS COMPARES  WITH 56% IN FISCAL 2018. SALES TO APAC GREW SUBSTANTIALLY, PRIMARILY FROM CHINA IN THE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND MEDICAL MARKETS,  WHICH OFFSET SLOWER U.S. SALES DUE TO THE TIMING OF DEMAND IN THE MEDICAL MARKET FROM A STENT MANUFACTURER FOR ULTRASONIC COATING  EQUIPMENT.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $47,000, OR 1%, TO $5,249,000 FOR FISCAL 2019 FROM $5,296,000  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED BY 290 BASIS POINTS TO 45.2% FOR FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE REFLECTS THE  COMPANY\u2019S STRATEGY FOR ESTABLISHING A LEADING MARKET POSITION IN THE FUEL CELL MARKET IN CHINA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE A  LARGE ADDRESSABLE MARKET. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT AS THE MARKET MORE FULLY DEVELOPS, THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANUFACTURING  OF OUR EQUIPMENT AT PRODUCTION-LEVEL SCALE WILL BE REDUCED, ENABLING MARGINS TO EXPAND. MARGIN COMPRESSION ALSO REFLECTS THE CHANGE  IN PRODUCT MIX TO MORE COMPLEX ULTRASONIC COATING SOLUTIONS THAT REQUIRE MORE OUTSOURCED CONTENT.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCREASED $45,000 TO $1,325,000 FOR FISCAL  2019 AS COMPARED WITH $1,280,000 FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. HIGHER RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE  DUE TO INCREASED ENGINEERING SALARIES AND HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED DEPRECIATION  EXPENSE.  MARKETING AND SELLING.  MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS INCREASED $170,000 TO $2,686,000 FOR FISCAL 2019 AS  COMPARED WITH $2,516,000 FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. HIGHER MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE DUE TO INCREASED HEALTH  INSURANCE PREMIUMS, SALARIES RELATED TO THE ADDITION OF NEW TECHNICAL SALES PERSONNEL, TRAVEL EXPENSES RELATED TO TRAIN THE NEW  PERSONNEL AND INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR TRAINING. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION  EXPENSE AND TRADE SHOW EXPENSE.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY $457,000 FOR COMMISSIONS AS COMPARED  WITH $530,000 FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF $73,000. THE DECREASE IN COMMISSIONS IS DUE TO AN INCREASE OF EQUIPMENT  SALES THAT DID NOT HAVE EXTERNAL DISTRIBUTOR INVOLVEMENT AND THE ASSOCIATED COMMISSION EXPENSE.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY $247,000 FOR ADVERTISING AND TRADE  SHOW EXPENSE COMPARED WITH $280,000 FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF $33,000.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCREASED $37,000 TO $1,155,000 FOR FISCAL 2019  AS COMPARED WITH $1,118,000, FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR FISCAL 2019 WERE DUE TO INCREASED  HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS, LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, BANK FEES AND FEES RELATED TO AN INVESTOR RELATIONS FIRM. FEES RELATED  TO THE INVESTOR RELATIONS FIRM BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN  SALARY EXPENSE AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  OPERATING INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME DECREASED TO $82,000 IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $382,000 FOR  THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASED OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS IN FISCAL  2019 AS WE ADDRESS MARKET EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME IS A RESULT OF OUR GROSS PROFIT DECREASING  BY $48,000 COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF $252,000, RESULTING IN A NET DECREASE OF $300,000 IN OPERATING INCOME.  HOWEVER, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, OPERATING EXPENSES WERE DOWN 20 BASIS POINTS TO 44.5% IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH 44.7%  IN FISCAL 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED TO $40,000 FOR FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED WITH $46,000 FOR  THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME.  INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME INCREASED TO $137,000 FOR FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED WITH  $91,000 FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. OUR PRESENT INVESTMENT POLICY IS TO INVEST EXCESS CASH IN HIGHLY LIQUID, LOWER RISK US TREASURY  SECURITIES. AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE MAJORITY OF OUR HOLDINGS ARE RATED AT OR ABOVE INVESTMENT GRADE.  14  OTHER INCOME.  INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME IS THE NET REVENUE RELATED TO THE RENTAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  REAL ESTATE. FOR FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S RENTAL REVENUE WAS $84,000, EXPENSES WERE $61,000 AND THE NET PROFIT WAS $23,000.  FOR FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S RENTAL REVENUE WAS $78,000, EXPENSES WERE $59,000  AND THE NET PROFIT WAS $19,000.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $20,000 FOR FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $92,000  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DETAILS OF THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S TAX EXPENSE ARE EXPLAINED IN NOTE 11 IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME DECREASED TO $162,000 IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH $368,000 FOR THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTS $300,000 IN LOWER OPERATING PROFIT AND A $37,000 NET LOSS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES ($63,000  INCREASE IN REALIZED GAIN OFFSET BY $100,000 UNREALIZED LOSS), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $52,000 NET INCREASE IN INTEREST AND DIVIDEND  INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, $7,000 INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND LOWER INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $72,000.  FOR FISCAL 2019 AND 2018, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR SALES REVENUE OR NET INCOME  HAS BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF INFLATION OR CHANGING PRICES.  FISCAL YEAR 2020 OUTLOOK  WE EXPECT THAT ALL OF OUR RECORD BACKLOG OF $3,038,000 AS OF FEBRUARY 28,  2019 TO SHIP DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020, SUPPORTING OUR EXPECTATION THAT CURRENT FISCAL YEAR SALES WILL  GROW IN THE RANGE OF 15% TO 20%. FURTHERMORE, WE EXPECT THAT THIS INCREASED SALES VOLUME WILL EXPAND MARGINS AND DRIVE  STRONGER EARNINGS. PART OF OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH IS DUE TO A $1,650,000 ORDER FOR A NEWLY INTRODUCED ROBOTIC COATING  PLATFORM. THIS NEW PLATFORM WILL ALLOW US TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL PROSPECTS FOR SIX AXIS ROBOTIC COATING WHICH IS AN OPPORTUNITY  FOR ONGOING GROWTH.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WORKING CAPITAL \u2013  OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $136,000 TO  $6,424,000 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 FROM $6,560,000 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS MOSTLY THE RESULT OF  PURCHASES OF EQUIPMENT AND REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CURRENT PERIOD'S NET INCOME AND NONCASH CHARGES.  THE COMPANY AGGREGATES CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN MANAGING  ITS BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY. FOR PURPOSES OF THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS, THE TOTAL IS REFERRED TO AS \u201cCASH.\u201d AT FEBRUARY  28, 2019 AND 2018, OUR WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDED.

NET DECREASE IN CASH  $(912,000  )  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY -  STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY INCREASED $192,000  FROM $8,392,000 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO $8,584,000 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS A RESULT OF THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S  NET INCOME OF $162,000 AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $30,000.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES \u2013  WE USED $109,000 OF CASH IN  OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH GENERATING $1,802,000 IN FISCAL 2018. THE REDUCTION IN CASH GENERATED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS MOSTLY THE RESULT OF LOWER NET INCOME AND INCREASED INVENTORIES, PREPAID EXPENSES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  AS WELL AS A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER  DEPOSITS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES \u2013  IN FISCAL 2019, CASH GENERATED  BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $1,393,000 COMPARED WITH USING $2,194,000 OF CASH IN FISCAL 2018. CAPITAL SPENDING IN FISCAL 2019  WAS $547,000 FOR THE PURCHASE OR MANUFACTURE OF EQUIPMENT, FURNISHINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDED $337,000 OF CASH  TO UPGRADE OUR CNC MACHINERY. THIS COMPARES WITH $189,000 FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT AND FURNISHINGS IN FISCAL 2018.  IN FISCAL 2019 SALES OF OUR MARKETABLE SECURITIES PROVIDED  $1,940,000 OF CASH COMPARED WITH USING $2,004,000 FOR PURCHASES IN FISCAL 2018.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES \u2013  IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, WE USED  $156,000 AND $150,000 IN CASH, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MORTGAGE.  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS \u2013  IN FISCAL  2019 OUR CASH BALANCE INCREASED BY $1,128,000 AS COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $541,000 IN FISCAL 2018. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE USED  $109,000 OF CASH IN OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, WE RECEIVED $1,940,000 FROM THE SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WE USED  $548,000 FOR THE PURCHASE OR MANUFACTURE OF EQUIPMENT, FURNISHINGS AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND USED $156,000 FOR THE REPAYMENT  OF OUR NOTE PAYABLE.  16  BANK CREDIT FACILITIES.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE A REVOLVING CREDIT LINE OF $1,500,000 AND A $750,000 EQUIPMENT  PURCHASE FACILITY, BOTH OF WHICH ARE WITH A BANK. THE REVOLVING CREDIT LINE IS COLLATERALIZED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  AND INVENTORY. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IS PAYABLE ON DEMAND AND MUST BE RETIRED FOR A 30-DAY PERIOD, ONCE ANNUALLY. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, $808,000 OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT LINE WAS BEING UTILIZED  TO COLLATERALIZE LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE REMITTED CASH DEPOSITS TO THE COMPANY ON EXISTING ORDERS. THE  UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT LINE WAS $692,000 AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT EXPIRE IN 2020.  WE HAD OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER A NOTE PAYABLE OF $871,000 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE NOTE IS PAYABLE OVER FIVE YEARS AND ACCRUES INTEREST AT 4.15% PER YEAR. THE NOTE PAYABLE IS SECURED BY A MORTGAGE ON OUR LAND  AND BUILDINGS.  OFF - BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF - BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES  THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND  RELATED DISCLOSURE ON CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM  THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF SIGNIFICANT  JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND MAY POTENTIALLY RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS AND CONDITIONS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE ARE NO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT ARE REFLECTIVE  OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND OR UNCERTAINTIES.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPUTATION OF THE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION REQUIRES  THE USE OF A VALUATION MODEL. ASC 718 IS A COMPLEX ACCOUNTING STANDARD, THE APPLICATION OF WHICH REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT  AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES, PARTICULARLY SURROUNDING BLACK-SCHOLES ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, EXPECTED OPTION LIVES,  AND EXPECTED OPTION FORFEITURE RATES, TO VALUE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. WE CURRENTLY USE A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL  TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS. WE PRIMARILY USE HISTORICAL DATA TO DETERMINE THE ASSUMPTIONS TO BE USED IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES  MODEL AND HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT FUTURE DATA IS LIKELY TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM HISTORICAL DATA. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN THE  ASSUMPTIONS TO REFLECT FUTURE STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY AND FUTURE STOCK AWARD EXERCISE EXPERIENCE COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN THE  ASSUMPTIONS USED TO VALUE AWARDS IN THE FUTURE AND MAY RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE FAIR VALUE CALCULATION OF STOCK-BASED  AWARDS. ASC 718 REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK COMPENSATION IN NET INCOME. ALTHOUGH EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO  ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THOSE ESTIMATES, INTERPRETATIONS AND  ASSUMPTIONS MAY RESULT IN RECORDING STOCK OPTION EXPENSE THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EACH RESPECTIVE  REPORTING PERIOD.  17  IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-01, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013  OVERALL: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES.\u201d ASU 2016-01 REQUIRES EQUITY INVESTMENTS  (EXCEPT THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, OR THOSE THAT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION OF THE INVESTEE) TO BE  MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME, REQUIRES PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES TO USE THE EXIT PRICE  NOTION WHEN MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE PURPOSES, REQUIRES SEPARATE PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL  ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES BY MEASUREMENT CATEGORY AND FORM OF FINANCIAL ASSET, AND ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR PUBLIC  BUSINESS ENTITIES TO DISCLOSE THE METHOD(S) AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE  DISCLOSED FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST. ASU 2016-01 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS STANDARD  MAY HAVE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED  TO RETAINED EARNINGS FROM OTHER ACCUMULATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02, LEASES (TOPIC 842), TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY  AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET FOR ALL LEASES WITH TERMS LONGER  THAN 12 MONTHS. LEASES WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER OPERATING OR FINANCING, WITH SUCH CLASSIFICATION AFFECTING THE PATTERN OF EXPENSE  RECOGNITION IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. ASU 2016-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE YEARS BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02 WILL HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02, INCOME STATEMENT - REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE  INCOME (TOPIC 220), \u201cRECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\u201d. ASU 2018-02  WAS ISSUED TO ALLOW THE RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE STRANDED TAX  EFFECT RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCED  THE CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, WHICH REQUIRED THE RE-EVALUATION OF ANY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE LOWERED  TAX RATE WHICH POTENTIALLY COULD LEAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE TAX EFFECT IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ASU 2018-02 ALLOWS  FOR THE ELECTION TO RECLASSIFY THESE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS TO RETAINED EARNINGS. ASU 2018-02 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL  YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING  ADOPTION IN ANY INTERIM PERIOD FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR REPORTING PERIODS FOR WHICH FINANCIALS STATEMENTS HAVE NOT YET  BEEN ISSUED. THE ADOPTION  OF ASU 2018-02 WILL HAVE NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OTHER THAN, ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO.  ASU 2016-01,  ASU 2016-02 AND ASU 2018-02 DISCUSSED ABOVE, ALL NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE HAVE BEEN DEEMED TO  BE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY. HENCE, THE ADOPTION OF THESE NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, ONCE EFFECTIVE, IS NOT EXPECTED TO  HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY.  18", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-K", "Company Name": "SONO TEK CORP", "CIK": 806172, "Date": "2019-05-28T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SOTK", "Name": "Sono Tek Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 3690.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "NY", "IRS": 141568099.0, "key": "20190528SOTK", "labelr1": 0.4166666666666763, "labelr2": 1.6597510373443998, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6856544, "prof1": 0.31434557, "return1&2": 0.979304979253112, "return1&2&3": 0.979304979253112, "return1&2&3&4": 0.979304979253112, "return2": 0.9834024896265559, "return1": 0.9958333333333332, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "4_day_return": 2.083333333333348, "cumulative_return1": 0.08848584452252192, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.0018098660390820853, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.891758538562741e-05, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 1.0406924662404222e-07, "indexx": 2393, "cumreturn1b": 1.026931995340986, "cumreturndow": 0.9490361529775404, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9503727033579542}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2395, "level_0": 2420, "index": 1785, "text": "ITEM 7.

DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1997 TO 2000, CAVCO WAS PURCHASED BY, AND BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF, CENTEX CORPORATION, WHICH OPERATED THE COMPANY UNTIL 2003, WHEN CAVCO BECAME A STAND-ALONE PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY TRADED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL CVCO.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BEGINNING IN 2007, THE OVERALL HOUSING INDUSTRY EXPERIENCED A MULTI-YEAR DECLINE, WHICH INCLUDED MANUFACTURED HOUSING. SINCE THIS DOWNTURN, CAVCO HAS STRATEGICALLY EXPANDED ITS FACTORY OPERATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESS INITIATIVES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF INDUSTRY COMPETITORS. THIS ENABLED THE COMPANY TO MORE BROADLY PARTICIPATE IN THE OVERALL HOUSING INDUSTRY RECOVERY.  IN 2009, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOUSING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF FLEETWOOD. THE ASSETS PURCHASED INCLUDED SEVEN OPERATING PRODUCTION FACILITIES AS WELL AS IDLE FACTORIES. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOUSING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF PALM HARBOR, A FLORIDA CORPORATION. THE ASSETS PURCHASED INCLUDED FIVE OPERATING PRODUCTION FACILITIES AS WELL AS IDLE FACTORIES, 49 OPERATING RETAIL LOCATIONS, A MANUFACTURED HOUSING FINANCE COMPANY AND A HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE COMPANY. THESE ACQUISITIONS EXPANDED THE COMPANY'S PRESENCE ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.  IN 2015, THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE BUSINESS AND OPERATING ASSETS OF CHARIOT EAGLE, A FLORIDA-BASED MANUFACTURER OF PARK MODEL RVS AND MANUFACTURED HOMES, AS WELL AS CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF FAIRMONT HOMES. IN 2017, THE COMPANY PURCHASED LEXINGTON HOMES, A ONE FACILITY OPERATION LOCATED IN LEXINGTON, MISSISSIPPI. THESE ACQUISITIONS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL HOME PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES, GREW THE COMPANY'S OFFERING OF PARK MODEL RV PRODUCT LINES AND FURTHER STRENGTHENED OUR MARKET POSITION IN THE SOUTHEAST, MIDWEST, THE WESTERN GREAT PLAINS STATES AND SEVERAL PROVINCES IN CANADA.  THE COMPANY OPERATES  20  HOMEBUILDING FACILITIES LOCATED IN MILLERSBURG AND WOODBURN, OREGON; NAMPA, IDAHO; RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA; PHOENIX AND GOODYEAR, ARIZONA; AUSTIN, FORT WORTH, SEGUIN AND WACO, TEXAS; MONTEVIDEO, MINNESOTA (2); NAPPANEE, INDIANA; LAFAYETTE, TENNESSEE; LEXINGTON, MISSISSIPPI; MARTINSVILLE AND ROCKY MOUNT, VIRGINIA; DOUGLAS, GEORGIA; PLANT CITY AND OCALA, FLORIDA. THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMES PRODUCED ARE SOLD TO AND DISTRIBUTED BY INDEPENDENTLY OWNED DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED PRIMARILY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN ADDITION, OUR HOMES ARE SOLD THROUGH  38  COMPANY-OWNED U.S. RETAIL LOCATIONS.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED ON A DECENTRALIZED BASIS, WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THE HOME OFFICE. THIS DECENTRALIZATION ENABLES OUR OPERATORS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO LOCAL MARKET DEMAND, BE MORE CUSTOMER FOCUSED AND HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO MAKE SWIFT DECISIONS, WHILE STILL BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND STRIVES TO IMPROVE PRODUCT DESIGNS, PRODUCTION METHODS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES. WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GAINING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AMONG OUR OPERATIONS, ALL OF WHICH CONTINUE TO HAVE ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL.  COMPANY OUTLOOK  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A CONSERVATIVE COST STRUCTURE IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD ADDED VALUE INTO OUR HOMES AND HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO MAINTAIN A SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH AND POSITION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS SHOULD HELP US AVOID LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND ENABLE US TO ACT EFFECTIVELY AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES.  THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND WE UTILIZE LOCAL MARKET RESEARCH TO DESIGN HOMES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE FLOOR PLANS AND DESIGNS TO FULFILL SPECIFIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS. BY OFFERING A FULL RANGE OF HOMES FROM ENTRY-LEVEL MODELS TO LARGE CUSTOM HOMES AND WITH THE ABILITY TO ENGINEER DESIGNS IN-HOUSE, WE CAN ACCOMMODATE VIRTUALLY ANY CUSTOMER REQUEST. IN ADDITION TO HOMES BUILT TO THE FEDERAL HUD CODE, WE CONSTRUCT MODULAR HOMES THAT CONFORM TO STATE AND LOCAL CODES, PARK MODEL RVS AND CABINS AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT MANY OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO IDENTIFY NICHE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHERE OUR DIVERSE PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOM BUILDING CAPABILITIES PROVIDE US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR GREEN BUILDING INITIATIVES INVOLVE THE CREATION OF AN ENERGY EFFICIENT ENVELOPE AND HIGHER UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS. THESE HOMES PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, TYPICALLY LOWER UTILITY COSTS, SPECIALLY DESIGNED VENTILATION SYSTEMS AND SUSTAINABILITY. CAVCO ALSO BUILDS HOMES DESIGNED TO USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND. FROM BAMBOO FLOORING AND TANKLESS WATER HEATERS TO SOLAR-POWERED HOMES, OUR PRODUCTS ARE DIVERSE AND TAILORED TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER INTERESTS. INNOVATION IN HOUSING DESIGN IS A FORTE OF THE COMPANY AND WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW MODELS AT COMPETITIVE PRICE POINTS WITH EXPRESSIVE INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS THAT COMPLEMENT HOME STYLES IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED.  BASED ON THE RELATIVELY LOW COST ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURED HOME OWNERSHIP, OUR PRODUCTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY COMPETED WITH RENTAL HOUSING'S MONTHLY PAYMENT AFFORDABILITY. RENTAL HOUSING ACTIVITY IS REPORTED TO HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED A DECLINE IN TENANT HOUSING VACANCY RATES, CAUSING A CORRESPONDING RISE IN ASSOCIATED RENTAL RATES. THESE RENTAL MARKET FACTORS MAY CAUSE SOME RENTERS TO BECOME INTERESTED BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING MANUFACTURED HOMES.  FURTHER, WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL RISE IN DEMAND FOR RENTAL HOUSING, WE HAVE REALIZED A LARGER PROPORTION OF ORDERS FROM DEVELOPERS AND COMMUNITY OWNERS FOR NEW MANUFACTURED HOMES INTENDED FOR USE AS RENTAL HOUSING. THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE PRODUCT AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS OF THESE HOME BUYERS AND VALUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE HOMES THAT ARE WELL SUITED FOR THESE PURPOSES.  CAVCO MAINTAINS A BACKLOG OF HOME ORDERS FROM ITS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK OF LICENSED DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDING COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY CANCEL ORDERS PRIOR TO PRODUCTION WITHOUT PENALTY. ACCORDINGLY, UNTIL THE PRODUCTION OF A PARTICULAR HOME HAS COMMENCED, WE DO NOT CONSIDER OUR ORDER BACKLOG TO BE FIRM ORDERS. THE BACKLOG OF SALES ORDERS AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , VARIED AMONG OUR FACTORIES, BUT IN TOTAL WAS  $128.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $179.0 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  . DURING THE MOST RECENT FALL AND WINTER MONTHS, ORDER RATES FOR LOWER PRICE-POINT HOMES DECLINED, MAINLY FROM AN INCREASE IN BECAUSE DISTRIBUTOR INVENTORIES OF THESE HOMES. ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE, SOME PROSPECTIVE HOME BUYERS MAY HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY GENERALLY RISING INTEREST RATES IN 2018, HOME PRICE ESCALATION FROM INPUT COST INFLATION IN 2018 AND 2017, AND PERSISTENT FALL AND WINTER ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS CAUSED EXTENSIVE DELAYS IN HOME SET-UP PROCESSES. THE COMPANY IS DEVELOPING ORDER VOLUME GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BY WORKING TO INCREASE OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AS WELL AS ADJUSTING AFFECTED PRODUCT LINES. THIS HOME ORDER RATE DECLINE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED ROBUST DEMAND FOR HIGHER-PRICED, LARGER AND MORE AMENITIZED HOMES IN VARIOUS MARKETS. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MANAGE ITS PRODUCTION LEVELS AND WORKFORCE SIZE BASED UPON MARKET DEMAND. HOWEVER, THE CONSTRAINED LABOR MARKET CONTINUES TO BE A KEY CHALLENGE TO THIS PROCESS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OVERALL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE MANUFACTURED HOMES REMAINS STRONG.  THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOAN PROGRAMS WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS THAT INDEPENDENT FINANCIERS THEN LEND TO DISTRIBUTORS TO FINANCE RETAIL INVENTORIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DIRECT COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR FINANCING HOMES (SEE NOTE  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT IN COMMERCIAL LOANS HELPS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MANUFACTURED HOME FINANCING TO DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER USERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT OUR PARTICIPATION IN WHOLESALE FINANCING IS HELPFUL TO DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS AND ALLOWS OUR PRODUCTS ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS. THESE INITIATIVES SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION IN ALL OF OUR MARKETS. HOWEVER, THE INITIATIVES EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, INCLUDING INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, DEVELOPERS, COMMUNITIES AND INVENTORY FINANCING PARTNERS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRICTIVE UNDERWRITING GUIDELINES, HIGHER INTEREST RATES COMPARED TO SITE-BUILT HOMES, A LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS LENDING TO MANUFACTURED HOME BUYERS AND LIMITED SECONDARY MARKET AVAILABILITY FOR MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS CONTINUE TO CONSTRAIN INDUSTRY GROWTH. THE COMPANY IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO DEVELOP MANUFACTURED HOME CONSUMER FINANCING LOAN PORTFOLIOS TO ATTRACT INDUSTRY FINANCIERS INTERESTED IN FURTHERING OR EXPANDING LENDING OPPORTUNITIES IN THE INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY-BASED LENDING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE HOME-ONLY FINANCING TO NEW RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES. OUR MORTGAGE SUBSIDIARY ALSO DEVELOPS AND INVESTS IN HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS TO GROW SALES OF HOMES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION POINTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT GROWING OUR PARTICIPATION IN HOME-ONLY LENDING MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SALES GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING THROUGH INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE FAVORABLE LEGISLATIVE AND GSE ACTION TO ADDRESS THE MORTGAGE FINANCING NEEDS OF BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE GSES TO ISSUE A REGULATION TO IMPLEMENT THE \"DUTY TO SERVE\" REQUIREMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS ACT OF 1992, AS AMENDED BY THE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008. IN DECEMBER 2017, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC RELEASED THEIR FINAL UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLAN THAT DESCRIBES, WITH SPECIFICITY, THE ACTIONS THEY WILL TAKE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD TO FULFILL THE \"DUTY TO SERVE\" OBLIGATION. THESE PLANS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. EACH OF THE THREE-YEAR PLANS OFFERS AN ENHANCED MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCT THROUGH THEIR \"MH ADVANTAGE\" AND \"CHOICEHOME\" PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY, THAT BEGAN IN THE LATTER PART OF CALENDAR 2018. SMALL-SCALE PILOT PROGRAMS FOR THE PURCHASE OF HOME-ONLY LOANS ARE EXPECTED TO COMMENCE TOWARDS THE END OF CALENDAR 2019. EXPANSION OF THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR LENDING THROUGH THE GSES COULD SUPPORT FURTHER DEMAND FOR HOUSING, AS LENDING OPTIONS WOULD LIKELY BECOME MORE AVAILABLE TO HOME BUYERS. ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS AREA, MEANINGFUL POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE FORM OF INCREASED HOME ORDERS HAS YET TO BE REALIZED.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, HUD ANNOUNCED A TOP-TO-BOTTOM REVIEW OF ITS MANUFACTURED HOUSING RULES AS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO IDENTIFY REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, OVERLY BURDENSOME, OR EXCESSIVELY COSTLY GIVEN THE CRITICAL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WHILE THEY HAVE NOT INDICATED WHEN THIS REVIEW WILL BE COMPLETE, IF CERTAIN CHANGES ARE MADE, THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF HOME BUYERS.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM EXCESSIVE POLICY CLAIMS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING PERIODS OF INCLEMENT WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL SPRING STORMS OR FALL HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN TEXAS WHERE MOST OF ITS POLICIES ARE UNDERWRITTEN. WHERE APPLICABLE, LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED BY REINSURANCE CONTRACTS IN PLACE AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S LOSS MITIGATION STRUCTURE.  DURING THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, HURRICANE HARVEY PRODUCED THE LARGEST RECORDED RAIN VOLUME FOR A SINGLE WEATHER EVENT IN U.S. HISTORY, RESULTING IN HISTORIC FLOODING AND WIDESPREAD PROPERTY DAMAGE, PRIMARILY IN SOUTHEAST TEXAS, CAUSING HIGH HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE CLAIM VOLUME. THE COMPANY PRODUCED A LIMITED NUMBER OF DISASTER-RELIEF HOMES FOR FEMA DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017.  WHILE NOT AS SEVERE AS HURRICANE HARVEY, DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY'S RESULTS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED HOMEOWNERS' INSURANCE CLAIMS FROM WEATHER EVENTS IN ARIZONA.  AS DISCLOSED IN PART I, ITEM 3, \"LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,\" THE COMPANY AND JOSEPH STEGMAYER RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE SEC'S DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO TRADING IN THE STOCK OF ANOTHER PUBLIC COMPANY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS MATTER THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS. THOSE COSTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES FOR MR. STEGMAYER PURSUANT TO HIS INDEMNITY ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE INITIATED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION LED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN RELATION TO THIS INQUIRY. THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE HAS ADVISED THE AUDIT COMMITTEE THAT IT HAS COMPLETED ITS INTERNAL INVESTIGATION RELATED TO THE MATTERS. THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE STAFF AT THE SEC. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO FULLY COOPERATE WITH THE SEC.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS A RESULT OF THE ONGOING INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, THE COMPANY RECORDED  $2.1 MILLION  RELATED TO LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR RELATED COSTS PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWED THE SUFFICIENCY OF ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW, CAVCO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MADE A DECISION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL D&O INSURANCE COVERAGE. THESE NEW 22 MONTH POLICIES WERE IMPLEMENTED DECEMBER 21, 2018, WITH PREMIUMS TOTALING $15.3 MILLION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED  $2.8 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL D&O POLICY PREMIUM EXPENSE DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, AND EXPECTS TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION PER QUARTER IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FROM THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE POLICY PREMIUMS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF MAINTAINING ADEQUATE D&O INSURANCE FOR THE COMPANY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL YEAR  2019  COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR  2018  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING FOR FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  NET REVENUE.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PRODUCED SOMEWHAT LARGER HOMES WITH MORE AMENITIES. CURRENT YEAR REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES  $24.9 MILLION  , OR 3.1% OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE, RELATED TO SUBCONTRACTED PASS-THROUGH SERVICES, WHICH ARE NOW RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS RATHER THAN NET OF ASSOCIATED COSTS. IN THE PRIOR YEAR, THE COMPANY PRODUCED DISASTER-RELIEF UNITS FOR FEMA DURING THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE PRIOR YEAR RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $14.8 MILLION OF HOME SALES REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM EARLY COMMERCIAL LOAN PAYOFFS RECEIVED UNDER CAVCO'S WHOLESALE LENDING PROGRAMS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD IS A VOLATILE METRIC DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS. A PRIMARY FACTOR IS THE PRICE DISPARITY BETWEEN SALES OF HOMES TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, BUILDERS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS (\"WHOLESALE\") AND SALES OF HOMES TO CONSUMERS BY COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL CENTERS (\"RETAIL\"). WHOLESALE SALES PRICES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE HOME AND THE COST TO SHIP THE HOME FROM A HOMEBUILDING FACILITY TO THE HOME-SITE. RETAIL HOME PRICES INCLUDE THESE ITEMS AND RETAIL MARKUP, AS WELL AS ITEMS THAT ARE LARGELY SUBJECT TO HOME BUYER DISCRETION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INSTALLATION, UTILITY CONNECTIONS, SITE IMPROVEMENTS, LANDSCAPING AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES. CHANGES TO THE PROPORTION OF HOME SALES AMONG THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS IMPACTS THE OVERALL NET REVENUE PER HOME SOLD. FOR THE  TWELVE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY SOLD  11,806  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  2,583  RETAIL VERSUS  12,137  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  2,400  HOMES RETAIL IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FURTHER, FLUCTUATIONS IN NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, WHICH RESULTS FROM HOME BUYER TASTES AND PREFERENCES AS THEY SELECT HOME TYPES/MODELS, AS WELL AS OPTIONAL HOME UPGRADES WHEN PURCHASING THE HOME. THESE SELECTIONS VARY REGULARLY BASED ON CONSUMER INTERESTS, LOCAL HOUSING PREFERENCES AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PRODUCT PRICES ARE ALSO PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED FOR THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDED IN, AND LABOR USED TO PRODUCE, EACH HOME. FOR THESE REASONS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, VOLATILITY IN OVERALL NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD.  FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER PREMIUM REVENUE FROM A GREATER NUMBER OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME ON LOANS HELD FOR INVESTMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIOS THAT CONTINUE TO AMORTIZE.

CURRENT YEAR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE  $2.1 MILLION  IN LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AND RESPONSE TO THE SEC INQUIRY AND  $2.8 MILLION  FROM THE PREMIUM AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE ADDITIONAL D&O INSURANCE PURCHASED DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL PREMIUMS PAID FOR THESE POLICIES WERE $15.3 MILLION AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION PER QUARTER FROM THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE POLICY PREMIUMS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES  INCREASED  PRIMARILY FROM HIGHER SALARY AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COSTS FROM IMPROVED EARNINGS.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED FROM THE SEC AND D&O COSTS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET REVENUE DECREASED FROM BETTER OVERHEAD UTILIZATION.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.4 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  AND  $4.4 MILLION  IN FISCAL YEAR  2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DEBT SERVICE ON THE COUNTRYPLACE SECURITIZED FINANCINGS OF MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS AND INTEREST RELATED TO THE CAPITAL LEASE TREATMENT FOR A LEASE OF MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND LAND ENTERED INTO AS PART OF THE LEXINGTON HOMES ACQUISITION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE DECREASE IS RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN BOND INTEREST EXPENSE, AS THE COMPANY EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO REPURCHASE THE 2005-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO IN JANUARY 2019, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE FINAL QUARTER IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THESE DECREASES ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN INTEREST EXPENSE FROM SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES AT COUNTRYPLACE.  OTHER INCOME, NET.  FOR FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , OTHER INCOME, NET WAS  $6.0 MILLION  AND  $9.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, A  DECREASE  OF  $3.1 MILLION  OR  34.1%.  OTHER INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON CASH AND COMMERCIAL LOANS RECEIVABLE, PARTNERSHIP INCOME AND GAINS ON CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SALES. THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY FROM $4.5 MILLION IN INVESTMENT GAINS REALIZED ON THE SALE OF CORPORATE INVESTMENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON CASH AND COMMERCIAL LOANS RECEIVABLES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , TOGETHER WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE FOR GROWTH FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH IN U.S. TREASURY MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND OTHER MONEY MARKET FUNDS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF, OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN, BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO OUR COMPANY, AS WELL AS OTHER EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH AND HAVE OTHER IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES IN THE EVENT OF SUCH A TRANSACTION. BECAUSE OF THE COMPANY'S SUFFICIENT CASH POSITION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HISTORICALLY SOUGHT EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN CREDIT FACILITIES FOR OUR HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, WE MAY NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH FINANCING WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL. IF THIS FINANCING WERE NOT AVAILABLE, IT COULD BE NECESSARY FOR US TO REEVALUATE OUR LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE EXACT NATURE OF ANY CHANGES TO OUR PLANS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS CONDITIONS IN THE FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING INDUSTRY AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.  STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OWNED BY OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF CAVCO INDUSTRIES, INC. OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES. WE BELIEVE THAT STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AT OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY REMAINS SUFFICIENT AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO CAVCO INDUSTRIES, INC. WILL BE RESTRICTED PER STATE REGULATIONS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOWS FOR FISCAL YEARS  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY (IN THOUSANDS).  YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CHANGE  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH AT BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR  $199,258  $144,839  $54,419  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  32,836  58,966  (26,130  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (5,815  )  (4,671  )  (1,144  )  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (26,410  )  124  (26,534  )  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH AT END OF FISCAL YEAR  $199,869  $199,258  $611  CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATIONS IN THE COMING YEAR IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SALES VOLUME. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED DURING THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN COMMERCIAL LOANS ORIGINATED AS WELL AS PREMIUMS PAID FOR D&O INSURANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED HOME SALE PROFITABILITY AND GREATER PROCEEDS FROM CONSUMER LENDING ACTIVITY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS  INCREASED  $3.6 MILLION  TO  $130.0 MILLION  DURING THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , FROM  $126.4 MILLION  DURING THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY FROM  INCREASED  HOME LENDING ACTIVITY AT COUNTRYPLACE. PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CONSUMER LOANS PROVIDED  $131.1 MILLION  IN CASH, COMPARED TO  $119.3 MILLION  IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR, A NET  INCREASE  OF  $11.8 MILLION  . THE  INCREASE  IS PRIMARY FROM TIMING OF LOAN ORIGINATIONS AND RELATED SALES TO THE GSES.  WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER LENDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOUSING, STATES MAY CLASSIFY MANUFACTURED HOMES FOR BOTH LEGAL AND TAX PURPOSES AS PERSONAL PROPERTY RATHER THAN REAL ESTATE. AS A RESULT, FINANCING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IS CHARACTERIZED BY SHORTER LOAN MATURITIES AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE PART I, ITEM IA, \"RISK FACTORS.\"  CAVCO HAS ENTERED INTO COMMERCIAL LOAN AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF OUR PRODUCTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR WHOLESALE PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DIRECT COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR FINANCING HOMES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO INVESTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED LENDING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE HOME-ONLY FINANCING TO NEW RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES (SEE NOTE  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FURTHER, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN AND DEVELOPED HOME-ONLY LOAN POOLS AND LENDING PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT THIRD-PARTY FINANCIER INTEREST IN ORDER TO GROW SALES OF NEW HOMES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION POINTS.  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , INCLUDED PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT SALES. CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  INCLUDED PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PAYMENTS FOR LEXINGTON HOMES AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM INVESTMENT SALES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , WAS MAINLY FOR THE REPURCHASE OF THE SECURITIZATION ISSUED ON JULY 12, 2005 AND OTHER PAYMENTS ON SECURITIZED FINANCINGS. NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL  2018  WAS PRIMARILY FROM ADVANCES ON SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS ON SECURITIZED FINANCINGS.  SEE PART II, ITEM 7, \"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\" IN THE COMPANY'S  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN LIQUIDITY BETWEEN FISCAL YEARS  2018  AND  2017.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCINGS.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , ONLY CLASS A-4 OF THE 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO REMAINED OUTSTANDING, TOTALING  $18.4 MILLION  WITH A COUPON RATE OF 5.846% AND AN ESTIMATED CALL DATE IN AUGUST 2019. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT WE WILL REPURCHASE OR REFINANCE THIS FACILITY PRIOR TO THE CALL DATE.  COUNTRYPLACE'S SECURITIZED DEBT IS SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE CERTAIN LEVELS OF OVERCOLLATERALIZATION. OVERCOLLATERALIZATION IS EQUAL TO COUNTRYPLACE'S EQUITY IN THE BONDS. FAILURE TO SATISFY THESE PROVISIONS COULD CAUSE CASH, WHICH WOULD NORMALLY BE DISTRIBUTED TO COUNTRYPLACE, TO BE USED FOR REPAYMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RELATED CLASS A BONDS UNTIL THE REQUIRED OVERCOLLATERALIZATION LEVEL IS REACHED. DURING PERIODS WHEN THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION IS BELOW THE SPECIFIED LEVEL, CASH COLLECTIONS FROM THE SECURITIZED LOANS IN EXCESS OF SERVICING FEES PAYABLE TO COUNTRYPLACE AND AMOUNTS OWED TO THE CLASS A BONDHOLDERS, TRUSTEE AND SURETY, ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE THE CLASS A DEBT UNTIL SUCH TIME THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION LEVEL REACHES THE SPECIFIED LEVEL. THEREFORE, FAILURE TO MEET THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION REQUIREMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS RECEIVED BY COUNTRYPLACE. HOWEVER, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF THE SECURITIZED DEBT, INCLUDING ACCELERATED AMOUNTS, ARE PAYABLE ONLY FROM CASH COLLECTIONS FROM THE SECURITIZED LOANS AND NO ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF REPAYMENT ARE REQUIRED OR PERMITTED. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO WAS WITHIN THE REQUIRED OVERCOLLATERALIZATION LEVEL.  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BANKS WITH DRAW PERIODS FROM ONE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS AND MATURITY DATES OF TEN YEARS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE DRAW PERIODS. THE PROCEEDS ARE USED BY THE COMPANY TO ORIGINATE AND HOLD CONSUMER HOME-ONLY LOANS SECURED BY MANUFACTURED HOMES, WHICH ARE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL TO THE FACILITIES. UPON COMPLETION OF THE DRAW DOWN PERIOD, THE FACILITIES ARE CONVERTED INTO AN AMORTIZING LOAN BASED ON A 20 OR 25 YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT DUE UPON MATURITY. THE MAXIMUM ADVANCE FOR LOANS UNDER THIS PROGRAM IS  80%  OF THE OUTSTANDING COLLATERAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE, WITH THE COMPANY PROVIDING THE REMAINING FUNDS. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE CONVERTED LOANS WAS  $11.3 MILLION  AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.9%, WITH $5.0 MILLION AVAILABLE TO DRAW. AMOUNTS AVAILABLE TO DRAW BEAR INTEREST AT 5.15%. ONCE CONVERTED, THE INITIAL ANNUAL INTEREST RATE OF 5.15% WILL ADJUST EVERY 5 YEARS BEGINNING IN 2024 TO PRIME PLUS 0.40%. THE PER ANNUM INTEREST RATE WILL NEVER BE LESS THAN 5.00% OR GREATER THAN 6.00%.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND LEASE AGREEMENTS. THIS TABLE EXCLUDES LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS NO DEFINITE COMMITMENT PERIOD.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  TOTAL  LESS THAN  1 YEAR  1-3  YEARS  3-5  YEARS  AFTER 5  YEARS  (IN THOUSANDS)  DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  SECURITIZED FINANCINGS AND OTHER BORROWINGS, INCLUDING INTEREST (1)  $33,368  $19,788  $2,781  $2,702  $8,097  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  8,322  2,292  3,586  1,783  661  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  1,181  766  146  146  123  TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  $42,871  $22,846  $6,513  $4,631  $8,881  (1)  INTEREST IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING CONTRACTUAL INTEREST RATES TO MONTH-END BALANCES. THE TIMING OF THESE ESTIMATED PAYMENTS FLUCTUATES BASED UPON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING ESTIMATED LOAN PORTFOLIO PREPAYMENT AND DEFAULT RATES.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , CONSISTING OF CONTINGENT REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REMAINING CONSTRUCTION CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS, SEE NOTE  16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS CONTINGENTLY LIABLE UNDER TERMS OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING INVENTORY FINANCING FOR INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT FOR WHICH THE COMPANY WAS LIABLE UNDER SUCH AGREEMENTS APPROXIMATED  $77.1 MILLION  AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , WITHOUT REDUCTION FOR THE RESALE VALUE OF THE HOMES. ALTHOUGH THE REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING HAVE A FINITE LIFE, THESE COMMITMENTS ARE CONTINUALLY REPLACED AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SELL MANUFACTURED HOMES TO DISTRIBUTORS UNDER REPURCHASE AND OTHER RECOURSE AGREEMENTS WITH LENDING INSTITUTIONS WHICH HAVE PROVIDED WHOLESALE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING TO DISTRIBUTORS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF CREDIT OF  $11.0 MILLION  TO PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL FULFILL ITS REINSURANCE OBLIGATIONS. THIS LETTER OF CREDIT IS SECURED BY CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS. WHILE THE CURRENT LETTERS OF CREDIT HAVE FINITE LIVES, THEY ARE SUBJECT TO RENEWAL BASED ON THEIR UNDERLYING REQUIREMENTS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY HAS A COMMITMENT TO FUND CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD MORTGAGES UP TO  $15.3 MILLION  AT  MARCH 30, 2019  . THE TOTAL LOAN CONTRACT AMOUNT, LESS CUMULATIVE ADVANCES, REPRESENTS AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET CONTINGENT COMMITMENT OF COUNTRYPLACE TO FUND FUTURE ADVANCES.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  SEE NOTE  16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR A DISCUSSION  OF OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS, WHICH IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. SEE \"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\" ABOVE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE CRITICAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR MAY AFFECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE RECOGNITION - WHOLESALE  . REVENUE FROM HOMES SOLD TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, BUILDERS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE HOME IS SHIPPED, AT WHICH TIME TITLE PASSES AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CONSIDERATION WILL BE RECEIVED. HOMES SOLD TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS ARE GENERALLY EITHER PAID FOR UPON SHIPMENT OR FLOOR PLAN FINANCED BY THE INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTOR THROUGH STANDARD INDUSTRY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH CAN INCLUDE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. MANUFACTURING SALES FINANCED UNDER FLOOR PLAN ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE REDUCED BY A PROVISION FOR ESTIMATED REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (SEE NOTE  16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  (\"ASC 606\"), REVENUE FROM HOMES SOLD UNDER COMMERCIAL LOAN PROGRAMS INVOLVING FUNDS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY WERE EITHER DEFERRED UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT PAYMENT FOR THE RELATED COMMERCIAL LOAN WAS RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY OR RECOGNIZED WHEN THE HOME WAS SHIPPED AND TITLE TRANSFERRED, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE PROGRAM AND BORROWER. UPON ADOPTION OF ASC 606, THE COMPANY GENERALLY RECOGNIZES HOME SALES REVENUE UPON SHIPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TITLE, AS IT IS PROBABLE THAT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE CONSIDERATION IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GOODS OR SERVICES TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER WILL BE COLLECTED. ONE CONSIDERATION UNDER THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE EVALUATION OF THE FINANCING COMPONENT OF THE RELATED LOAN PROGRAM. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT THE INTEREST RATE CHARGED UNDER THE LOAN PROGRAM IS LESS THAN THE MARKET RATE, THE COMPANY WILL REDUCE THE TRANSACTION PRICE BY AN AMOUNT FOR DEFERRED INTEREST. IN THESE CASES, INTEREST INCOME WILL BE ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LOAN USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S LOAN PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED AT MARKET RATES.  FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE RECOGNITION - RETAIL  . SALES BY COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL LOCATIONS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CUSTOMER HAS ENTERED INTO A LEGALLY BINDING SALES CONTRACT, THE HOME IS DELIVERED AND PERMANENTLY LOCATED AT THE CUSTOMER'S SITE, THE HOME IS ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER, TITLE HAS TRANSFERRED AND FUNDING IS PROBABLE.  FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE RECOGNITION.  PREMIUM AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON POLICIES ISSUED AND ASSUMED BY STANDARD CASUALTY ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS INTO NET REVENUE OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY. PREMIUMS EARNED ARE NET OF REINSURANCE CEDED. POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS ARE ALSO AMORTIZED IN COST OF SALES OVER THE LIFE OF THE POLICY. INSURANCE AGENCY COMMISSIONS RECEIVED FROM THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE UPON EXECUTION OF THE INSURANCE POLICY, WHERE THE COMPANY HAS NO FUTURE OR ONGOING OBLIGATION.  UPON ACQUISITION OF THE SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIOS (\"ACQUISITION DATE\"), MANAGEMENT EVALUATED CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE HELD FOR INVESTMENT BY COUNTRYPLACE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION OF CREDIT QUALITY AND IF IT WAS PROBABLE THAT COUNTRYPLACE WOULD BE UNABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE LOANS' CONTRACTUAL TERMS. THE COMPANY ALSO CONSIDERED EXPECTED PREPAYMENTS AND ESTIMATED THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF UNDISCOUNTED EXPECTED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE EXCESS OF THE LOAN POOL'S SCHEDULED CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS OVER THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS EXPECTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE AS AN AMOUNT THAT IS NOT ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME (THE NON-ACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE). THE CASH FLOW EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED LOANS IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST INCOME OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE LOANS (REFERRED TO AS ACCRETABLE YIELD). INTEREST INCOME ON CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUE (SEE NOTE  6  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  FOR LOANS ORIGINATED BY COUNTRYPLACE AND HELD FOR SALE, LOAN ORIGINATION FEES AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUE UPON TITLE TRANSFER OF THE LOANS. COUNTRYPLACE PROVIDES THIRD-PARTY SERVICING OF MORTGAGES AND EARNS SERVICING FEES EACH MONTH BASED ON THE AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING BALANCES. SERVICING FEES ARE RECOGNIZED IN NET REVENUE WHEN EARNED.  WARRANTIES.  THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE RETAIL HOME BUYER A ONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY COVERING DEFECTS IN MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP IN HOME STRUCTURE, PLUMBING AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS. NONSTRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF A COSMETIC NATURE ARE WARRANTED FOR  120 DAYS  , EXCEPT IN SPECIFIC CASES WHERE STATE LAWS REQUIRE LONGER WARRANTY TERMS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE WARRANTY COSTS RELATING TO HOMES SOLD, BASED UPON OUR ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE FACTORS. FACTORS USED IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WARRANTY LIABILITY INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF HOMES STILL UNDER WARRANTY INCLUDING HOMES IN DISTRIBUTOR INVENTORIES, HOMES PURCHASED BY CONSUMERS STILL WITHIN THE ONE-YEAR WARRANTY PERIOD, THE TIMING IN WHICH WORK ORDERS ARE COMPLETED AND THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE COSTS INCURRED TO SERVICE A HOME.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESERVE FOR REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMPANIES CUSTOMARILY ENTER INTO REPURCHASE AND OTHER RECOURSE AGREEMENTS WITH LENDING INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE PROVIDED WHOLESALE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING TO DISTRIBUTORS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES ARE MADE TO DISTRIBUTORS PURSUANT TO REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH LENDING INSTITUTIONS. THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT THE COMPANY WILL REPURCHASE OUR NEW PRODUCTS FROM THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS IN THE EVENT SUCH PRODUCT IS REPOSSESSED UPON A DISTRIBUTOR'S DEFAULT. OUR OBLIGATION UNDER THESE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS CEASES UPON THE PURCHASE OF THE HOME BY THE RETAIL CUSTOMER.  THE COMPANY APPLIES FASB ASC 460,  GUARANTEES  AND FASB ASC 450-20,  LOSS CONTINGENCIES  (\"ASC 450-20\"), TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS LIABILITY FOR REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCEPTION OF THE REPURCHASE COMMITMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT IT WILL BE CALLED ON TO PERFORM UNDER THE INVENTORY REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS. IF IT BECOMES PROBABLE THAT A DISTRIBUTOR WILL DEFAULT AND AN ASC 450-20 LOSS RESERVE SHOULD BE RECORDED, THEN SUCH CONTINGENT LIABILITY IS RECORDED EQUAL TO THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON REPURCHASE.  DISTRIBUTOR VOLUME REBATES  . THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS SPONSOR VOLUME REBATE PROGRAMS UNDER WHICH CERTAIN SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS, BUILDERS AND DEVELOPERS CAN QUALIFY FOR CASH REBATES GENERALLY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF SALES ATTAINED DURING A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD. VOLUME REBATES ARE ACCRUED AT THE TIME OF SALE AND ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF NET REVENUE.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED AND WHEN EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT SUCH A REVIEW. THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE ANTICIPATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM SUCH ASSETS IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. IN THAT EVENT, A LOSS IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED PRIMARILY USING THE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS DISCOUNTED AT A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK INVOLVED. LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE DETERMINED IN A SIMILAR MANNER, EXCEPT THAT THE FAIR VALUES ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON INDEPENDENT APPRAISALS AND PRELIMINARY OR DEFINITIVE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS LESS COSTS TO DISPOSE. THE COMPANY RECORDED  NO  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS DURING FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  OR  2017.  INCOME TAXES AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES USING ENACTED TAX RATES IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON THE REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED IN FASB ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  , WHICH REQUIRES THE RECORDING OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE DETERMINATION OF THE NEED FOR OR AMOUNT OF ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND IS BASED UPON THE EVALUATION OF BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF ANTICIPATED TAXABLE PROFITS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS WITH WHICH THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE ASSOCIATED. AT  MARCH 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY EVALUATED ITS HISTORICAL PROFITS EARNED AND FORECASTED TAXABLE PROFITS AND DETERMINED THAT, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN STATE NET OPERATING LOSS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, ALL OTHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WOULD BE UTILIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES.  GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. OUR ANALYSIS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH TESTING IS SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTIES, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE FAIR VALUE TO FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , ALL OF OUR GOODWILL IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING SEGMENT. WE PERFORMED THE ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU NO. 2011-08,  INTANGIBLES-GOODWILL AND OTHER (TOPIC 350): TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT  . THE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT WAS GREATER THAN THE CARRYING VALUE AND THUS NO FURTHER PROCEDURES WERE CONSIDERED NECESSARY.  IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ACHIEVE EXPECTED CASH FLOW LEVELS, OR OTHER FACTORS INDICATE THAT GOODWILL IS IMPAIRED, THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO WRITE OFF ALL OR PART OF OUR GOODWILL, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND NET WORTH. SEE PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS.\"  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACCRETABLE YIELD ON CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE AND SECURITIZED FINANCINGS.  THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE AND SECURITIZED FINANCINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012 AS A PART OF THE PALM HARBOR TRANSACTION. ACQUIRED CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE HELD FOR INVESTMENT AND SECURITIZED FINANCINGS WERE ACQUIRED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A DISCOUNT, AND SUBSEQUENTLY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO FASB ASC 310-30,  LOANS AND DEBT SECURITIES ACQUIRED WITH DETERIORATED CREDIT QUALITY  TO ACCRETE THE DISCOUNT.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS EXPECTED PREPAYMENTS AND DEFAULT RATES AND ESTIMATES THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF UNDISCOUNTED EXPECTED PRINCIPAL, INTEREST AND OTHER CASH FLOWS FOR CONSUMER LOANS RECEIVABLE HELD FOR INVESTMENT TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON SECURITIZED FINANCINGS AND THE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF CONTRACTUAL PRINCIPAL AND CONTRACTUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS DUE ON THE SECURITIZED FINANCINGS IN EXCESS OF ALL CASH FLOWS EXPECTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE CANNOT BE ACCRETED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE (THE NON-ACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE). THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS ACCRETED INTO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE OBLIGATION (REFERRED TO AS ACCRETABLE YIELD). FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE  6  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OTHER MATTERS  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN OTHER DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF OUR COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL LOCATIONS. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY SELLS HOMES AND LENDS TO CERTAIN OF THESE OPERATIONS THROUGH ITS COMMERCIAL LENDING PROGRAMS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  ,  MARCH 31, 2018  AND  APRIL 1, 2017  , THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF SALES TO RELATED PARTIES WAS  $42.2 MILLION  ,  $38.8 MILLION  AND  $13.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , THERE WERE A TOTAL OF  $6.2 MILLION  AND  $0.8 MILLION  OF COMMERCIAL LOANS OUTSTANDING WITH CERTAIN RELATED PARTIES.  IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, THE COMPANY RECORDED A GAIN OF $1.9 MILLION ON THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES TO A RELATED PARTY IN WHICH THE COMPANY OWNS A 10% MINORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST. THE ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION OCCURRED AT MARKET RATES.  IMPACT OF INFLATION.  SUDDEN INCREASES IN SPECIFIC COSTS, SUCH AS THE INCREASES IN MATERIAL AND LABOR, AS WELL AS PRICE COMPETITION, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY INCREASE OUR SELLING PRICES AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INCREASE HOMES SALES PRICES IN FISCAL 2019; HOWEVER, GENERAL MATERIAL AND LABOR INFLATION DID HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR PROFITABILITY. WE CAN GIVE NO ASSURANCE THAT INFLATION WILL NOT AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.  INCOME TAXES.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX ACT, MAKING BROAD AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX CODE THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (1) REDUCING THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE, (2) ALLOWING BONUS DEPRECIATION FOR FULL EXPENSING OF QUALIFIED PROPERTY, (3) ELIMINATING THE MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION AND (4) LIMITING THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DEDUCT CERTAIN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THE TAX ACT REDUCES THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE TO 21% FOR OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MARCH 30, 2019. OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 HAD A FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE OF 31.54%, WHICH IS BASED ON THE TAX RATE BEFORE AND AFTER THE TAX ACT AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS IN THE FISCAL YEAR.  IN ADDITION, ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 THAT ALLOWED US TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD NOT TO EXTEND BEYOND ONE YEAR OF THE ENACTMENT DATE. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED THE ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE TAX ACT, AND THERE WERE NO CHANGES FROM THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.

FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, AND THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1A  ABOVE. FURTHERMORE, SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO  REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DATE OF SUCH EVENTS.  OVERVIEW  OUR BUSINESS  WE ARE A LEADER IN ADMINISTERING CDBS WHICH EMPOWER EMPLOYEES TO SAVE MONEY ON TAXES WHILE ALSO PROVIDING CORPORATE TAX ADVANTAGES FOR EMPLOYERS. WE ARE SOLELY DEDICATED TO ADMINISTERING CDBS, INCLUDING PRE-TAX SPENDING ACCOUNTS SUCH AS HSAS, HEALTH AND DEPENDENT CARE FSAS, HRAS, AS WELL AS COMMUTER BENEFIT SERVICES, INCLUDING TRANSIT AND PARKING PROGRAMS, WELLNESS PROGRAMS, COBRA AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS IN THE UNITED STATES.  IN SEPTEMBER 2015, WE ENTERED INTO OUR SECOND PARTNER ARRANGEMENT WITH CERIDIAN TO TRANSITION THEIR COBRA AND DIRECT BILL PORTFOLIO TO WAGEWORKS. THIS RELATIONSHIP ALSO ALLOWS CERIDIAN TO RESELL THE COMPANY\u2019S COBRA AND DIRECT BILL SERVICES TO THEIR NEW AND EXISTING CLIENTS, IN ADDITION TO THE FULL SUITE OF HEALTHCARE AND COMMUTER PRODUCTS THEY HAVE BEEN SELLING. PURSUANT TO THE ARRANGEMENT, TRANSITION OF THE PORTFOLIO WAS COMPLETED BY THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2016.  IN MARCH 2016, WE WERE SELECTED BY THE OPM TO ADMINISTER ITS FSAFEDS. THIS RELATIONSHIP PROVIDES ELIGIBLE FEDERAL EMPLOYEES ACCESS TO OUR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND PREMIUM SERVICE CAPABILITIES.  ON NOVEMBER 28, 2016, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSACTION WITH ADP, A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS, TO ACQUIRE THE \u201cTHE ADP CHSA/COBRA BUSINESS\u201d FOR APPROXIMATELY $235.0 MILLION IN CASH.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN MANY INSTANCES, WE COULD HAVE REASONABLY USED DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, AND IN OTHER INSTANCES, CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATES MADE BY OUR MANAGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WILL BE AFFECTED.  IN MANY CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF A PARTICULAR TRANSACTION IS SPECIFICALLY DICTATED BY GAAP AND DOES NOT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT IN ITS APPLICATION, WHILE IN OTHER CASES, MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN SELECTING AMONG AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT ALLOW DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AS THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND ESTIMATES. THESE SIGNIFICANT POLICIES AND OUR PROCEDURES RELATED TO THESE POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL BELOW. IN ADDITION, PLEASE REFER TO  NOTE 1  . SUMMARY OF BUSINESS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE REQUIREMENTS OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606) (\u201cASC 606\u201d) AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS BELOW. ASC 606 ESTABLISHES A PRINCIPLE FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE UPON THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CONSIDERATION RECEIVED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. ASC 606 ALSO INCLUDES SUBTOPIC 340-40, OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED COSTS-CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS, WHICH REQUIRES THE DEFERRAL OF INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER. COLLECTIVELY, REFERENCES TO ASC 606 USED HEREIN REFER TO BOTH ASC 606 AND SUBTOPIC 340-40.  WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS BY APPLYING THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 606, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  \u2022  IDENTIFICATION OF THE CONTRACT, OR CONTRACTS, WITH THE CUSTOMER;  \u2022  IDENTIFICATION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  \u2022  DETERMINATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  \u2022  ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; AND  \u2022  RECOGNITION OF THE REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE COMPANY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM BENEFIT SERVICE ADMINISTRATION, INTERCHANGE FEES, COMMISSIONS REVENUE, AND OTHER REVENUE. OTHER REVENUE INCLUDES SERVICES RELATED TO ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY, NON-HEALTHCARE, AND EMPLOYEE ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATION (I.E., TUITION AND HEALTH CLUB REIMBURSEMENTS) AND PROJECT-RELATED PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. WE ACCOUNT FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SEPARATELY IF THEY ARE DISTINCT-THAT IS, IF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS SEPARATELY IDENTIFIABLE FROM OTHER ITEMS IN THE CONTRACT AND IF A CUSTOMER CAN BENEFIT FROM IT ON ITS OWN OR WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER.  WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER WHEN THERE IS APPROVAL AND COMMITMENT FROM BOTH PARTIES, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, PAYMENT TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE AND COLLECTABILITY OF CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. WE MEASURE REVENUE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT WITH EACH CUSTOMER, NET OF ANY SALES INCENTIVES AND TAXES COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. TO THE EXTENT THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO APPLY THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION EXCEPTION, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE UTILIZING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD BASED ON TERM OF BILLING ARRANGEMENTS AND HISTORICAL DATA. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN A MANNER THAT BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER, WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS TRANSFERRED TO A CUSTOMER. WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS WHEN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.  BASED UPON SIMILAR OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES ARE DISAGGREGATED INTO HEALTHCARE, COMMUTER, COBRA AND OTHER REVENUE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE REVENUE CATEGORIES DEPICT HOW THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF ITS REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC FACTORS.  \u2022  HEALTHCARE AND COMMUTER PROGRAMS INCLUDE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE MONTHLY ADMINISTRATION SERVICES BASED ON EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT LEVELS AND INTERCHANGE AND OTHER COMMISSION REVENUES.  \u2022  COBRA REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE SERVICES FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR THE EMPLOYER\u2019S HEALTH BENEFITS, SUCH AS MEDICAL, DENTAL, VISION AND FOR THE CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cHRAS\u201d), AND CERTAIN HEALTHCARE FLEXIBLE SPENDING ACCOUNTS (\u201cFSAS\u201d).  \u2022  OTHER REVENUE INCLUDES SERVICES RELATED TO ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY, NON-HEALTHCARE, EMPLOYEE ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATION (I.E., TUITION AND HEALTH CLUB REIMBURSEMENTS).  WITHIN OUR HEALTHCARE AND COMMUTER SERVICE LINES, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR ADMINISTRATION SERVICES ARE A SINGLE CONTINUOUS SERVICE COMPRISED OF A SERIES OF DISTINCT SERVICES THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AND THAT HAVE THE SAME PATTERN OF TRANSFER (I.E. DISTINCT DAYS OF SERVICE). THESE SERVICES ARE CONSUMED AS THEY ARE RECEIVED AND THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SERVICE REVENUE OVER TIME ON A MONTHLY BASIS AS IT SATISFIES ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN EACH MONTH FOR THE ADMINISTRATION SERVICES PROVIDED IN THAT MONTH USING THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION EXCEPTION.  THE COMPANY APPLIES THIS EXCEPTION BECAUSE IT CONCLUDED THAT THE NATURE OF ITS OBLIGATIONS AND THE VARIABLE PAYMENT TERMS ARE ALIGNED AND THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE CONSIDERATION IS RESOLVED ON A MONTHLY BASIS AS THE COMPANY SATISFIES ITS OBLIGATIONS. THE ADMINISTRATION SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY BILLED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COBRA REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO MAKE HEALTH COVERAGE AVAILABLE FOR TERMINATED EMPLOYEES FOR A PERIOD OF UP TO 36 MONTHS POST-TERMINATION. SIMILAR TO OUR HEALTHCARE AND COMMUTER SERVICE LINES, OUR COBRA ADMINISTRATION SERVICES ARE A SINGLE CONTINUOUS SERVICE. THESE SERVICES ARE CONSUMED AS THEY ARE RECEIVED AND THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SERVICE REVENUE OVER TIME ON A MONTHLY BASIS AS IT SATISFIES ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN EACH MONTH FOR THE COBRA ADMINISTRATION SERVICES PROVIDED IN THAT MONTH USING THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION EXCEPTION. THE ADMINISTRATION SERVICES ARE TYPICALLY BILLED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  WE ALSO RECOGNIZE REVENUES THAT ARE GENERATED FROM THE USE OF DEBIT CARDS USED BY EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS RELATED TO THE DISTRIBUTION, MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING OF SUCH CARDS WHICH ARE USED BY PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION SERVICES FOR HEALTHCARE AND COMMUTER SERVICE LINES. THESE RELATED FEES ARE KNOWN AS INTERCHANGE FEES AND ARE BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE AMOUNTS TRANSACTED ON EACH CARD. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION FOR INTERCHANGE IS A SINGLE CONTINUOUS SERVICE, WHICH IS SATISFIED OVER TIME EACH MONTH. THEREFORE, WE RECOGNIZE INTERCHANGE REVENUE ON A MONTHLY BASIS BASED ON THE SERVICES PROVIDED AND USE THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ALLOCATION EXCEPTION. THE INTERCHANGE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY BILLED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE CONSISTS OF FEES RELATED TO SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S EMPLOYER CLIENTS TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR REPORTING OR ADMINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR UPON WRITTEN ACCEPTANCE FROM CUSTOMERS, IF APPLICABLE, OR ACCEPTANCE PROVISIONS HAVE LAPSED ASSUMING ALL OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION NOTED ABOVE HAVE BEEN MET.  CONTRACT ASSETS  CONTRACT ASSETS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATED TO OUR ENFORCEABLE RIGHT TO CONSIDERATION FOR COMPLETED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS NOT YET INVOICED. THE CONTRACT ASSETS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE RECEIVABLES BALANCE WHEN THE RIGHTS BECOME UNCONDITIONAL.  CONTRACT LIABILITIES  CONTRACT LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUES AND INCLUDE PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN ADVANCE OF PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT. WE GENERALLY INVOICE OUR CUSTOMERS FOR SERVICES AS THEY ARE PROVIDED ON A MONTHLY BASIS, HOWEVER IN LIMITED INSTANCES WE MAY INVOICE IN ADVANCE OF SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED. CONTRACT LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO THE CUSTOMER. CONTRACT LIABILITIES THAT ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE RECOGNIZED DURING THE SUCCEEDING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ARE RECORDED AS CURRENT DEFERRED REVENUE AND THE REMAINING PORTION IS RECORDED AS NONCURRENT.  CONTRACT COSTS  ASC 606 REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET FOR THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER IF THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO RECOVER SUCH COSTS. INCREMENTAL COSTS ARE COSTS THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INCURRED IF THE CONTRACT HAD NOT BEEN OBTAINED. EXAMPLES OF CONTRACT COSTS ARE COMMISSIONS PAID TO SALES PERSONNEL. SALES COMMISSIONS EARNED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES FORCE ARE CONSIDERED INCREMENTAL AND RECOVERABLE COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER. SALES COMMISSIONS FOR INITIAL CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED AND THEN AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF BENEFIT THAT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE SIX YEARS WHICH APPROXIMATES THE TRANSFER OF BENEFITS TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE PERIOD OF BENEFIT BY TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LENGTH OF CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, USEFUL LIFE OF DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO, AND OTHER FACTORS. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IS INCLUDED IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARD\u2019S FAIR VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES OR MONTE CARLO OPTION PRICING MODEL OR THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK ON THE GRANT DATE AND IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD. THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING AN OPTION PRICING MODEL IS AFFECTED BY OUR STOCK PRICE AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING A NUMBER OF COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE VARIABLES. THESE VARIABLES INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARDS, ACTUAL AND PROJECTED EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISE BEHAVIORS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AND EXPECTED DIVIDENDS.  RSUS AND PERFORMANCE-CONTINGENT STOCK UNITS (\u201cPSUS\u201d) ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE FAIR MARKET VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATES OF GRANT. THE VESTING OF PSUS AWARDED IS CONDITIONED UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES OVER A SPECIFIED PERIOD AND UPON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE APPLICABLE VESTING DATE. AT THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO PSUS VEST BASED UPON BOTH THE LEVEL OF ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES WITHIN THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD AND CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT THROUGH THE APPLICABLE VESTING DATE.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS CALCULATED BASED ON AWARDS ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO VEST AND IS REDUCED FOR ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AT THE TIME OF GRANT AND REVISED, IF NECESSARY, IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL FORFEITURE RATES FOR STOCK OPTIONS, RSUS, AND PSUS ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL FORFEITURE EXPERIENCE.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE EXPENSED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING TERM OF THE GRANT AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF PSUS ARE EXPENSED USING AN ACCELERATED METHOD OVER THE TERM OF THE AWARD ONCE MANAGEMENT HAS  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DETERMINED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVE WILL BE ACHIEVED. COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECORDED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ESTIMATE AS TO WHETHER IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE SHARES AWARDED ARE EXPECTED TO VEST. MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE PROBABILITY OF THE PERFORMANCE MILESTONES BEING MET ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.  WE ESTIMATE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF COMPARABLE COMPANIES FROM A REPRESENTATIVE PEER-GROUP AS WELL AS OUR OWN HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. WE ESTIMATE EXPECTED TERM BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, GIVING CONSIDERATION TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE STOCK-BASED AWARDS, VESTING SCHEDULES AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EMPLOYEE BEHAVIOR SUCH AS EXERCISES AND FORFEITURES. WE BASED THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ON ZERO-COUPON YIELDS IMPLIED FROM U.S. TREASURY ISSUES WITH REMAINING TERMS SIMILAR TO THE EXPECTED TERM ON THE OPTIONS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING ANY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, AND THEREFORE, USED AN EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD OF ZERO IN THE OPTION PRICING MODEL. WE ESTIMATE FORFEITURES AT THE TIME OF GRANT AND REVISE THOSE ESTIMATES IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE ESTIMATED ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS AND RELATED EXPENSE IS BASED ON THE EXPECTATIONS OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) TARGET ACHIEVEMENT OVER A SPECIFIED THREE YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IF WE USE DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS FOR ESTIMATING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, OR IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, FUTURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE.  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF 90 DAYS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CONSIST OF CASH ON DEPOSIT WITH BANKS AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS, STATED AT COST, AS WELL AS COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF LESS THAN 90 DAYS AS FURTHER DESCRIBED UNDER  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  BELOW. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTRACTS DO NOT PROVIDE FOR ANY RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF CASH THAT IT RECEIVES FROM CLIENTS, THE CASH IS RECORDED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH REPRESENTS FUNDING AND PRE-FUNDING BALANCES RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A CORRESPONDING CURRENT OBLIGATION. IN ALL CASES WHERE WE HAVE COLLECTED CASH FROM A CUSTOMER BUT NOT FULFILLED SERVICES (THE PAYMENT OF PARTICIPANT HEALTHCARE CLAIMS OR COMMUTER BENEFITS), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A RELATED LIABILITY TO ITS CUSTOMERS, CLASSIFIED AS CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  RESTRICTED CASH REPRESENTS CASH USED TO COLLATERALIZE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WHICH WERE ISSUED TO THE BENEFIT OF A THIRD PARTY TO SECURE A CONTRACT WITH THE COMPANY.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND THOSE WITH STATED MATURITIES OF BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND ONE YEAR AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES BEYOND TWELVE MONTHS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITHIN CURRENT ASSETS AS THE COMPANY INTENDS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. THESE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH INCLUDES THE ACCRUED INTEREST OF INTEREST-BEARING SECURITIES. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, ARE INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, EXCEPT FOR UNREALIZED LOSSES DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY WHICH WILL BE RECORDED WITHIN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  RECEIVABLES  RECEIVABLES REPRESENT BOTH TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS IN RELATION TO FEES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVICES AND UNPAID AMOUNTS FOR BENEFIT SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS, SUCH AS TRANSIT AGENCIES AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY RECORDS A RECEIVABLE FOR FUNDING AND A CORRESPONDING CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS LIABILITY UNTIL THE COMPANY DISBURSES THE BALANCES TO THE VENDORS.  THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BY SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFYING ACCOUNTS WITH A RISK OF COLLECTABILITY AND PROVIDING AN ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE AFTER ALL MEANS OF COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY IS CONSIDERED REMOTE.  THE COMPANY OFFSETS ON A CUSTOMER BY CUSTOMER BASIS UNPAID AMOUNTS FOR BENEFIT SERVICES AND CUSTOMER OBLIGATION BALANCES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY OFFSETS OUTSTANDING TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING ANY DEBIT OR CREDIT MEMOS, AGAINST ANY PREFUND BALANCES AFTER PLAN YEAR CLOSE OR UPON TERMINATION OF SERVICES BOTH BASED ON THE COMPLETION OF A FULL RECONCILIATION WITH THE CUSTOMER.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  THE COMPANY REVIEWS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXISTS WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF A LONG-LIVED ASSET GROUP, EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRED ASSET GROUP IS NOT RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP TO THE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM ITS USE. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS ITS ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECOGNIZED BY THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET OR ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.  ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL AND DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE COST OF AN ACQUISITION IS ALLOCATED TO THE TANGIBLE ASSETS AND DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS COST OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE ACQUISITION AND IS NOT AMORTIZED, BUT RATHER IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT.  DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CONSISTING OF CLIENT/BROKER CONTRACTS AND RELATIONSHIPS, TRADE NAMES, TECHNOLOGY, NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS AND FAVORABLE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION. ALL DEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED REMAINING ECONOMIC LIVES, GENERALLY RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS INCLUDED IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  THE COMPANY PERFORMS A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSET MIGHT BE IMPAIRED. IN 2018, WE CHANGED THE DATE OF OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FROM DECEMBER 31 TO OCTOBER 1. THE CHANGE WAS MADE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE IMPAIRMENT TESTING DATE WITH OUR LONG-RANGE PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS, AND DOES NOT REPRESENT A MATERIAL CHANGE TO A METHOD OF APPLYING AN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLE RELATED TO CHANGING OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING DATE DID NOT DELAY, ACCELERATE, OR AVOID AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.  THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF TRIGGERING EVENTS THAT COULD INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW THE UNIT\u2019S CARRYING AMOUNT.  \u2022  A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN LEGAL FACTORS OR IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE  \u2022  AN ADVERSE ACTION OR ASSESSMENT BY A REGULATOR  \u2022  UNANTICIPATED COMPETITION  \u2022  A LOSS OF KEY PERSONNEL  \u2022  A MORE-LIKELY THAN-NOT EXPECTATION THAT A REPORTING UNIT OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT WILL BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF  AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE. WHEN REVIEWING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY ASSESSES WHETHER GOODWILL SHOULD BE ALLOCATED TO OPERATING LEVELS LOWER THAN THE COMPANY\u2019S SINGLE OPERATING SEGMENT FOR WHICH DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE AND REVIEWED FOR DECISION-MAKING PURPOSES. THESE LOWER LEVELS ARE REFERRED TO AS REPORTING UNITS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DOES NOT ALLOCATE RESOURCES OR ASSESS PERFORMANCE AT THE INDIVIDUAL HEALTHCARE, COMMUTER, COBRA OR OTHER REVENUE STREAM LEVEL, BUT RATHER AT THE OPERATING SEGMENT LEVEL. DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS THEREFORE NOT MAINTAINED AT THE REVENUE STREAM LEVEL. THE COMPANY\u2019S ONE REPORTING UNIT WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE COMPANY\u2019S ONE OPERATING SEGMENT.  THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS: FIRST, THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE, INCLUDING GOODWILL. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, THE COMPANY MOVES TO THE SECOND STEP TO DETERMINE THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL EXCEEDS ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR ANY EXCESS OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL OVER THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION.  WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, ENTITIES HAVE THE OPTION TO FIRST MAKE A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF IMPAIRMENT IS DEEMED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT, MANAGEMENT WOULD PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. OTHERWISE, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. IN ASSESSING THE QUALITATIVE FACTORS, THE COMPANY ASSESSES RELEVANT EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE AND THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE IDENTIFICATION OF RELEVANT EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES AND HOW THESE MAY IMPACT A REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE OR CARRYING AMOUNT  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE JUDGMENT AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE IDENTIFICATION OF MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONSIDERATIONS, OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, COMPANY SPECIFIC EVENTS AND SHARE PRICE TRENDS AND MAKING THE ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER EACH RELEVANT FACTOR WILL IMPACT THE IMPAIRMENT TEST POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY SUCH IMPACT.  CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS LIABILITY  MANY OF OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS WHEREBY OUR CUSTOMER REMIT FUNDS TO US WHICH REPRESENT PREFUNDS OF EMPLOYER / CLIENT AND EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT CONTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO FSA, HRA AND COMMUTER PROGRAMS. THE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT RESTRICTED CASH AND ACCORDINGLY THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED ARE INCLUDED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY RECORDED AS CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS. OUR CUSTOMERS GENERALLY PROVIDE US WITH PREFUNDS FOR THEIR FSA AND HRA PROGRAMS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF PROJECTED SPENDING BY THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS FOR THE PLAN YEAR AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE CASE OF OUR COMMUTER PROGRAM, AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH MONTH WE RECEIVE PREFUNDS BASED ON THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 MONTHLY ELECTIONS. THESE PREFUNDS ARE TYPICALLY REPLENISHED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BY OUR FSA, HRA AND COMMUTER CLIENTS AS CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED BENEFITS UNDER THESE PROGRAMS.  THE COMPANY OFFSETS ON A CUSTOMER BY CUSTOMER BASIS UNPAID AMOUNTS FOR BENEFIT SERVICES AND CUSTOMER OBLIGATION BALANCES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY OFFSETS OUTSTANDING TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING ANY DEBIT OR CREDIT MEMOS, AGAINST ANY PREFUND BALANCES AFTER PLAN YEAR CLOSE OR UPON TERMINATION OF SERVICES BOTH BASED ON THE COMPLETION OF A FULL RECONCILIATION WITH THE CUSTOMER.  BUSINESS COMBINATION  WE RECORD ACQUISITIONS USING THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. ALL OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, ARE RECOGNIZED AT THEIR FAIR VALUE AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND NET INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. THE APPLICATION OF THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN ORDER TO ALLOCATE PURCHASE PRICE CONSIDERATION. OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE ACQUIRED COMPANIES AND, ASSISTANCE FROM INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY APPRAISAL FIRMS. OUR SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE CASH FLOWS FOR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, THE ESTIMATED COST OF CAPITAL, AND THE COST SAVINGS EXPECTED TO BE DERIVED FROM ACQUIRING AN ASSET. THESE ESTIMATES ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE. IN ADDITION, UNANTICIPATED EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY OCCUR WHICH MAY AFFECT THE ACCURACY OR VALIDITY OF SUCH ESTIMATES.

WE ALSO EARN INTERCHANGE REVENUE PAID BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RELATED TO TRANSACTION FEES ON DEBIT CARDS USED BY EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH ALL OF OUR HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS AND THROUGH OUR WHOLESALE CARD PROGRAM, AND REVENUE FROM SELF-SERVICE PLAN KITS CALLED PREMIUM ONLY PLAN KITS.  THE  INCREASE  IN HEALTHCARE REVENUE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN HSA CLIENTS AND CUSTODIAL INTEREST, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN FSA CLIENTS.  THE  $79.7 MILLION  , OR  41%  INCREASE  IN HEALTHCARE REVENUE FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN FSA AND HSA REVENUE DUE TO THE ADDITION OF NEW CLIENTS, INCLUDING FSAFEDS, AND GROWTH IN EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE REVENUE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THE ADP CHSA BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2016 WHICH INCLUDES INTERCHANGE SERVICES. THE ACQUIRED ADP BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $55.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  COBRA REVENUE  COBRA REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM ADMINISTRATION SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO EMPLOYER CLIENTS FOR CONTINUATION OF COVERAGE FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR THE EMPLOYER\u2019S HEALTH BENEFITS, SUCH AS MEDICAL, DENTAL AND VISION, AND FOR THE CONTINUED ADMINISTRATION OF THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 HRAS AND CERTAIN HEALTHCARE FSAS.  THE  $5.4 MILLION  , OR  5%  DECREASE  IN COBRA REVENUE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN CLIENTS  DUE TO A COMBINATION OF PARTNERSHIP TERMINATION AND ADP PLATFORM LOSSES  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ANNUAL NOTICE FEES.  THE  $37.8 MILLION  , OR  51%  INCREASE  IN COBRA REVENUE FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ADP COBRA BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2016. ADDITIONALLY, COBRA REVENUE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM OUR CERIDIAN BUSINESS WITH CUSTOMERS JOINING THROUGHOUT THE FIRST HALF OF 2016. THE ACQUIRED ADP BUSINESS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $33.4 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  COMMUTER REVENUE  WE DERIVE OUR COMMUTER REVENUE FROM MONTHLY SERVICE FEES PAID BY OUR EMPLOYER CLIENTS, INTERCHANGE REVENUE PAID BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RELATED TO TRANSACTION FEES ON DEBIT CARDS USED BY EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMMUTER SOLUTIONS AND COMMISSIONS FROM THE SALE OF TRANSIT PASSES USED IN OUR COMMUTER SOLUTIONS WHICH WE PURCHASE FROM VARIOUS TRANSIT AGENCIES ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS.  THE  $3.1 MILLION  , OR  4%  INCREASE  IN COMMUTER REVENUE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF CLIENTS, GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS AND AN INCREASE IN INTERCHANGE FEE REVENUE.  THE  $2.7 MILLION  , OR  4%  INCREASE  IN COMMUTER REVENUE FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF CLIENTS, GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS AND AN INCREASE IN INTERCHANGE FEE REVENUE.  OTHER REVENUE  OTHER REVENUE INCLUDES ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY SERVICES, EMPLOYEE ACCOUNT ADMINISTRATION (I.E., TUITION AND HEALTH CLUB REIMBURSEMENTS) AND PROJECT-RELATED PROFESSIONAL FEES.  THE  $1.6 MILLION  , OR  9%  DECREASE  IN OTHER REVENUE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN ENROLLMENT AND ELIGIBILITY SERVICES.  THE  $0.3 MILLION  , OR  2%  INCREASE  IN OTHER REVENUE FROM  2016  TO  2017  IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF REVENUES  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  CHANGE FROM PRIOR YEAR  2018  2017  2016  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  COST OF REVENUES (EXCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE)  $154,804  $173,661  $129,046  $(18,857  )  $44,615  PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE  33%  36%  36%  COST OF REVENUES CONSIST OF DIRECT EXPENSES FOR CLAIMS PROCESSING, PRODUCT SUPPORT AND CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONNEL, OUTSOURCED AND TEMPORARY LABOR, CHECK/ACH PAYMENT PROCESSING SERVICES, DEBIT CARD PROCESSING SERVICES, SHIPPING AND HANDLING, PASSES AND EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT COMMUNICATIONS.  THE  $18.9 MILLION  , OR  11%  DECREASE  IN COST OF REVENUES FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY  LOWER OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDER COSTS DUE TO LOWER TRANSITIONAL COSTS AND LOWER EMPLOYEE AND OFFICE/FACILITIES COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TECHNOLOGY  COSTS.  THE  $44.6 MILLION  OR  35%  INCREASE  IN COST OF REVENUES FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN OUTSOURCED SERVICES AND COMPENSATION COSTS FOR HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT THE ADP CHSA/COBRA BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2016. WE ALSO INCURRED ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION COSTS TO ADMINISTER FSAFEDS.  COST OF REVENUES WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY OUR PORTFOLIO PURCHASES, ACQUISITIONS AND CHANNEL PARTNER ARRANGEMENTS. PRIOR TO MIGRATING TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS, THESE NEW PORTFOLIOS OFTEN OPERATE WITH HIGHER SERVICE DELIVERY COSTS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED COST OF REVENUES UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE MIGRATION PROCESS, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS OVER THE 12 TO 24 MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING OF THE PORTFOLIO PURCHASE OR ACQUISITION.

THE  $11.6 MILLION  , OR  26%  INCREASE  IN TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION COSTS TO SUPPORT THE ADP CHSA/COBRA BUSINESS AND TO ADMINISTER FSAFEDS. WE ALSO INCURRED ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION COSTS TO SERVICE CLIENTS ACQUIRED FROM CERIDIAN. ADDITIONALLY, OUR OUTSOURCED SERVICE COSTS ALSO INCREASED TO SUPPORT THE ADP CHSA BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2016.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE ENHANCING THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND INCREASE INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS PART OF OUR CONTINUOUS EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR EMPLOYER CLIENT AND EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE AND TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE OUR CONTROL AND COMPLIANCE ENVIRONMENT. THE TIMING OF DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT PROJECTS, INCLUDING THE NATURE OF EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS THE PHASE OF THE PROJECT THAT COULD REQUIRE CAPITALIZATION OR EXPENSE TREATMENT, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE BOTH IN DOLLAR AMOUNT AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SALES AND MARKETING  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  CHANGE FROM PRIOR YEAR  2018  2017  2016  2018  2017  (IN THOUSANDS)  SALES AND MARKETING  $73,092  $64,111  $57,083  $8,981  $7,028  PERCENT OF REVENUE  15%  13%  16%  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPENSATION AND RELATED BENEFIT COSTS FOR OUR SALES, CLIENT SERVICES AND MARKETING STAFF, INCLUDING SALES COMMISSIONS FOR OUR DIRECT SALES FORCE AND EXTERNAL AGENTS AND BROKERS, AS WELL AS COMMUNICATION, PROMOTIONAL, PUBLIC RELATIONS AND OTHER MARKETING EXPENSES.  THE  $9.0 MILLION  OR  14%  INCREASE  IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED EMPLOYEE COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDER COSTS.  THE  $7.0 MILLION  OR  12%  INCREASE  IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND RELATED BENEFIT COSTS TO SUPPORT CLIENT RELATIONSHIPS, ATTRIBUTED PRIMARILY TO INCREASED COSTS AFTER THE ADP ACQUISITION.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, CLIENT SERVICES AND MARKETING BY HIRING ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL AND CONTINUING TO BUILD OUR BROKER AND CHANNEL RELATIONSHIPS. WE ALSO PROMOTE OUR BRAND THROUGH A VARIETY OF MARKETING AND PUBLIC RELATIONS ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT OUR SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES TO INCREASE IN DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE  $29.4 MILLION  , OR  41%  INCREASE  IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES ATTRIBUTED TO THE RESTATEMENT AND AUDIT COMMITTEE INVESTIGATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO EXECUTIVE DEPARTURES AND A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE.  THE  $11.8 MILLION  , OR  20%  INCREASE  IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED BENEFIT COSTS INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE. AS A RESULT OF OUR GROWTH, WE INCREASED HEADCOUNT, INCURRED ADDITIONAL CLIENT COSTS AND INCREASED VARIOUS OUTSOURCED ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FACILITY COSTS INCREASED AS WE EXPANDED OUR OPERATIONS.  AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW, WE EXPECT OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE EXPAND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT TO SUPPORT OUR CONTINUED GROWTH. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT THE EXPENSES TO REMAIN AT THE ELEVATED LEVELS IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF PROFESSIONAL FEES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR RESTATEMENT AND CONTROL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES.

WE CAPITALIZE OUR SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS SOLUTION. WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE FOR ITS INTENDED USE, THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE TECHNOLOGY\u2019S ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE, WHICH IS GENERALLY FOUR YEARS. ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ALSO AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.  THE  $3.6 MILLION  OR  9%  INCREASE  IN AMORTIZATION FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  THE  $0.7 MILLION  OR  2%  INCREASE  IN AMORTIZATION FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN NOVEMBER 2016 IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADP CHSA/COBRA BUSINESS COMBINATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO TWO ONE-TIME EVENTS THAT OCCURRED IN 2016. IN 2016, WE TERMINATED A SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP IN OUR HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE BUSINESS RESULTING IN A $3.8 MILLION ACCELERATION OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2016, WE RECORDED A $3.7 MILLION IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR KP CONNECTOR, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 7  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2018, WE CONTINUED TO ADD TO THE SIZE OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  THE  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  183%  INCREASE  IN INTEREST INCOME FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES IN 2017.  THE  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  38%  INCREASE  IN INTEREST EXPENSE FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN 2017.  THE  $4.6 MILLION  , OR  168%  INCREASE  IN INTEREST EXPENSE FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR DEBT AT THE END OF 2016 THAT REMAINED OUTSTANDING THROUGHOUT 2017. IN NOVEMBER 2016, WE BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $169.9 MILLION TO ACQUIRE THE ADP CHSA/COBRA BUSINESS. THIS DEBT REMAINED OUTSTANDING IN 2017 RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  THE  $0.3 MILLION  , OR  90%  CHANGE  IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  THE  $1.4 MILLION  OR  129%  CHANGE  IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS DRIVEN BY INSURANCE SETTLEMENT PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN 2016 RELATED TO AN INSURANCE CLAIM IN 2015.  INCOME TAXES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS ARE REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE USE THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD TO ACCOUNT FOR INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE. VALUATION ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED, WHEN NECESSARY, TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO AN AMOUNT WHOSE REALIZATION IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT.  MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY EVALUATES IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED. IN MAKING SUCH DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ORDER TO SUPPORT A CONCLUSION THAT A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS NOT NEEDED, POSITIVE EVIDENCE OF SUFFICIENT QUANTITY AND QUALITY (OBJECTIVE COMPARED TO SUBJECTIVE) IS NECESSARY TO OVERCOME NEGATIVE EVIDENCE.  DURING THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZE TAX LIABILITIES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF WHETHER ADDITIONAL TAXES AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE. THESE TAX LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN, DESPITE THE BELIEF THAT OUR TAX RETURN POSITIONS ARE SUPPORTABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN POSITIONS MAY NOT BE MORE LIKELY THAN NOT OF BEING SUSTAINED UPON REVIEW BY TAX AUTHORITIES. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS APPROXIMATED  $5.6 MILLION  AND WE HAVE NO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT WOULD BE REDUCED AS A RESULT OF A LAPSE OF THE APPLICABLE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ACCRUALS FOR TAX LIABILITIES ARE ADEQUATE FOR ALL OPEN AUDIT YEARS BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING PAST EXPERIENCE AND INTERPRETATIONS OF TAX LAW. THIS ASSESSMENT RELIES ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AND MAY INVOLVE A SERIES OF COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. WE RECOGNIZE ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.  IN THE FUTURE, IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CHANGE IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR THE OTHER FACTORS THAT WERE CONSIDERED IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. ANY SUBSEQUENT INCREASES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED TAX EXPENSE. ANY DECREASES IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WILL BE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF THE INCOME TAX PROVISION.

THE TAX ACT INTRODUCES TAX REFORM THAT REDUCES THE CURRENT CORPORATE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, AMONG OTHER CHANGES. THE RATE REDUCTION IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT THE TAX ACT REQUIRES A REVALUATION OF OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET UPON ITS ENACTMENT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND RECORDED A CHARGE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $0.3 MILLION.  THE  $4.6 MILLION  OR  48%  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FROM  2017  TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE EFFECT OF THE COVERED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION LIMITATION PURSUANT TO THE TAX ACT, STATE TAX EXPENSE AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.  THE  $0.7 MILLION  OR  7%  INCREASE  IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FROM  2016  TO  2017  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PURSUANT TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-09 OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN PROVISIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE REVALUATION OF NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT AND INCREASE IN INCOME BEFORE TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WERE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALING  $898.4 MILLION  AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING  $222.2 MILLION  COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF FUNDING BY CLIENTS OF AMOUNTS TO BE PAID ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED  $178.7 MILLION.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AVAILABLE CREDIT FROM OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND EXPECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND STOCK REPURCHASE NEEDS, AS WELL AS ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR POTENTIAL FUTURE PORTFOLIO PURCHASES, OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN ABLE TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS AS INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS IN THE FUTURE. OUR EXPECTATION IS BASED ON OUR CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED CLIENT RETENTION RATES AND OUR CONTINUING FUNDING MODEL IN WHICH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR ENTERPRISE CLIENTS PROVIDE US WITH PREFUNDS AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER \u201c  \u2014PREFUNDS  .\u201d TO THE EXTENT THESE CURRENT AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL PORTFOLIO PURCHASES, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. WE CANNOT PROVIDE ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  PREFUNDS  UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYER CLIENTS, WE RECEIVE PREFUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OUR CLIENT CONTRACTS DO NOT CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR USE OF CLIENT PREFUNDS AND, AS A RESULT, EACH PREFUND IS REFLECTED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WITH AN EQUIVALENT CUSTOMER OBLIGATION RECORDED AS A LIABILITY AS THE PREFUND IS RECEIVED. CHANGES IN THESE PREFUNDS AND THE CORRESPONDING CUSTOMER OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE TIMING OF WHEN EMPLOYER CLIENTS MAKE THEIR PREFUNDS AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF WHEN WE MAKE PAYMENTS ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS.  THE OPERATION OF THESE PREFUNDS FOR OUR EMPLOYER CLIENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR TYPICALLY IS AS FOLLOWS: AT THE BEGINNING OF A PLAN YEAR, THESE EMPLOYER CLIENTS PROVIDE US WITH PREFUNDS FOR THEIR FSA AND HRA PROGRAMS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF PROJECTED SPENDING BY THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS FOR THE PLAN YEAR AND OTHER FACTORS. IN THE CASE OF OUR COMMUTER PROGRAM, AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH MONTH WE RECEIVE PREFUNDS BASED ON THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 MONTHLY ELECTIONS. THESE PREFUNDS ARE TYPICALLY REPLENISHED ON A WEEKLY BASIS BY OUR FSA AND HRA EMPLOYER CLIENTS AND ON A MONTHLY BASIS BY OUR COMMUTER EMPLOYER CLIENTS, IN EACH CASE, AFTER WE HAVE ADVANCED THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO PROCESS EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS\u2019 FSA AND HRA CLAIMS AS THEY ARE SUBMITTED TO US AND TO PAY VENDORS RELATING TO OUR COMMUTER PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT, OUR CASH BALANCES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING UPON THE TIMING OF INVOICING, THE DATE PAYMENT IS RECEIVED FROM OUR EMPLOYER CLIENTS OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR PAYMENTS WE HAVE MADE ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS. THIS PREFUNDING ACTIVITY COVERS OUR ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY ONE WEEK OF SPENDING ON BEHALF OF THE EMPLOYER CLIENT\u2019S EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS. WE DO NOT REQUIRE A PREFUND TO ADMINISTER ANY OF OUR HSA PROGRAMS BECAUSE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS IN THESE PROGRAMS ONLY HAVE ACCESS TO FUNDS THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY CONTRIBUTED.  REVOLVING  CREDIT FACILITY (CREDIT AGREEMENT)  ON AUGUST 1, 2016, WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH MUFG UNION BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (\u201cAGENT\u201d) TO INCREASE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CREDIT LIMIT FROM $150.0 MILLION TO $250.0 MILLION.

WE MAY PREPAY LOANS UNDER THE SECOND AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SECOND AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE INCURRED FEES OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.9 MILLION  , WHICH ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE SECOND AMENDED CREDIT AGREEMENT.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OVERVIEW  THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF THE COMPANY IS TO GROW PROFITABLE SALES AND IMPROVE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (\"ROIC\") THROUGH FIVE STRATEGIC PILLARS.  THESE STRATEGIC PILLARS INCLUDE.  *  DEFEND THE BASE BUSINESS  - DESIGN, PRODUCT INNOVATION, CATEGORY LEADERSHIP  *  EXPAND TO ADJACENT CATEGORIES WITH A FOCUS ON BRANDS  - FOCUS ON FRAGMENTED MARKETS, BRANDS, OMNI-CHANNEL  *  BUILD AN OMNI-CHANNEL BUSINESS MODEL  - DEDICATED RESOURCES, LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY  *  IMPROVE ROIC BY MAXIMIZING MARGINS WHILE MINIMIZING CAPITAL INVESTMENT  - STREAMLINE AND FOCUS ON ECONOMIC VALUE ADD AND WORKING CAPITAL  *  BUILD A COLLABORATIVE, ONE CSS CULTURE  - COMMUNICATION, ACCOUNTABILITY, DIVERSITY  APPROXIMATELY  70%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2019 ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRODUCTS WITHIN OUR GIFT AND CRAFT CATEGORIES, WITH THE REMAINDER ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRODUCTS IN THE SEASONAL CATEGORY.  THE SEASONAL PRODUCT CATEGORY IS DEFINED AS PRODUCTS DESIGNED, PRODUCED AND SOLD TO MASS MARKET AND ONLINE RETAILERS FOR HOLIDAYS AND SEASONAL EVENTS, INCLUDING CHRISTMAS, VALENTINE\u2019S DAY, EASTER AND BACK-TO-SCHOOL.  PRODUCTION FORECASTS FOR THESE PRODUCTS ARE KNOWN WELL IN ADVANCE OF SHIPMENT.  THE GIFT PRODUCT CATEGORY IS DEFINED AS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY DESIGNED TO CELEBRATE CERTAIN LIFE EVENTS OR SPECIAL OCCASIONS SUCH AS WEDDINGS, BIRTHDAYS, ANNIVERSARIES, GRADUATIONS, OR THE BIRTH OF A CHILD.  GIFT PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY SOLD INTO MASS, SPECIALTY, AND ONLINE RETAILERS, FLORAL AND PACKAGING WHOLESALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, AND ARE GENERALLY ORDERED ON A REPLENISHMENT BASIS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THE CRAFT PRODUCT CATEGORY REFLECTS PRODUCTS USED FOR CRAFT ACTIVITIES AND INCLUDES RIBBONS, TRIMS, BUTTONS, SEWING PATTERNS, KNITTING NEEDLES, NEEDLE ARTS AND KIDS CRAFTS.  CRAFT PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO MASS MARKET, SPECIALTY, AND ONLINE RETAILERS AND ARE GENERALLY ORDERED ON A REPLENISHMENT BASIS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS RELATIVELY HIGH MARKET SHARE IN MANY PRODUCTS ACROSS ITS CATEGORIES.  MOST OF THESE MARKETS HAVE DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONFRONT SIGNIFICANT PRICE PRESSURE AS ITS COMPETITORS SOURCE CERTAIN PRODUCTS FROM OVERSEAS AND ITS CUSTOMERS INCREASE DIRECT SOURCING FROM OVERSEAS FACTORIES.  INCREASING CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION HAS AUGMENTED CUSTOMERS' BARGAINING POWER, WHICH HAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO PRICE PRESSURE.  IN RECENT FISCAL YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED LOWER SALES IN CERTAIN CHRISTMAS PRODUCT LINES, CRAFT RIBBON PRODUCT LINES, GIFT STATIONERY, INFANT PRODUCT LINE, AND IN OUR NON-RETAIL PACKAGING AND FLORAL PRODUCT LINES DUE TO FACTORS SUCH AS CONTINUED PRICE PRESSURE, INVENTORY DESTOCKING, AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN BRICK AND MORTAR RETAIL TRAFFIC.  THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN SEVERAL MEASURES TO RESPOND TO SALES VOLUME, COST AND PRICE PRESSURES.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CONTINUES TO HAVE STRONG CORE PRODUCT OFFERINGS WHICH HAVE ALLOWED IT TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THIS COMPETITIVE MARKET.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS PURSUING NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES RELATED TO SEASONAL, GIFT AND CRAFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING NEW LICENSED AND NON-LICENSED PRODUCT OFFERINGS, AS WELL AS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN OMNI-CHANNEL OFFERINGS.  CSS CONTINUALLY INVESTS IN PRODUCT AND PACKAGING DESIGN AND PRODUCT KNOWLEDGE TO ASSURE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE UNIQUE ADDED VALUE TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  IN ADDITION, CSS MAINTAINS PURCHASING OFFICES IN HONG KONG AND CHINA TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE FOREIGN-SOURCED PRODUCTS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES.  CSS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES THE EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF ITS PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES AND OF ITS BACK OFFICE OPERATIONS TO MAINTAIN ITS COMPETITIVENESS.  CSS' DOMESTICALLY-MANUFACTURED PLASTIC DECORATIVE RIBBON PRODUCT LINES HAVE EXPERIENCED PRICE PRESSURE AND REDUCED SALES VOLUME BECAUSE OF COMPETITION FROM LOW-PRICED IMPORTS FROM CHINA. IN DECEMBER 2017, OUR BERWICK OFFRAY COMPANY FILED TRADE REMEDY PETITIONS WITH THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (\u201cITC\u201d) AND THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE (\u201cCOMMERCE DEPARTMENT\u201d) ASSERTING THAT THE COMPETING CHINESE PRODUCTS ARE BEING IMPORTED AT LESS-THAN-FAIR VALUE AND THAT THEY BENEFIT FROM UNFAIR GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES.  IN THE PETITIONS, BERWICK OFFRAY REQUESTED THE IMPOSITION OF TRADE REMEDIES IN THE FORM OF ANTIDUMPING (\u201cAD\u201d) AND COUNTERVAILING (\u201cCV\u201d) DUTIES ON PLASTIC DECORATIVE RIBBON FROM CHINA.  THE ITC AND THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT COMPLETED THEIR RESPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS AND ISSUED THEIR FINAL DETERMINATIONS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE ITC FOUND THAT U.S. PRODUCERS OF PLASTIC DECORATIVE RIBBON HAVE BEEN MATERIALLY INJURED BY UNFAIRLY TRADED IMPORTS OF PLASTIC DECORATIVE RIBBON FROM CHINA.  IN MARCH 2019, THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT IMPOSED TRADE REMEDIES, IN THE FORM OF AD AND CV DUTIES, ON IMPORTS OF PLASTIC DECORATIVE RIBBON FROM CHINA AT COMBINED AD AND CV DUTY RATES RANGING FROM 78.14% TO 464.71%.  THESE RATES ARE SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE ADJUSTMENT THROUGH AN ANNUAL ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW PROCESS, AND THE AD AND CV DUTY ORDERS ISSUED BY THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ARE SUBJECT TO A SUNSET REVIEW ONCE EVERY FIVE YEARS.  THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THESE PROCEEDINGS IS NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME.  16  THE SEASONAL NATURE OF CSS\u2019 BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN LOWER SALES LEVELS AND OPERATING LOSSES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS AND COMPARATIVELY HIGHER SALES LEVELS AND OPERATING PROFITS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR, WHICH ENDS MARCH 31, THEREBY CAUSING SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ON EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SEASONAL, GIFT AND CRAFT CUSTOMERS BY EXPANDING AND DIVERSIFYING ITS PRODUCT LINES AND THEREBY GROWING ITS PRESENCE IN THE LARGEST RETAILERS IN NORTH AMERICA.  THIS INCLUDES BOTH CAPITALIZING ON OPPORTUNITIES FOR ORGANIC GROWTH IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AS WELL AS ACQUIRING COMPANIES WHICH FIT INTO APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION PARAMETERS.  THOUGH WE ARE PAUSING ON ACQUISITIONS IN THE NEAR TERM, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY MEET WITH SEASONAL, GIFT AND CRAFT COMPANIES TO REVIEW AND ASSESS POTENTIAL ACQUISITION TARGETS.  HISTORICALLY, SIGNIFICANT REVENUE GROWTH AT CSS HAS COME THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.  OVER THE LONG TERM, MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO CONSIDER ACQUISITIONS AS A STRATEGY TO STIMULATE GROWTH.  ON JUNE 1, 2018, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE BUSINESS AND NET ASSETS OF FITLOSOPHY, INC. (\"FITLOSOPHY\") FOR $2,500,000 IN CASH AND TRANSACTION COSTS OF $25,000, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO THE $2,500,000 PAID AT CLOSING, THE COMPANY MAY PAY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $10,500,000 OF CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION, IN CASH, IF NET SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS MEET OR EXCEED FIVE DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE THROUGH MARCH 31, 2023.  THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION PAYMENTS WILL BE PAID, IF AT ALL, GENERALLY WITHIN 20 DAYS AFTER THE END OF EACH ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH MEASUREMENT PERIOD (QUARTERLY THROUGH MARCH 31, 2023).  AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION WAS $1,600,000.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE UPDATED OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION TO BE $1,366,000 WHICH IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  FITLOSOPHY IS DEVOTED TO CREATING, MARKETING, AND DISTRIBUTING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT INSPIRE PEOPLE TO DEVELOP HEALTHY HABITS BY FOCUSING ON EFFECTIVE GOAL-SETTING THROUGH JOURNALING.  PRODUCTS INCLUDE A COMPLETE LINE OF FITNESS AND WELLNESS PLANNING PRODUCTS ALL SOLD UNDER THE FITLOSOPHY  TM  , LIVE LIFE FIT  TM  AND FITBOOK  TM  BRANDS.  THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE ACQUISITION METHOD AND THE EXCESS OF COST OVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED OF $1,390,000 WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT A TRIGGERING EVENT OCCURRED DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WAS IN EXCESS OF THE COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION.  GIVEN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, THE COMPANY BYPASSED THE OPTION TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF IMPAIRMENT AND PROCEEDED DIRECTLY TO THE QUANTITATIVE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF ITS IMPAIRMENT TEST, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $1,390,000.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, THE COMPANY HAD NO GOODWILL.  ON NOVEMBER 3, 2017, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS AND BUSINESS OF SIMPLICITY CREATIVE GROUP FROM WILTON FOR A TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $69,617,000  AND TRANSACTION COSTS OF $3,411,000  .

SIMPLICITY'S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO MASS-MARKET RETAILERS, SPECIALTY FABRIC AND CRAFT CHAINS, WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTORS AND ONLINE CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY PRIMARILY FINANCED THE ACQUISITION WITH BORROWINGS OF $60,000,000 UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY.  A PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE IS BEING HELD IN ESCROW FOR CERTAIN INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS.  THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE ACQUISITION METHOD AND THE EXCESS OF COST OVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED OF $9,642,000  WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  THIS GOODWILL WAS SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN OFF AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON DECEMBER 13, 2016, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE NET ASSETS AND BUSINESS OF THE MCCALL PATTERN COMPANY AND CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES FOR $13,914,000  IN CASH PLUS TRANSACTION COSTS OF $1,484,000  .

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS BARGAIN PURCHASE, THE COMPANY RECORDED A GAIN OF $376,000  IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2017.  LITIGATION  CSS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN ORDINARY, ROUTINE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE MATERIAL.  IN THE OPINION OF COMPANY COUNSEL AND MANAGEMENT, THE ULTIMATE LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH LEGAL  17  PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO INCREMENTAL SALES OF $55,459,000 RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF SIMPLICITY ON NOVEMBER 2, 2017.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT EXCLUDING SIMPLICITY WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN GROSS SALES OF $16,268,000 DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME AND $10,416,000 DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, FURTHERED BY $1,375,000 HIGHER CUSTOMER CLAIMS AND AN INCREASE IN COST OF SALES OF $1,771,000 AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY'S INITIATIVE TO STREAMLINE PRODUCT OFFERINGS. THIS DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8,354,000 OF LOWER MCCALL\u2019S INVENTORY STEP-UP AMORTIZATION. THE OVERALL DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT FOR THE BASE BUSINESS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED GROSS PROFIT OF $18,260,000 FROM A FULL YEAR OF THE SIMPLICITY BUSINESS RESULTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2019 INCREASED TO $113,349,000 FROM $105,201,000 IN FISCAL 2018 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A FULL YEAR RESULTS OF THE SIMPLICITY BUSINESS RESULTING IN AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES OF $9,818,000.

INCOME TAXES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME (LOSS) BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WERE  (18)%  IN FISCAL  2019  AND  21%  IN FISCAL  2018  .

THE COMPANY HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2017.

NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2017 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS OF $7,273,000.  THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON CASH ON HAND, CASH GENERATED FROM ITS OPERATIONS AND SEASONAL BORROWINGS UNDER ITS CREDIT FACILITY TO MEET ITS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  HISTORICALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES HAVE BEEN SEASONAL, PRIMARILY CHRISTMAS RELATED, WITH 64% OF SALES RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS.  AS PAYMENT FOR SALES OF CHRISTMAS RELATED PRODUCTS IS USUALLY NOT RECEIVED UNTIL JUST BEFORE OR JUST AFTER THE HOLIDAY SELLING SEASON IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL INDUSTRY PRACTICE, WORKING CAPITAL HAS HISTORICALLY INCREASED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS, PEAKING PRIOR TO CHRISTMAS AND DROPPING THEREAFTER.  ON MARCH 7, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $125,000,000 ASSET BASED SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY WITH THREE BANKS (THE \u201cABL CREDIT FACILITY\u201d).  THE COMPANY USED THE PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE ABL CREDIT FACILITY TO REPAY IN FULL THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY WITH TWO BANKS (THE \u201cPRIOR CREDIT FACILITY\u201d), UNDER WHICH THE MAXIMUM CREDIT AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY AT ANY ONE TIME (THE \u201cCOMMITTED AMOUNT\u201d) WAS $50,000,000 AT THE TIME THE PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY WAS REPAID AND TERMINATED ON MARCH 7, 2019.  FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS ABL FACILITY, SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS $26,139,000  OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S ABL CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY HAD $173,000  OF OTHER DEBT OUTSTANDING AND  $156,000  OF CAPITAL LEASES OUTSTANDING AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  BASED ON ITS CURRENT OPERATING PLAN, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS SOURCES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET ITS ONGOING CASH NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AS OF MARCH 31,  2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  4-5 YEARS  AFTER 5 YEARS  TOTAL  DEBT  (1)  $26,462  $14  $\u2014  $\u2014  $26,476  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  145  13  \u2014  \u2014  158  OPERATING LEASES  10,520  17,806  13,564  21,818  63,708  OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS  (2)  273  456  604  4,147  5,480  ROYALTY OBLIGATIONS  (3)  947  1,970  \u2014  \u2014  2,917  $38,347  $20,259  $14,168  $25,965  $98,739  (1)  DEBT INCLUDES THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AS WELL AS THE PRINCIPLE AND INTEREST RELATED TO AN EQUIPMENT FINANCING AGREEMENT AT A RATE OF 5.72%.  (2)  OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL LIABILITIES, DEFERRED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS, PENSION OBLIGATIONS, AND DEFERRED RENT.  FUTURE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FOR OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS IS ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT.  20  (3)  THE COMPANY IS COMMITTED TO PAY GUARANTEED MINIMUM ROYALTIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSED PRODUCTS.  THE ABOVE TABLE EXCLUDES ANY POTENTIAL UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX LIABILITIES THAT MAY BECOME PAYABLE UPON EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INCOME TAX RETURNS BY TAXING AUTHORITIES.  SUCH AMOUNTS AND PERIODS OF PAYMENT CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED.  SEE NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  AS OF MARCH 31,  2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER COMMITMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  4-5 YEARS  AFTER 5 YEARS  TOTAL  LETTERS OF CREDIT  $2,182,000  $\u2014  $\u2014  $\u2014  $2,182,000  THE COMPANY HAS A REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT GUARANTEE THE FUNDING OF WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND A LEASE SECURITY DEPOSIT.  THE COMPANY HAS NO FINANCIAL GUARANTEES OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS WITH ANY THIRD PARTIES OR RELATED PARTIES OTHER THAN ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH VENDORS TO PURCHASE MERCHANDISE IN ADVANCE OF EXPECTED DELIVERY.  THESE PURCHASE ORDERS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY SIGNIFICANT TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR OTHER PENALTIES IF CANCELED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES.  THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MOST SIGNIFICANT WHERE THEY INVOLVE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR MATTERS SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHANGE, AND WHERE THEY CAN HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  BELOW ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND RELATED ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IF ACTUAL RESULTS WERE TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATES MADE, THE REPORTED RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.  REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS, IN THE AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM ITS CUSTOMERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS.  THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED USING THE FIVE-STEP MODEL IDENTIFIED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 606, \"REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS.\"  THESE STEPS ARE: (I) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER; (II) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; (III) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE; (IV) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; AND (V) RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED.  THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY INCLUDE ONE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION UNDER THE REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD.  FOR MOST PRODUCT SALES, THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS THE DELIVERY OF A SPECIFIED PRODUCT, AND IS SATISFIED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT HAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER, WHICH TAKES PLACE WHEN TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS TRANSFER IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE SHIPPING TERMS, TYPICALLY EITHER AT SHIPPING POINT OR AT DELIVERY TO A SPECIFIED DESTINATION.  THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN LIMITED PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY SEWING PATTERNS, WHICH ARE SOLD ON CONSIGNMENT AT MASS MARKET RETAILERS.  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE ON THESE PRODUCTS AS THEY ARE SOLD TO END CONSUMERS AS RECORDED AT POINT-OF-SALE TERMINALS, WHICH IS THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN A CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER, AND IS MEASURED AS THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING THE GOODS.  WHEN APPLICABLE, THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR.  VARIABLE CONSIDERATION CONSISTS OF REVENUES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REDUCTIONS TO THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SPECIAL PRICING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS, VOLUME INCENTIVES AND OTHER PROMOTIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND ESTIMATES THE EXPECTED CONSIDERATION BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS.  THE RELATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED IN ACCRUED CUSTOMER PROGRAMS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS ITS ESTIMATE OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AT LEAST QUARTERLY OR WHEN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES USED IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS MAY CHANGE.  IN LIMITED CASES, THE COMPANY MAY PROVIDE THE RIGHT TO RETURN PRODUCT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, BASED PRIMARILY ON KNOWN CLAIMS, FOR CUSTOMER RETURNS AND CHARGEBACKS THAT MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF SHIPPING ERRORS, PRODUCT DAMAGED IN TRANSIT OR FOR OTHER REASONS THAT BECOME KNOWN SUBSEQUENT TO RECOGNIZING THE REVENUE.  THESE PROVISIONS ARE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THAT THE RELATED  21  SALE IS RECOGNIZED AND ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION FROM GROSS SALES.  THE RELATED RESERVES ARE INCLUDED AS A REDUCTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  IF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL CUSTOMER RETURNS AND CHARGEBACKS WERE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE FROM THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED RESERVE WOULD BE RECORDED.  THE COMPANY TREATS SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS OBTAINED CONTROL OF A GOOD AS AN ACTIVITY TO FULFILL THE PROMISE TO TRANSFER THE PRODUCT.  COSTS RELATED TO SHIPPING OF PRODUCT ARE RECORDED AS INCURRED AND CLASSIFIED IN COST OF SALES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  PAYMENT TERMS WITH CUSTOMERS VARY BY CUSTOMER, BUT GENERALLY RANGE FROM 30 TO 90 DAYS.  CERTAIN SEASONAL REVENUES HAVE EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL INDUSTRY PRACTICE.  SINCE THE TERM BETWEEN INVOICING AND EXPECTED PAYMENT IS LESS THAN ONE YEAR, THE COMPANY DOES NOT ADJUST THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A FINANCING COMPONENT.  SALES COMMISSIONS ARE EARNED AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE AS THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME.  THESE COSTS ARE RECORDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUE AND CREDITED DIRECTLY TO OBLIGATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES.  INVENTORY VALUATION  INVENTORIES ARE VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. COST IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD ALTHOUGH CERTAIN INVENTORIES ARE VALUED BASED ON THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD.  THE COMPANY WRITES DOWN ITS INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED OBSOLESCENCE IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF THE INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND, MARKET CONDITIONS, CUSTOMER PLANOGRAMS AND SALES FORECASTS.  ADDITIONAL INVENTORY WRITE DOWNS COULD RESULT FROM UNANTICIPATED ADDITIONAL CARRYOVER OF FINISHED GOODS AND RAW MATERIALS, OR FROM LOWER PROCEEDS OFFERED BY PARTIES IN OUR TRADITIONAL CLOSEOUT CHANNELS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OF MCCALL ON DECEMBER 13, 2016, SIMPLICITY ON NOVEMBER 3, 2017, AND FITLOSOPHY ON JUNE 1, 2018, THERE WAS A STEP-UP TO FAIR VALUE OF THE INVENTORY ACQUIRED OF  $21,773,000  ,  $10,214,000  , AND $312,000  , RESPECTIVELY, RECORDED AT THE APPLICABLE DATES OF ACQUISITION.  THIS WAS A RESULT OF THE INVENTORY ACQUIRED BEING MARKED UP TO ESTIMATED NET SELLING PRICE IN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING, AND IS RECOGNIZED THROUGH COST OF SALES AS THE INVENTORY TURNS.  THE AMOUNT OF STEP-UP TO FAIR VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED INVENTORY REMAINING AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $284,000  AND $10,683,000  .  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE ACQUIRED SIMPLICITY INVENTORY TO BE SOLD THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.  OTHER INTANGIBLES AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS  OTHER INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF TRADENAMES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  AN ENTITY HAS THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED.  TO PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT, AN ENTITY MUST IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, INDUSTRY AND ENTITY-SPECIFIC EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT COULD AFFECT THE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET.  IF THE RESULT OF THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET IS IMPAIRED, A MORE DETAILED FAIR VALUE CALCULATION WILL NEED TO BE PERFORMED WHICH IS USED TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENTS AND TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES TO BE RECOGNIZED, IF ANY.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TRADENAMES IS CALCULATED USING A \u201cRELIEF FROM ROYALTY PAYMENTS\u201d METHODOLOGY.  THIS APPROACH INVOLVES FIRST ESTIMATING REASONABLE ROYALTY RATES FOR EACH TRADEMARK THEN APPLYING THESE ROYALTY RATES TO A NET SALES STREAM AND DISCOUNTING THE RESULTING CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE.  THE ROYALTY RATE IS ESTIMATED USING BOTH A MARKET AND INCOME APPROACH.  THE MARKET APPROACH RELIES ON THE EXISTENCE OF IDENTIFIABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKETPLACE INVOLVING THE LICENSING OF TRADENAMES SIMILAR TO THOSE OWNED BY THE COMPANY.  THE INCOME APPROACH USES A PROJECTED PRETAX PROFITABILITY RATE RELEVANT TO THE LICENSED INCOME STREAM.  WE BELIEVE THE USE OF MULTIPLE VALUATION TECHNIQUES RESULTS IN A MORE ACCURATE INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH TRADENAME.  THIS FAIR VALUE IS THEN COMPARED WITH THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH TRADENAME.  LONG-LIVED ASSETS (INCLUDING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT) AND INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  RECOVERABILITY OF ASSETS TO BE HELD AND USED IS MEASURED BY A COMPARISON OF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUP TO FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS ESTIMATED BY THE COMPANY TO BE GENERATED BY SUCH ASSETS.  IF SUCH ASSET GROUP IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP.  ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF THEIR CARRYING VALUE OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR ACTUAL CURRENT TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT (STATE, FEDERAL AND FOREIGN), INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PERMANENT AND TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES  22  RESULTING FROM DIFFERING BASES AND TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR TAX AND ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, SUCH AS THE CARRYING VALUE OF INTANGIBLES, DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND VALUATION OF INVENTORIES.  TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES AND OPERATING LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS RESULT IN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  WE THEN ASSESS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE RECOVERED FROM FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THIS ASSESSMENT IF SUFFICIENT TAXABLE INCOME IS NOT GENERATED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  TO THE EXTENT WE DETERMINE THE NEED TO ESTABLISH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OR INCREASE (DECREASE) SUCH ALLOWANCE IN A PERIOD, THE COMPANY WOULD RECORD ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY ESTIMATES THE PROBABLE TAX OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY USING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND INFORMED JUDGMENTS.  THERE ARE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THE INTERPRETATION OF TAX REGULATIONS.  THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES MADE AT A POINT IN TIME MAY CHANGE BASED ON THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO OR FURTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF REGULATIONS.  IF SUCH CHANGES TAKE PLACE, THERE IS A RISK THAT THE TAX RATE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE IN ANY PERIOD.  NEW TAX LEGISLATION IN THE U.S., COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX ACT, WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017.  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION 740, \"ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,\" REQUIRED COMPANIES TO RECOGNIZE THE EFFECT OF TAX LAW CHANGES IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT EVEN THOUGH THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR MOST PROVISIONS WAS FOR TAX YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2017, OR IN THE CASE OF CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS, JANUARY 1, 2018.  THOUGH CERTAIN KEY ASPECTS OF THE NEW LAW WERE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 AND HAD AN IMMEDIATE ACCOUNTING EFFECT, OTHER SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS WERE NOT EFFECTIVE OR DID NOT RESULT IN ACCOUNTING EFFECTS FOR THE COMPANY UNTIL APRIL 1, 2018.  GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LEGISLATION, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 118, \"INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT\" (\"SAB 118\"), WHICH ALLOWED REGISTRANTS TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A ONE YEAR \u201cMEASUREMENT PERIOD\u201d SIMILAR TO THAT USED WHEN ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.  HOWEVER, THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD WAS DEEMED TO HAVE ENDED EARLIER WHEN THE REGISTRANT OBTAINED, PREPARED AND ANALYZED THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO FINALIZE ITS ACCOUNTING.  DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, IMPACTS OF THE LAW WERE EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED AT THE TIME A REASONABLE ESTIMATE FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF THE EFFECTS COULD BE MADE, AND PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED AND ADJUSTED AS INFORMATION BECAME AVAILABLE, PREPARED OR ANALYZED.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT INCORPORATING ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON OUR CURRENT INTERPRETATIONS OF ITS PROVISIONS.  WE RECOGNIZED THE TAX IMPACTS RELATED TO DEEMED REPATRIATED EARNINGS AND REVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND INCLUDED THOSE AMOUNTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FISCAL 2018. IN FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING WITHIN THE ONE-YEAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD ALLOWED UNDER SAB 118. AFTER FURTHER REFINEMENT OF OUR CALCULATIONS, ANY CHANGES IN INTERPRETATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MADE, AND REVIEW OF ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED, THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT DID NOT MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018. IN ADDITION, WE ADOPTED A POLICY TO RECORD ANY TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW-TAXED INCOME (\u201cGILTI\u201d) PROVISION OF THE TAX ACT AS A PERIOD COST.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION CONCERNING RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF THOSE STANDARDS.
