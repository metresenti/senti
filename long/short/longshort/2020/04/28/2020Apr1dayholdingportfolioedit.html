EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\"WE\", \"AGILENT\" OR THE \"COMPANY\"), INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN MAY 1999, IS A GLOBAL LEADER IN LIFE SCIENCES, DIAGNOSTICS AND APPLIED CHEMICAL MARKETS, PROVIDING APPLICATION FOCUSED SOLUTIONS THAT INCLUDE INSTRUMENTS, SOFTWARE, SERVICES AND CONSUMABLES FOR THE ENTIRE LABORATORY WORKFLOW.  NET REVENUE OF  $1,357 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED  6 PERCENT  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IN JANUARY 2020, NET REVENUE WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DUE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN CHINA AND THE EXTENSION OF THE LUNAR NEW YEAR RESULTING IN FEWER SELLING DAYS IN THE MONTH.

REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR LIFE SCIENCES AND APPLIED MARKETS BUSINESS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED  5 PERCENT  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  REVENUE FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO OUR LIFE SCIENCES AND APPLIED MARKETS BUSINESS REVENUE GROWTH IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  . FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  HAD AN OVERALL  UNFAVORABLE  IMPACT ON REVENUE OF LESS THAN  1  PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR DIAGNOSTICS AND GENOMICS BUSINESS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED  6 PERCENT  WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  HAD AN OVERALL  UNFAVORABLE  IMPACT ON REVENUE OF  1  PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR.  NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $197 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $504 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  WAS IMPACTED BY A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $299 MILLION RELATED TO THE EXTENSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX INCENTIVE IN SINGAPORE. IN THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , CASH USED IN OPERATIONS WAS  $59 MILLION  WHICH INCLUDES AN ONE-TIME TAX OUTFLOW OF $226 MILLION RELATED TO A TRANSFER OF INTANGIBLES COMPARED TO CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS OF  $213 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $56 MILLION  AND  $52 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE PAID ON THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK.  ON NOVEMBER 19, 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\") DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DILUTION RESULTING FROM ISSUANCE OF STOCK UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.75 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION AND HAS NO FIXED TERMINATION DATE. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED, AMENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  725,827  SHARES FOR  $60 MILLION  UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  1.1 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $75 MILLION  UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $967 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE, CONTINUED GROWTH AND EARNINGS EXPANSION. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, WE EXPECT THE RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT STARTED IN CHINA AND HAS GROWN WORLDWIDE WILL REDUCE BUSINESS RESULTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, BUT DESPITE THE SHORT-TERM UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THIS HEALTH CRISIS, WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR 2020 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND EQUITY ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  HAD AN OVERALL  UNFAVORABLE  IMPACT ON REVENUE OF LESS THAN  1  PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT BY REDUCING OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). WE MAY ALSO HEDGE EQUITY BALANCES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY ON A LONG TERM BASIS.TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.

GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND NUMEROUS MATTERS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.

DESPITE THE EXPECTED NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE STILL BELIEVE THIS SEGMENT WILL GROW IN FISCAL 2020.  BOOKINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE BOOKINGS WE ACHIEVED IN BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) FOR THIS SEGMENT WAS  1.03  . PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS IS NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE LOWER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES TO BOTH U.S. GOVERNMENT AND DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. OUR HEIGHTS  TM  SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO GAIN TRACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HEIGHTS  TM  NETWORKING PLATFORM WAS RECENTLY SELECTED BY A MAJOR MARITIME SERVICE PROVIDER IN ASIA AS THE BEST FIT FOR DEMANDING MARITIME APPLICATIONS.

OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DETERIORATION IN MACROECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS ARE TEMPORARY AND THAT CONDITIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL 2020. HOWEVER, OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RESULTING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS.

SALES OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HAVE LONG SALES CYCLES AND ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFICULT-TO-PREDICT CHANGES IN THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES OF WIRELESS CARRIER CUSTOMERS, BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE POSITIONED WELL.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LARGE OPPORTUNITIES PENDING RELATED TO UPGRADES TO NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEMS. OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS REMAIN FAVORABLE; AS SUCH, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 TO BE ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  40.5%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  47.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG AND DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS STILL APPEARS ROBUST. HOWEVER, LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW BELIEVE THAT NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, LARGELY DUE TO THE TIMING OF AND PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS RELATED TO OUR $98.6 MILLION U.S. ARMY GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT.  BOOKINGS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE HIGHER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  0.80  . BOOKINGS DURING THE QUARTER INCLUDE $13.4 MILLION OF INITIAL FUNDING RELATED TO A 10-YEAR, $211.0 MILLION IDIQ CONTRACT AWARDED TO US BY A PRIME CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION TROPOSCATTER SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS. WE BELIEVE THIS MULTI-YEAR OPPORTUNITY VALIDATES COMTECH\u2019S MARKET LEADING TROPOSCATTER TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPERTISE. PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS ARE NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  46  INDEX  NET SALES OF OUR MISSION-CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , LARGELY DUE TO LOWER NET SALES OF SATELLITE BASED SPACE COMPONENTS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH RELIABILITY ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONIC AND ELECTROMECHANICAL (\"EEE\") PARTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF SALES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD RELATED TO OUR NEXT GENERATION MT-2025 MOBILE SATELLITE TRANSCEIVERS.  NET SALES OF OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE HIGHER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF OUR SOLID-STATE, HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIERS AND RELATED SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING, DEPLOYMENT AND TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS BY OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE  SALES BY GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE AS FOLLOWS.

DOMESTIC SALES INCLUDE SALES TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO U.S. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THERE WERE  NO  CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  . INCLUDED IN DOMESTIC SALES, ARE SALES TO VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. (\"VERIZON\"). SALES TO VERIZON WERE  10.1%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  (WHICH INCLUDE SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS) WERE  $35.3 MILLION  AND  $37.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S.,  NO  INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY (INCLUDING SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY) REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $60.6  MILLION AND  $61.2  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  DECREASE  OF  $0.6  MILLION REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  37.5%  AS COMPARED TO  37.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THIS SLIGHT INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT HISTORICALLY ACHIEVES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 PRIMARILY REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX, INCLUDING LOWER NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO ANTICIPATED MIX CHANGES, INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED CESSATION OF SALES TO AT&T FOR 911 WIRELESS CALL ROUTING WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  47  INDEX  OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG AND THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THIS SEGMENT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LEVEL ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY OF  $0.6  MILLION AND  $1.0  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED IN \"  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY,\"  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY AND RECORD A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED USAGE TRENDS.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. NEVERTHELESS, BASED ON EXPECTED BOOKINGS, EXPECTED TIMING OF OUR PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS AND THE ANTICIPATED MIX OF NET SALES BETWEEN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 TO BE THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $29.4  MILLION AND  $32.0  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $2.6  MILLION, OR  8.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  18.2%  AND  19.5%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $3.9 MILLION OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO THE REPOSITIONING OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, IN ADDITION TO A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. EXCLUDING THE $0.3 MILLION, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WOULD HAVE BEEN $29.7 MILLION, OR 18.4% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $28.1 MILLION, OR 17.1% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES.  AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECORDED AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS  $1.1 MILLION  IN BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT TOTAL FISCAL 2020 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER AND, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SIMILAR TO THE  19.1% RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  $13.7  MILLION AND  $14.0  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $0.3  MILLION, OR  2.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  8.5%  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $11.9  MILLION RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND  $1.7  MILLION AND  $2.0  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE REMAINING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $0.1  MILLION FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE SEEK CUSTOMER FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ADAPT OUR PRODUCTS TO SPECIALIZED CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , CUSTOMERS REIMBURSED US  $2.4  MILLION AND  $2.3  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT IS INCLUDED IN NET SALES WITH THE RELATED COSTS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS IN NEW PRODUCTS ACROSS ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE  8.4% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  AMORTIZATION RELATING TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES WAS  $5.2  MILLION (OF WHICH  $4.3  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $0.9  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  $4.3  MILLION (OF WHICH  $3.5  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $0.8  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE OF  $0.9  MILLION WAS DUE TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC IN JANUARY 2020.  48  INDEX  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES TOTAL ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.0  MILLION WHICH REFLECTS A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. SUCH TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ANY PENDING OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  SETTLEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A  $3.2  MILLION BENEFIT IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $6.0  MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS OF UHP AND GILAT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $1.8  MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITION OF SOLACOM. THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY  $3.6  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF GILAT AND UHP. THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT OUR ACQUISITION PLAN EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND TOTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MAY ULTIMATELY BE HIGHER.  OPERATING INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $6.2  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $12.4  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  UNALLOCATED  CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  $12.6  8.8  5.0  7.8  (11.4  )  (4.1  )  $6.2  12.4  PERCENTAGE OF RELATED NET SALES  13.1%  10.1%  7.6%  10.1%  NA  NA  3.8%  7.6%  THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  REFLECTS  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH CHARGE, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $12.7 MILLION, OR 14.6% OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES. THE SLIGHT DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT'S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE HIGHER THAN THE  10.1% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN NET SALES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN ADDITION TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE LOWER THAN THE 9.2% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER AND THE $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS  $1.2 MILLION  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  EXCLUDING THE  $6.0 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS DURING THE PERIOD, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WOULD HAVE BEEN  $12.0 MILLION  , OR  7.4%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $1.8 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES,  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS AND  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN $14.9 MILLION, OR 9.1% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE FROM 9.1% TO  7.4%  REFLECTS CHANGES IN OVERALL SPENDING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  49  INDEX  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES, SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY CERTAIN ANNUAL NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS IN THE FORM OF FULLY-VESTED SHARE UNITS. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS, ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS. IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE OUR FISCAL 2020 BUSINESS GOALS, AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD BE LOWER THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 RANGE.  LOOKING FORWARD, UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE $23.6 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY: (I) INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (WHICH IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS) WHICH, IN FISCAL 2020, IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $12.0 MILLION TO $14.0 MILLION; (II) INCREASED COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING INCREMENTAL COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH; (III) THE ABSENCE OF A $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2020 RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE RULING IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER; (IV) INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES; AND (IV) OTHER INCREASED SPENDING AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY ASSUMED IN FISCAL 2020.  DESPITE THE INCURRENCE OF $8.4 MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $32,000 BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL $3.6 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR FISCAL 2020 GAAP CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES) IS ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE $41.4 MILLION OR  6.2% WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $1.6  MILLION AND  $2.3  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE (INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS APPROXIMATELY  4.3%.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW EXPECT OUR FISCAL 2020 INTEREST EXPENSE RATE TO APPROXIMATE  4.5%  AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE TO APPROXIMATE  $7.0  MILLION. OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 CASH BORROWING RATE (WHICH EXCLUDES THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IS APPROXIMATELY  3.50%  TO  3.75%.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS NOMINAL. ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WHICH, AT THIS TIME, ARE CURRENTLY YIELDING AN IMMATERIAL INTEREST RATE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS  $1.1  MILLION AND  $2.4  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (EXCLUDING DISCRETE TAX ITEMS) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS 23.0%. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.1 MILLION  . DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE OF LESS THAN  $0.1 MILLION.  OUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL 2017 AND 2018 ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF OUR STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. TCS'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 TO FEBRUARY 23, 2016, THE DATE WE ACQUIRED TCS, IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF TCS'S STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO CALENDAR YEAR 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. FUTURE TAX ASSESSMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  NET INCOME.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME WAS  $3.5  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $7.8  MILLION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  50  INDEX  ADJUSTED EBITDA.  ADJUSTED EBITDA (BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED NET SALES) FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW (NUMBERS IN THE TABLE MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING).

THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, AND DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET SALES IN THIS SEGMENT OFFSET BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT AS WELL AS UNALLOCATED SPENDING, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 INCLUDES SEVERAL ITEMS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN STILL SHIFT AND IMPACT OUR EXPECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  LOOKING FORWARD, BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG, THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED SALES, AND OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WE ARE TARGETING CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER IN FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE $93.5 MILLION WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.

OUR DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA MAY DIFFER FROM THE DEFINITION OF EBITDA OR ADJUSTED EBITDA USED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO A MEASURE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED BY OUR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS MAY USE ADJUSTED EBITDA, ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR SEC FILINGS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES FOR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE REFLECT THE GAAP MEASURES AS REPORTED, ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS AS DESCRIBED. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AS THEY EXCLUDE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE GRANTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS, AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP IN THE ABOVE TABLES, BUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT ALL OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS OR COSTS ARE UNUSUAL, INFREQUENT OR NON-RECURRING. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. INVESTORS ARE ADVISED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR SEC FILINGS. WE HAVE NOT QUANTITATIVELY RECONCILED OUR FISCAL 2020 ADJUSTED EBITDA TARGET TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE BECAUSE ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT IMPACT THESE MEASURES, HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED, ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, OR CANNOT BE PREDICTED. FOR EXAMPLE, QUANTIFICATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES INPUTS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND MARKET PRICE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ASCERTAINABLE. ACCORDINGLY, RECONCILIATIONS TO THE NON-GAAP FORWARD LOOKING METRICS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT AND SUCH UNAVAILABLE RECONCILING ITEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  NET SALES.  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES WERE  $331.9  MILLION AND  $325.0  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  $6.9  MILLION, OR  2.1%  . THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. NET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $190.4  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  $164.7  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , AN  INCREASE  OF  $25.7  MILLION, OR  15.6%  . OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  57.4%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  50.7%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . DESPITE THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE STILL BELIEVE THIS SEGMENT WILL GROW IN FISCAL 2020.  BOOKINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) FOR THIS SEGMENT WAS  0.91  . PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS IS NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE LOWER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES TO BOTH DOMESTIC AND U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. OUR HEIGHTS  TM  SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO GAIN TRACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HEIGHTS  TM  NETWORKING PLATFORM WAS RECENTLY SELECTED BY A MAJOR MARITIME SERVICE PROVIDER IN ASIA AS THE BEST FIT FOR DEMANDING MARITIME APPLICATIONS. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER, WE WERE ALSO AWARDED A CONTRACT VALUED AT MORE THAN $8.8 MILLION FOR KA-BAND SOLID-STATE AMPLIFIERS TO BE USED IN AN IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY SATCOM APPLICATION. OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DETERIORATION IN MACROECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS ARE TEMPORARY AND THAT CONDITIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL 2020. HOWEVER, OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RESULTING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS. IF CURRENT POOR BUSINESS CONDITIONS INCLUDING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND ORDER DELAYS CONTINUE, FISCAL 2020 DELIVERIES AND OR OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR PIPELINE COULD SHIFT INTO FISCAL 2021.  53  INDEX  NET SALES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AS COMPARED TO THE NET SALES WE ACHIEVED IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL SALES TO KEY WIRELESS CUSTOMERS FOR 911 CALL ROUTING. SALES OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HAVE LONG SALES CYCLES AND ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFICULT-TO-PREDICT CHANGES IN THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES OF WIRELESS CARRIER CUSTOMERS, BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE POSITIONED WELL. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ANNOUNCED A CONTRACT WORTH $6.6 MILLION TO UPGRADE A NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEM FOR A NEW ENGLAND STATE, AS WELL AS A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION TOTALING AN ESTIMATED $14.2 MILLION TO PROVIDE ENHANCED 911 SERVICES TO A TIER ONE U.S. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LARGE OPPORTUNITIES PENDING RELATED TO UPGRADES TO NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEMS. OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS REMAIN FAVORABLE; AS SUCH, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 TO BE ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $141.5  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  $160.3  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $18.8  MILLION, OR  11.7%  . OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  42.6%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . HOWEVER, LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW BELIEVE THAT NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, LARGELY DUE TO THE TIMING OF AND PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS RELATED TO OUR $98.6 MILLION U.S. ARMY GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT.  BOOKINGS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  0.80  . BOOKINGS DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD INCLUDE $13.4 MILLION OF INITIAL FUNDING RELATED TO A 10-YEAR, $211.0 MILLION IDIQ CONTRACT AWARDED TO US BY A PRIME CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION TROPOSCATTER SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS. WE BELIEVE THIS MULTI-YEAR OPPORTUNITY VALIDATES COMTECH\u2019S MARKET LEADING TROPOSCATTER TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPERTISE. ALSO, DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD, THE U.S ARMY AWARDED US A CONTRACT WITH A $98.6 MILLION CEILING TO PROVIDE GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATION (\"SATCOM\") TERMINALS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE SATCOM TERMINALS PROVIDE INTER AND INTRA-THEATER NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS WITH WORLDWIDE REACH BACK CAPABILITY. THE FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT COVERS DIVERSE ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SKILLS TO SUPPORT THESE SATCOM TERMINALS, INCLUDING LOGISTICS, HELP DESK, NETWORK ENGINEERING, SECURITY ENGINEERING, RF AND SATELLITE SYSTEM ENGINEERING AND SUPPORT. TO DATE, THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN FUNDED AT $24.4 MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACROSS THE TWELVE-MONTH PERFORMANCE PERIOD PLUS A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION PERIOD. PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS ARE NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR MISSION-CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET SALES TO THE U.S. ARMY OF OUR NEXT GENERATION MT-2025 MOBILE SATELLITE TRANSCEIVERS, AS WELL AS LOWER NET SALES OF SATELLITE BASED SPACE COMPONENTS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH RELIABILITY ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONIC AND ELECTROMECHANICAL (\u201cEEE\u201d) PARTS.  NET SALES OF OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF OUR SOLID-STATE, HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIERS AND RELATED SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING, DEPLOYMENT AND TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS BY OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  54  INDEX  GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE  SALES BY GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  CONSOLIDATED  U.S. GOVERNMENT  17.8%  21.3%  72.5%  68.8%  41.2%  44.7%  DOMESTIC  56.4%  52.2%  9.4%  10.6%  36.3%  31.7%  TOTAL U.S.  74.2%  73.5%  81.9%  79.4%  77.5%  76.4%  INTERNATIONAL  25.8%  26.5%  18.1%  20.6%  22.5%  23.6%  TOTAL  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  SALES TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SALES TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (\"DOD\"), INTELLIGENCE AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES, AS WELL AS SALES DIRECTLY TO OR THROUGH PRIME CONTRACTORS.  DOMESTIC SALES INCLUDE SALES TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO U.S. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THERE WERE NO CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  (WHICH INCLUDE SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS) WERE  $74.7 MILLION  AND  $76.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S.,  NO  INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY (INCLUDING SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY) REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $124.2  MILLION AND  $119.0  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  INCREASE  OF  $5.2  MILLION REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  37.4%  AS COMPARED TO  36.6%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THIS SEGMENT HISTORICALLY ACHIEVES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  PRIMARILY REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX, INCLUDING LOWER NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO ANTICIPATED MIX CHANGES, INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED CESSATION OF SALES TO AT&T FOR 911 WIRELESS CALL ROUTING WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN COMPARISON TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG AND THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THIS SEGMENT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LEVEL ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY OF  $0.9 MILLION  AND  $1.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED IN \"  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY,\"  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY AND RECORD A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED USAGE TRENDS.  55  INDEX  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. NEVERTHELESS, BASED ON EXPECTED BOOKINGS, EXPECTED TIMING OF OUR PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS AND THE ANTICIPATED MIX OF NET SALES BETWEEN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 TO BE THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $61.2  MILLION AND  $63.8  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $2.6  MILLION, OR  4.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  18.4%  AND  19.6%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED  $1.4 MILLION  OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS RELATED TO THE REPOSITIONING OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. EXCLUDING SUCH COSTS, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN $58.5 MILLION, OR 18.0% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD REFLECTS THE ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECORDED AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS  $1.8 MILLION  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT TOTAL FISCAL 2020 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER AND, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SIMILAR TO THE  19.1% RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  $28.6  MILLION AND  $27.2  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN  INCREASE  OF  $1.4  MILLION, OR  5.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  8.6%  AND  8.4%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $24.8  MILLION AND  $23.4  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND  $3.6  MILLION AND  $3.7  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE REMAINING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $0.2  MILLION FOR BOTH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE SEEK CUSTOMER FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ADAPT OUR PRODUCTS TO SPECIALIZED CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , CUSTOMERS REIMBURSED US  $5.1  MILLION AND  $7.3  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT IS INCLUDED IN NET SALES WITH THE RELATED COSTS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS IN NEW PRODUCTS ACROSS ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE  8.4% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  AMORTIZATION RELATING TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES WAS  $10.4  MILLION (OF WHICH  $8.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $1.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  $8.6  MILLION (OF WHICH  $6.9  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $1.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE OF  $1.9  MILLION WAS DUE TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC IN JANUARY 2020.  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES TOTAL ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.0  MILLION WHICH REFLECTS A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. SUCH TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ANY PENDING OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  SETTLEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  56  INDEX  ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $8.4  MILLION, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC, AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS OF UHP AND GILAT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $2.9  MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITION OF SOLACOM. THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY  $3.6  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF GILAT AND UHP. THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT OUR ACQUISITION PLAN EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND TOTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MAY ULTIMATELY BE HIGHER.  OPERATING INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $15.5  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $19.7  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  UNALLOCATED  CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  $22.5  15.8  12.1  14.4  (19.1  )  (10.5  )  $15.5  19.7  PERCENTAGE OF RELATED NET SALES  11.8%  9.6%  8.6%  9.0%  NA  NA  4.7%  6.1%  THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  REFLECTS  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH CHARGE, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $19.7 MILLION, OR 12.0% OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS, AND SLIGHT DECREASE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE, HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE HIGHER THAN THE  10.1% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH FACILITY EXIT COSTS, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WOULD HAVE BEEN  $15.8 MILLION  , OR  9.9%  OF RELATED SEGMENT SALES. THE DECREASE, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  FROM $15.8 MILLION, OR 9.9% TO $12.1 MILLION, OR 8.6%, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT\u2019S NET SALES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD, IN ADDITION TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE LOWER THAN THE 9.2% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS AND SALES ACTIVITY AND HIGHER ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX MONTH PERIOD, AND THE $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $2.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  EXCLUDING THE  $8.4  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WOULD HAVE BEEN  $23.9 MILLION  , OR  7.2%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS,  $1.4 MILLION  OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS,  $2.9 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN $24.7 MILLION, OR 7.6% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE DECREASE FROM 7.6% TO  7.2%  REFLECTS CHANGES IN OVERALL SPENDING AS WELL AS INCREASED AMORTIZATION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES, SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY CERTAIN ANNUAL NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS IN THE FORM OF FULLY-VESTED SHARE UNITS. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS, ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS. IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE OUR FISCAL 2020 BUSINESS GOALS, AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD BE LOWER THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 RANGE.  57  INDEX  LOOKING FORWARD, UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE $23.6 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY: (I) INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (WHICH IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS) WHICH, IN FISCAL 2020, IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $12.0 MILLION TO $14.0 MILLION; (II) INCREASED COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING INCREMENTAL COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH; (III) THE ABSENCE OF A $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2020 RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE RULING IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER; (IV) INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES; AND (IV) OTHER INCREASED SPENDING AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY ASSUMED IN FISCAL 2020.  DESPITE THE INCURRENCE OF  $8.4  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $32,000 BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL $3.6 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR FISCAL 2020 GAAP CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES) IS ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE $41.4 MILLION OR  6.2% WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.4  MILLION AND  $4.9  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE (INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS APPROXIMATELY  4.5%.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW EXPECT OUR FISCAL 2020 INTEREST EXPENSE RATE TO APPROXIMATE  4.5%  AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE TO APPROXIMATE  $7.0  MILLION. OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 CASH BORROWING RATE (WHICH EXCLUDES THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IS APPROXIMATELY  3.50%  TO  3.75%.  WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE WROTE-OFF  $3.2 MILLION  OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN PORTION OF OUR PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY. SEE \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  NOTE (11)  -  CREDIT FACILITY  \" FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE CHARGE IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER FOR BOTH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS NOMINAL. ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WHICH, AT THIS TIME, ARE CURRENTLY YIELDING AN IMMATERIAL INTEREST RATE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS  $2.3  MILLION AND  $0.2  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (EXCLUDING DISCRETE TAX ITEMS) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS 23.0%.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $0.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT WERE SETTLED DURING FISCAL 2020.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $2.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO (I) THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THE IRS AUDIT OF OUR FISCAL 2016 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN, AND (II) DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT WERE SETTLED DURING FISCAL 2019.  OUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL 2017 AND 2018 ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF OUR STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. TCS'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 TO FEBRUARY 23, 2016, THE DATE WE ACQUIRED TCS, IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF TCS'S STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO CALENDAR YEAR 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. FUTURE TAX ASSESSMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  NET INCOME.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME WAS  $9.9  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $11.3  MILLION DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  58  INDEX  ADJUSTED EBITDA.

THE INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, AND THE SLIGHT DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET SALES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT AS WELL AS UNALLOCATED SPENDING, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 INCLUDES SEVERAL ITEMS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN STILL SHIFT AND IMPACT OUR EXPECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  LOOKING FORWARD, BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG,  THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED SALES, AND OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WE ARE TARGETING CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER IN FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE $93.5 MILLION WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019. AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE  14.0%  IN FISCAL 2020.  59  INDEX  A RECONCILIATION OF OUR FISCAL 2019 GAAP NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $93.5 MILLION  IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW (NUMBERS IN THE TABLE MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING).

OUR DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA MAY DIFFER FROM THE DEFINITION OF EBITDA OR ADJUSTED EBITDA USED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO A MEASURE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED BY OUR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS MAY USE ADJUSTED EBITDA, ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR SEC FILINGS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES FOR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE REFLECT THE GAAP MEASURES AS REPORTED, ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS AS DESCRIBED. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AS THEY EXCLUDE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE GRANTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS, AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP IN THE ABOVE TABLES, BUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT ALL OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS OR COSTS ARE UNUSUAL, INFREQUENT OR NON-RECURRING. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. INVESTORS ARE ADVISED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR SEC FILINGS. WE HAVE NOT QUANTITATIVELY RECONCILED OUR FISCAL 2020 ADJUSTED EBITDA TARGET TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE BECAUSE ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT IMPACT THESE MEASURES, HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED, ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, OR CANNOT BE PREDICTED. FOR EXAMPLE, QUANTIFICATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES INPUTS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND MARKET PRICE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ASCERTAINABLE. ACCORDINGLY, RECONCILIATIONS TO THE NON-GAAP FORWARD LOOKING METRICS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT AND SUCH UNAVAILABLE RECONCILING ITEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED $0.9 MILLION FROM  $45.6 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  TO  $46.5 MILLION  AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  . THE INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $31.3 MILLION  AND  $13.0 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS OVERALL CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PRINCIPALLY THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS, BILLINGS AND PAYMENTS.  \u2022  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS $13.7 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO $4.2 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WE PAID $11.2 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF CGC TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THE REMAINING PORTION OF NET CASH USED IN BOTH PERIODS PRIMARILY REPRESENTED EXPENDITURES RELATING TO ONGOING EQUIPMENT UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS.  \u2022  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $16.7 MILLION  AND  $6.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT FACILITY AND REPAID IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY OF  $7.0 MILLION  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , WE PAID  $5.1 MILLION  AND  $5.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. WE ALSO MADE  $5.2 MILLION  AND  $5.0 MILLION  OF PAYMENTS TO REMIT EMPLOYEES' STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE NET SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DISCUSSED BELOW AND IN \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (11) - CREDIT FACILITY.\"  OUR INVESTMENT POLICY RELATING TO OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE PRINCIPAL LOSS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZE THE INCOME WE RECEIVE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO MINIMIZE RISK, WE GENERALLY INVEST OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS (BOTH GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL), CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, BANK DEPOSITS, AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. MANY OF OUR MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS INVEST IN DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BANK SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER SECURITIES ISSUED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS OR MARKET LIQUIDITY, WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. ULTIMATELY, THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS DEPENDENT ON A WELL-FUNCTIONING LIQUID MARKET.  61  INDEX  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR MATERIAL SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF: (I) INTEREST PAYMENTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY; (II) PAYMENTS RELATED TO LEASE COMMITMENTS; (III) OUR ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, INCLUDING INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; AND (IV) PAYMENT OF ACCRUED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.  AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  \"NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (2) - ACQUISITIONS,\"  AND THE SECTION ABOVE TITLED BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020, IN JANUARY 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \"MERGER AGREEMENT\") TO ACQUIRE GILAT SATELLITE NETWORKS LTD (\"GILAT\"). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, EACH GILAT ORDINARY SHARE WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION OF (I)  $7.18  IN CASH, WITHOUT INTEREST, PLUS (II)  0.08425  OF A SHARE OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, WITH CASH PAYABLE IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. BASED ON SUCH CONSIDERATION, ON JANUARY 29, 2020, THE DATE WE ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, GILAT HAD AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $532.5 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO FUND THE GILAT ACQUISITION BY REDEPLOYING A PORTION OF BOTH OUR AND GILAT'S COMBINED UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS PROVIDED BY A NEW  $800.0 MILLION  GILAT ACQUISITION RELATED CREDIT FACILITY (SEE  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 11 - \"CREDIT FACILITY\"  ), THE EXACT TERMS OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. AFTER CLOSING AND INCLUDING ESTIMATED TRANSACTION FEES OF  $28.6 MILLION  , WE EXPECT TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY $45.0 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND.  ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE UHP NETWORKS INC., AND ITS SISTER COMPANY (TOGETHER, \"UHP\") FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE AT CLOSING OF APPROXIMATELY  $40.0 MILLION  , OF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE  $5.0 MILLION  TO BE PAID IN COMTECH COMMON STOCK WITH THE REMAINING BALANCE PAYABLE IN CASH. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES AN EARN-OUT UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $10.0 MILLION  PAYABLE, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH AND OR SHARES OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON SALES MILESTONES ARE REACHED IN THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING. WE EXPECT TO USE EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INCREASED BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO COMPLETE THE UHP ACQUISITION.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE FILED A  $400.0 MILLION  SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC FOR THE SALE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING DEBT. THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC AS OF DECEMBER 14, 2018.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  MARCH 4, 2020  , WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $8.7 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PURSUANT TO OUR CURRENT  $100.0 MILLION  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO TIME RESTRICTIONS AND REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE IN OPEN-MARKET OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AND MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  ON  SEPTEMBER 24, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 4, 2019  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH WERE PAID ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2019  AND  FEBRUARY 14, 2020  , RESPECTIVELY. ON  MARCH 4, 2020  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON  MAY 15, 2020  TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON  APRIL 15, 2020  . FUTURE DIVIDENDS REMAIN SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED, AS WELL AS BOARD APPROVAL.  OUR MATERIAL LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF MANDATORY INTEREST PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LEASE COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET BOTH OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS WITH FUNDS PROVIDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING INCOME, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AMOUNTS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET BOTH OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING CASH REQUIREMENTS.  ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT TO PREDICT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF FINANCING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE, SHOULD OUR SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS INCREASE BEYOND OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CREDIT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND/OR FINANCING FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON  OCTOBER 31, 2018  , WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \"CREDIT FACILITY\") WITH A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS, REPLACING OUR PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF  FEBRUARY 23, 2016  (AS AMENDED BY THAT CERTAIN FIRST AMENDMENT, DATED AS OF  JUNE 6, 2017  (THE \"PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY\")).  THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES A SENIOR SECURED LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO  $550.0 MILLION  CONSISTING OF: (I) A REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY (\"REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY\") WITH A BORROWING LIMIT OF  $300.0 MILLION  ; (II) AN ACCORDION FEATURE ALLOWING US TO BORROW UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $250.0 MILLION  ; (III) A  $35.0 MILLION  LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT; AND (IV) A SWINGLINE LOAN CREDIT SUBLIMIT OF  $25.0 MILLION.  62  INDEX  THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES ON  OCTOBER 31, 2023  (THE \"REVOLVING MATURITY DATE\"). IF WE ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT IN EXCESS OF  $5.0 MILLION  WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS LESS THAN  91  DAYS FROM  OCTOBER 31, 2023  , THE REVOLVING MATURITY DATE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ACCELERATE SO THAT IT WOULD BE  91  DAYS EARLIER THAN THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NEW UNSECURED DEBT.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WERE USED, IN PART, TO REPAY IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY, AND ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED BY US FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WAS  $158.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE NON-CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  $2.6 MILLION  OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY RELATED TO OUR GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND  NO  OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY RANGING FROM  $137.0 MILLION  TO  $169.0 MILLION.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY SHALL BE EITHER: (I) ALTERNATE BASE RATE BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST FROM THE APPLICABLE BORROWING DATE AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO (X) THE GREATEST OF (A) THE PRIME RATE (AS DEFINED) IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE (AS DEFINED) IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY PLUS 1/2 OF 1.00% PER ANNUM AND (C) THE ADJUSTED LIBO RATE (AS DEFINED) ON SUCH DAY (OR, IF SUCH DAY IS NOT A BUSINESS DAY, THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING BUSINESS DAY) PLUS  1.00%  PER ANNUM, PLUS (Y) THE APPLICABLE RATE (AS DEFINED), OR (II) EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST FROM THE APPLICABLE BORROWING DATE AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO (X) THE ADJUSTED LIBO RATE FOR SUCH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS (Y) THE APPLICABLE RATE. DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE RATE IS BASED ON A PRICING GRID THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED) AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER FOR WHICH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLY DELIVERED.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CUSTOMARY NEGATIVE COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATED EXCEPTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) LIENS, (II) INVESTMENTS, (III) INDEBTEDNESS, (IV) SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE CHANGES, INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, (V) DISPOSITIONS, (VI) RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, INCLUDING STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS, AND (VII) CERTAIN OTHER RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT (SUBJECT TO GRACE PERIODS, AS APPROPRIATE), SUCH AS PAYMENT DEFAULTS, CROSS-DEFAULTS TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY, THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFINED CHANGE IN CONTROL AND THE FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE NEGATIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AMENDMENTS TO THE CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FURTHER SYNDICATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) NO SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL UNTIL MATURITY; (II) A MAXIMUM SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO OF  3.75  X TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS (\"TTM\") ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\"ADJUSTED EBITDA\") AND A MAXIMUM TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO OF  4.50  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA, EACH WITH NO STEP DOWNS; AND (III) A MINIMUM INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO OF  3.25  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO WAS  1.60  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA COMPARED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO OF  3.75  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA. OUR INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS  14.51  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA COMPARED TO THE MINIMUM INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO OF  3.25  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA. GIVEN OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, WE ANTICIPATE MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"GUARANTORS\"). AS COLLATERAL SECURITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE GUARANTEES THEREOF, WE AND THE GUARANTORS HAVE GRANTED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LENDERS, A LIEN ON, AND FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  ON DECEMBER 6, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE FOR A MECHANISM TO REPLACE THE LIBO RATE FOR EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS WITH AN ALTERNATIVE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, SHOULD THE LIBO RATE GENERALLY BECOME UNAVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE ON AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY BASIS.  CAPITALIZED TERMS USED BUT NOT DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH FOR SUCH TERMS IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AND FILED WITH THE SEC.  AS DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ABOVE ENTITLED \"  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \" IN CONNECTION WITH OUR AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE GILAT, WE ENTERED INTO AN $800 MILLION DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, THE TERMS OF WHICH WILL BE FINALIZED ON OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. THIS FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY.  63  INDEX  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.  COMMITMENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OTHER THAN AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO BINDING AND NON-BINDING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY COVERING ANTICIPATED PURCHASES OF INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THESE COMMITMENTS, AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WILL MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY.  AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  , CASH PAYMENTS DUE UNDER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING ESTIMATED INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY), EXCLUDING PURCHASE ORDERS THAT WE ENTERED INTO IN OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, ARE AS FOLLOWS.  OBLIGATIONS DUE BY FISCAL YEARS OR MATURITY DATE (IN THOUSANDS)  TOTAL  REMAINDER  OF  2020  2021  AND  2022  2023  AND  2024  AFTER  2024  CREDIT FACILITY - PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS  $158,000  \u2014  \u2014  158,000  \u2014  CREDIT FACILITY - INTEREST PAYMENTS  22,511  3,025  11,999  7,487  \u2014  OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES  39,213  5,647  16,876  10,157  6,533  FINANCE LEASE AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  471  471  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS  $220,195  9,143  28,875  175,644  6,533  AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (11) - CREDIT FACILITY  ,\" OUR CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES A SENIOR SECURED LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO $550.0 MILLION CONSISTING OF: (I) A REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY (\"REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY\") WITH A BORROWING LIMIT OF $300.0 MILLION; (II) AN ACCORDION FEATURE ALLOWING US TO BORROW UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $250.0 MILLION; (III) A $35.0 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT; AND (IV) A SWINGLINE LOAN CREDIT SUBLIMIT OF $25.0 MILLION. THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES ON OCTOBER 31, 2023 (THE \"REVOLVING MATURITY DATE\"). IN ADDITION, IF WE ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT IN EXCESS OF $5.0 MILLION WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS LESS THAN 91 DAYS FROM OCTOBER 31, 2023, THE REVOLVING MATURITY DATE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ACCELERATE SO THAT IT WOULD BE 91 DAYS EARLIER THAN THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NEW UNSECURED DEBT.  AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (18) - STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY,\"  ON MARCH 4, 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.10 PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON MAY 15, 2020 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 15, 2020. FUTURE DIVIDENDS REMAIN SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED, AS WELL AS BOARD APPROVAL.  AT JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $2.6 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY RELATED TO OUR GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE.  IN FISCAL 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FULL AND FINAL WARRANTY SETTLEMENT WITH AT&T, THE LARGEST CUSTOMER/DISTRIBUTOR OF A SMALL PRODUCT LINE THAT WE REFER TO AS THE TCS 911 CALL HANDLING SOFTWARE SOLUTION. AS DISCUSSED IN  \"NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  NOTE (9)  -  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES  ,  \"  PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE ISSUED THIRTY-SIX CREDITS TO AT&T OF $0.2 MILLION WHICH AT&T CAN APPLY ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO PURCHASES OF SOLUTIONS FROM US, BEGINNING OCTOBER 2017 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, THE TOTAL PRESENT VALUE OF THESE MONTHLY CREDITS IS $1.2 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OUR CURRENT ACCRUED WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SUCH AMOUNT IS NOT SHOWN IN THE ABOVE COMMITMENT TABLE.  64  INDEX  AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  \"NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (2) - ACQUISITIONS,\"  IN JANUARY 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \"MERGER AGREEMENT\") TO ACQUIRE GILAT SATELLITE NETWORKS LTD (\"GILAT\"). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, EACH GILAT ORDINARY SHARE WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION OF (I)  $7.18  IN CASH, WITHOUT INTEREST, PLUS (II)  0.08425  OF A SHARE OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, WITH CASH PAYABLE IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. BASED ON SUCH CONSIDERATION, ON JANUARY 29, 2020, THE DATE WE ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, GILAT HAD AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $532.5 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO FUND THE GILAT ACQUISITION BY REDEPLOYING A PORTION OF BOTH OUR AND GILAT'S COMBINED UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS PROVIDED BY A NEW  $800.0 MILLION  GILAT ACQUISITION RELATED CREDIT FACILITY (SEE  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 11 - \"CREDIT FACILITY\"  ), THE EXACT TERMS OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. AFTER CLOSING AND INCLUDING ESTIMATED TRANSACTION FEES OF  $28.6 MILLION  , WE EXPECT TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY $45.0 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND.  ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE UHP NETWORKS INC., AND ITS SISTER COMPANY (TOGETHER, \"UHP\") FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE AT CLOSING OF APPROXIMATELY  $40.0 MILLION  , OF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE  $5.0 MILLION  TO BE PAID IN COMTECH COMMON STOCK WITH THE REMAINING BALANCE PAYABLE IN CASH. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES AN EARN-OUT UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $10.0 MILLION  PAYABLE, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH AND OR SHARES OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON SALES MILESTONES ARE REACHED IN THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING. SUCH AMOUNT IS NOT SHOWN IN THE ABOVE COMMITMENT TABLE.  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. PURSUANT TO THESE AGREEMENTS, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY, HOLD HARMLESS AND REIMBURSE THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY FOR CERTAIN LOSSES SUFFERED OR INCURRED BY THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSSES RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO A HISTORY OF NOMINAL CLAIMS IN THE COMTECH LEGACY BUSINESS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH PARTICULAR AGREEMENT. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  NOTE (19)  -  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND OTHER MATTERS  ,\" TCS IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF INDEMNIFICATION DEMANDS AND WE ARE INCURRING ONGOING LEGAL EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MATTERS.

AS A RESULT, PENDING OR FUTURE CLAIMS ASSERTED AGAINST US BY A PARTY THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY COULD RESULT IN LEGAL COSTS AND DAMAGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE HAVE CHANGE IN CONTROL AGREEMENTS, SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS AND INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. ALL OF THESE AGREEMENTS MAY REQUIRE PAYMENTS BY US, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY OR AN INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITHOUT CAUSE.  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  INCLUDES TOTAL LIABILITIES OF  $8.1 MILLION  FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST, ANY OR ALL OF WHICH MAY RESULT IN A CASH PAYMENT.

THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF PERSONAL COMPUTING AND OTHER ACCESS DEVICES, IMAGING AND PRINTING PRODUCTS, AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, SOLUTIONS, AND SERVICES. WE SELL TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMBS AND LARGE ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS IN THE GOVERNMENT, HEALTH, AND EDUCATION SECTORS. WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: PERSONAL SYSTEMS, PRINTING AND CORPORATE INVESTMENTS. THE PERSONAL SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DESKTOP AND NOTEBOOK PCS, WORKSTATIONS, THIN CLIENTS, COMMERCIAL MOBILITY DEVICES, RETAIL POS SYSTEMS, DISPLAYS AND OTHER RELATED ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE, SUPPORT, AND SERVICES. THE PRINTING SEGMENT PROVIDES CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PRINTER HARDWARE, SUPPLIES, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS SCANNING DEVICES. CORPORATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE HP LABS AND CERTAIN BUSINESS INCUBATION AND INVESTMENT PROJECTS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH MARKET SEGMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO ENHANCED INNOVATION IN MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEMS, MULTI-ARCHITECTURE, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND OTHER KEY ATTRIBUTES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE INVESTING IN  END POINT SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS  . WE ARE  FOCUSED ON SERVICES INCLUDING DEVICE AS A SERVICE AS THE MARKET BEGINS TO SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED DUE TO OUR COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LINEUP.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS AND GRAPHICS, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR FOOTPRINT IN THE 3D PRINTING & DIGITAL MANUFACTURING MARKETPLACE. IN CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS, WE HAVE A CONTINUED FOCUS ON MANAGED PRINT SERVICES (\u201cMPS\u201d) AND INSTANT INK. IN GRAPHICS, WE OFFER A BROAD SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE SEGMENTS AND APPLICATIONS IN THE GRAPHICS INDUSTRY.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ONE SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO DYNAMIC MARKET TRENDS, SUCH AS FORECASTED DECLINING PC CLIENT MARKETS AND HOME PRINTING MARKETS. A SECOND SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS ARE EXERTING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE IN TARGETED AREAS AND ARE ENTERING NEW MARKETS, OUR EMERGING COMPETITORS ARE INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, AND OUR ALLIANCE PARTNERS IN SOME BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING OUR COMPETITORS IN OTHERS. A THIRD SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO BUSINESS MODEL CHANGES AND OUR GO-TO-MARKET EXECUTION IN AN EVOLVING DISTRIBUTION AND RESELLER LANDSCAPE, WITH INCREASING ONLINE AND OMNICHANNEL PRESENCE.  ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WE FACE AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL ARE SET FORTH BELOW.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS,  WE FACE CHALLENGES WITH INDUSTRY COMPONENT AVAILABILITY AND A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM NON-ORIGINAL SUPPLIES (WHICH INCLUDES IMITATION, REFILL OR REMANUFACTURED ALTERNATIVES), AND A WEAKENED MARKET IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES WITH ASSOCIATED PRICING SENSITIVITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PRESENT CHALLENGES. WE ALSO FACE CHALLENGES IN PRINTING, PRIMARILY IN EMEA, DUE TO OUR MULTI-TIER DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, INCLUDING LIMITING GREY MARKETING AND THE POTENTIAL MISUSE OF PRICING PROGRAMS. WE ALSO  OBTAIN MANY PRINTING COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE SOURCES DUE TO TECHNOLOGY, AVAILABILITY, PRICE, QUALITY OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE SOURCE THE  MAJORITY OF OUR A4 AND A PORTION OF OUR A3 PORTFOLIO OF  LASER PRINTER ENGINES AND LASER TONER CARTRIDGES FROM CANON. ANY DECISION BY EITHER PARTY TO NOT RENEW OUR AGREEMENT WITH CANON OR TO LIMIT OR REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE FROM LASERJET PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH CANON AND ANTICIPATE RENEWAL OF THIS AGREEMENT.  OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ALSO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES, TARIFF-DRIVEN HEADWINDS,  UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS, VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES, WEAKER MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND EVOLVING DYNAMICS IN THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT.  THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON OUR BUSINESS CANNOT BE KNOWN AT THIS TIME.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE INNOVATION WITH A VIEW TOWARDS DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALIGNED WITH GENERATING MARKET DEMAND AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS  AND ADAPTING OUR BUSINESS MODELS  , WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR END-TO-END PROCESSES, ANALYTICS AND EFFICIENCIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OPTIMIZING OUR SALES COVERAGE MODELS, ALIGNING OUR SALES INCENTIVES WITH OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, IMPROVING CHANNEL EXECUTION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, STRENGTHENING OUR CAPABILITIES IN OUR AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS, STRENGTHENING OUR PRICING DISCIPLINE AND DEVELOPING AND CAPITALIZING ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  SPECIFICALLY, IN OCTOBER 2019, WE ANNOUNCED COST-REDUCTION AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THE WAY WE WORK, MOVE CLOSER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND FACILITATE SPECIFIC INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS. THESE WERE FURTHER UPDATED IN FEBRUARY 2020. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE TRANSFORMING OUR OPERATING MODEL TO INTEGRATE OUR SALES FORCE INTO A SINGLE COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION AND REDUCING STRUCTURAL COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY THROUGH OUR RESTRUCTURING PLAN APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER 2019 (THE \u201cFISCAL 2020 PLAN\u201d). WE EXPECT TO INVEST SOME OF THE SAVINGS FROM THESE EFFORTS ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTING TO BUILD OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES. OVER TIME, WE EXPECT THESE INVESTMENTS WILL MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT AND ALLOW US TO ADVANCE OUR POSITIONS IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS AND PRINTING, WHILE ALSO DISRUPTING NEW INDUSTRIES WHERE WE SEE ATTRACTIVE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THE RATE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE RETURNS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FROM THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE EXECUTION, INDUSTRY AND MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING OUR BUSINESS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN THE ANTICIPATED TIMING OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THESE EFFORTS, AND THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE.  THE RECENT NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) OUTBREAK HAS IMPACTED AND COULD FURTHER IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS AS A RESULT OF QUARANTINES, FACILITY CLOSURES, AND TRAVEL AND LOGISTICS RESTRICTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OUTBREAK. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS TO BE TEMPORARY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AROUND ITS DURATION AND ITS BROADER IMPACT.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  WE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL HOLIDAY DEMAND. HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  UNSOLICITED EXCHANGE OFFER  ON MARCH 2, 2020, XEROX HOLDINGS CORPORATION (\u201cXEROX\u201d) COMMENCED AN UNSOLICITED EXCHANGE OFFER FOR ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF HP\u2019S COMMON STOCK (THE \u201cOFFER\u201d). XEROX PREVIOUSLY NOMINATED CANDIDATES FOR ELECTION TO HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE \u201cBOARD\u201d) AT HP\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS.  AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE OFFER IN CONSULTATION WITH HP\u2019S INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS, THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF HP\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDED THAT HP STOCKHOLDERS REJECT THE OFFER AND NOT TENDER THEIR SHARES INTO THE OFFER.  ON MARCH 5, 2020, WE FILED A SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9 WITH THE SEC CONTAINING THE BOARD\u2019S RECOMMENDATION.  IN RESPONSE TO XEROX\u2019S ACTIONS, HP HAS INCURRED, AND EXPECTS TO INCUR IN THE FUTURE, SIGNIFICANT COSTS.  FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRENDS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS IN ITEM 1A OF PART II IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MD&A IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN MD&A IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31,  2019  , EXCEPT AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN \u201cNOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT, A MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR NET REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE SUPPLEMENT THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE WITH THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD REVENUES USING MONTHLY AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD AND DOES NOT ADJUST FOR ANY REPRICING OR DEMAND IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SO THAT NET REVENUE CAN BE VIEWED WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES OUR NET REVENUE RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY MEASURES ARE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A GAAP BASIS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE AND DEFINE SIMILARLY LABELED ITEMS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF THIS MEASURE FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC.

U.S. NET REVENUE DECREASED 1% TO $4.9 BILLION, WHILE NET REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REMAINED FLAT AT $9.7 BILLION. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECLINE IN SUPPLIES AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS AND WORKSTATIONS.

GROSS MARGIN  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR GROSS MARGIN INCREASED BY 1.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATE IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS DRIVEN BY LOWER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.

PROVISION FOR TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  22.8%  AND 10.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACCRUAL OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE GENERALLY DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% DUE TO FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED  $7 MILLION  OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS OF $48 MILLION AND $7 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER NET TAX BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $48 MILLION. FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE-ADJUSTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE IMMATERIAL.

THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS AND WORKSTATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A 3.9% INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 1.4% DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (\u201cASPS\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASE IN DESKTOPS, NOTEBOOKS AND WORKSTATIONS.

THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN SUPPLIES, CONSUMER HARDWARE REVENUE AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. NET REVENUE FOR SUPPLIES DECREASED 6.9% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEMAND WEAKNESS. PRINTER UNIT VOLUME DECREASED 10.4% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY UNIT DECREASES IN BOTH CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL HARDWARE.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NET REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL HARDWARE DECREASED BY 1.3% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 11.5% DECREASE IN PRINTER VOLUME AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ASPS BY 3.8%. THE UNIT VOLUME DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL HARDWARE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAKNESS IN DEMAND AND OUR STRATEGY TO REBALANCE OUR PORTFOLIO TO A HIGHER PROFIT CUSTOMER MIX. THE INCREASE IN ASPS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  NET REVENUE FOR CONSUMER HARDWARE DECREASED 13.2% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD DUE TO A DECREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME BY 10.2% AND 3.5% DECREASE IN ASPS. THE UNIT VOLUME DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INKJET HOME CONSUMER BUSINESS AND LASERJET HOME BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN ASPS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  PRINTING EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED BY 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SUPPLIES REVENUE.  CORPORATE INVESTMENTS  THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE INVESTMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INCUBATION PROJECTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT CASH, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, NEW BORROWINGS, AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER AUTHORIZATION AND CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET HP\u2019S OPERATING CASH REQUIREMENTS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON ALL BORROWINGS, PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASES AND ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE EVENT THAT SUITABLE BUSINESSES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ACQUISITION THAT OFFER GOOD RETURN OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY MAY OBTAIN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FINANCING FOR THESE ACQUISITIONS THROUGH ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS. WHILE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND OUR COST OF BORROWING MAY INCREASE UNDER CERTAIN BUSINESS, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESOURCES UNDER ALL SUCH CONDITIONS. OUR LIQUIDITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS INCLUDING THE RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS IN ITEM 1A OF PART II IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND THE MARKET RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d IN ITEM 3 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  ON FEBRUARY 22, 2020, HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED HP\u2019S SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $15.0 BILLION. HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO AUTHORIZED A CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM THAT WILL TARGET THE RETURN OF APPROXIMATELY $16.0 BILLION TO HP SHAREHOLDERS USING SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS DURING FISCAL 2020 TO FISCAL 2022. WE EXPECT THIS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE REPURCHASE OF AT LEAST $8.0 BILLION OF HP SHARES IN THE TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING HP\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL MEETING.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES ARE HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NON-U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX WILL BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS AND BEGAN IN FISCAL YEAR 2019. WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON A SUBSEQUENT REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THIS CASH MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN INCOME TAX OR WITHHOLDING TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON REPATRIATION. AS WE EVALUATE THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REVISE THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND HOW TO UTILIZE SUCH FUNDS, INCLUDING REDUCING OUR GROSS DEBT LEVEL, OR OTHER USES.

DOS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DOS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FOCUS ON INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.  DPO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES ARE OUTSTANDING. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DPO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INVENTORY PURCHASING VOLUME.

WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RATING DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT, PREVIOUS DOWNGRADES HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, HAVE REDUCED MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HAVE REQUIRED THE POSTING OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL UNDER SOME OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, ANY FURTHER DOWNGRADE TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS BY ANY RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER IMPACT US IN A SIMILAR MANNER, AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF ANY SUCH DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. WE CAN ACCESS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING DRAWDOWNS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, IF NECESSARY, TO OFFSET POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER.  CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE ANTICIPATE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  OF APPROXIMATELY $63 MILLION TO OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, $29 MILLION TO COVER BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND $5 MILLION TO COVER BENEFIT CLAIMS FOR OUR POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $581 MILLION OF RECORDED LIABILITIES AND RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES PERTAINING TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE AS TO WHEN CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES MIGHT OCCUR DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE TAX MATTERS. PAYMENTS OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD RESULT FROM SETTLEMENTS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

OVERVIEW  EATON VANCE CORP. PROVIDES ADVANCED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO FORWARD-THINKING INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS MANAGING INVESTMENT FUNDS AND PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. OUR CORE STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES AND TO OFFER LEADING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IN EXECUTING OUR CORE STRATEGY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED BROADLY DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION.  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS AS A COMPANY BASED PRINCIPALLY ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DELIVERED, CLIENT SATISFACTION, REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE, PROGRESS ACHIEVING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND SATISFACTION, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATED.  WE CONDUCT OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY BUSINESS THROUGH WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT AFFILIATES, WHICH INCLUDE: EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT (EVM), PARAMETRIC PORTFOLIO ASSOCIATES LLC (PARAMETRIC), ATLANTA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC (ATLANTA CAPITAL) AND CALVERT RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT (CALVERT). WE ALSO OFFER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES THROUGH MINORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE HEXAVEST INC. (HEXAVEST).  THROUGH EVM, ATLANTA CAPITAL, CALVERT AND OUR OTHER AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE ACTIVE EQUITY, INCOME, ALTERNATIVE AND BLENDED STRATEGIES ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT STYLES AND ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING U.S., GLOBAL AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, FLOATING-RATE BANK LOANS, MUNICIPAL BONDS, GLOBAL INCOME, HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS, AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE MANAGE A RANGE OF SYSTEMATIC  41  INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING SYSTEMATIC EQUITY, SYSTEMATIC FIXED INCOME, SYSTEMATIC ALTERNATIVES AND MANAGED OPTIONS STRATEGIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE ALSO PROVIDE PORTFOLIO OVERLAY SERVICES AND MANAGE CUSTOM SEPARATE ACCOUNT PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING CUSTOM CORETM EQUITY, LADDERED FIXED INCOME, MULTI-ASSET AND MULTI-MANAGER PORTFOLIOS. WE ALSO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND DISTRIBUTE, INVESTMENT FUNDS SUB-ADVISED BY UNAFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS, INCLUDING GLOBAL, EMERGING MARKET AND REGIONAL EQUITY AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES.  OUR BREADTH OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES SUPPORTS A WIDE RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND SERVICES OFFERED TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNT INVESTORS.  OUR EQUITY STRATEGIES ENCOMPASS A DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISK PROFILES, INCOME LEVELS AND GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION. OUR INCOME INVESTMENT STRATEGIES COVER A BROAD DURATION, GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RANGE AND ENCOMPASS BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-FREE INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO OFFER ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN AND COMMODITY-BASED INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE MANAGE AND DISTRIBUTE A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, WE OPERATE IN ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, NAMELY AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER TO FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $518.2 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDS AND INDIVIDUAL SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. WE HAVE BROAD MARKET REACH, WITH DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS INCLUDING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BROKER-DEALERS, INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS, BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE SUPPORT THESE DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS WITH A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 160 SALES PROFESSIONALS COVERING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  WE EMPLOY A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 20 SALES PROFESSIONALS FOCUSED ON SERVING INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS WHO ACCESS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ON A DIRECT BASIS AND THROUGH INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE INVESTMENTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CLIENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKETPLACE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS, SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, ENDOWMENTS, FOUNDATIONS, FAMILY OFFICES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS.  OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE FEES RECEIVED FROM EATON VANCE-, PARAMETRIC- AND CALVERT-BRANDED FUNDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED FROM INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. OUR FEE REVENUES ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE, AND FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THE TOTAL VALUE AND MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A MATTER OF COURSE, INVESTORS IN OUR SPONSORED OPEN-END FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REDEEM THEIR INVESTMENTS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AND THERE ARE NO MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. OUR MAJOR EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, DISTRIBUTION-RELATED EXPENSES, SERVICE FEE EXPENSE, FUND-RELATED EXPENSES, FACILITIES EXPENSE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, TEMPORARY EQUITY, INCOME TAXES, INVESTMENTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  42  CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING FOUR PRIMARY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES: (1) CAPITALIZING ON THE NEAR-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED BY OUR MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS IN CUSTOMIZED INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS, RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, SPECIALTY WEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, AND THE ARRAY OF HIGH-PERFORMING ACTIVELY MANAGED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WE OFFER ACROSS ASSET CLASSES AND INVESTMENT STYLES; (2) DEFENDING OUR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN, GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN, SYSTEMATIC EMERGING MARKET EQUITY AND CLOSED-END FUND BUSINESS FRANCHISES; (3) ENHANCING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BY DEVELOPING NEW VALUE-ADDED INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, LOWERING OPERATING COSTS, ADVANCING SUCCESSION PLANNING AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY PURSUING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (4) INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE, LEADERSHIP AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT, AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.  IN JUNE 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE INVOLVING OUR PARAMETRIC, EVM AND EATON VANCE DISTRIBUTORS AFFILIATES TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN RULES-BASED, SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, CUSTOMIZED INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THE INITIATIVE HAS THREE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS: (1) REBRANDING EVM\u2019S RULES-BASED, SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES AS PARAMETRIC AND ALIGNING INTERNAL REPORTING CONSISTENT WITH THE REVISED BRANDING; (2) INTEGRATING UNDER EATON VANCE DISTRIBUTORS THE SALES TEAMS SERVING PARAMETRIC AND EVM CLIENTS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS IN THE REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND MULTI-FAMILY OFFICE MARKET; AND (3) COMBINING UNDER PARAMETRIC THE TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING PLATFORMS SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUAL SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT BUSINESSES OF PARAMETRIC AND EVM. THE INTERNAL CHANGE PROCESS SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.  WE NOW REPORT EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND MULTI-ASSET SEPARATE ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY PARAMETRIC FOR WHICH CUSTOMIZATION IS A PRIMARY FEATURE AS PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS. THIS NEW INVESTMENT MANDATE REPORTING CATEGORY INCLUDES THE PARAMETRIC EQUITY AND MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIES THAT PREVIOUSLY COMPOSED OUR FORMER PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION CATEGORY, PRIMARILY CUSTOM CORE AND CENTRALIZED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE LADDERED BOND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS THAT WERE FORMERLY MANAGED BY EVM AND PREVIOUSLY CATEGORIZED AS FIXED INCOME FOR REPORTING PURPOSES. THESE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS COMBINE THE BENEFITS OF BENCHMARK-BASED INVESTING WITH THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PORTFOLIOS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, NET INFLOWS INTO PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS TOTALED $3.5 BILLION, GENERATING ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 9 PERCENT.  THE CALVERT FUNDS ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED FAMILIES OF RESPONSIBLY INVESTED MUTUAL FUNDS, ENCOMPASSING ACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY MANAGED EQUITY, FIXED AND FLOATING-RATE INCOME, AND MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIES MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CALVERT PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OR OTHER RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. SINCE CALVERT BECAME PART OF EATON VANCE IN DECEMBER 2016, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN CALVERT-BRANDED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND FURTHER DISTINGUISHED CALVERT AS A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING THE ATLANTA CAPITAL-SUBADVISED CALVERT EQUITY FUND, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN CALVERT STRATEGIES GREW TO A NEW HIGH OF $21.8 BILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2020 FROM $19.8 BILLION AT OCTOBER 31, 2019, REFLECTING NET INFLOWS OF $1.3 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $0.7 BILLION. CALVERT\u2019S $1.3 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 EQUATES TO ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 26 PERCENT.  WHILE CALVERT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OUR COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTING ALSO ENCOMPASSES OUR OTHER INVESTMENT AFFILIATES. EVM AND ATLANTA CAPITAL ARE INCREASINGLY UTILIZING CALVERT\u2019S PROPRIETARY ESG RESEARCH AS A COMPONENT OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROCESSES, AND PORTFOLIO CUSTOMIZATION TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT\u2019S RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA REMAINS A CENTRAL FEATURE OF PARAMETRIC SEPARATE ACCOUNT OFFERINGS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, PARAMETRIC MANAGED $25.6 BILLION OF CLIENT  43  ASSETS BASED ON CLIENT-SPECIFIED RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. ON AN OVERALL BASIS, EATON VANCE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PARTICIPANTS IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, A POSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO GROWING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RISING DEMAND FOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCORPORATE ESG-INTEGRATED INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND/OR SEEK TO ACHIEVE BOTH FAVORABLE INVESTMENT RETURNS AND POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT.  NET OUTFLOWS OF OUR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN STRATEGIES DECLINED TO $1.4 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 FROM $2.9 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND $2.6 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE IMPROVED FLOW RESULTS REFLECT A MORE FAVORABLE MARKET OUTLOOK FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF FLOATING-RATE LOANS, DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S ANNOUNCED PLAN TO PAUSE BENCHMARK SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND CONFIDENCE IN THE STRENGTH OF U.S. CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS.  INVESTOR FLOWS INTO AND OUT OF OUR GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGIES NETTED TO APPROXIMATELY ZERO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WHICH COMPARES TO NET OUTFLOWS OF $2.1 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND NET OUTFLOWS OF $500 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE IMPROVED FLOW RESULTS OF THESE STRATEGIES, WHICH HOLD LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS IN CURRENCY AND SHORT-DURATION SOVEREIGN DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF EMERGING AND FRONTIER MARKET COUNTRIES, REFLECT FAVORABLE INVESTOR RETURNS IN 2019 COMPARED TO DISAPPOINTING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN 2018.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, EVM AND RELATED PARTIES FILED AN APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF WITH THE SEC, SEEKING PERMISSION TO OFFER EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFS) THAT WOULD EMPLOY A NOVEL METHOD OF SUPPORTING EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF THEIR SHARES. BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF CURRENT HOLDINGS WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED, THE PORTFOLIO TRADING ACTIVITY OF ETFS UTILIZING THE PROPOSED METHOD COULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PROPOSED APPROACHES TO LESS-TRANSPARENT ETFS THAT HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED SEC EXEMPTIVE RELIEF, WE BELIEVE OUR METHOD SHOULD BE BROADLY APPLICABLE ACROSS FUND ASSET CLASSES AND CAN SUPPORT EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF FUND SHARES IN ALL MARKET CONDITIONS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH FILING THE EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION, WE FORMED A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS, TO MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ETFS UTILIZING THIS NEW METHOD, FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND LIKELIHOOD OF APPROVAL REMAINS UNCERTAIN.  PERFORMANCE  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, 77 CALVERT, EATON VANCE AND PARAMETRIC-BRANDED MUTUAL FUNDS OFFERED IN THE U.S. WERE RATED 4 OR 5 STARS BY MORNINGSTAR  TM  FOR AT LEAST ONE CLASS OF SHARES, INCLUDING 32 FIVE-STAR RATED FUNDS. AS MEASURED BY TOTAL RETURN NET OF EXPENSES, AT JANUARY 31, 2020 30 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. MUTUAL FUND ASSETS RANKED IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF THEIR MORNINGSTAR PEER GROUPS OVER THREE YEARS AND 58 PERCENT RANKED IN THE TOP QUARTILE OVER FIVE AND TEN YEARS. A GOOD SOURCE OF PERFORMANCE-RELATED INFORMATION FOR OUR FUNDS IS THEIR WEBSITES, AVAILABLE AT WWW.CALVERT.COM AND WWW.EATONVANCE.COM. INFORMATION ON THESE WEBSITES IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. ON OUR FUNDS\u2019 WEBSITES, INVESTORS CAN ALSO OBTAIN OTHER CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FUNDS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT POLICIES, PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, EXPENSES AND MORNINGSTAR RATINGS.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  PREVAILING EQUITY AND INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR SENTIMENT AFFECT THE SALES AND REDEMPTIONS OF OUR INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, MANAGED ASSET LEVELS, OPERATING RESULTS AND THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE S&P 500 INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 6.7 PERCENT AND THE MSCI EMERGING MARKET INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF EMERGING MARKET EQUITY PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 2.3 PERCENT. OVER THE SAME PERIODS, THE BARCLAYS U.S. AGGREGATE BOND INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. BOND MARKET PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 1.8 PERCENT.  44  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REACHED A NEW RECORD QUARTER-END HIGH OF $518.2 BILLION ON JANUARY 31, 2020, UP 17 PERCENT FROM $444.7 BILLION OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON JANUARY 31, 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE REFLECTS NET INFLOWS OF $28.6 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $45.0 BILLION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE OUR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT MANDATE, INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND INVESTMENT AFFILIATE. PRIOR-PERIOD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND NET FLOWS BY INVESTMENT MANDATE HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE RECLASSIFICATION OF BENCHMARK-BASED FIXED INCOME SEPARATE ACCOUNTS FROM FIXED INCOME TO PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS. PRIOR-PERIOD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT AFFILIATE HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE SHIFT IN MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S SYSTEMATICALLY MANAGED INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES FROM EVM TO PARAMETRIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW POLICY TO REPORT THE MANAGED ASSETS OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS OVERSEEN BY MULTIPLE EATON VANCE AFFILIATES BASED ON THE STRATEGY\u2019S PRIMARY IDENTITY.

THESE SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN INVESTMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

WE MAINTAIN A $300 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL BANKS THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 11, 2023. THE FACILITY, WHICH WE ENTERED INTO ON DECEMBER 11, 2018, PROVIDES THAT WE MAY BORROW AT LIBOR OR LIBOR-SUCCESSOR BENCHMARK-BASED RATES OF INTEREST THAT VARY DEPENDING ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE, AND REQUIRES US TO PAY AN ANNUAL COMMITMENT FEE ON ANY UNUSED PORTION. WE HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT JANUARY 31, 2020 OR AT ANY POINT DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY DAILY. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING LIQUID ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT AND FORECASTED OPERATING CASH NEEDS. THE RISK EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT IF WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT IN THE FUTURE, RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. OUR ABILITY TO ENTER THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS AT SUCH TIME. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO ISSUE NEW DEBT, REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR SELL SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK AS NEEDED, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS AND AMORTIZING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AS EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $17.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $34.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES, A DECREASE IN NET INFLOWS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES AND AN INCREASE IN NET OUTFLOWS FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITY OF CONSOLIDATED SPONSORED FUNDS AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE CASH SETTLEMENTS OF OUR OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

OUR DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER SHARE WERE $0.375 IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL $2.3 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 VERSUS THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO DECLARE AND PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR VOTING AND NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK COMPARABLE TO THE DIVIDEND DECLARED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED $68.5 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM A WAREHOUSE LINE OF CREDIT.  63  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER VARIOUS CONTRACTS RELATING TO DEBT, INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASES.

VESTED PROFIT UNITS (NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS) HELD BY EMPLOYEES IN THE ATLANTA CAPITAL LONG\u2010TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION. OUR REPURCHASE OF THESE NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS PREDICATED ON THE EXERCISE OF A SERIES OF PUT OPTIONS HELD BY PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS AND CALL OPTIONS HELD BY US. THE PUT OPTIONS PROVIDE THE PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THEIR INTERESTS AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS OVER TIME. THE CALL OPTIONS WE HOLD PROVIDE US WITH THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS TO SELL THEIR INTERESTS TO US AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS OVER TIME, AS WELL AS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS SUCH AS DEATH OR PERMANENT DISABILITY. THESE NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE REDEEMABLE AT FAIR VALUE. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF ANY PURCHASES OF VESTED PROFIT UNITS IN THE FUTURE. AT JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS OF ATLANTA CAPITAL TO REPURCHASE VESTED PROFIT UNITS. IN FISCAL 2017, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED A PHANTOM INCENTIVE PLAN FOR ATLANTA CAPITAL THAT PROVIDES FOR THE AWARD OF PHANTOM INCENTIVE UNITS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE INDEXED TO THE PER UNIT ENTERPRISE VALUE OF ATLANTA CAPITAL AND SETTLED IN SHARES OF OUR NON\u2010VOTING COMMON STOCK AT VESTING. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTRODUCING THIS STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION PLAN, WE CEASED GRANTING PROFIT UNITS TO EMPLOYEES OF ATLANTA CAPITAL UNDER THE LONG\u2010TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN.

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE CONSIDER THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS.

IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TREATMENT OF TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS, UNDER THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS AND LACK OF WITHHOLDING TAX IMPOSED BY CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, ANY FUTURE TAX LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS IMMATERIAL.

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO SEEK TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN  FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME.  ON NOVEMBER 6,  2003, MR. TOKARZ ASSUMED HIS POSITIONS AS CHAIRMAN AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF THE COMPANY. HE AND THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS  (WHO, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2006, PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES TO THE COMPANY THROUGH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT ADVISER, TTG ADVISERS)  ARE SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE (  I.E.  , TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME)  THROUGH MAKING A BROAD RANGE OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES.  THE INVESTMENTS CAN  INCLUDE SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED LOANS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES, COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK, EQUITY  INTERESTS, WARRANTS OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INTERESTS, AND OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIX NEW INVESTMENTS AND FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN SIX EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $44.9 MILLION. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, THE COMPANY MADE FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN FIVE EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8.3 MILLION.  THE  COMPANY'S PRIOR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION FROM VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS HAD FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES OF INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY 3.2% OF THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS CONSISTED OF LEGACY INVESTMENTS.  WE ARE, HOWEVER, SEEKING TO MANAGE THESE LEGACY INVESTMENTS TO TRY AND REALIZE MAXIMUM RETURNS. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO CAPITALIZE  ON OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE CASH RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN PRESENTED WI  TH A POTENTIAL \"LIQUIDITY EVENT,\"  I.E., A SALE, PUBLIC OFFERING, MERGER OR OTHER REORGANIZATION.  OUR NEW PORTFOLIO  INVESTMENTS ARE MADE PURSUANT TO OUR CURRENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY. WE ARE CONCENTRATING OUR INVESTMENT EFFORTS ON SMALL AND MIDDLE-MARKET  COMPANIES THAT, IN OUR VIEW, PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME THOUGH OUR  CURRENT FOCUS IS MORE ON YIELD GENERATING INVESTMENTS WHICH CAN INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED LOANS, CONVERTIBLE  DEBT, COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY WITH A COUPON OR LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE AND WARRANTS OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INTERESTS (THE  \u201cYIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY\u201d). WE HAVE CONTINUED THE TRANSITION TO THE YIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY. WE HAVE DONE THIS THROUGH  SELLING A NUMBER OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR 2017 SALE OF U.S. GAS, OUR THEN-LARGEST PORTFOLIO COMPANY. THESE SALES AND  REPAYMENTS HAVE IMPROVED OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH PROVIDES US WITH FLEXIBILITY TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL INTO DEBT OR SIMILAR INCOME-PRODUCING  INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SEEK TO MONETIZE VARIOUS EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE YIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY.  WE PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS GENERALLY BY PROVIDING NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM EQUITY AND/OR DEBT INVESTMENT CAPITAL  TO PRIVATELY-OWNED SMALL AND MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES. OUR FINANCINGS ARE GENERALLY USED TO FUND GROWTH, BUYOUTS, ACQUISITIONS,  RECAPITALIZATIONS, NOTE PURCHASES AND/OR BRIDGE FINANCINGS. WE GENERALLY INVEST IN PRIVATE COMPANIES, THOUGH, FROM TIME TO TIME,  WE MAY INVEST IN PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT MAY LACK ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PUBLIC CAPITAL.  44  WE  MAY ALSO SEEK TO ACHIEVE OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE BY ESTABLISHING A SUBSIDIARY OR SUBSIDIARIES THAT WOULD SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER  TO A PRIVATE EQUITY OR OTHER INVESTMENT FUND(S). IN FACT, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, WE ESTABLISHED MVC PARTNERS FOR THIS PURPOSE.  FURTHERMORE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PE FUND, FOR WHICH AN INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF  THE COMPANY SERVES AS THE GP AND WHICH MAY RAISE UP TO $250 MILLION. ON OCTOBER 29, 2010, THROUGH MVC PARTNERS AND MVCFS, THE COMPANY  COMMITTED TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $20.1 MILLION IN THE PE FUND. THE PE FUND CLOSED ON APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION OF CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.  THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, THE PE FUND FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING  THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MAKE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE PE FUND. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS RESTRICTED  IN ITS ABILITY TO MAKE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS. FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE PE FUND, THE GP AND MVC PARTNERS ARE TOGETHER  ENTITLED TO RECEIVE 25% OF ALL MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER FEES PAID BY THE PE FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES AND UP TO 30% OF  THE CARRIED INTEREST GENERATED BY THE PE FUND. FURTHER, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE GP RETAINED TTG ADVISERS  TO SERVE AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF THE PE FUND. IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES, AND PURSUANT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS'  AUTHORIZATION AND DIRECTION, TTG ADVISERS IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE BALANCE OF THE FEES AND ANY CARRIED INTEREST GENERATED BY  THE PE FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. GIVEN THIS SEPARATE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE GP AND THE PE FUND, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S  ADVISORY AGREEMENT WITH TTG ADVISERS, TTG ADVISERS IS NOT ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM THE COMPANY A MANAGEMENT FEE OR AN INCENTIVE  FEE ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE PE FUND. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2012 AND THEREAFTER, MVC  PARTNERS WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AS MVC PARTNERS\u2019 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PE FUND  IS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF MVC PARTNERS OPERATIONS. PREVIOUSLY, MVC PARTNERS WAS PRESENTED AS A PORTFOLIO COMPANY ON THE SCHEDULE  OF INVESTMENTS. THE CONSOLIDATION OF MVC PARTNERS HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR NET RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OF THE COMPANY. ALSO, DURING FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2014, MVC TURF, INC. (\u201cMVC TURF\u201d) WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH  THE COMPANY AS MVC TURF WAS AN MVC WHOLLY-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY. THE CONSOLIDATION OF MVC TURF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON  THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR NET RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. ON MARCH 7, 2017, THE COMPANY EXCHANGED ITS SHARES OF MVC TURF  FOR APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED DEBT IN TURF PRODUCTS.  MVC TURF IS NO LONGER CONSOLIDATED  WITH THE COMPANY. PLEASE SEE NOTE 2 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u201cCONSOLIDATION\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE  CLOSING OF THE PE FUND, CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD-APPROVED POLICY CONCERNING THE ALLOCATION OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE PE  FUND RECEIVED A PRIORITY ALLOCATION OF ALL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS FOR THE  COMPANY DURING THE PE FUND'S INVESTMENT PERIOD THAT ENDED ON OCTOBER 28, 2014. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY BE CALLED FOR FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS  IN EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OF THE PE FUND OR TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE PE FUND UNTIL THE PARTNERSHIP IS NO LONGER EXTENDED.  ADDITIONALLY, IN PURSUIT  OF OUR OBJECTIVE, WE MAY ACQUIRE A PORTFOLIO OF EXISTING PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT INVESTMENTS HELD BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER  INVESTMENT FUNDS SHOULD SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARISE.  FURTHERMORE, PENDING  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY, THE COMPANY MAY INVEST IN CERTAIN  SECURITIES ON A SHORT-TERM OR TEMPORARY BASIS. IN ADDITION TO CASH-EQUIVALENTS AND OTHER MONEY MARKET-TYPE INVESTMENTS, SUCH SHORT-TERM  INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT FUNDS OFFERING PERIODIC LIQUIDITY.  45  OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT FREIT\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS  REGARDING FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF FREIT, AND DO NOT RELATE  STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS.

IF THE U.S. ECONOMY IMPROVES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE  MAY INCREASE LENDING RATES WHICH MAY AFFECT THE REFINANCING OF MORTGAGES COMING DUE IN THE SHORT-TERM AND BORROWINGS FOR OTHER  PURPOSES. THERE COULD ALSO BE A PANDEMIC OF THE CORONAVIRUS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND FREIT\u2019S  RETAIL TENANTS.  RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES.  FREIT HAS AGGRESSIVELY INCREASED RENTAL RATES ON ITS STABILIZED PROPERTIES RESULTING IN FREIT\u2019S RENTAL REVENUES CONTINUING  TO SHOW YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES AT MOST OF ITS PROPERTIES. FREIT EXPECTS INCREASES IN RENTAL RATES TO TAPER; HOWEVER, THE INCREASED  RENTAL RATES THAT ARE IN PLACE SHOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT FUTURE REVENUES.  COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.  THERE CONTINUES TO BE UNCERTAINTY IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON FREIT\u2019S RETAIL TENANTS,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON FREIT.

(SEE NOTE 8 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  FREIT CONTINUES TO MAKE ONLY THOSE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THE RETAIL SPACE AT  THE ROTUNDA CONTINUES TO LEASE-UP AND IS APPROXIMATELY 86.5% LEASED AND 83.4% OCCUPIED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020. FREIT EXPECTS ROTUNDA\u2019S  OPERATIONS TO STABILIZE IN LATE 2020.  DEBT FINANCING AVAILABILITY.  FINANCING HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO FREIT AND ITS AFFILIATES. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC REFINANCED ITS $115.3 MILLION  CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO WITH A NEW LOAN HELD BY AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5  MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,380,000. THIS LOAN  IS SECURED BY THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY, BEARS A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT 285 BASIS POINTS OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AND HAS A  MATURITY DATE OF FEBRUARY 6, 2021 WITH TWO ONE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED  AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR  RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION OF THIS LOAN FACILITY WAS  DRAWN DOWN AND THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.59%. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE  CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR ONE  YEAR. THIS INTEREST RATE CAP HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 5, 2020 AND A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 5, 2021.  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, BERDAN COURT, LLC  (\u201cBERDAN COURT\u201d), (OWNED 100% BY FREIT), REFINANCED ITS $17 MILLION LOAN (WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019) WITH  THE LENDER IN THE AMOUNT OF $28,815,000. THIS LOAN, SECURED BY AN APARTMENT BUILDING LOCATED IN WAYNE, NEW JERSEY, HAS A TERM OF  TEN YEARS AND BEARS A FIXED INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 3.54%. INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED EACH MONTH FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS  OF THE TERM AND THEREAFTER, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST WILL BE REQUIRED EACH MONTH THROUGH MATURITY. THIS REFINANCING  RESULTED IN: (I) A REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE FROM A FIXED RATE OF 6.09% TO A FIXED RATE OF 3.54% AND (II) NET REFINANCING  PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  ON APRIL 3, 2019, WESTFREIT, CORP. (OWNED  100% BY FREIT) EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO EXTEND ITS LOAN HELD BY M&T BANK, WITH A THEN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5  MILLION, FOR TWELVE MONTHS. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING ON JUNE 1, 2019, THE EXTENSION OF THIS LOAN SECURED BY THE WESTRIDGE SQUARE SHOPPING  CENTER, REQUIRED MONTHLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $47,250 PLUS INTEREST BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 240 BASIS POINTS  OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF MAY 1, 2020. FREIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE LENDER TO EXTEND THE LOAN.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE LOAN IS ENTERED INTO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE  LOAN WILL BE EXTENDED.  ON OCTOBER 27, 2017, FREIT\u2019S REVOLVING  LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE PROVIDENT BANK WAS RENEWED FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM ENDING ON OCTOBER 27, 2020 AT WHICH POINT NO FURTHER  ADVANCES SHALL BE PERMITTED AND PROVIDED THE LINE OF CREDIT IS NOT RENEWED BY THE LENDER, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF  THE LINE OF CREDIT SHALL CONVERT TO A COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN MATURING ON OCTOBER 31, 2022. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE CAN BE USED  FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE ARE SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON FREIT\u2019S  FRANKLIN CROSSING SHOPPING CENTER IN FRANKLIN LAKES, NEW JERSEY AND RETAIL SPACE IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY. THE TOTAL LINE OF CREDIT  WAS INCREASED FROM $12.8 MILLION TO $13 MILLION AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING WILL BE AT A FLOATING RATE OF 275  BASIS POINTS OVER THE 30-DAY LIBOR WITH A FLOOR OF 3.75%. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING  AND $13 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT  FOR EACH OF THE LOANS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FREIT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MEET OR MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS THROUGHOUT THE TERM  OF THE LOAN.  OPERATING  CASH FLOW.  FREIT EXPECTS THAT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH RESERVES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER MANDATORY  DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS OF INTEREST, BUT EXCLUDING BALLOON PAYMENTS), REAL ESTATE TAXES, RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS  AT PROPERTIES AND OTHER NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS A REIT FOR AT LEAST A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF FILING OF THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  PAGE  23  INDEX  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  PURSUANT TO THE SEC DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE  FOR \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\" THE SEC DEFINES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT  OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE PREPARATION OF WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT  ESTIMATES BASED ON JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER  FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES USED, WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY AS OF JANUARY  31, 2020, AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR ESTIMATES  REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION: BASE RENTS, ADDITIONAL  RENTS BASED ON TENANTS' SALES VOLUME AND REIMBURSEMENT OF THE TENANTS' SHARE OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED  WHEN DUE FROM TENANTS. THE STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IS USED TO RECOGNIZE BASE RENTS UNDER LEASES IF THEY PROVIDE FOR VARYING RENTS OVER  THE LEASE TERMS. STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS REPRESENT UNBILLED RENTS RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS EXCEED CURRENT RENTS  BILLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEASE AGREEMENTS. BEFORE FREIT CAN RECOGNIZE REVENUE, IT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS  COLLECTABILITY.  VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: FREIT  ASSESSES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS PERIODICALLY, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE  CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WHEN FREIT DETERMINES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY  BE IMPAIRED, THE MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON A PROJECTED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD DETERMINED BY FREIT'S MANAGEMENT.  WHILE FREIT BELIEVES THAT OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODS ARE REASONABLE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING SUCH CASH FLOWS MAY  SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRMENT.  REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COSTS: IT IS  FREIT\u2019S POLICY TO CAPITALIZE PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER DIRECTLY  RELATED THIRD-PARTY COSTS. REAL ESTATE TAXES AND INTEREST COSTS INCURRED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES ARE ALSO  CAPITALIZED. FREIT CEASES CAPITALIZATION OF THESE COSTS WHEN THE PROJECT OR PORTION THEREOF BECOMES OPERATIONAL, OR WHEN CONSTRUCTION  HAS BEEN POSTPONED. IN THE EVENT OF POSTPONEMENT, CAPITALIZATION OF THESE COSTS WILL RECOMMENCE ONCE CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROJECT  RESUMES.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REAL ESTATE REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 (\u201cCURRENT QUARTER\u201d) INCREASED 4.5% TO $15,593,000, COMPARED TO $14,928,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 (\u201cPRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER\u201d). THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE  IN BASE RENTS ACROSS MOST PROPERTIES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE (OFFICE AND  RETAIL) AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY FROM AN AVERAGE OCCUPANCY RATE OF 81.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER TO 84.2% IN THE CURRENT  QUARTER.  NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO  COMMON EQUITY (\u201cNET (LOSS) INCOME-COMMON EQUITY\u201d) FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS A NET LOSS OF $2,262,000 (($0.32)  PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED), COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $459,000 ($0.07 PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED) FOR THE PRIOR  YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY $3.4 MILLION RELATED TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE EXPENSES FOR ADVISORY  AND LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN FISCAL 2020; OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE AS EXPLAINED ABOVE (CONSOLIDATED IMPACT OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION); AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION (CONSOLIDATED IMPACT OF $0.3  MILLION) DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON THE VARIABLE MORTGAGE LOANS.

FREIT ASSESSES AND MEASURES SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON NOI.  SAME PROPERTY NOI: FREIT CONSIDERS SAME  PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cSAME PROPERTY NOI\u201d) TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURE OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  FREIT DEFINES SAME PROPERTY WITHIN BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS TO BE THOSE PROPERTIES THAT FREIT HAS OWNED AND  OPERATED FOR BOTH THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED, EXCLUDING THOSE PROPERTIES THAT FREIT ACQUIRED OR REDEVELOPED DURING  THOSE PERIODS. ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, ANY PROPERTY THAT IS UNDERGOING A MAJOR  REDEVELOPMENT BUT MAY STILL BE IN OPERATION AT LESS THAN FULL CAPACITY, AND/OR ANY PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SOLD IS NOT CONSIDERED  SAME PROPERTY.  NOI AND SAME PROPERTY NOI ARE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES AND ARE NOT MEASURES OF OPERATING RESULTS OR CASH FLOW AS MEASURED BY GAAP, AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE  OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOWS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.  COMMERCIAL SEGMENT  THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CONTAINS EIGHT  (8) SEPARATE PROPERTIES. SEVEN OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE MULTI-TENANTED RETAIL OR OFFICE CENTERS, AND ONE IS SINGLE TENANTED ON LAND  LOCATED IN ROCKAWAY, NEW JERSEY OWNED BY FREIT FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES MONTHLY RENTAL INCOME FROM A TENANT WHO HAS BUILT AND OPERATES  A BANK BRANCH ON THE LAND. ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, FREIT SOLD A COMMERCIAL BUILDING, FORMERLY OCCUPIED AS A PATHMARK SUPERMARKET IN  PATCHOGUE, NEW YORK FOR A SALES PRICE OF $7.5 MILLION. THE SALE OF THIS PROPERTY, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $6.2  MILLION, RESULTED IN A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION NET OF SALES FEES AND COMMISSIONS. NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $2 MILLION WERE REALIZED AFTER PAYING OFF THE RELATED MORTGAGE ON THIS PROPERTY IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION. THE  SALE OF THIS PROPERTY ELIMINATES AN OPERATING LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION ($0.12 PER SHARE) INCURRED, ANNUALLY, SINCE PATHMARK  VACATED THE BUILDING IN DECEMBER 2015 (SEE NOTE 5 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE ABOVE UNDER  THE CAPTION SEGMENT INFORMATION, TOTAL REVENUE AND NOI FROM FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL SEGMENT FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED  BY 5.8% AND 13.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES  INCREASED SLIGHTLY BY 0.1% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE AND NOI WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE (OFFICE AND RETAIL) AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY FROM AN  AVERAGE OCCUPANCY RATE OF 81.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER TO 84.2% IN THE CURRENT QUARTER.  SAME PROPERTY OPERATING RESULTS: FREIT\u2019S  COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CURRENTLY CONTAINS EIGHT (8) SAME PROPERTIES. (SEE DEFINITION OF SAME PROPERTY UNDER SEGMENT INFORMATION ABOVE.)  THE PATCHOGUE PROPERTY WAS EXCLUDED FROM SAME PROPERTY RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY WAS SOLD IN FEBRUARY  2019. SAME PROPERTY REVENUE AND NOI FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED BY 5.8% AND 10.1%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR  YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE CHANGES RESULTED FROM THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.  LEASING: THE FOLLOWING TABLES REFLECT  LEASING ACTIVITY AT FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES FOR COMPARABLE LEASES (LEASES EXECUTED FOR SPACES IN WHICH THERE WAS A  TENANT AT SOME POINT DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD) AND NON-COMPARABLE LEASES FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER.

PAGE  26  INDEX  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT  FREIT CURRENTLY OPERATES EIGHT (8) MULTI-FAMILY  APARTMENT BUILDINGS OR COMPLEXES TOTALING 1,437 APARTMENT UNITS. ON JANUARY 14, 2020, FREIT AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY,  THE \u201cSELLERS\u201d), ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cPURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AN  AFFILIATE OF THE KUSHNER COMPANIES (THE \u201cPURCHASER\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THE SELLERS WILL SELL TO THE PURCHASER 100%  OF SELLERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SEVEN APARTMENT PROPERTIES HELD BY THE SELLERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PURCHASE PRICE DESCRIBED  THEREIN, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. (SEE NOTE 6 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE ABOVE UNDER  THE CAPTION SEGMENT INFORMATION, TOTAL REVENUE AND NOI FROM FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED  BY 3.4% AND 2.9%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE AND NOI FOR THE CURRENT  QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN BASE RENTS ACROSS MOST PROPERTIES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES  FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER.  SAME PROPERTY OPERATING RESULTS: FREIT\u2019S  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT CURRENTLY CONTAINS EIGHT (8) SAME PROPERTIES. (SEE DEFINITION OF SAME PROPERTY UNDER SEGMENT INFORMATION ABOVE.)  SINCE ALL OF FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE CONSIDERED SAME PROPERTIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, REFER TO THE PRECEDING  PARAGRAPH FOR DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN SAME PROPERTY RESULTS.  FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL REVENUE IS  PRINCIPALLY COMPOSED OF MONTHLY APARTMENT RENTAL INCOME. TOTAL RENTAL INCOME IS A FACTOR OF OCCUPANCY AND MONTHLY APARTMENT RENTS.  MONTHLY AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RENTS AT THE END OF THE CURRENT QUARTER AND THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER WERE $1,994 AND $1,947,  RESPECTIVELY. FOR COMPARABILITY PURPOSES, THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RENT FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER HAS BEEN RESTATED TO  INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF STATION PLACE AND THE ICON. A 1% DECLINE IN ANNUAL AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, OR A 1% DECLINE IN AVERAGE RENTS FROM  CURRENT LEVELS, RESULTS IN AN ANNUAL REVENUE DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY $344,000 AND $323,000, RESPECTIVELY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: SINCE ALL OF FREIT\u2019S  APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BOULDERS, REGENCY, ICON AND STATION PLACE PROPERTIES, WERE CONSTRUCTED MORE THAN  25 YEARS AGO, FREIT TENDS TO SPEND MORE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR ON MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAN MAY BE SPENT ON NEWER PROPERTIES.  FUNDS FOR THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM CASH FLOW FROM THE PROPERTY'S OPERATIONS AND CASH RESERVES.

TOTAL  FINANCING COSTS FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $417,000 OR 9.0% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER  WHICH IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON THE VARIABLE MORTGAGE LOANS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\u201cG&A\u201d)  G&A EXPENSE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER  WAS $772,000 COMPARED TO $608,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF G&A ARE ACCOUNTING/AUDITING  FEES, LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, AND TRUSTEES\u2019 AND CONSULTANT FEES.

AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $36.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO $42.5 MILLION AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $2.2 MILLION IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING  ACTIVITIES, $0.3 MILLION IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $3.0 MILLION IN NET CASH USED  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE DECLINE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPECIAL COMMITTEE EXPENSES  PAID IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PAID OUT TO A RETIRED TRUSTEE  IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $4.8 MILLION.  IN FISCAL 2017, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC INCURRED  SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY RELATED TO RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, LEASING COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES  WHICH, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEEDED REVENUES AS THE PROPERTY WAS STILL IN THE RENT UP PHASE AND THE CONSTRUCTION LOAN PREVIOUSLY  HELD WITH WELLS FARGO WAS AT ITS MAXIMUM LEVEL RESULTING IN NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DRAW. ACCORDINGLY, DURING FISCAL  2017 THE EQUITY OWNERS IN GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC (FREIT WITH A 60% OWNERSHIP AND ROTUNDA 100, LLC WITH A 40% OWNERSHIP) CONTRIBUTED  THEIR RESPECTIVE PRO-RATA SHARE OF ANY CASH NEEDS THROUGH LOANS TO GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31,  2019, ROTUNDA 100, LLC HAS FUNDED GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC WITH APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION AND $5.7 MILLION (INCLUDING INTEREST), RESPECTIVELY,  WHICH IS INCLUDED IN \u201cDUE TO AFFILIATE\u201d ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CREDIT LINE: ON OCTOBER 27, 2017, FREIT\u2019S  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE PROVIDENT BANK WAS RENEWED FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM ENDING ON OCTOBER 27, 2020 AT WHICH POINT  NO FURTHER ADVANCES SHALL BE PERMITTED AND PROVIDED THE LINE OF CREDIT IS NOT RENEWED BY THE LENDER, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL  BALANCE OF THE LINE OF CREDIT SHALL CONVERT TO A COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN MATURING ON OCTOBER 31, 2022. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE  CAN BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE ARE SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON  FREIT\u2019S FRANKLIN CROSSING SHOPPING CENTER IN FRANKLIN LAKES, NEW JERSEY AND RETAIL SPACE IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY. THE TOTAL  LINE OF CREDIT WAS INCREASED FROM $12.8 MILLION TO $13 MILLION AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING WILL BE AT A FLOATING  RATE OF 275 BASIS POINTS OVER THE 30-DAY LIBOR WITH A FLOOR OF 3.75%. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS NO  AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AND $13 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT.  AS AT JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT\u2019S  AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE DEBT WAS $351.8 MILLION, WHICH BEARS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.26% AND AN AVERAGE LIFE  OF APPROXIMATELY 4.1 YEARS. FREIT\u2019S FIXED RATE MORTGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION SCHEDULES THAT ARE LONGER THAN THE  TERMS OF THE MORTGAGES. AS SUCH, BALLOON PAYMENTS (UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AT MORTGAGE DUE DATE) FOR ALL MORTGAGE DEBT WILL BE  REQUIRED AS FOLLOWS.  FISCAL YEAR  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  2026  2028  2029  ($ IN MILLIONS)  MORTGAGE \"BALLOON\" PAYMENTS  $21.9  $137.6 (A)  $14.4  $34.4  $9.0  $13.9  $18.2  $53.9  $26.0  (A) INCLUDES LOAN ON THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY LOCATED IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION REFINANCED WITH AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE ESTIMATED  FAIR VALUE AND NET CARRYING VALUE OF FREIT\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT AT JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019.  ($ IN MILLIONS)  JANUARY 31, 2020  OCTOBER 31, 2019  FAIR VALUE  $353.9  $352.9  CARRYING VALUE, NET  $349.1  $349.9  FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON MARKET INTEREST  RATES AT JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATION METHODS  MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON OBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 2 IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  AS PROVIDED BY AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE).  FREIT EXPECTS TO REFINANCE THE INDIVIDUAL  MORTGAGES WITH NEW MORTGAGES WHEN THEIR TERMS EXPIRE. TO THIS EXTENT FREIT HAS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK. IF INTEREST RATES,  AT THE TIME ANY INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE NOTE IS DUE, ARE HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT FIXED INTEREST RATE, HIGHER DEBT SERVICE MAY BE REQUIRED,  AND/OR REFINANCING PROCEEDS MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE DEBT BEING RETIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, AT JANUARY 31, 2020, A 1%  INTEREST RATE INCREASE WOULD REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF FREIT\u2019S DEBT BY $9.7 MILLION, AND A 1% DECREASE WOULD INCREASE THE  FAIR VALUE BY $10.4 MILLION.  FREIT BELIEVES THAT THE VALUES OF ITS  PROPERTIES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COMMAND REFINANCING PROCEEDS EQUAL TO OR HIGHER THAN THE MORTGAGE DEBT TO BE REFINANCED. FREIT CONTINUALLY  REVIEWS ITS DEBT LEVELS TO DETERMINE IF ADDITIONAL DEBT CAN PRUDENTLY BE UTILIZED FOR PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS FOR ITS REAL ESTATE  PORTFOLIO THAT WILL INCREASE INCOME AND CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS.  PAGE  28  INDEX  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, BERDAN COURT, LLC  (\u201cBERDAN COURT\u201d), (OWNED 100% BY FREIT), REFINANCED ITS $17 MILLION LOAN (WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019) WITH  THE LENDER IN THE AMOUNT OF $28,815,000. THIS LOAN, SECURED BY AN APARTMENT BUILDING LOCATED IN WAYNE, NEW JERSEY, HAS A TERM OF  TEN YEARS AND BEARS A FIXED INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 3.54%. INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED EACH MONTH FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS  OF THE TERM AND THEREAFTER, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST WILL BE REQUIRED EACH MONTH THROUGH MATURITY. THIS REFINANCING  RESULTED IN: (I) A REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE FROM A FIXED RATE OF 6.09% TO A FIXED RATE OF 3.54% AND (II) NET REFINANCING  PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  ON APRIL 3, 2019, WESTFREIT, CORP. (OWNED  100% BY FREIT) EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO EXTEND ITS LOAN HELD BY M&T BANK, WITH A THEN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5  MILLION, FOR TWELVE MONTHS. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING ON JUNE 1, 2019, THE EXTENSION OF THIS LOAN SECURED BY THE WESTRIDGE SQUARE SHOPPING  CENTER, REQUIRED MONTHLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $47,250 PLUS INTEREST BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 240 BASIS POINTS  OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF MAY 1, 2020. FREIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE LENDER TO EXTEND THE LOAN.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE LOAN IS ENTERED INTO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE  LOAN WILL BE EXTENDED.  ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018, GRANDE ROTUNDA,  LLC REFINANCED ITS $115.3 MILLION CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO WITH A NEW LOAN HELD BY AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION IN THE  AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS IN THE  AMOUNT OF $3,380,000. THIS LOAN IS SECURED BY THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY, BEARS A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT 285 BASIS POINTS OVER THE  ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF FEBRUARY 6, 2021 WITH TWO ONE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION,  GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION,  CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION  OF THIS LOAN FACILITY WAS DRAWN DOWN AND THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.59%. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED  AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR  RATE AT 3% FOR ONE YEAR. THIS INTEREST RATE CAP HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 5, 2020 AND A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 5, 2021.  INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: TO REDUCE  INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, FREIT USES A \u201cPAY FIXED, RECEIVE FLOATING\u201d INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT FLOATING INTEREST  RATES TO FIXED INTEREST RATES OVER THE TERM OF A CERTAIN LOAN. FREIT ENTERS INTO THESE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT  IS USUALLY A HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL BANK. IN ESSENCE, FREIT AGREES TO PAY ITS COUNTERPARTIES A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST ON A DOLLAR  AMOUNT OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL (WHICH CORRESPONDS TO FREIT\u2019S MORTGAGE DEBT) OVER A TERM EQUAL TO THE TERM OF THE MORTGAGE NOTES.  FREIT\u2019S COUNTERPARTIES, IN RETURN, AGREE TO PAY FREIT A SHORT-TERM RATE OF INTEREST - GENERALLY LIBOR - ON THAT SAME NOTIONAL  AMOUNT OVER THE SAME TERM AS THE MORTGAGE NOTES.  FREIT HAS VARIABLE INTEREST RATE LOANS  SECURED BY ITS DAMASCUS CENTRE, REGENCY, WAYNE PSC AND STATION PLACE PROPERTIES. TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FREIT ENTERED  INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FOR EACH OF THESE LOANS. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED VARIABLE INTEREST  RATE PAYMENTS TO FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS. THE CONTRACTS WERE BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $22,320,000 ($19,267,000  AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE SWAPS, A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $16,200,000 ($15,505,000 AT JANUARY 31,  2020) FOR THE REGENCY SWAP, A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $25,800,000 ($23,619,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE WAYNE PSC  SWAP AND A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $12,350,000 ($12,333,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE STATION PLACE SWAP.  INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT: TO LIMIT  EXPOSURE ON INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, FREIT USES AN INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT TO CAP A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT A SET PRE-DETERMINED  RATE. FREIT ENTERS INTO CAP CONTRACTS WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT IS USUALLY A HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL BANK. IN ESSENCE, SO LONG AS  THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE IS BELOW THE CAP RATE, FREIT AGREES TO PAY ITS COUNTERPARTIES A VARIABLE RATE OF INTEREST ON A DOLLAR  AMOUNT OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL (WHICH CORRESPONDS TO FREIT\u2019S MORTGAGE DEBT). ONCE THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RISES ABOVE THE  CAP RATE, FREIT\u2019S COUNTERPARTIES, IN RETURN, AGREE TO PAY FREIT A SHORT-TERM RATE OF INTEREST ABOVE THE CAP ON THAT SAME  NOTIONAL AMOUNT.  FREIT HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE LOAN  SECURED BY ITS ROTUNDA PROPERTY. AS PART OF THE REFINANCING OF GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC\u2019S CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO  WITH A NEW LOAN FROM AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT  THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN.  THE CAP CONTRACT WAS BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $121,900,000 ($121,900,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) AND A TERM OF  TWO YEARS WITH THE LOAN BEING HEDGED AGAINST HAVING A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $118,520,000 AND A TERM OF THREE YEARS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU 2017-12, WHICH  WAS ADOPTED BY FREIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, FREIT MARKS-TO-MARKET ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AND CAP CONTRACTS. AS THE  FLOATING INTEREST RATE VARIES FROM TIME-TO-TIME OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WILL CHANGE UPWARD OR  DOWNWARD. IF THE FLOATING RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE FIXED RATE, THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT GOES UP AND THERE IS A GAIN AND AN ASSET.  IF THE FLOATING RATE IS LESS THAN THE FIXED RATE, THERE IS A LOSS AND A LIABILITY. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAP ARE ACCOUNTED  FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS NOT AFFECTING FREIT\u2019S INCOME STATEMENT;  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES WILL BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND APPEAR IN THE EQUITY SECTION  OF THE BALANCE SHEET. THIS GAIN OR LOSS REPRESENTS THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF LIQUIDATING FIXED RATE SWAPS OR THE CAP CONTRACT  AND REPLACING THEM WITH LIKE-DURATION FUNDING AT CURRENT MARKET RATES, SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKELY NEVER DO. PERIODIC CASH SETTLEMENTS  OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2019, PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12,  THE INTEREST RATE CAP WAS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, DEEMED TO BE AN INEFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE WITH A CORRESPONDING GAIN OR LOSS  BEING RECORDED IN FREIT\u2019S INCOME STATEMENT.  PAGE  29  INDEX  FREIT HAS THE FOLLOWING DERIVATIVE-RELATED  RISKS WITH ITS SWAP AND CAP CONTRACTS (\u201cCONTRACT\u201d): 1) EARLY TERMINATION RISK, AND 2) COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK.  EARLY TERMINATION RISK: IF FREIT  WANTS TO TERMINATE ITS CONTRACT BEFORE MATURITY, IT WOULD BE BOUGHT OUT OR TERMINATED AT MARKET VALUE; I.E., THE DIFFERENCE IN  THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ANTICIPATED NET CASH FLOWS FROM EACH OF THE CONTRACT\u2019S PARTIES. IF CURRENT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES  ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW FREIT\u2019S FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS, THIS COULD BE COSTLY. CONVERSELY, IF INTEREST RATES RISE ABOVE  FREIT\u2019S FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AND FREIT ELECTED EARLY TERMINATION, FREIT WOULD REALIZE A GAIN ON TERMINATION. AT JANUARY  31, 2020, THE SWAP CONTRACTS FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE, REGENCY, STATION PLACE AND WAYNE PSC WERE IN THE COUNTERPARTIES\u2019 FAVOR.  IF FREIT HAD TERMINATED THESE CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE IT WOULD HAVE REALIZED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0 FOR THE ROTUNDA CAP, $239,000  FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE SWAPS, $917,000 FOR THE REGENCY SWAP, $1,122,000 FOR THE STATION PLACE SWAP AND $238,000 FOR THE WAYNE  PSC SWAP, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS A LIABILITY IN FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS AT JANUARY 31,  2020. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE FOR THE CONTRACT (GAIN OR LOSS) DURING SUCH PERIOD HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AND  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $390,000 IN COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.  IN FISCAL 2019, FREIT WAS  ACCOUNTING FOR ITS INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAP CONTRACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 815,  \u201cACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\u201d  . (SEE NOTE 2 AND 4 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS). FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF $2,364,000 IN  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS REPRESENTING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS DURING SUCH PERIOD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $154,000  FOR  GRANDE ROTUNDA\u2019S INTEREST RATE CAP REPRESENTING THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS INEFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE  DURING SUCH PERIOD. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GRANDE ROTUNDA INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT WAS $0.  COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK: EACH  PARTY TO A CAP OR SWAP CONTRACT BEARS THE RISK THAT ITS COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO MAKE A PERIODIC PAYMENT.  FREIT REDUCES THIS RISK BY ENTERING INTO SWAP OR CAP CONTRACTS ONLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCED MARKET  MAKERS IN THE DERIVATIVES MARKET.  DIVIDEND: IN VIEW OF FREIT HAVING ENTERED  INTO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DID NOT DECLARE A DIVIDEND FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE  BOARD WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE DIVIDEND ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  STOCK OPTION PLAN  ON  MARCH 4, 2019, THE BOARD APPROVED THE GRANT OF AN AGGREGATE OF 5,000 NON-QUALIFIED SHARE OPTIONS UNDER THE PLAN TO THE CHAIRMAN  OF THE BOARD. THE OPTIONS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $15.00 PER SHARE, WILL VEST IN EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD  AND WILL EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WHICH WILL BE MARCH 3, 2029. (SEE NOTE 13 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.)  PAGE  30  INDEX  ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d)  IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d). FREIT DOES  NOT INCLUDE SOURCES OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM EQUITY/DEBT SOURCES IN ITS COMPUTATION OF FFO. ALTHOUGH MANY CONSIDER FFO AS THE STANDARD  MEASUREMENT OF A REIT\u2019S PERFORMANCE, FREIT MODIFIED THE NAREIT COMPUTATION OF FFO TO INCLUDE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO GAAP NET  INCOME THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF ITS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO GAAP  NET INCOME ARE STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS AND RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ON FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL APARTMENTS. THE MODIFIED FFO  COMPUTATION IS REFERRED TO AS ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cAFFO\u201d). FREIT BELIEVES THAT AFFO IS A SUPERIOR MEASURE  OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FREIT COMPUTES FFO AND AFFO AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") (A)  NET (LOSS) INCOME  $(2,021  )  $435  DEPRECIATION OF CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES  2,932  2,824  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED LEASING COSTS  113  127  DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS  (583  )  (294  )  FFO  $441  $3,092  PER SHARE - BASIC AND DILUTED  $0.06  $0.45  (A) AS PRESCRIBED BY NAREIT.

BASIC AND DILUTED  6,979  6,915  FFO AND AFFO DO NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED  FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME AS A MEASURE  OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FOR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE APPLICATION AND CALCULATION  OF FFO AND AFFO BY CERTAIN OTHER REITS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THAT OF FREIT, AND THEREFORE FREIT\u2019S FFO AND AFFO MAY NOT  BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  INFLATION  INFLATION CAN IMPACT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OF FREIT IN VARIOUS WAYS. FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL TENANT LEASES NORMALLY PROVIDE THAT THE TENANTS BEAR ALL OR A PORTION OF MOST  OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INFLATIONARY INCREASES ON FREIT. APARTMENT LEASES ARE NORMALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR  TERM, WHICH MAY ALLOW FREIT TO SEEK INCREASED RENTS AS LEASES RENEW OR WHEN NEW TENANTS ARE OBTAINED, SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET  CONDITIONS.

WE SELL OUR PISTACHIOS TO A ROASTER, PACKAGER AND MARKETER OF NUTS, AND OUR WINE GRAPES ARE SOLD TO VARIOUS WINE PRODUCERS.  HISTORICALLY, OUR AGRIBUSINESS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN SEASONAL IN NATURE WITH QUARTERLY REVENUE FLUCTUATING DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND VARIETY OF CROPS BEING HARVESTED. CULTURAL COSTS IN OUR AGRIBUSINESS TEND TO BE HIGHER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS AND LOWER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF EXPENSING CULTURAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WERE INVENTORIED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OUR HARVEST COSTS GENERALLY INCREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PEAK IN THE THIRD QUARTER COINCIDING WITH THE INCREASING PRODUCTION AND REVENUE.  FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE ARE A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND WITH WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNUSUALLY LOW TEMPERATURES, TYPICALLY HAVING THE MOST DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF LEMONS SUPPLIED IN ANY INDIVIDUAL GROWING SEASON. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY MAINTAINING OUR OWN LEMON PACKING OPERATIONS, EVEN THOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THESE OPERATIONS ARE FIXED. AS A RESULT, COST PER CARTON IS A FUNCTION OF FRUIT THROUGHPUT. WHILE WE REGULARLY MONITOR OUR COSTS FOR REDUNDANCIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST REDUCTIONS, WE ALSO SUPPLEMENT THE NUMBER OF LEMONS WE PACK IN OUR PACKINGHOUSE WITH ADDITIONAL LEMONS PROCURED FROM OTHER GROWERS. BECAUSE THE FRESH UTILIZATION RATE FOR OUR LEMONS, OR PERCENTAGE OF LEMONS WE HARVEST AND PACK THAT ARE SOLD TO THE FRESH MARKET, IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF LEMONS WE PACK AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRICE WE RECEIVE PER 40-POUND BOX, WE ONLY PACK LEMONS FROM OTHER GROWERS IF WE DETERMINE THEIR LEMONS ARE OF GOOD QUALITY.  OUR AVOCADO PRODUCING BUSINESS IS IMPORTANT TO US, YET IT FACES CONSTRAINTS ON GROWTH AS THERE IS LITTLE ADDITIONAL LAND THAT CAN BE COST-EFFECTIVELY ACQUIRED TO SUPPORT NEW AVOCADO ORCHARDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALSO, AVOCADO PRODUCTION IS CYCLICAL AS AVOCADOS TYPICALLY BEAR FRUIT ON A BI-ANNUAL BASIS WITH LARGE CROPS IN ONE YEAR FOLLOWED BY SMALLER CROPS THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE OUR AVOCADO PRODUCTION CAN BE VOLATILE, THE PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW REALIZED FROM OUR AVOCADOS HELPS TO DIVERSIFY OUR FRUIT PRODUCTION BASE.  IN ADDITION TO GROWING LEMONS AND AVOCADOS, WE GROW ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS, TYPICALLY UTILIZING LAND NOT SUITABLE FOR GROWING HIGH QUALITY LEMONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE DEMAND FOR THE FRUIT WE GROW IN THE EVER-CHANGING MARKETPLACE TO IDENTIFY TRENDS. FOR INSTANCE, WHILE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF ORANGES IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DECREASING SINCE 2000 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CONSUMERS INCREASING THEIR CONSUMPTION OF MANDARIN ORANGES AND OTHER SPECIALTY CITRUS, THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET DEMAND FOR U.S. ORANGES HAS INCREASED. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR ORANGE PRODUCTION ON HIGH QUALITY LATE SEASON NAVEL ORANGES PRIMARILY FOR EXPORT TO JAPAN, CHINA AND KOREA, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY HIGHLY PROFITABLE NICHE MARKETS. WE PRODUCE OUR SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS IN RESPONSE TO IDENTIFIED CONSUMER TRENDS AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE A LEADER IN THE NICHE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF THESE HIGH MARGIN FRUITS. WE CAREFULLY MONITOR THE RESPECTIVE MARKETS OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS AND WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR THE TYPES AND VARIETIES OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS THAT WE GROW WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  OTHER DIVISIONS  OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION INCLUDES OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL RENTALS, LEASED LAND OPERATIONS AND ORGANIC RECYCLING. OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 3%, 4% AND 4% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNITS GENERATE RELIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH WE USE TO PARTIALLY FUND THE OPERATIONS OF ALL THREE OF OUR BUSINESS DIVISIONS AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OUR AGRIBUSINESS EMPLOYEES, A UNIQUE EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT THAT HELPS US MAINTAIN A DEPENDABLE, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BASE. IN ADDITION, OUR LEASED LAND BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH A TYPICALLY PROFITABLE DIVERSIFICATION. REVENUE FROM RENTAL OPERATIONS IS GENERALLY LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION INCLUDES OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION HAD NO REVENUE IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  OR  2017  . WE RECOGNIZE THAT LONG-TERM STRATEGIES ARE REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO REDEPLOY REAL ESTATE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW INTO THE EXPANSION OF OUR AGRIBUSINESS AND OTHER INCOME PRODUCING REAL ESTATE. FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND JOINT VENTURES, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND COSTS, PARTNER CONTRIBUTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, PROJECT LOANS AND OTHER FINANCING ASSUMPTIONS AND PROJECT CASH FLOWS TO BE IMPACTED BY GOVERNMENT APPROVALS, PROJECT REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FINANCING SOURCES AND PRODUCT DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS. SUCH FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY.  27  WATER RESOURCES  OUR WATER RESOURCES INCLUDE WATER RIGHTS, USAGE RIGHTS AND PUMPING RIGHTS TO THE WATER IN AQUIFERS UNDER, AND CANALS THAT RUN THROUGH, THE LAND WE OWN. WATER FOR OUR FARMING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA IS SOURCED FROM THE EXISTING WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LAND, WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 8,600-ACRE FEET OF ADJUDICATED WATER RIGHTS IN THE SANTA PAULA BASIN (AQUIFER) AND THE UN-ADJUDICATED FILLMORE BASIN. WE USE A COMBINATION OF GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS THAT DERIVE WATER FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BASIN AND WATER FROM VARIOUS WATER DISTRICTS AND IRRIGATION DISTRICTS IN TULARE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS IN THE AGRICULTURALLY PRODUCTIVE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE USE GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS WHICH DERIVE WATER FROM THE CADIZ VALLEY BASIN AT THE CADIZ RANCH IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. OUR WINDFALL FARMS PROPERTY LOCATED IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA OBTAINS WATER FROM WELLS THAT DERIVE WATER FROM THE PASO ROBLES BASIN. OUR ASSOCIATED CITRUS PACKERS, INC. (\"ASSOCIATED\") FARMING OPERATIONS IN YUMA, ARIZONA SOURCE WATER FROM THE COLORADO RIVER THROUGH THE YMIDD, WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY 11,700-ACRE FEET OF CLASS 3 COLORADO RIVER WATER RIGHTS. WE USE GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS AND SURFACE WATER FOR OUR PDA AND SAN PABLO FARMING OPERATIONS IN LA SERENA, CHILE AND OUR TRAPANI FRESH FARMING OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA.  CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF BELOW AVERAGE PRECIPITATION. PRECIPITATION IN 2019 BROUGHT RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA\u2019S DROUGHT CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE FEW YEARS PRIOR TO 2019 WERE AMONG THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHTS ON RECORD. RAINFALL, SNOW LEVELS AND WATER CONTENT OF SNOW PACK WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW HISTORICAL AVERAGES. THESE CONDITIONS RESULTED IN REDUCED WATER LEVELS IN STREAMS, RIVERS, LAKES, AQUIFERS AND RESERVOIRS. FEDERAL OFFICIALS OVERSEE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT, CALIFORNIA\u2019S LARGEST WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM AND 100% OF THE CONTRACTED AMOUNT OF WATER WAS PROVIDED TO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FARMERS IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017 COMPARED TO 75% IN 2016 AND ZERO FOR 2015 AND 2014.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE EQUAL PARTNERS IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE LEWIS GROUP OF COMPANIES (\u201cLEWIS\u201d) FOR THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EAST AREA I REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION, WE FORMED LIMONEIRA LEWIS COMMUNITY BUILDERS, LLC (THE \"LLCB\" OR \"JOINT VENTURE\") AS THE DEVELOPMENT ENTITY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT BROKE GROUND TO COMMENCE MASS GRADING IN NOVEMBER 2017. THE JOINT VENTURE HAS CLOSED ON LOTS SALES REPRESENTING 244 UNITS THROUGH  JANUARY 31, 2020  . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION SEE NOTE 7 \u2013 REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  ON MAY 30, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A  51%  INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE, TRAPANI FRESH, FORMED WITH FGF TRAPANI (\u201cFGF\u201d), A MULTI-GENERATIONAL, FAMILY OWNED CITRUS OPERATION IN ARGENTINA. TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION, WE FORMED A SUBSIDIARY UNDER THE NAME LIMONEIRA ARGENTINA S.A.U. (\u201cLIMONEIRA ARGENTINA\u201d) AS THE MANAGING PARTNER AND ACQUIRED A  51%  INTEREST IN AN ARGENTINE TRUST THAT HOLDS A  75%  INTEREST IN FINCA SANTA CLARA (\u201cSANTA CLARA\u201d), A RANCH WITH APPROXIMATELY  1,200  ACRES OF PLANTED LEMONS. TRAPANI FRESH CONTROLS THE TRUST AND GROWS, PACKS, MARKETS AND SELLS FRESH CITRUS. TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID FOR OUR INTEREST IN TRAPANI FRESH WAS  $15,000,000.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR SEVILLA PROPERTY FOR $2,700,000. AFTER TRANSACTION AND OTHER COSTS, WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $2,550,000 AND RECOGNIZE AN INSIGNIFICANT GAIN. AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE  $2,543,000  CARRYING VALUE OF THE PROPERTY WAS CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE AND INCLUDED IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.  FOR FISCAL YEAR  2019  , WE DECLARED CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS TOTALING $0.25 PER COMMON SHARE IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $4.0 MILLION COMPARED TO A TOTAL OF $0.21 PER COMMON SHARE IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $3.7 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR  2018  . ON DECEMBER 17, 2019, WE DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND $0.075 PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID ON JANUARY 15, 2020, IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $1.3 MILLION TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2019.  WE BELIEVE THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 POSES INCREASING RISKS AND MAY POTENTIALLY HAVE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS FOR US WITH EXPOSURE TO A BROADER ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AND DECLINE IN FINANCIAL MARKETS.  WE ANTICIPATE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR FRESH CITRUS IN ASIAN COUNTRIES WHICH WOULD RESULT IN SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AND REDUCED EXPORTS TO AREAS AFFECTED BY THE VIRUS.  28  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (IN THOUSANDS).

SEASONAL OPERATIONS  HISTORICALLY, OUR AGRIBUSINESS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN SEASONAL IN NATURE WITH QUARTERLY REVENUE FLUCTUATING DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND THE VARIETY OF CROPS BEING HARVESTED. CULTURAL COSTS IN OUR AGRIBUSINESS TEND TO BE HIGHER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS AND LOWER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF EXPENSING CULTURAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WERE INVENTORIED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OUR HARVEST COSTS GENERALLY INCREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PEAK IN THE THIRD QUARTER COINCIDING WITH THE INCREASING PRODUCTION AND REVENUE.

INFLATION  HISTORICALLY, INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN INFLATION, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AVAILABLE RELEVANT DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS AS NEW OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2016-02, LEASES (AS AMENDED, \"ASU 2016-02\" OR THE \"NEW LEASE STANDARD\"). A LEASE IS DEFINED AS A CONTRACT THAT CONVEYS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN IDENTIFIED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT ARE, OR CONTAIN, LEASES AS BOTH A LESSEE AND A LESSOR. THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE BEEN UPDATED AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD.  LEASES  ACCOUNTING FOR OPERATING LEASES AS A LESSEE  - IN OUR ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ENTER INTO LEASES AS A LESSEE GENERALLY FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND AND PACKINGHOUSE EQUIPMENT. WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE OR CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO USE AN UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE, MEASURED ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM AT COMMENCEMENT DATE. AS NONE OF THE OUR LEASES PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS.  LEASE EXPENSE FOR MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS WE HAVE ELECTED TO RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE HAVE MATERIAL LEASES WITH RELATED PARTIES WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. CERTAIN OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LAND AGREEMENTS CONTAIN VARIABLE COSTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LEASED PROPERTY. SUCH VARIABLE LEASE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THESE LAND AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN COSTS FOR NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SUCH AS WATER USAGE. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY. FOR ALL OTHER AGREEMENTS, WE GENERALLY COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS IN CALCULATING THE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. SEE NOTE 13 - LEASES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  38  ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES AS A LESSOR  - WE LEASE IN WHICH WE ACT AS THE LESSOR INCLUDES LAND AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL UNITS AND ARE ALL CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES. CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN VARIABLE INCOME BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LEASED ASSET. CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SUCH AS WATER, UTILITIES AND COMMON AREA SERVICES. WE HAVE ELECTED TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR OUR LESSOR ARRANGEMENTS AND THE COMBINED COMPONENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR ENTIRELY UNDER ASC 842. THE UNDERLYING ASSET IN AN OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENT IS CARRIED AT DEPRECIATED COST WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEPRECIATION IS CALCULATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET. WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  - WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR AGRIBUSINESS REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE STANDARD IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. TO ACHIEVE THAT CORE PRINCIPLE, AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  \u2022  IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT(S) WITH A CUSTOMER;  \u2022  IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  \u2022  DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  \u2022  ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; AND  \u2022  RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE METHOD BY WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE BY ANALYZING THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED AS WELL AS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT WHEN IT HAS APPROVAL AND COMMITMENT FROM BOTH PARTIES, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, PAYMENT TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE AND COLLECTABILITY OF CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. A CONTRACT'S TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE (I.E., PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION) IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTRACT AND EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS VALUED BASED ON ITS ESTIMATED RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE.  WE RECOGNIZE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND TRANSFER CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT TO THE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMER. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT IS RECOGNIZED IS BASED ON THE TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION SUCH AS ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS OR CONCESSIONS, WHERE APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND IS INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT WILL NOT OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD.  AGRIBUSINESS REVENUE  - REVENUE FROM LEMON SALES IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN THE CUSTOMER TAKES CONTROL OF THE FRUIT FROM OUR PACKINGHOUSE WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE TRANSFER OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER. WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT ANY SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS INCURRED AFTER CONTROL OF THE GOODS HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AS AGRIBUSINESS COSTS.  OUR AVOCADOS, ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER SPECIALTY CROPS ARE PACKED AND SOLD BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES. WE DELIVER THE MAJORITY OF OUR AVOCADO PRODUCTION FROM OUR ORCHARDS TO CALAVO. THESE AVOCADOS ARE THEN PACKED BY CALAVO AT ITS PACKINGHOUSE AND SOLD AND DISTRIBUTED UNDER CALAVO BRANDS TO ITS CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES RELATED TO OUR ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER SPECIALTY CROPS ARE SIMILAR TO OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH CALAVO. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE SUCH THAT WE ARE THE PRODUCER AND SUPPLIER OF THE PRODUCT AND THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE REVENUES WE RECOGNIZE RELATED TO THE FRUITS SOLD TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE BASED ON THE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF THE FRUITS DELIVERED, THE MARKET PRICE FOR SUCH FRUIT, LESS THE PACKINGHOUSES\u2019 CHARGES TO PACK AND MARKET THE FRUIT. SUCH PACKINGHOUSE CHARGES INCLUDE THE GRADING, SIZING, PACKING, COOLING, RIPENING AND MARKETING OF THE RELATED FRUIT. WE CONTROL THE PRODUCT UNTIL IT IS DELIVERED TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AT WHICH TIME CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. SUCH THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSE CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AS THEY ARE NOT FOR DISTINCT SERVICES. THE IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT WE RECEIVE FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES FOR PACKAGING AND MARKETING SERVICES CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEPARATED FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES\u2019 PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BENEFIT RECEIVED FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES FOR SUCH SERVICES AND AS SUCH, THESE COSTS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS IS RECORDED BASED ON ESTIMATED PROCEEDS PROVIDED BY CERTAIN OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING PARTNERS (CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES) DUE TO THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED BY US AND THE CLOSING OF THE POOLS FOR SUCH FRUITS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH OR HARVEST PERIOD. CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES OR FUNCTION IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS AN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE. WE ESTIMATE THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING  39  THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD, WITH THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT BEING THE QUANTITIES ACTUALLY SHIPPED EXTENDED BY THE PRICES REPORTED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT TIME OF DELIVERY TO THE PACKINGHOUSES RELATING TO FRUITS THAT ARE IN POOLS THAT HAVE NOT YET CLOSED AT MONTH END IF: (A) THE RELATED FRUITS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES (I.E., CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES OBTAIN CONTROL) AND (B) SALES PRICE INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES (BASED ON THE MARKETPLACE ACTIVITY FOR THE RELATED FRUIT) TO ESTIMATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY THE FINAL SELLING PRICE FOR THE FRUIT UPON THE CLOSING OF THE POOLS. IN SUCH INSTANCES, WE HAVE THE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT AND CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES HAVE THE PRESENT RIGHT TO DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM, THE DELIVERED FRUIT. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THERE IS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE EARLY PERIODS OF THE POOL WILL OCCUR ONCE THE FINAL POOL PRICES HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY THE PACKINGHOUSES. HISTORICALLY, THE REVENUE THAT IS RECORDED BASED ON THE SALES PRICE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY, HAVE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERED FROM THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS THAT ARE PAID AFTER THE MONTHLY OR HARVEST PERIOD POOLS ARE CLOSED.  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY INTERNATIONAL PACKINGHOUSES. IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM THE FRUIT, AND ARE THEREFORE ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL. AS SUCH, WE RECORD THE RELATED REVENUE AND COSTS OF THE FRUIT GROSS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE FROM CROP INSURANCE PROCEEDS IS RECORDED WHEN THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY DETERMINED AND UPON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT.  RENTAL REVENUE  - WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, LEASES. MINIMUM RENTAL REVENUES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RESPECTIVE INITIAL LEASE TERM. CONTINGENT RENTAL REVENUES ARE CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AS TO THE PERCENTAGE OF RENT RECEIVED BY US AND ARE BASED ON FEES COLLECTED BY THE LESSEE. SUCH REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ACTUAL RESULTS, BASED ON COLLECTED FEES REPORTED BY THE TENANT, ARE RECEIVED. OUR RENTAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS.  REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  - WE CAPITALIZE THE PLANNING, ENTITLEMENT, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR VARIOUS REAL ESTATE PROJECTS. COSTS THAT ARE NOT CAPITALIZED, WHICH INCLUDE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND MARKETING EXPENSES, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE UPON THE CESSATION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ONCE A PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED, FUTURE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS INCURRED TO SELL THE REAL ESTATE ARE EVALUATED FOR CAPITALIZATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 340-40, AND INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT AND COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT ARE CAPITALIZED ONLY IF THE COSTS RELATE DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED CONTRACT, ENHANCE RESOURCES TO SATISFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED.  FINANCING AND PAYMENT  - OUR PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF OUR CUSTOMER AND THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED. PAYMENT TERMS DIFFER BY JURISDICTION AND CUSTOMER BUT PAYMENT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED IN A TERM RANGING FROM 30 TO 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF SHIPMENT OR SATISFACTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE DO NOT PROVIDE FINANCING WITH EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS BEYOND GENERALLY STANDARD COMMERCIAL PAYMENT TERMS FOR THE APPLICABLE INDUSTRY.  PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AND EXEMPTIONS  - TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND THAT ARE RELATED TO THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUES.  WE DO NOT DISCLOSE THE VALUE OF UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR (I) CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL EXPECTED LENGTHS OF ONE YEAR OR LESS OR (II) CONTRACTS FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE AMOUNT TO WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVOICE FOR THE SERVICES PERFORMED.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  - PDA AND SAN PABLO\u2019S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CHILEAN PESO. OUR BALANCE SHEETS ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATES AND THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE RESULTING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  INCOME TAXES  - DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE COMPUTED ANNUALLY FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND INCOME TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WILL RESULT IN TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE TO PERIODS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED, WHEN NECESSARY, TO REDUCE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED.  TAX BENEFITS FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  40  FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS  - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 805, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE ACQUISITION METHOD REQUIRES IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED BE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, WHICH IS THE DATE THAT THE ACQUIRER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED AS THE PURCHASE PRICE EXCEEDS THE NET FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. ACQUISITIONS THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS UNDER THE ASC ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS ASSET ACQUISITIONS. ASSET ACQUISITIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ALLOCATING THE COST OF THE ACQUISITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS. GOODWILL IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN AN ASSET ACQUISITION WITH ANY CONSIDERATION IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED ASSETS ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS. TRANSACTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ARE CONSIDERED A COMPONENT OF THE COST OF THE ACQUISITION IN AN ASSET ACQUISITION.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  - WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN  - AS DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE SPONSOR A DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN THAT WAS FROZEN IN JUNE 2004, AND NO FUTURE BENEFITS ACCRUED TO PARTICIPANTS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT TIME. ONGOING ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN UNDER FASB ASC 715 PROVIDES GUIDANCE AS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION EXPENSE, PENSION LIABILITY AND MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIAL CONSULTANTS PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO US. IN DEVELOPING THIS DATA, CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS, DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN AND MORTALITY TABLES. DURING 2019, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (\u201cSOA\u201d) RELEASED A NEW MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE TABLE, REFERRED TO AS MP-2019, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BETTER REFLECT MORTALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND IS TO BE USED IN CALCULATING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE TO MEASURE THE PENSION OBLIGATION DECREASED TO 3.0%. WE USED THE LATEST MORTALITY TABLES RELEASED BY THE SOA THROUGH OCTOBER 2019 TO MEASURE OUR PENSION OBLIGATION AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND COMBINED WITH THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PENSION LIABILITY INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 MILLION AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019. FURTHER CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD  BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED  ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE  ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING PROPRIETARY ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS  TO THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES OF PATHOGEN AND HYGIENIC CONTROL. OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS BASED ON PATENTED STABILIZED  IONIC SILVER, AND OUR INITIAL PRODUCTS CONTAIN SILVER DIHYDROGEN CITRATE, OR SDC. SDC IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM, NON-TOXIC ANTIMICROBIAL  AGENT, WHICH OFFERS 24-HOUR RESIDUAL PROTECTION AND FORMULATES WELL WITH OTHER COMPOUNDS. AS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY, WE BELIEVE  SDC IS DISTINGUISHED FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR EFFICACY, REDUCED TOXICITY, NON-CAUSTICITY,  AND THE INABILITY OF BACTERIA TO FORM A RESISTANCE TO IT.  WE  BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SAFE, NON-TOXIC AND EFFECTIVE SDC-BASED SOLUTIONS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER  PURE  \u00ae  HARD SURFACE AS A FOOD CONTACT SURFACE SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT TO RESTAURANT CHAINS, FOOD PROCESSORS,  AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. WE ALSO OFFER PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID. WE RECEIVED  THE REQUIRED FDA APPROVALS TO MARKET PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW POULTRY AND  FRESH PRODUCE IN DECEMBER 2015 AND JANUARY 2016, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE ADDITIONAL USDA APPROVAL WAS NOT REQUIRED, WE BEGAN MARKETING  PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR FRESH PRODUCE FOLLOWING OUR RECEIPT OF FDA APPROVAL IN JANUARY 2016.  IN  JULY 2016, WE RECEIVED A \u201cNO OBJECTION LETTER\u201d FROM THE USDA\u2019S FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE (FSIS) GRANTING  APPROVAL FOR SDC-BASED PURE CONTROL TO BE USED AS A SPRAY OR DIP APPLIED TO POULTRY CARCASSES, PARTS AND ORGANS IN PRE-OLR (ON-LINE  REPROCESSING) AND POST CHILL PROCESSING OF FRESH POULTRY. IN JANUARY 2017, WE SUBMITTED AN ADDITIONAL FCN TO THE FDA TO ALLOW  USE OF HIGHER SDC CONCENTRATIONS IN POULTRY PROCESSING, ALLOWING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST TO VARYING PLANT AND PROCESSING CONDITIONS.  IN MAY 2017, WE RECEIVED A FINAL LETTER FROM THE FDA FOR THIS FCN AS WELL AS A \u201cNO OBJECTION LETTER\u201d FROM THE USDA\u2019S  FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE (FSIS) GRANTING APPROVAL FOR THE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF SDC-BASED PURE CONTROL TO BE USED  AS A SPRAY OR DIP APPLIED TO POULTRY CARCASSES, PARTS AND ORGANS IN PRE-OLR (ON-LINE REPROCESSING) AND POST CHILL PROCESSING OF  FRESH POULTRY. WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON COMPLETING IN-PLANT VALIDATION TRIALS FOR PURE CONTROL IN PRE- AND POST OLR POULTRY  PROCESSING APPLICATIONS, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 65% TO 75% OF THE TOTAL PROCESSING AID MARKET FOR POULTRY PROCESSING.  WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPTIMIZE THE APPLICATION OF PURE CONTROL IN OLR TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN USDA APPROVAL FOR USE IN THIS STAGE OF  POULTRY PROCESSING.  SUBJECT  TO THE RESULTS OF OUR FOCUSED IN-PLANT VALIDATION EFFORTS FOR OUR APPROVED PRODUCE AND POULTRY SOLUTIONS, WE INTEND TO SEEK APPROVAL  TO UTILIZE PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW MEATS, INCLUDING BEEF AND PORK. IN ADDITION TO OUR DIRECT  SALES EFFORTS WITH PURE HARD SURFACE AND PURE CONTROL, WE MARKET AND SELL OUR SDC-BASED PRODUCTS INDIRECTLY THROUGH THIRD-PARTY  DISTRIBUTORS.  15  BUSINESS  STRATEGY  OUR  GOAL IS TO BECOME A SUSTAINABLE COMPANY BY COMMERCIALIZING THE SDC-BASED PRODUCTS WE HAVE DEVELOPED WITH OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING LEADING ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS FOOD SAFETY RISKS ACROSS THE FOOD INDUSTRY  SUPPLY CHAIN. KEY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY INCLUDE.  \u25cf  EXPANDING  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS INTO THE FOOD INDUSTRY WITH A FOCUS ON A DUAL TRACK OF FOOD SAFETY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  \u25cf  HARD  SURFACE DISINFECTANT  - COMMERCIALIZING OUR CURRENT EPA REGISTERED PURE HARD SURFACE DISINFECTANT AND SANITIZER FOR  USE IN FOODSERVICE OPERATIONS, FOOD MANUFACTURING AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION.  \u25cf  DIRECT  FOOD CONTACT  - COMMERCIALIZING FDA APPROVED PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR FRESH PRODUCE;  COMMERCIALIZING FDA APPROVED PURE CONTROL AS A FOOD PROCESSING AND INTERVENTION AID FOR FOOD PROCESSORS TREATING RAW POULTRY  IN PRE AND POST OLR APPLICATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPTIMIZE THE APPLICATION OF PURE CONTROL IN OLR TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN  USDA APPROVAL FOR USE IN THIS STAGE OF POULTRY PROCESSING. ADDITIONALLY, SUBJECT TO THE RESULTS OF OUR FOCUSED IN-PLANT VALIDATION  EFFORTS FOR OUR APPROVED PRODUCE AND POULTRY SOLUTIONS, WE INTEND TO SEEK APPROVAL TO UTILIZE PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD  CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW MEATS, INCLUDING BEEF AND PORK.  \u25cf  ESTABLISHING  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES TO MAXIMIZE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM;  \u25cf  DEVELOPING  ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS; AND  \u25cf  PROTECTING  AND ENHANCING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  IN  ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS ADDRESSING FOOD SAFETY, WE INTEND TO LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THROUGH LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION  COLLABORATIONS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENTER INTO NEW MARKETS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GENERATE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF  REVENUE.  FINANCIAL  OVERVIEW  THIS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR REVENUE AND EXPENSES.  REVENUE  WE  CONTRACT MANUFACTURE AND SELL SDC-BASED PRODUCTS FOR END USE, AND AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR MANUFACTURING USE. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT  THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PRIOR  TO SATISFYING REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD  COST  OF GOODS SOLD FOR PRODUCT SALES INCLUDES DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MATERIALS CONSUMED, MANUFACTURING  OVERHEAD, SHIPPING COSTS, SALARIES, BENEFITS, RESERVED INVENTORY, AND RELATED EXPENSES OF OPERATIONS. DEPRECIATION RELATED TO  MANUFACTURING IS SYSTEMATICALLY ALLOCATED TO INVENTORY PRODUCED, AND EXPENSED THROUGH COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME INVENTORY  IS SOLD.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS FOR PERSONNEL IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT,  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, SALES, FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. OTHER SELLING, GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE PRODUCT MARKETING, ADVERTISING, AND TRADE SHOW COSTS, AS WELL AS PUBLIC RELATIONS AND INVESTOR  RELATIONS, FACILITY COSTS, AND LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT  OUR  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FOCUSED ON LEVERAGING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS  AND APPLICATIONS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL AND RELATED COSTS, PRODUCT REGISTRATION EXPENSES,  AND THIRD-PARTY TESTING. WE EXPENSE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS INCURRED.  16  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  FLUCTUATIONS  IN OPERATING RESULTS  OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN THE PAST AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE  FUTURE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BY SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE  TO THESE PERIODIC FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR PRODUCT SALES, AND THE PROGRESS  AND TIMING OF EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SALES AND MARKETING, AS WELL AS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO THESE FLUCTUATIONS, WE BELIEVE  THAT THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT A RELIABLE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  COMPARISON  OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  NET  PRODUCT SALES  NET  PRODUCT SALES WERE $349,000 AND $394,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $45,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, TWO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 14% AND 10% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES. ALL OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES WERE U.S. BASED  SALES.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, THREE INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 14%, 10% AND 10% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES.

COST  OF GOODS SOLD  COST  OF GOODS SOLD WAS $142,000 AND $160,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $18,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PRODUCT SALES.  GROSS  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, OR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WAS 59% FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019. OVERALL THE GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS HIGHER DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS $810,000 AND $1,459,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE OF $649,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PERSONNEL COSTS, AS WELL AS, DECREASED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT,  MARKETING, BOARD FEES AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WAS $89,000 AND $457,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $368,000 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS  AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS SUPPORTING OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  FUNCTIONS.  17  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $60,000 AND $67,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE  OF $7,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON RESEARCH SUPPORTING OUR FDA APPROVALS.

FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, TWO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 16% AND 12% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES. ALL OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES WERE U.S. BASED  SALES.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD  COST  OF GOODS SOLD WAS $298,000 AND $363,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $65,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PRODUCT SALES.  GROSS  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, OR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WAS 60% AND 63% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALE OF LOWER MARGIN FORMULATIONS  AND PACKAGING CONFIGURATIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR PERIOD.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS $2,100,000 AND $4,312,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE OF $2,212,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PERSONNEL COSTS, AS WELL AS, DECREASED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT,  MARKETING, BOARD FEES AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WAS $547,000 AND $2,201,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $1,654,000 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR ACCELERATED VESTING  OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HELD BY DAVE PFANZELTER, THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD  (SEE  NOTE 6  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q  ).  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $142,000 AND $164,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE  OF $22,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON RESEARCH SUPPORTING OUR FDA APPROVALS.  18  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION  OF ASSETS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. AS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $1,791,000  AND USED CASH IN OPERATIONS OF $958,000. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN  WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEING ISSUED. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT  UPON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PLAN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO  NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. IN ADDITION, OUR INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S JULY 31, 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, HAS RAISED SUBSTANTIAL  DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF SECURITIES, DEBT FINANCING, AND  REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF RECURRING LOSSES, AND AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 WE HAVE INCURRED  A CUMULATIVE NET LOSS OF $125,269,000.  AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $321,000 IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED WITH $473,000 IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF JULY  31, 2019. THE NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FUNDS USED TO RUN OUR OPERATIONS OFFSET  BY THE OCTOBER 2019 PRIVATE PLACEMENT FINANCING. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $672,000 OF CURRENT LIABILITIES,  INCLUDING $569,000 IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, COMPARED WITH $738,000 OF CURRENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING $553,000 IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  AS OF JULY 31, 2019. THE NET DECREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN WAGE ACCRUALS.  IN  ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OUR EXECUTIVES THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CASES, PROVIDE  FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SALARY AND CERTAIN OTHER BENEFITS IF THESE EXECUTIVES ARE TERMINATED UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE  AGREEMENTS GENERALLY EXPIRE UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE OR WHEN WE HAVE MET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. AS OF JANUARY  31, 2020, NO EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE OBLIGATION OF ANY SUCH PAYMENTS.  OUR  FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FORWARD-LOOKING FACTORS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE  FOLLOWING: THE ACCEPTANCE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS; OUR SUCCESS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PARTNERS IN SELLING OUR PRODUCTS;  OUR SUCCESS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PARTNERS IN OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS; THE COSTS OF FURTHER DEVELOPING  OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES; THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE INVEST IN NEW PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT; AND THE COSTS  ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTINUED OPERATION, AND ANY FUTURE GROWTH, OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING  FACTORS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  UNTIL  WE CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS OF OFFERINGS  OF OUR EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR THAT,  IF AVAILABLE, FINANCING WILL BE OBTAINED ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE  ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WOULD LIKELY RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS  BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC  FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. FURTHER, ANY CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS WE ENTER  INTO TO RAISE FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH OUR RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL  BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY  REQUIRE US TO DELAY OR SCALE BACK OUR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER.  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY UNUSED CREDIT FACILITIES OR OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE TO US AT THIS TIME. WE INTEND TO SECURE ADDITIONAL  WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH SALES OF ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. OUR INTENDED FINANCING INITIATIVES ARE SUBJECT TO RISK,  AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OR TERMS OF THESE OR ANY FUTURE FINANCINGS.  19  IF  WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. IT COULD CAUSE  US TO FAIL TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES, OR FAIL TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  OR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS TO REDUCE SPENDING  TO A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE DELAYING, SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING SOME OR ALL OF OUR ONGOING AND PLANNED INVESTMENTS  IN CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, AND  SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER INVESTMENTS. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO  REDUCE OR CEASE OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER.  SUBSEQUENT  TO JANUARY 31, 2020, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF 6,896,551 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $2.0M  (SEE  NOTE 8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q  ).  WE BELIEVE OUR AVAILABLE CASH, OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE EXPENSES,  WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CASH RESOURCES TO SATISFY OUR NEEDS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET HAVE, AND WE MAY NEVER  HAVE, SIGNIFICANT CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES OR FROM OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE TO OFFSET OUR ONGOING AND PLANNED INVESTMENTS  IN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND SALES AND MARKETING, AMONG  OTHER INVESTMENTS. SOME OR ALL OF OUR ONGOING OR PLANNED INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION, IRRESPECTIVE OF OUR CASH  RESOURCES, WE MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY OR LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE POSTPONED.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, OR GAAP.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF  ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH  FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER  SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  IN  ADDITION, THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND PRESENTED ON  A BASIS ASSUMING WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. UNTIL WE CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE  TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS OF OFFERINGS OF OUR EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL  FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR THAT, IF AVAILABLE, FINANCING WILL BE OBTAINED ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WOULD LIKELY  RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS  AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. FURTHER, ANY CONTRACTS  OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS WE ENTER INTO TO RAISE FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH OUR RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY, AND  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT  ALL. HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO DELAY OR SCALE BACK OUR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES  OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO RECOVERABILITY OR CLASSIFICATION  OF RECORDED ASSETS AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED LIABILITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CRITICAL TO AID YOU IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL  RESULTS.  20  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d),  TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (\u201cTOPIC 606\u201d). UNDER TOPIC 606, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT AN AMOUNT  THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING GOODS OR SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER.  THIS PRINCIPLE IS APPLIED USING THE FOLLOWING 5-STEP PROCESS.  1.  IDENTIFY  THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER  2.  IDENTIFY  THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  3.  DETERMINE  THE TRANSACTION PRICE  4.  ALLOCATE  THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  5.  RECOGNIZE  REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED  UNDER  TOPIC 606, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES  TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  OUR  TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS BASED ON PATENTED STABILIZED IONIC SILVER, AND OUR INITIAL PRODUCTS CONTAIN SILVER DIHYDROGEN CITRATE,  OR SDC. SDC IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM, NON-TOXIC ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT, WHICH OFFERS 24-HOUR RESIDUAL PROTECTION AND FORMULATES WELL WITH  OTHER COMPOUNDS. WE SELL VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS AND DILUTIONS OF SDC DIRECT TO CUSTOMERS AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE CURRENTLY  OFFER PURE  \u00ae  HARD SURFACE AS A FOOD CONTACT SURFACE SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT TO RESTAURANT CHAINS, FOOD PROCESSORS  AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. WE ALSO OFFER PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID.  CONTRACT  TERMS FOR UNIT PRICE, QUANTITY, SHIPPING AND PAYMENT ARE GOVERNED BY SALES AGREEMENTS AND PURCHASE ORDERS WHICH WE CONSIDER TO  BE A CUSTOMER\u2019S CONTRACT IN ALL CASES. THE UNIT PRICE IS CONSIDERED THE OBSERVABLE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE FOR THE ARRANGEMENTS.  ANY PROMOTIONAL OR SALES DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED EVENLY TO THE UNITS SOLD FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING STANDALONE SELLING PRICE.  PRODUCT  SALES GENERALLY CONSIST OF A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION THAT WE SATISFY AT A POINT IN TIME. WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN  THE FOLLOWING EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED: (A) WE HAVE TRANSFERRED PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE PRODUCTS, (B) WE HAVE A PRESENT RIGHT TO  PAYMENT, (C) THE CUSTOMER HAS LEGAL TITLE TO THE PRODUCTS, AND (D) THE CUSTOMER BEARS SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP  OF THE PRODUCTS.  OUR  DIRECT CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTER SALES ARE INVOICED BASED ON RECEIVED PURCHASE ORDERS. OUR PAYMENT TERMS ON INVOICED DIRECT CUSTOMER  AND DISTRIBUTOR SALES RANGE BETWEEN 30 AND 90 DAYS AFTER WE SATISFY OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS  ARE ON 30 DAY PAYMENT TERMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NO RIGHT OF RETURN ON INVOICED SALES AND MAINTAIN NO ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS.  SHIPPING  AND HANDLING ARE TREATED AS ACTIVITIES TO FULFILL PROMISES TO CUSTOMERS AND ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO A CUSTOMER, IF APPLICABLE, REPRESENT  REVENUES EARNED FOR THE GOODS PROVIDED. COSTS RELATED TO SUCH SHIPPING AND HANDLING BILLINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF SALES.  WE  DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES OF REVENUE THAT MAY IMPACT HOW THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH  FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC FACTORS.  VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION  WE  RECORD REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE TRANSACTION PRICE WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO AFTER TRANSFERRING  CONTROL OF THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE OFFER SALES PROMOTIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS DISCOUNTS. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION  IS ESTIMATED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF REVENUE WILL NOT OCCUR.  21  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION  WE  GRANT EQUITY-BASED AWARDS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OR STAND-ALONE CONTRACTS. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT AWARDS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL. THIS FAIR VALUE IS THEN AMORTIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIODS  OF THE AWARDS. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING PRICE VOLATILITY  OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  IS BASED ON AWARDS ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO VEST, AND THEREFORE IS REDUCED BY EXPECTED FORFEITURES. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS USED  UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR NET LOSS AND NET LOSS PER SHARE.  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, IF INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST, WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE AFFECTED LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY DETERMINING  WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS CAN BE RECOVERED THROUGH UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. IF IMPAIRMENT IS  INDICATED, WE MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET  AND WE RECORD THE IMPAIRMENT AS A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET AND A CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS. ESTIMATING  THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRES JUDGMENT, AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY  FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, NO IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WAS INDICATED  OR RECORDED.

FUTURE FINANCINGS  WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON EQUITY SALES OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  ISSUANCES OF ADDITIONAL SHARES WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE ANY ADDITIONAL SALES OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES OR ARRANGE FOR DEBT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND PLANNED ACQUISITIONS AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  18  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

YOU SHOULD NOT PUT UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ACTUAL RESULTS, CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS, OR CHANGES IN OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS. IF WE DO UPDATE ONE OR MORE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, NO INFERENCE SHOULD BE DRAWN THAT WE WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL UPDATES WITH RESPECT TO THOSE OR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS.  UTILIZING OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM (THE \"PLATFORM\"), A COMPREHENSIVE BANK OF UNIQUE, WELL CHRACTERIZED PDX MODELS, WE PROVIDE SELECT SERVICES TO PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING PERSONALIZED APPROACHES TO DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY PERFORMING STUDIES TO PREDICT THE EFFICACY OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS, OUR PLATFORM FACILITATES DRUG DISCOVERY WITH LOWER COSTS AND INCREASED SPEED OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS INCREASED ADOPTION OF EXISTING DRUGS.  OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES A NOVEL APPROACH TO SIMULATING THE RESULTS OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS USED IN DEVELOPING ONCOLOGY DRUGS. IT CAN COST UP TO $100,000 PER PATIENT IN ONCOLOGY CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE TYPICAL COST FOR EACH PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR INCREASES FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION IN THE PRE-CLINICAL SETTING TO APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN PHASE III. SIMULATING TRIALS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND PATIENTS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CAN LOWER THE RISK OF SPENDING RESOURCES ON DRUGS THAT DO NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PATH THEY PURSUE WILL BE FOCUSED ON AN APPROPRIATE PATIENT POPULATION AND A SUCCESSFUL COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR TOS PROGRAM. OUR POS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE THE FOCUS OF OUR GROWTH MOVING FORWARD.  IN DECEMBER 2019, A NOVEL STRAIN OF CORONAVIRUS WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN WUHAN, HUBEI PROVINCE, CHINA. ANY OUTBREAK OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES, OR OTHER ADVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH DEVELOPMENTS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS  19  OPERATIONS. THESE COULD INCLUDE DISRUPTIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL, PURSUE PARTNERSHIPS AND OTHER BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, RECEIVE SHIPMENTS OF BIOLOGIC MATERIALS, AS WELL AS BE IMPACTED BY THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE FACILITIES OF SUPPLIERS. WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OPERATIONS. WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE VIRUS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT THE CORONAVIRUS WILL HAVE DUE TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, THE DURATION OF THE OUTBREAK, AND ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS HAVE TYPICALLY ARISEN FROM THE FUNDING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE MET THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CASH, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF OUR SECURITIES, AND SALES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE COMPANY HAD NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY  $72,000  AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF  $360,000  . AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE COMPANY HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $70.6 MILLION  , A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF  $0.3 MILLION  AND CASH OF  $3.3 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH ON HAND, TOGETHER WITH EXPECTED POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM THE FILING OF THIS 10-Q. HOWEVER, SHOULD OUR REVENUE EXPECTATIONS NOT MATERIALIZE, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE COST REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE BUSINESS OR RESTRUCTURING THE COMPANY. SHOULD THE COMPANY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUCH CAPITAL ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.

OPERATING REVENUES WERE  $23.4 MILLION  AND  $19.3 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $4.0 MILLION  OR  20.8%  . THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO INCREASED SALES, BOTH IN NUMBER AND SIZE OF STUDIES, AND CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  ADDITIONALLY, CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING MORE COMPLEX STUDY DESIGNS AND END POINT ANALYSIS TESTING, LEADING TO LARGER CONTRACTS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO REVENUE GROWTH.  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $4.3 MILLION  AND  $3.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $900,000  OR  26.1%  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  52.0%  AND  46.7%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND SUPPLY EXPENSES. THE OVERALL EXPENSE INCREASE IS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION BASED ON THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND STUDY VOLUME. COST OF ONCOLOGY SOLUTIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $12.0 MILLION  AND  $10.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $2.0 MILLION  OR  20.0%  .  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  48.8%  AND  48.5%  , RESPECTIVELY. GROSS MARGIN VARIES BASED ON TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPENSE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AND WAS IMPACTED BY THE INCREASE IN COSTS ON GROWING STUDY VOLUME IN ADVANCE OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE INCREASE IN COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND SUPPLY EXPENSES RELATED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND STUDY VOLUME.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.4 MILLION  AND  $1.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $4.0 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $485,000  OR  13.7%  . THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND LAB SUPPLY EXPENSE AS WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO OFFER NEW PDX MODELS, EX-VIVO ASSAYS AND TO EXPAND OUR ENDPOINT ANALYSIS TESTING.  SALES AND MARKETING  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.3 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  48.7%  . SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $3.2 MILLION  AND  $2.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $1.0 MILLION  OR  47.6%  . THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS IS MAINLY DUE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR SALES FORCE AND COMMISSIONS EARNED.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.6 MILLION  AND  $1.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $400,000  , OR  27.2%  . THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES AS WELL AS A NON-RECURRING BAD DEBT WRITE-OFF. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $4.1 MILLION  AND  $3.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $807,000  OR  24.4%  . THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION, PROFESSIONAL FEES, AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN RECRUITING COSTS.  INFLATION  INFLATION DOES NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  21  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $360,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.6 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE OPERATING LOSS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND, A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $334,000 AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF APPROXIMATELY $913,000.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.7 MILLION  AND  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF LAB EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANY'S NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $378,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.4 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS DUE TO A DECREASE IN OPTION AND WARRANT EXERCISES DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO APPLY METHODOLOGIES AND MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE REALIZATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION (REPLACEMENT OF LICENSED TUMORS), VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, VALUATION OF GOODWILL, AND STOCK COMPENSATION AND WARRANT ASSUMPTIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

WE BEGAN OPERATIONS IN 1979 AND AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OPERATED 5,815 STORES IN THE U.S., 608 STORES IN MEXICO AND 38 STORES IN BRAZIL. EACH STORE CARRIES AN EXTENSIVE PRODUCT LINE FOR CARS, SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES, VANS AND LIGHT TRUCKS, INCLUDING NEW AND REMANUFACTURED AUTOMOTIVE HARD PARTS, MAINTENANCE ITEMS, ACCESSORIES AND  NON-AUTOMOTIVE  PRODUCTS. AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, IN 4,942 OF OUR DOMESTIC STORES, WE ALSO HAD A COMMERCIAL SALES PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES COMMERCIAL CREDIT AND PROMPT DELIVERY OF PARTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REPAIR GARAGES, DEALERS, SERVICE STATIONS AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTS. WE ALSO HAVE COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS IN STORES IN MEXICO AND BRAZIL. WE ALSO SELL THE ALLDATA BRAND AUTOMOTIVE DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR SOFTWARE THROUGH WWW.ALLDATA.COM AND WWW.ALLDATADIY.COM. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL AUTOMOTIVE HARD PARTS, MAINTENANCE ITEMS, ACCESSORIES AND  NON-AUTOMOTIVE  PRODUCTS THROUGH WWW.AUTOZONE.COM AND OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE PURCHASES THROUGH WWW.AUTOZONEPRO.COM. WE ALSO PROVIDE PRODUCT INFORMATION ON OUR DURALAST BRANDED PRODUCTS THROUGH WWW.DURALASTPARTS.COM. WE DO NOT DERIVE REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR OR INSTALLATION SERVICES.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE TWELVE AND TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE EXPECTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AUGUST 29, 2020. EACH OF THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR CONSISTS OF 12 WEEKS, AND THE FOURTH QUARTER CONSISTS OF 16 OR 17 WEEKS. THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 HAS 16 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2019 HAD 17 WEEKS. OUR BUSINESS IS SOMEWHAT SEASONAL IN NATURE, WITH THE HIGHEST SALES GENERALLY OCCURRING DURING THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER AND THE LOWEST SALES GENERALLY OCCURRING IN THE MONTHS OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  NET SALES WERE UP 2.6% FOR THE QUARTER DRIVEN BY NEW STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES (SALES FROM STORES OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR) OF (0.8%). DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED 8.2%, WHICH REPRESENTS 22% OF OUR TOTAL SALES. OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 2.0% TO $407.9 MILLION, WHILE NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED 1.6% OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR TO $299.3 MILLION. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 7.8% TO $12.39 PER SHARE FROM $11.49 PER SHARE IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  OUR BUSINESS IS IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS WITHIN THE ECONOMY THAT AFFECT BOTH OUR CONSUMER AND OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUEL COSTS, WAGE RATES AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THESE MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR FOR HOW LONG CERTAIN TRENDS WILL CONTINUE, NOR CAN WE PREDICT TO WHAT DEGREE THESE TRENDS WILL IMPACT US IN THE FUTURE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT OUTBREAK OF A NOVEL STRAIN OF THE CORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), WHICH ORIGINATED IN CHINA AND HAS SPREAD GLOBALLY, HAS LED TO ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE CREATED CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THOSE MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES BELIEVED TO BE AT RISK, INCLUDING THOSE SOURCED FROM CHINA AND ELSEWHERE, AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND UPDATE OUR PLANS AS CIRCUMSTANCES EVOLVE. WHILE WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS THUS FAR FROM THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT COVID-19 WILL HAVE DUE TO NUMEROUS UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, THE DURATION OF THE OUTBREAK, ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDINGLY, CONTINUED BUSINESS DISRUPTION RELATING TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR STORE HOURS AND OUR WORKFORCE AVAILABILITY AND MAY ALSO MAGNIFY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SOURCING QUALITY MERCHANDISE DOMESTICALLY AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT FAVORABLE PRICES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, FAILURE AND MAINTENANCE RELATED CATEGORIES REPRESENTED THE LARGEST PORTION OF OUR SALES MIX, AT APPROXIMATELY 85% OF TOTAL SALES WITH DISCRETIONARY MAKING UP THE REMAINING, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WITH FAILURE RELATED CATEGORIES CONTINUING TO BE THE LARGEST PORTION OF OUR SALES MIX. WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN OUR CATEGORY SALES MIX AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR. OUR SALES MIX CAN BE IMPACTED BY SEVERE OR UNUSUAL WEATHER OVER A SHORT-TERM PERIOD. OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF THE WEATHER ON OUR SALES MIX IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  THE TWO STATISTICS WE BELIEVE HAVE THE MOST POSITIVE CORRELATION TO OUR MARKET GROWTH OVER THE LONG-TERM ARE MILES DRIVEN AND THE NUMBER OF SEVEN YEAR OLD OR OLDER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WHILE OVER THE LONG-TERM WE HAVE SEEN A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN OUR NET SALES AND THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN TIME FRAMES OF MINIMAL CORRELATION IN SALES PERFORMANCE AND MILES DRIVEN. DURING THE PERIODS OF MINIMAL CORRELATION BETWEEN NET SALES AND MILES DRIVEN, WE BELIEVE NET SALES HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF SEVEN YEAR OLD OR OLDER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE U.S. LIGHT VEHICLE FLEET CONTINUES TO TREND IN OUR INDUSTRY\u2019S FAVOR. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AUTO CARE ASSOCIATION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, FOR THE 8  TH  CONSECUTIVE YEAR, THE AVERAGE AGE OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD HAS EXCEEDED 11 YEARS. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND THROUGH NOVEMBER 2019 (LATEST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION), MILES DRIVEN IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY FLAT.  TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020  COMPARED WITH TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019  NET SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED $63.1 MILLION TO $2.514 BILLION, OR 2.6%, OVER NET SALES OF $2.451 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL AUTO PARTS SALES INCREASED BY 2.6%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET SALES OF $56.5 MILLION FROM NEW STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES OF (0.8%). DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED $42.3 MILLION, OR 8.2%, TO $556.9 MILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $1.366 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.325 BILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 54.3% COMPARED TO 54.1% DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLY CHAIN LEVERAGE.  OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $958.1 MILLION, OR 38.1% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $925.1 MILLION, OR 37.7% OF NET SALES DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, WERE HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR WITH DELEVERAGE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOMESTIC STORE PAYROLL.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $44.3 MILLION COMPARED WITH $41.4 MILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE BORROWING LEVELS OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. AVERAGE BORROWINGS FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $5.464 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.119 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATES WERE 3.0% FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND 3.1% FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 17.7% OF PRETAX INCOME FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, AND 17.8% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED BY $4.6 MILLION TO $299.3 MILLION DUE TO THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY 7.8% TO $12.39 FROM $11.49 IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON CURRENT QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM STOCK REPURCHASES SINCE THE END OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS AN INCREASE OF $0.55.  TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020  COMPARED WITH TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019  NET SALES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED $214.4 MILLION TO $5.307 BILLION, OR 4.2%, OVER NET SALES OF $5.092 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL AUTO PARTS SALES INCREASED BY 4.2%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET SALES OF $106.6 MILLION FROM NEW STORES AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES OF 1.4%. DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED $116.9 MILLION, OR 11.0%, TO $1.178 BILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $2.867 BILLION, OR 54.0% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $2.743 BILLION, OR 53.9% OF NET SALES, DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLY CHAIN LEVERAGE.  OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $1.959 BILLION, OR 36.9% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $1.855 BILLION, OR 36.4% OF NET SALES. DELEVERAGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOMESTIC STORE PAYROLL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $88.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $80.4 MILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE BORROWING LEVELS OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. AVERAGE BORROWINGS FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $5.327 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.045 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATES WERE 3.1% FOR EACH OF THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 20.8% OF PRETAX INCOME FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, AND 20.0% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $16.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $25.2 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET INCOME FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED BY $3.6 MILLION TO $649.6 MILLION DUE TO THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY 6.9% TO $26.70 FROM $24.97 IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON CURRENT QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM STOCK REPURCHASES SINCE THE END OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS AN INCREASE OF $1.09.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH FLOWS REALIZED THROUGH THE SALE OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS, PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $651.6 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $817.1 MILLION PROVIDED DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  OUR NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $174.9 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $176.2 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $190.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $195.8 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE OPENED 50 NET NEW STORES. IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WE OPENED 39 NET NEW STORES. INVESTING CASH FLOWS WERE IMPACTED BY OUR WHOLLY OWNED CAPTIVE, WHICH PURCHASED $56.3 MILLION AND SOLD $70.8 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020. DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, THE CAPTIVE PURCHASED $21.1 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND SOLD $34.5 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES.  OUR NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $502.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $661.5 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY RESULTED IN $242.7 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER, AS COMPARED TO $103.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. STOCK REPURCHASES WERE $764.8 MILLION IN THE CURRENT TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD AS COMPARED WITH $847.1 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS PROVIDED $48.7 MILLION. IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS PROVIDED $107.6 MILLION.  DURING FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019. OUR INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO BE DIRECTED PRIMARILY TO NEW STORES, SUPPLY CHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING STORES. THE AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR NEW STORES IS IMPACTED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS, INCLUDING SUCH FACTORS AS WHETHER THE BUILDING AND LAND ARE PURCHASED (REQUIRING HIGHER INVESTMENT) OR LEASED (GENERALLY LOWER INVESTMENT), LOCATED IN THE U.S., MEXICO OR BRAZIL, OR LOCATED IN URBAN OR RURAL AREAS.  IN ADDITION TO THE BUILDING AND LAND COSTS, OUR NEW STORES REQUIRE WORKING CAPITAL, PREDOMINANTLY FOR INVENTORIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NEGOTIATED EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM SUPPLIERS, REDUCING THE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIRED AND RESULTING IN A HIGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO INVENTORY RATIO. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE LEVERAGING OUR INVENTORY PURCHASES; HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO DO SO MAY BE LIMITED BY OUR VENDORS\u2019 CAPACITY TO FACTOR THEIR RECEIVABLES FROM US. CERTAIN VENDORS PARTICIPATE IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEREBY THEY FACTOR THEIR RECEIVABLES FROM US, ALLOWING THEM TO RECEIVE PAYMENT ON OUR INVOICES AT A DISCOUNTED RATE. EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM OUR VENDORS HAVE ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE OUR HIGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO INVENTORY RATIO. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS INVENTORY, WAS 105.7% AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, COMPARED TO 108.5% AT FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENTS (EITHER IN THE FORM OF LEASED OR PURCHASED PROPERTIES OR ACQUISITIONS), WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL RELY PRIMARILY ON INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT A MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STOCK REPURCHASES. THE BALANCE MAY BE FUNDED THROUGH NEW BORROWINGS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS AND FAVORABLE EXPERIENCES IN THE DEBT MARKETS IN THE PAST.  FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR ADJUSTED  AFTER-TAX  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (\u201cROIC\u201d) WAS 35.3% AS COMPARED TO 33.5% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE USE ADJUSTED ROIC TO EVALUATE WHETHER WE ARE EFFECTIVELY USING OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR OVERALL OPERATING PERFORMANCE. REFER TO THE \u201cRECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF OUR CALCULATION.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT FACILITIES  WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER EXTENSION, NEW COMMITMENT AND AMENDMENT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 18, 2017 (THE \u201cEXTENSION AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 18, 2016, AS AMENDED, MODIFIED, EXTENDED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT: (I) OUR BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS INCREASED FROM $1.6 BILLION TO $2.0 BILLION; (II) OUR OPTION TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS \u201cREFRESHED\u201d AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH OPTION REMAINED AT $400 MILLION; (III) THE MAXIMUM BORROWING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY, AT OUR OPTION, SUBJECT TO LENDERS APPROVAL, BE INCREASED FROM $2.0 BILLION TO $2.4 BILLION; (IV) THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS EXTENDED FROM NOVEMBER 18, 2021 UNTIL NOVEMBER 18, 2022; AND (V) WE HAVE THE OPTION TO MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL WRITTEN REQUEST OF THE LENDERS TO EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE MAY BORROW FUNDS CONSISTING OF EURODOLLAR LOANS, BASE RATE LOANS OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. INTEREST ACCRUES ON EURODOLLAR LOANS AT A DEFINED EURODOLLAR RATE, DEFINED AS LIBOR PLUS THE APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, DEPENDING UPON OUR SENIOR, UNSECURED,  (NON-CREDIT  ENHANCED) LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. INTEREST ACCRUES ON BASE RATE LOANS AS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $3.2 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE ALSO MAINTAIN A LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO REQUEST THE PARTICIPATING BANK TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT ON OUR BEHALF UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $25 MILLION. THE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY IS IN ADDITION TO THE LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $25.0 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN JUNE 2022.  IN ADDITION TO THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER THE COMMITTED FACILITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAD $219.4 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020. THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT HAVE VARIOUS MATURITY DATES AND WERE ISSUED ON AN UNCOMMITTED BASIS.  ALL SENIOR NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO AN INTEREST RATE ADJUSTMENT IF THE DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED TO THE SENIOR NOTES ARE DOWNGRADED (AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS). FURTHER, THE SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE SENIOR NOTES MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS). OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN MINIMAL COVENANTS, PRIMARILY RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS. UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, COVENANTS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS, A MAXIMUM DEBT TO EARNINGS RATIO, A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND A CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISION THAT MAY REQUIRE ACCELERATION OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE ACCELERATED AND COME DUE PRIOR TO THE APPLICABLE SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE IF COVENANTS ARE BREACHED OR AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, THE $1.273 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND THE $500 MILLION 4.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2020 WERE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS WE HAD THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS THROUGH AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $1.997 BILLION OF AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR $2.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO REPLACE THESE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS WITH LONG-TERM FINANCING FACILITIES.  OUR ADJUSTED DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND RENT (\u201cEBITDAR\u201d) RATIO WAS 2.6:1 AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND WAS 2.5:1 AS OF FEBRUARY 9, 2019. WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED DEBT AS THE SUM OF TOTAL DEBT, FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AND RENT TIMES SIX; AND WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDAR BY ADDING INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, RENT, SHARE-BASED EXPENSE AND PENSION TERMINATION CHARGES TO NET INCOME. ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IS CALCULATED ON A TRAILING FOUR QUARTER BASIS. WE TARGET OUR DEBT LEVELS TO A RATIO OF ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DEBT LEVELS. TO THE EXTENT EBITDAR CONTINUES TO GROW IN FUTURE YEARS, WE EXPECT OUR DEBT LEVELS TO INCREASE; CONVERSELY, IF EBITDAR DECLINES, WE WOULD EXPECT OUR DEBT LEVELS TO DECREASE. REFER TO THE \u201cRECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF OUR CALCULATION.  STOCK REPURCHASES  FROM JANUARY 1, 1998 TO FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAVE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 147.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $22.188 BILLION, INCLUDING 669,967 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $764.8 MILLION DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020. ON OCTOBER 7, 2019, THE BOARD VOTED TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZATION BY $1.25 BILLION. THIS RAISED THE TOTAL VALUE OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE REPURCHASED TO $23.15 BILLION. CONSIDERING CUMULATIVE REPURCHASES AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $961.9 MILLION REMAINING UNDER THE BOARD\u2019S AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.  SUBSEQUENT TO FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 156,035 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $166.1 MILLION.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  SINCE OUR FISCAL YEAR END, WE HAVE CANCELLED, ISSUED AND MODIFIED  STAND-BY  LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT ARE PRIMARILY RENEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO COVER DEDUCTIBLE PAYMENTS TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR TOTAL  STAND-BY  LETTERS OF CREDIT COMMITMENT AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WAS $247.6 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $101.2 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019, AND OUR TOTAL SURETY BONDS COMMITMENT AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WAS $42.2 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $36.7 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019.  FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  RECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES NOT DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING OUR OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND ARE USED TO ASSIST MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING PERFORMANCE AND IN MAKING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS DECISIONS TO MAXIMIZE STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 VALUE.  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE USED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, OR CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANALYZING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, WE HAVE PRESENTED  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS WE BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS. FURTHERMORE, OUR MANAGEMENT AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD USE THE ABOVE MENTIONED  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS AND TO DETERMINE PAYMENTS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION. WE HAVE INCLUDED A RECONCILIATION OF THIS INFORMATION TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURES IN THE FOLLOWING RECONCILIATION TABLES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURE: ADJUSTED  AFTER-TAX  ROIC  THE FOLLOWING TABLES CALCULATE THE PERCENTAGES OF ADJUSTED ROIC FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 9, 2019.

THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL, IT MAY DILUTE OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN US.  \u2022  WE ARE INCORPORATED IN IRELAND AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT OR AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OVERVIEW  REVENUES ARE DRIVEN BY THE ABILITY OF OUR EXECUTIVES TO SECURE NEW CONTRACTS, TO RENEW AND EXTEND EXISTING CONTRACTS, AND TO DELIVER SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS THAT ADD VALUE RELEVANT TO OUR CLIENTS\u2019 CURRENT NEEDS AND CHALLENGES. THE LEVEL OF REVENUES WE ACHIEVE IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MARKET-LEADING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS AND TO DEPLOY SKILLED TEAMS OF PROFESSIONALS QUICKLY AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED THAT LEVEL OF VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY GLOBALLY AND HAS CREATED ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. WE ARE ACTIVELY MANAGING OUR BUSINESS TO RESPOND TO THE IMPACT.  THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN AND U.K. POUND. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  AS ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 13, 2020, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, WE BEGAN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS UNDER A NEW GROWTH MODEL THROUGH OUR THREE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHICH WILL BECOME OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE OUR FORM 8-K FILED ON JANUARY 13, 2020.  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONG, RESULTING IN GROWTH ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  , REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS, SOLID IN COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES AND MODEST IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE EXPERIENCED LOCAL CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS VERY STRONG IN GROWTH MARKETS AND NORTH AMERICA AND MODEST IN EUROPE. REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS STRONG IN BOTH OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  . WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINED COMPETITIVE, PRICING WAS RELATIVELY STABLE. WE USE THE TERM \u201cPRICING\u201d TO MEAN THE CONTRACT PROFITABILITY OR MARGIN ON THE WORK THAT WE SELL.  IN OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . CONSULTING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS, MODEST GROWTH IN RESOURCES AND COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND SLIGHT GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES.  OUR CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR DIGITAL-, CLOUD- AND SECURITY-RELATED SERVICES AND ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DELIVER COST SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO INTEGRATE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GROW AND TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES.  IN OUR OUTSOURCING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . OUTSOURCING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . OUTSOURCING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES AND STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE, COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMAND TO ASSIST CLIENTS WITH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DIGITAL-RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD ENABLEMENT. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING THEIR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENCY.  AS WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  1.0%  AND  1.4%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITHIN RECENT RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2020  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  1.5%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. WE HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HEADCOUNT, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH SERVE OUR CLIENTS, TO APPROXIMATELY  509,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , COMPARED  TO APPROXIMATELY  477,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS  14%  , DOWN FROM  15%  IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  PRELIMINARY  NOTE  ON  AUGUST 1, 2019, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY NDS, CLOSED ON ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENTS (THE \u201cAPAS\u201d)  FOR THE PURCHASE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE OPERATING ASSETS OF MEDISOURCE PARTNERS, LLC (\u201cMEDISOURCE\u201d) AND PANTHEON  MEDICAL - FOOT & ANKLE, LLC (\u201cPANTHEON\u201d).  WE  INTEND TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS, LLC\u2019S (\u201cNGDX\u201d, AS DEFINED BELOW) BUSINESS, AND ON THE BUSINESSES  OF REGENTYS, OLAREGEN AND THE MSO BUSINESS ACQUIRED FROM VENETO, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION TARGETS, BUT DO NOT INTEND  TO DISCONTINUE OUR HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT PURSUE OUR HISTORICAL BUSINESS IF WE DO NOT RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL  FINANCING FOR THAT PURPOSE.  OVERVIEW  OF BUSINESS  CORPORATE  HISTORY  GENEREX  IS BASED IN MIRAMAR, FLORIDA, WITH OFFICES IN DALLAS, TEXAS AND WELLESLEY, MASSACHUSETTS. THE COMPANY WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED  IN THE STATE OF DELAWARE ON SEPTEMBER 4, 1997, FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACQUIRING GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC., A CANADIAN (PROVINCE  OF ONTARIO) CORPORATION FORMED IN NOVEMBER 1995 TO ENGAGE IN PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND  OTHER ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. WAS COMPLETED IN OCTOBER 1997 IN A TRANSACTION  IN WHICH THE HOLDERS OF ALL OUTSTANDING SHARES OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. EXCHANGED THEIR SHARES FOR SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON  STOCK.  IN  JANUARY 1998, GENEREX PARTICIPATED IN A \u201cREVERSE ACQUISITION\u201d WITH GREEN MT. P.S., INC, (\u201cGREEN MT.\u201d),  AN INACTIVE IDAHO CORPORATION FORMED IN 1983. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE SHAREHOLDERS OF GENEREX (THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS  OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC.) ACQUIRED A MAJORITY (APPROXIMATELY 90%) OF THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF GREEN MT., AND GENEREX  BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GREEN MT.; GREEN MT. CHANGED ITS CORPORATE NAME TO GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (\"GENEREX  IDAHO\"), AND GENEREX CHANGED ITS CORPORATE NAME TO GBC - DELAWARE, INC. BECAUSE THE REVERSE ACQUISITION RESULTED IN GBC -  DELAWARE, INC. SHAREHOLDERS (FORMALLY GENEREX SHAREHOLDERS) BECOMING THE MAJORITY HOLDERS OF GENEREX IDAHO, GBC DELAWARE, INC.  WAS TREATED AS THE ACQUIRING CORPORATION IN THE TRANSACTION FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THUS, OUR, GBC - DELAWARE, INC. (FORMALLY  GENEREX), HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ESSENTIALLY REPRESENTED THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS  INC., WERE DEEMED TO BE THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GENEREX IDAHO.  28  IN  APRIL 1999, WE COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION IN WHICH GBC - DELAWARE, INC. MERGED WITH GENEREX IDAHO. IN THIS TRANSACTION, ALL OUTSTANDING  SHARES OF GENEREX IDAHO WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF GBC - DELAWARE, INC.; GENEREX IDAHO CEASED TO EXIST AS A SEPARATE ENTITY,  AND WE, GBC - DELAWARE, INC., CHANGED OUR CORPORATE NAME BACK TO \"GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION.\" THIS REORGANIZATION  DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR CURRENT FINANCIAL REPORTING.  FOLLOWING OUR  REORGANIZATION IN 1999, GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC., WHICH WAS INCORPORATED IN ONTARIO, CANADA, REMAINED AS OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY.  ALL OF OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED BY GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC.; GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. IS THE 100% OWNER OF  1097346 ONTARIO INC., WHICH WAS ALSO INCORPORATED IN ONTARIO, CANADA. IN AUGUST 2003, WE ACQUIRED  NUGENEREX IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY,  INC. (FORMERLY  ANTIGEN EXPRESS, INC.) (\u201cNGIO\u201d), A DELAWARE INCORPORATED COMPANY. ANTIGEN IS ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND IMMUNOMEDICINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT, INFECTIOUS, AUTOIMMUNE AND ALLERGIC DISEASES.  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 GENEREX ISSUED A DIVIDEND OF NGIO TO GENEREX SHAREHOLDERS IN THE AMOUNT OF 1 SHARE OF ANTIGEN FOR EVERY 4  SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK. GENEREX STILL MAINTAINS MAJORITY CONTROL OF NGIO.  WE  FORMED GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC., WHICH IS ORGANIZED IN BERMUDA, IN JANUARY 2001 IN CONNECTION WITH A JOINT VENTURE WITH ELAN INTERNATIONAL  SERVICES, LTD., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ELAN CORPORATION, PLC, (\u201cELAN\u201d) TO PURSUE THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN  OF OUR AND ELAN'S DRUG DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING OUR PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUCCAL DELIVERY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  IN DECEMBER 2004, WE AND ELAN AGREED TO TERMINATE THE JOINT VENTURE. UNDER THE TERMINATION AGREEMENT, WE RETAINED ALL OF OUR INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OBTAINED FULL OWNERSHIP OF GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC.; GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC. DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT ANY  BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INCORPORATED IN THE U.S. AND CANADA WHICH ARE DORMANT AND DO NOT CARRY ON  ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  ON  JANUARY 18, 2017, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, LLC (\u201cHDS\u201d). IN DECEMBER  2018, WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING INTEREST IN HDS. THE COMPANY, NOW A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GENEREX, HAS BEEN RENAMED NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS, LLC (NGDX), AND IS MANAGED BY PRESIDENT HAROLD HAINES, PHD.  ON  OCTOBER 3, 2018, OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS, LLC (\u201cNUGENEREX\u201d), ENTERED INTO AN  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cVENETO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH VENETO HOLDINGS, L.L.C. (\u201cVENETO\u201d),  PURSUANT TO WHICH NUGENEREX PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS OF VENETO AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE \u201cASSETS\u201d). THE VENETO ASSET  PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENT TERMS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND INDEMNIFICATION, AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY  PROVISIONS.  EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 3, 2018, NUGENEREX ASSIGNED THE VENETO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC.  THE  SOLE MEMBER OF NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC IS NUGENEREX MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GENEREX  BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION.  ALSO,  ON OCTOBER 3, 2018, WE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS FROM VENETO (THE \u201cFIRST CLOSING ASSETS\u201d), PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF THE  OPERATING ASSETS OF (A) SYSTEM DISPENSING PHARMACIES, (B) A CENTRAL ADJUDICATING PHARMACY, (C) A WHOLESALE PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING  COMPANY, AND (D) AN IN-NETWORK LABORATORY.  ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE CONSUMMATED THE ACQUISITION OF VENETO ASSETS (THE \u201cSECOND CLOSING ASSETS\u201d), CONSISTING PRIMARILY  OF VENETO\u2019S MANAGEMENT SERVICES ORGANIZATION BUSINESS AND OTHER ASSETS. THE AGGREGATE PRICE FOR THE FIRST CLOSING ASSETS  AND THE SECOND CLOSING ASSETS WAS $30,000,000. WE ISSUED A PROMISSORY NOTE IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $35,000,000 (THE \u201cNEW  NOTE\u201d) CONSISTING OF THE $30,000,000 PURCHASE PRICE AND A $5,000,000 ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, AS THE SOLE CONSIDERATION  PAYABLE ON THE SECOND CLOSING DATE.

REGENTYS IS DEVELOPING A NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR INFLAMMATORY  BOWEL DISEASES SUCH AS ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND CROHN\u2019S DISEASE.  ON  JANUARY 7, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN OLAREGEN THERAPEUTIX INC.

OLAREGEN IS LAUNCHING AN  FDA-510(K) CLEARED WOUND CARE PRODUCT.  ON  MAY 10, 2019, WE ACQUIRED FROM A THIRD PARTY THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IN OLAREGEN IN EXCHANGE FOR 4 MILLION SHARES  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, PLUS THE ISSUANCE OF A $2 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE INCREASING OUR INTEREST IN OLAREGEN TO  APPROXIMATELY 62% OF THE OLAREGEN\u2019S OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES.  ON AUGUST 16,  2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 900,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN OLAREGEN  FROM OTHER SHAREHOLDERS OF OLAREGEN IN EXCHANGE FOR 1,905,912 SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK AND 476,478 SHARES OF NGIO COMMON  STOCK WHICH INCREASED OUR INTEREST IN OLAREGEN TO APPROXIMATELY 77% OF THE OLAREGEN\u2019S OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES. IN SEPTEMBER  2019, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ALL OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF OLAREGEN INTO COMMON STOCK OF OLAREGEN.  ON  FEBRUARY 14, 2020, OLAREGEN EXCHANGED ALL OF ITS OUTSTANDING SHARES FOR 5,950,000 SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK AND 2,765,000  SHARES OF NGIO IN. AFTER THIS TRANSACTION, GENEREX OWNS 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLAREGEN.  HISTORICAL  BUSINESS  HISTORICALLY,  WE HAVE BEEN A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ORAL-LYN BUCCAL INSULIN SPRAY FOR DIABETES.  ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARY NGIO, WE HAVE A DEEP INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO OF IMMUNOTHERAPY ASSETS RELATING TO THE  \u201cII-KEY\u201d TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTIVATES THE IMMUNE RESPONSE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. WE HAVE  COMPLETED A PHASE IIB CLINICAL TRIAL OF AE37 IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC PEPTIDE VACCINE WITH THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY IN OVER 300 WOMEN WITH  BREAST CANCER.  IN  2017, WE ACQUIRED HDS (NOW NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS) AND THEIR DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OF RAPID POINT-OF-CARE EXPRESS TEST KITS  AND CASSETTES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING.  WE BELIEVE THAT  THESE LEGACY DIAGNOSTICS, DIABETES AND CANCER ASSETS ARE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE WHICH IS NOT BEING RECOGNIZED DUE TO MISSTEPS  IN THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BY PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT, RESULTING INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.  WE THINK THE PRODUCTS AND IP PORTFOLIO RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VALUE. A RECENTLY SIGNED CO-DEVELOPMENT DEAL WITH A MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY FOR AE37 IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER, AND A LICENSING DEAL IN CHINA FOR AE37 IN PROSTATE CANCER ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL  FOR AE37 IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINE. ADDITIONALLY, ORAL-LYN HAS BEEN REFORMULATED TO ENTER CLINICAL TRIALS FOR TYPE II DIABETES.  THE HDS EXPRESS DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EXPANDED WITH THE NEW, PATENT-PENDING EXPRESS II TECHNOLOGY AND A NEW PRODUCT PIPELINE.  WE FILLED OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ORDER FOR 40,000 UNITS OF ITS  NGDX -MALARIA PF/PV CASSETTE TEST KIT  TO  IMRES, BV, A NETHERLANDS-BASED MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, AND WAS RECENTLY GRANTED A CE MARK CERTIFICATION UNDER THE EUROPEAN  MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (MDD) FOR ITS THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY  ,  A RAPID POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC  ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SYPHILIS. AS PART OF THE REORGANIZATION PLAN, WE PLACED  OUR LEGACY ASSETS INTO SEPARATE SUBSIDIARIES UNDER THE NUGENEREX FAMILY OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS, NGIO, AND  NUGENEREX THERAPEUTICS (ORAL-LYN AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY). OUR STRATEGY IS TO SPIN OUT NGIO AS A SEPARATELY TRADED  PUBLIC COMPANY, TO REIGNITE THE ORAL-LYN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH A REFORMULATED BUCCAL INSULIN SPRAY, AND TO BUILD OUT THE DIAGNOSTICS  BUSINESS, AS DETAILED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS, HOWEVER THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC  OBJECTIVES.  30  TREATMENT  OF LEGACY ASSETS  GENEREX  AND ITS SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES HAVE EXTENSIVE PATENT PORTFOLIOS, WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FOR COMPOSITION OF MATTER, FORMULATION,  DESIGN, AND USE IN A NUMBER OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS, ACROSS MULTIPLE INDICATIONS. AS DESCRIBED, WE PLAN TO BUILD OUR LEGACY ASSETS  WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO SPIN-OUT SUCH ASSETS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO NUGENEREX SUBSIDIARY  COMPANIES IN AN EFFORT TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL UNREALIZED VALUE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR  THESE DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES IN MAJOR MARKETS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, DIABETES, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING.  \u2022  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS  : ORAL-LYN (BUCCAL INSULIN) AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY  \u2022  NUGENEREX  IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY.  PHASE II AE37 + KEYTRUDA IN TNBC; ANTIGEN EXPRESS (II-KEY), LICENSING,  PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTOR DIVIDEND PAID (1:4) FOR SPIN-OUT  \u2022  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS.  NGDX EXPRESS II RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS HOUSES THE LEGACY DIABETES ASSETS, ORAL-LYN AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BUCCAL  DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS APPLICATION TO MANY LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AND DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A CONVENIENT,  NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADMINISTER SUCH DRUGS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AS POSSIBLE  CANDIDATES FOR DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING CANNABINOID MEDICINES. TO THAT END WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH SCIENTUS  PHARMACEUTICALS FOR THE USE OF THE RAPIDMIST TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF CANNABINOIDS.  BUCCAL  DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS  OUR  BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES THE PREPARATION OF PROPRIETARY FORMULATIONS IN WHICH AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL AGENT IS PLACED  IN A SOLUTION WITH A COMBINATION OF ABSORPTION ENHANCERS AND OTHER EXCIPIENTS CLASSIFIED \u201cGENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE\u201d  (\"GRAS\") BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) WHEN USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIFIED QUANTITIES  AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. THE RESULTING FORMULATIONS ARE AEROSOLIZED WITH A PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE CHEMICAL PROPELLANT AND ARE ADMINISTERED  TO PATIENTS USING OUR PROPRIETARY RAPIDMISTTM BRAND METERED DOSE INHALER. THE DEVICE IS A SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, HAND-HELD,  EASY-TO-USE AEROSOL APPLICATOR COMPRISED OF A CONTAINER FOR THE FORMULATION, A METERED DOSE VALVE, AN ACTUATOR AND DUST CAP. USING  THE DEVICE, PATIENTS SELF-ADMINISTER THE FORMULATIONS BY SPRAYING THEM INTO THE MOUTH. THE DEVICE CONTAINS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS,  THE NUMBER BEING DEPENDENT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON THE CONCENTRATION OF THE FORMULATION. ABSORPTION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AGENT  OCCURS IN THE BUCCAL CAVITY, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE INNER CHEEK WALLS. IN CLINICAL STUDIES OF OUR FLAGSHIP ORAL INSULIN PRODUCT  GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM, INSULIN ABSORPTION IN THE BUCCAL CAVITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS AND SAFE.  BUCCAL  INSULIN PRODUCT \u2013 GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  INSULIN  IS A HORMONE THAT IS NATURALLY SECRETED BY THE PANCREAS TO REGULATE THE LEVEL OF GLUCOSE, A TYPE OF SUGAR, IN THE BLOODSTREAM.  THE TERM \u201cDIABETES\u201d REFERS TO A GROUP OF DISORDERS THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE INABILITY OF THE BODY TO PROPERLY  REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. WHEN GLUCOSE IS ABUNDANT, IT IS CONVERTED INTO FAT AND STORED FOR USE WHEN FOOD IS NOT AVAILABLE.  WHEN GLUCOSE IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM FOOD, THESE FACTS ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO FREE FATTY ACIDS THAT STIMULATE GLUCOSE PRODUCTION.  INSULIN ACTS BY STIMULATING THE USE OF GLUCOSE AS FUEL AND BY INHIBITING THE PRODUCTION OF GLUCOSE. IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL, A  BALANCE IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN INSULIN SECRETION AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM.  31  ACCORDING  TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC), THERE ARE TWO MAJOR TYPES OF DIABETES. TYPE 1 DIABETES (JUVENILE ONSET DIABETES OR INSULIN  DEPENDENT DIABETES) REFERS TO THE CONDITION WHERE THE PANCREAS PRODUCES LITTLE OR NO INSULIN. TYPE 1 DIABETES ACCOUNTS FOR 5-10  PERCENT OF DIABETES CASES (CDC). IT OFTEN OCCURS IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. TYPE 1 DIABETICS MUST TAKE DAILY INSULIN INJECTIONS,  TYPICALLY THREE TO FIVE TIMES PER DAY, TO REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PROVIDES A NEEDLE-FREE MEANS  OF DELIVERING INSULIN FOR THESE PATIENTS.  ACCORDING  TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (ADULT ONSET OR NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS), THE BODY DOES  NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH INSULIN, OR CANNOT PROPERLY USE THE INSULIN PRODUCED. TYPE 2 DIABETES IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF THE DISEASE  AND ACCOUNTS FOR 90-95 PERCENT OF DIABETES CASES, ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION TO INSULIN THERAPY,  TYPE 2 DIABETICS MAY TAKE ORAL DRUGS THAT STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF INSULIN BY THE PANCREAS OR THAT HELP THE BODY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY  USE INSULIN. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PROVIDES A SIMPLE MEANS OF DELIVERING NEEDED INSULIN TO THIS MAJOR COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS.  STUDIES  IN DIABETES HAVE IDENTIFIED A CONDITION CLOSELY RELATED TO AND PRECEDING DIABETES, CALLED IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT). PEOPLE  WITH IGT DO NOT USUALLY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES MELLITUS. THEY HAVE NORMAL FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS BUT  TWO HOURS AFTER A MEAL THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IS FAR ABOVE NORMAL. WITH THE INCREASE USE OF GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TESTS THE NUMBER  OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH THIS PRE-DIABETIC CONDITION IS EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY. PER THE 2017 DIABETES ATLAS UPDATE, PUBLISHED  BY THE INTERNATIONAL DIABETES FEDERATION (IDF), APPROXIMATELY 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 425 MILLION  PEOPLE WORLD-WIDE SUFFER FROM IGT. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION TO PROVIDING MEAL-TIME INSULIN TO THE MILLIONS  OF IGT SUFFERERS. THIS THERAPEUTIC AREA IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED.  THERE  IS NO KNOWN CURE FOR DIABETES. THE IDF ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY 382 MILLION DIABETICS WORLDWIDE PER THEIR  2017 DIABETES ATLAS UPDATE AND IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT OVER 592 MILLION PEOPLE BY THE YEAR 2035. THERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER  37 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM DIABETES IN NORTH AMERICA ALONE AND DIABETES IS THE SECOND LARGEST CAUSE OF DEATH BY DISEASE  IN NORTH AMERICA.  A  SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS (  I.E.  , DRUGS COMPOSED OF MOLECULES WITH A HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND FAIRLY COMPLEX  AND LARGE SPATIAL ORIENTATION) HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES OR ARE PRESENTLY UNDERGOING CLINICAL TRIALS AS  PART OF THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN SUCH APPROVAL, INCLUDING VARIOUS PROTEINS, PEPTIDES, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, HORMONES AND VACCINES.  UNLIKE SMALL MOLECULE DRUGS, WHICH GENERALLY CAN BE ADMINISTERED BY VARIOUS METHODS, LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN  ADMINISTERED PREDOMINATELY BY INJECTION. THE PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THIS HAVE BEEN THE VULNERABILITY OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS TO  DIGESTION AND THE RELATIVELY LARGE SIZE OF THE MOLECULE ITSELF, WHICH MAKES ABSORPTION INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THROUGH THE SKIN  INEFFICIENT OR INEFFECTIVE. THE RAPIDMIST TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A RECOGNIZED AND PROVEN DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE DELIVERY OF  LARGE MOLECULES DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM WITH THE ATTENDANT ADVANTAGES.  ORAL-LYN  HISTORY  IN  MAY 2005, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE ECUADORIAN MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKETING AND SALE OF GENEREX  ORAL-LYNTM FOR TREATMENT OF TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION OF A  TURNKEY GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PRODUCTION OPERATION AT THE FACILITIES OF PHARMABRAND IN QUITO, ECUADOR. THE FIRST COMMERCIAL  PRODUCTION RUN OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM IN ECUADOR WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2006. WHILE ECUADOR PRODUCTION CAPABILITY MAY BE SUFFICIENT  TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SOUTH AMERICA, IT IS BELIEVED TO BE INSUFFICIENT FOR WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION FOR FUTURE COMMERCIAL SALES AND  CLINICAL TRIALS.  ON  THE BASIS OF THE TEST RESULTS IN ECUADOR AND OTHER PRE-CLINICAL DATA, WE MADE AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (\u201cIND\u201d)  SUBMISSION TO HEALTH CANADA (CANADA'S EQUIVALENT TO THE FDA) IN JULY 1998, AND RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE CANADIAN REGULATORS  TO PROCEED WITH CLINICAL TRIALS IN SEPTEMBER 1998. WE FILED AN IND APPLICATION WITH THE FDA IN OCTOBER 1998, AND RECEIVED FDA  APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH HUMAN TRIALS IN NOVEMBER 1998.  WE  BEGAN OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES IN JANUARY 1999. BETWEEN JANUARY 1999 AND SEPTEMBER 2000, WE  CONDUCTED CLINICAL TRIALS OF OUR INSULIN FORMULATION INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 200 SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES AND  HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. THE STUDY PROTOCOLS IN MOST TRIALS INVOLVED ADMINISTRATION OF TWO DIFFERENT DOSES OF OUR INSULIN FORMULATION  FOLLOWING EITHER A LIQUID SUSTACAL MEAL OR A STANDARD MEAL CHALLENGE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THESE STUDIES WAS TO EVALUATE OUR INSULIN  FORMULATION'S EFFICACY IN CONTROLLING POST-PRANDIAL (MEAL RELATED) GLUCOSE LEVELS. THESE TRIALS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR INSULIN  FORMULATION CONTROLLED POST-PRANDIAL HYPERGLYCEMIA IN A MANNER COMPARABLE TO INJECTED INSULIN. IN APRIL 2003, A PHASE II-B CLINICAL  TRIAL PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED IN CANADA. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A CLINICAL TRIAL APPLICATION RELATING TO OUR GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  PROTOCOL FOR LATE-STAGE TRIALS WAS APPROVED BY HEALTH CANADA. THE FDA\u2019S REVIEW PERIOD FOR THE PROTOCOL LAPSED WITHOUT OBJECTION  IN JULY 2007.  32  IN  LATE APRIL 2008, WE INITIATED PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS IN NORTH AMERICA FOR GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM WITH THE FIRST SUBJECT SCREENING  IN TEXAS. OTHER CLINICAL SITES PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY WERE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES (TEXAS, MARYLAND, MINNESOTA AND CALIFORNIA),  CANADA (ALBERTA), EUROPEAN UNION (ROMANIA, POLAND AND BULGARIA), EASTERN EUROPE (RUSSIA AND UKRAINE),) AND ECUADOR. APPROXIMATELY  450 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM AT APPROXIMATELY 70 CLINICAL SITES AROUND THE WORLD. THE PHASE III PROTOCOL CALLED FOR  A SIX-MONTH TRIAL WITH A SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM AND  THE RAPIDMISTTM DIABETES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH THAT OF STANDARD REGULAR INJECTABLE HUMAN INSULIN THERAPY AS MEASURED BY  HBA1C, IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE-1 DIABETES MELLITUS. THE FINAL SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL IN AUGUST 2011. AFTER APPROPRIATE VALIDATION,  THE DATA FROM APPROXIMATELY 450 PATIENTS WAS TABULATED, REVIEWED AND ANALYZED. THOSE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE III TRIAL ALONG WITH  A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSES OF APPROXIMATELY 40 PRIOR ORAL-LYN CLINICAL STUDIES WERE COMPILED AND SUBMITTED  TO THE FDA IN LATE DECEMBER 2011 IN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE INCLUDING A COMPOSITE METANALYSIS OF ALL SAFETY DATA. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY  PLAN TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS OF ORAL-LYNTM UNTIL AFTER SUCH TIME THAT WE SECURE ADDITIONAL  FINANCING. HOWEVER, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A FORMULATION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK AT THE UNIVERSITY  OF TORONTO AND THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH, ONTARIO TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INSULIN REACHING THE BLOOD STREAM. WE BELIEVE THAT  THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM AN ANIMAL STUDY ARE ENCOURAGING,  IN  THE PAST, WE ENGAGED A GLOBAL CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE MANY STUDY RELATED SITE SERVICES, INCLUDING INITIATION,  COMMUNICATION WITH SITES, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTATION; A GLOBAL CENTRAL LAB SERVICE COMPANY TO ARRANGE FOR THE LOGISTICS  OF KITS AND BLOOD SAMPLES SHIPMENT AND TESTING; AN INTERNET-BASED CLINICAL ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO ASSIST US WITH  GLOBAL DATA ENTRY, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND DATA STORAGE/PROCESSING OF THE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL AND REGULATORY PROCESSES. IN  THE PAST, WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF THE RAPIDMISTTM COMPONENTS,  THE INSULIN, AND THE RAW MATERIAL EXCIPIENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CLINICAL TRIAL BATCHES OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM.  FUTURE  PLANS  WE  HAVE REFORMULATED THE ORIGINAL ORAL-LYN BUCCAL INSULIN AS A NEW PATENTABLE ORAL-LYN 2 THAT REQUIRES ONLY 2 - 3 PRE-PRANDIAL (BEFORE  MEAL) SPRAYS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES. THE REFORMULATED ORAL-LYN 2 WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY NEW TECHNIQUES IN PROTEIN  CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION SCIENCE, THAT WITH MINIMAL CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND CONTENT OF THE COMPONENTS,  ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND IMPROVED, CONCENTRATED INSULIN FORMULATION FOR IMPROVED DIABETES MANAGEMENT.  NUGENEREX  HAS ENGAGED THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\u2019S CENTER FOR MOLECULAR DESIGN AND PRE-FORMULATIONS (CMDP) THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH  NETWORK WITH THE GOAL OF ENHANCING THE ORAL-LYNTM 2 FORMULATION TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO PATIENTS AND PROSPECTIVE COMMERCIALIZATION  PARTNERS BY INCREASING THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF INSULIN IN THE PRODUCT AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SPRAYS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE  PRANDIAL METABOLIC CONTROL FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF NUGENEREX CONSULTANT DR. LAKSHMI P. KOTRA, B.PHARM.  (HONS), PH.D., OF CMDP, PRELIMINARY EFFORTS SUCCEEDED IN INCREASING THE INSULIN CONCENTRATION IN THE PRODUCT BY APPROXIMATELY  400 - 500% AS CONFIRMED BY A VARIETY OF  IN VITRO  TESTING PROCEDURES, WHILE PRESERVING THE SOLUBILITY, STABILITY,  BIOLOGIC ACTIVITY, AND POTENCY OF THE INSULIN IN THE FORMULATION.  NUGENEREX  SUBSEQUENTLY ENTERED INTO A RESEARCH SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH PURSUANT TO WHICH DR. DANA ALLEN, DVM, MSC.  AND DR. RON JOHNSON, DVM, PH.D. OF THE ONTARIO VETERINARY COLLEGE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH CONDUCTED A STUDY OF THE RELATIVE  BIOAVAILABILITY OF THE ENHANCED FORMULATION IN DOGS IN THE UNIVERSITY\u2019S COMPARATIVE CLINICAL RESEARCH FACILITY. THE UNIVERSITY  HAD PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED THE STUDIES OF THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, SAFETY, AND  TOXICITY.  33  IN  THE NEW STUDIES, THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM 2 FORMULATION WAS COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION IN A BLINDED,  PARALLEL CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING FASTED, AWAKE, HEALTHY MATURE BEAGLE DOGS. EACH DOG RECEIVED THREE SPRAYS OF EITHER THE ENHANCED  FORMULATION OR THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION. EACH DOG WAS OBSERVED WITH ASSESSMENTS OF SERUM INSULIN AND GLUCOSE MEASURED OVER A TWO-HOUR  PERIOD. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE ANIMALS.  IN  THE DOGS GIVEN THE ENHANCED GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FORMULATION (5X), THERE WAS A GREATER THAN 20-FOLD INCREASE IN SERUM INSULIN  AT 15 MINUTES  (EXCLUDING ONE DOG WHO HAD LITTLE RESPONSE AT ANY TIME POINT; (WITH DOG INCLUDED IT WAS GREATER THAN 5-FOLD))  AND  ALMOST 500% GREATER ABSORPTION OF INSULIN OVER THE TWO-HOUR TEST PERIOD COMPARED TO DOGS GIVEN THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION (1X).  THERE WAS A 33% DECREASE IN SERUM GLUCOSE AT 30 MINUTES IN DOGS TREATED WITH THE ENHANCED GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FORMULATION,  COMPARED TO A 12% INCREASE IN SERUM GLUCOSE IN DOGS TREATED WITH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.  THE  RESULTS OF THE DOG STUDIES COUPLED WITH THE POSITIVE FINDINGS FROM THE  IN VITRO  WORK PROVIDE SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE  TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REMAINING CLINICAL AND REGULATORY WORK NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE FDA APPROVAL OF THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  FORMULATION THROUGH A 505(B)2 NDA.  THE  COMBINED RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM 2 WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED BY PEOPLE WITH EITHER  TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AS A SAFE, SIMPLE, FAST, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PRE-PRANDIAL INSULIN INJECTIONS  WITH DOSING OF ONLY TWO TO FOUR SPRAYS REQUIRED BEFORE MEALS.  THE  ORAL-LYN SAFETY DATABASE CONTAINS INFORMATION ON 1,496 SUBJECTS. EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-NINE (869) SUBJECTS WERE EXPOSED TO ORAL-LYN,  WHILE 627 SERVED AS CONTROL SUBJECTS AND WERE EXPOSED TO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMICS, INJECTED INSULIN, OR  ORAL-LYN PLACEBO. THERE WERE 695 SUBJECTS IN PK/PD STUDIES (368, ORAL-LYN; 327, CONTROL) AND 801 SUBJECTS IN EFFICACY TRIALS (501,  ORAL-LYN; 300, CONTROL).  TWO  HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO (272) ORAL-LYN SUBJECTS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (132 IN PK/PD STUDIES; 140 IN EFFICACY STUDIES)  WHILE 278 CONTROL SUBJECTS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (111 IN PK/PD STUDIES; 167 IN EFFICACY STUDIES). WITH RESPECT TO  ADVERSE EVENTS BY MAXIMUM SEVERITY THERE APPEARED TO BE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORAL-LYN AND THE CONTROL GROUPS IN  EITHER THE EFFICACY OR THE PK STUDIES.  IN  SUMMARY, THERE APPEAR TO BE NO INDICATIONS OF ANY SIGNIFICANT UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS. THE EXPECTED EVENTS OF HYPOESTHESIA ORAL,  THROAT IRRITATION, DRY THROAT, AND COUGH WERE FOR THE MOST PART MILD AND COULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORAL-LYN THERAPY ESPECIALLY  DURING THE LEARNING PHASE OF ADMINISTRATION. THERE WAS AN INDICATION OF OVERLAP OF SOME OF THESE EVENTS WITH MULTIPLE EVENT TERMS  IN THE CONSTELLATION OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION THAT APPEARED TO BE BALANCED ACROSS THERAPY GROUPS.  OUR  STRATEGY IS TO REVITALIZE OUR DIABETES PROGRAM BY ADVANCING THE REFORMULATED BUCCAL SPRAY ORAL-LYN 2 FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE  II DIABETES, AND TO INTEGRATE ORAL-LYN 2 THERAPY INTO OUR END-TO-END SOLUTION FOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT THROUGH OUR MSO MODEL.  BEYOND  ORAL-LYN 2 FOR TYPE II DIABETES, NUGENEREX DRUG DELIVERY SOLUTIONS WILL ADVANCE THE RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH  ADDITIONAL SMALL AND LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS WHICH WILL BENEFIT FROM AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION.  NUGENEREX  IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY (NGIO, FORMERLY ANTIGEN EXPRESS)  NGIO IS DEVELOPING  IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS AND VACCINES BASED ON OUR PROPRIETARY, PATENTED PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY, II-KEY. THE II-KEY IS A PEPTIDE  DERIVED FROM THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC) CLASS II ASSOCIATED INVARIANT CHAIN (II) THAT REGULATES THE FORMATION,  TRAFFICKING, AND ANTIGEN-PRESENTING FUNCTIONS OF MHC CLASS II COMPLEXES, ESSENTIAL FOR THE ACTIVATION OF T CELLS IN THE IMMUNE  RESPONSE. T CELLS RECOGNIZE ANTIGENIC EPITOPES WHEN THEY ARE 'PRESENTED' TO THEM BY SPECIFIC MOLECULES, TERMED (MHC) ON THE SURFACE  OF INFECTED OR MALIGNANT CELLS. THIS INTERACTION ACTIVATES THE T CELLS, STIMULATING A MULTICELLULAR CASCADE OF ACTIONS THAT ELIMINATES  THE DISEASED CELL AND PROTECTS AGAINST FUTURE DISEASE RECURRENCE.  34  WHEN  THE II-KEY PEPTIDE IS LINKED TO AN ANTIGENIC EPITOPE, IT CAN BIND TO MHC CLASS II MOLECULES, DISPLACING RESIDENT ANTIGENS FROM  THE ANTIGEN BINDING GROOVE, ESSENTIALLY 'HIJACKING' THE MHC CLASS II COMPLEX TO PRESENT THE II-KEY EPITOPE TO SELECTIVELY ACTIVATE  T-CELL TH1 RESPONSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE INTENSITY AND DURATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE.  NGION HAS DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF II-KEY HYBRID PEPTIDES FOR THE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC TARGETING OF TUMOR ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS  (TAAS) IN CANCER AND FOR VACCINES AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  II-KEY  HYBRID PEPTIDES CAN ALSO BE USED TO SELECTIVELY ACTIVATE TH2 RESPONSES AND THEREBY INDUCE TOLERANCE TO ANTIGENS INVOLVED IN HARMFUL  IMMUNE REACTIONS, E.G. AUTOIMMUNITY, ALLERGY, AND TRANSPLANT REJECTION.  AE37  \u2013 II-KEY/HER2/NEU HYBRID IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINE  OUR  MOST ADVANCED IMMUNOTHERAPY VACCINE IS AE37, AN  II-KEY-HYBRID MOLECULE  THAT CONTAINS THE HER2/NEU ANTIGENIC PEPTIDE  LINKED TO THE II-KEY TO ENHANCE IMMUNE STIMULATION AGAINST HER2, WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN NUMEROUS CANCERS, INCLUDING BREAST, PROSTATE,  AND BLADDER CANCERS. WE HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL OF AE37 IN BREAST CANCER: A PHASE IB SAFETY AND IMMUNOLOGY STUDY  OF AE37 AND GM-CSF IN 16 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAD COMPLETED ALL FIRST-LINE THERAPIES AND WHO WERE DISEASE-FREE AT THE TIME  OF ENROLLMENT TO THE STUDY  (HOLMES ET AL. RESULTS OF THE FIRST PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE NOVEL II-KEY HYBRID PREVENTIVE  HER-2/NEU PEPTIDE (AE37) VACCINE. J CLIN ONCOL 2008;26:3426-33)  . FURTHERMORE, WE COMPLETED A PHASE IIB TRIAL OF AE37 IN THE  PREVENTION OF CANCER RECURRENCE IN WOMEN WHO WERE AT HIGH RISK OF RECURRENCE AFTER UNDERGOING SUCCESSFUL PRIMARY STANDARD OF CARE  BREAST CANCER THERAPIES AND WERE DISEASE FREE AT TIME OF ENROLLMENT. THOUGH THE STUDY ENROLLED 300 SUBJECTS, THE RESULTS WERE  NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DUE TO A COMPLETE LACK OF RECURRENCE IN THE 160 WOMEN WITH HER2-3+ POSITIVE TUMORS WHO WERE TREATED  WITH HERCEPTIN DURING PRIMARY THERAPY. THOUGH THE TRIAL WAS NOT POWERED TO EVALUATE THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE IN SUBGROUPS,  THE TRIAL INDICATED EFFICACY IN THE SUBSET OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HER2 1+, 2+, AND TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER.  BASED  ON THE RESULTS FROM THIS TRIAL, NUGENEREX HAS ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT WITH MERCK SHARPE & DOHME B.V. (MERCK)  AND THE NATIONAL SURGICAL ADJUVANT BREAST AND PROSTATE PROGRAM (NSABP) TO CONDUCT A PHASE II TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY  AND EFFICACY OF AE37 IN COMBINATION WITH THE ANTI-PD-1 THERAPY, KEYTRUDA (PEMBROLIZUMAB) IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC TRIPLE-NEGATIVE  BREAST CANCER. THE TRIAL BEGAN ENROLLING PATIENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  IN  ADDITION TO THE BREAST CANCER PROGRAM, NUGENEREX HAS CONDUCTED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN PROSTATE CANCER, ENROLLING THIRTY-TWO  HER-2/NEU+, CASTRATE-SENSITIVE, AND CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND STRONG IMMUNOLOGICAL  RESPONSE TO AE37. WE ARE ADVANCING AE37 FOR THE TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER THROUGH A LICENSING AND RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH  SHENZHEN BIOSCIEN  PHARMACEUTICALS CO., LTD. (\u201cSHENZHEN\u201d), FOR WHICH NUGENEREX HAS RECEIVED A $700,000 UPFRONT  PAYMENT, WITH ADDITIONAL FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS.  IN  EXCHANGE FOR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO AE37 FOR PROSTATE CANCER IN CHINA, SHENZHEN IS FINANCING AND CONDUCTING THE PHASE II TRIALS IN  THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PHASE III TRIALS GLOBALLY UNDER INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON HARMONISATION (\u201cICH\u201d) GUIDELINES,  WITH NUGENEREX RETAINING THE RIGHTS TO ALL CLINICAL DATA FOR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS AND COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE REST OF THE WORLD  OUTSIDE CHINA.  FUTURE  PLANS  NGIO HAS BEEN  ESTABLISHED TO NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE THE NGIO CORE TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO TO EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO IN THE FIELD OF IMMUNOTHERAPY AND  PERSONALIZED MEDICINE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND ACQUISITIONS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ARE PLANNING TO SPIN-OUT NGIO AS A SEPARATE,  PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITY TO UNLOCK THE TRUE VALUE OF THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS AS IT CREATES A PURE PLAY IN IMMUNOTHERAPY,  WHICH WILL FOSTER INVESTMENT AND COLLABORATION.  AS  AN INITIAL STEP IN ACCOMPLISHING THE SPIN-OUT OF NGIO, ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE ISSUED A STOCK DIVIDEND TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WHEREBY  OUR SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1 SHARE OF NGIO FOR EVERY 4 SHARES OF OUR STOCK HELD ON THE DIVIDEND DATE. THE STOCK DIVIDENDS WILL  ENABLE OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE POTENTIALLY PROMISING FUTURE OF NGIO, WHILE CREATING A LARGE SHAREHOLDER  BASE WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY IMMEDIATELY UPON SPIN-OUT TO A NATIONAL EXCHANGE, WHICH WILL PROVIDE NGIO WITH  READY ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FINANCE ITS ON-GOING CLINICAL AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES.  35  ADDITIONALLY,  WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIPLE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES  TO AUGMENT THE NGIO DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.  ON FEBRUARY  28, 2020, THE COMPANY SIGNED A CONTRACT FROM THE CHINA TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, BEIJING ZHONGHUA INVESTMENT FUND MANAGEMENT CO., LTD.,  AND SINOTEK-ADVOCATES INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (SHENZHEN) CO., LTD. TO DEVELOP A COVID-19 VACCINE USING THE II-KEY PEPTIDE  VACCINE PLATFORM OF NUGENEREX IMMUNE-ONCOLOGY (NGIO). THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT INCLUDE AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $1 MILLION TO INITIATE  THE PROJECT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES, A $5 MILLION LICENSING FEE FOR THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY, PAYMENT BY THE CHINESE CONSORTIUM  FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COVID-19 VACCINE, AND A SUBSTANTIAL ROYALTY ON EACH DOSE OF VACCINE  PRODUCED.  UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENT, GENEREX WILL GENERATE A SERIES OF II-KEY PEPTIDES LINKED WITH NCOV-2019 CORONAVIRUS EPITOPES, AS PREDICTED BY  PROPRIETARY COMPUTER ALGORITHMS AND DELIVER THEM TO OUR PARTNERS IN CHINA FOR TESTING AGAINST BLOOD SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WHO HAVE  RECOVERED FROM COVID-19. THIS SCREENING PROGRAM SHOULD YIELD DATA INDICATING WHICH II-KEY-NCOV EPITOPES ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE HUMAN  IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND THEREFORE ARE POTENTIAL PEPTIDE VACCINE CANDIDATES. ONCE THE MOST REACTIVE PEPTIDES ARE IDENTIFIED, THE GROUP  PLANS TO MANUFACTURE MULTI-VALENT II-KEY PEPTIDE VACCINES FOR EVALUATION IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS IN CHINA. WHEN THE OPTIMAL VACCINE  FORMULATION IS DETERMINED, GENEREX INTENDS TO INITIATE THE REQUISITE CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE II-KEY-NCOV PEPTIDE VACCINE FOR APPROVAL  IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE FINALIZED OUR CORPORATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND HAVE INITIATED THE SPIN-OUT  PROCESS FOR NGIO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS (FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS LLC)  OUR  WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS (FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS LLC OR HDS) IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING,  MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING RAPID POINT-OF-CARE IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THESE ARE COMMONLY REFERRED  AS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS (\u201cRDTS\u201d). WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL RDTS BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY EXPRESS PLATFORMS  AS WELL AS STANDARD \u201cCASSETTE\u201d DEVICES.  SINCE  ITS FOUNDING, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AN EXPANDING LINE OF RDTS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE  DIAGNOSIS. THESE INCLUDE PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA, HEPATITIS B, HEPATITIS C, SYPHILIS,  AND OTHERS. THESE ASSAYS ARE ALL QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND PROVIDE A SIMPLE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT DIRECTLY AT THE CLINICAL  SITE. THEY CAN BE USED FOR DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS, TRIAGE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ASSAYS DEPENDING ON WHICH DISEASE IS BEING  CONSIDERED.  EACH  DEVICE INCORPORATES A TEST STRIP CONTAINING REAGENT LINES (STRIPES) THAT HAVE BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES  THAT DETECT THE TARGET MOLECULES SPECIFIC TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE. THE TEST STRIPS ARE INCORPORATED INTO OUR PROPRIETARY EXPRESS  PLATFORMS WHICH ARE EASY-TO-USE AND USER-FRIENDLY DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES. THERE ARE TWO EXPRESS PLATFORMS; THE EXPRESS AND THE EXPRESS  II. THE EXPRESS II IS AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL EXPRESS AND ITS USE INVOLVES FEWER OPERATOR STEPS, MAKING IT OF HIGHER  CLINICAL UTILITY VALUE. THE EXPRESS II PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MEDICAL SETTINGS  AND FOR DIRECT USE BY CONSUMERS IN THE HOME. IT IS SIMPLE TO USE, WITH FEWER STEPS OF OPERATION THAN OTHER RAPID POINT-OF-CARE  TESTS. A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD TAKEN BY A SIMPLE FINGER STICK IS ADDED DIRECTLY TO THE DEVICE AND THE ASSAY IS ACTIVATED BY PLACING  A POD OF BUFFER SOLUTION ONTO THE DEVICE. RESULTS CAN BE READ IN AS EARLY AS 5 MINUTES, AND NO LONGER THAN 30 MINUTES. THE ACCURACY  OF THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY IS EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN STANDARD LABORATORY ASSAYS FOR SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES WITH  SENSITIVITIES AND SPECIFICITIES OF OVER 99%.  WE  BELIEVE THAT EACH SYSTEM DELIVERS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES WHICH ENHANCE THE USE, APPLICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF EACH DIAGNOSTIC. THIS  EASE OF USE IN THE EXPRESS DELIVERY SYSTEMS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR RDTS PERFORM EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING  THE MOST ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE TEST RESULTS AVAILABLE WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, MINIMIZING THE TRANSFERENCE OF A POTENTIALLY  INFECTED BLOOD SAMPLE. THE EXPRESS AND CASSETTE DIAGNOSTIC KITS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING ARE DESIGNED FOR USE IN RESOURCE-POOR  COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, WHERE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COORDINATES POPULATION SCREENING  FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. WE RECENTLY FILLED OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ORDER FOR 40,000 UNITS OF ITS  NGDX -MALARIA  PF/PV CASSETTE TEST KIT  TO IMRES, BV, A NETHERLANDS-BASED MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS WAS RECENTLY GRANTED A CE MARK CERTIFICATION UNDER THE EUROPEAN MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (MDD) FOR ITS THE EXPRESS  II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY  ,  A RAPID POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES IN PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY SYPHILIS. THE ASSAY IS BASED UPON NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTIC\u2019S INNOVATIVE PATENT PENDING POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC  PLATFORM, THE EXPRESS II. THE ACCURACY OF THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY IS EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN STANDARD LABORATORY  ASSAYS FOR SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES WITH SENSITIVITIES AND SPECIFICITIES OF OVER 99%.  36  WITH  THE RECEIPT OF THE CE MARK CERTIFICATION FOR ITS RAPID POINT-OF-CARE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY, WE BELIEVE NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS IS WELL SITUATED TO ENTER INTO THIS GROWING SYPHILIS TESTING MARKET AND WILL NOW PURSUE MARKETING EFFORTS IN EUROPE  AND, IN PARALLEL, BEGIN PLANS FOR THE FILING OF A 510K APPLICATION WITH THE UNITED STATES FDA FOR MARKETING CLEARANCE IN THE UNITED  STATES. TO THIS END, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS IS FULLY QUALIFIED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DEVELOPER AND MANUFACTURER UNDER FDA GOOD MANUFACTURING  PROCEDURES (GMP) AND IS CERTIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MEDICAL DEVICES UNDER ISO  13485-2016 REGULATIONS.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS HAS JUST BEGUN A NEW INITIATIVE WHICH REVOLVES AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTITATIVE RAPID DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS. THESE  ASSAYS ALLOW LABORATORY PERSONNEL AND CLINICIANS TO ASSESS THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC TARGET MOLECULES IN BLOOD OR SERUM  SAMPLES AS OPPOSED TO \u201cYES\u201d OR \u201cNO\u201d RESULTS OF QUALITATIVE RDTS. THE FIRST ASSAY TO BE DEVELOPED IS A  MULTIPLEX BIOMARKER TEST FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF SEPSIS AND THE POTENTIAL DIFFERENTIATION OF INFECTIOUS SEPSIS FROM SYSTEMIC IMMUNE  RESPONSE SYNDROME (SIRS).  WE  MAINTAIN AN FDA REGISTERED FACILITY IN MIRAMAR, FLORIDA AND ARE CERTIFIED UNDER BOTH ISO9001 AND ISO13485 FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT,  PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE IN-VITRO DEVICES. APPROVAL OF OUR HIV RAPID TEST HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY  FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID). ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS QUALIFIED FOR AND CARRY THE EUROPEAN UNION \u201cCE\u201d  MARK, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ENTER INTO CE MEMBER COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE TWO MALARIA  RAPID TESTS APPROVED UNDER WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) GUIDELINES. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF RAPID TESTS,  REDUCING THE CURRENT 24 -30-MONTH PROCESS DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 6-9 MONTHS. WHO APPROVAL IS NECESSARY FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO BE USED  IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH RELY UPON THE EXPERTISE OF THE WHO, AS WELL AS FOR NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cNGO\u201d)  FUNDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  WE  MAINTAIN CURRENT U.S. CERTIFICATES OF EXPORTABILITY THAT ARE ISSUED BY TWO FDA DIVISIONS-CBER AND CDRH. CBER (CENTER FOR BIOLOGICALS  EVALUATION AND RESEARCH) IS THE FDA REGULATORY DIVISION THAT OVERSEES INFECTIOUS DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES, INCLUDING OUR HIV,  HEPATITIS B AND HEPATITIS C EXPRESS AND EXPRESS II KITS. THE OTHER DIVISION, CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH (CDRH),  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF OTHER HDS DEVICES WHICH INCLUDE TUBERCULOSIS, SYPHILIS, AND THE REMAINING PRODUCT LINE. OUR  HDS FACILITY MAINTAINS FDA ESTABLISHMENT REGISTRATION STATUS AND IS IN ACCORD WITH GMP (GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE) AS CONFIRMED  BY THE FDA.  WE  DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE FDA CLEARANCE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE INTEND TO SUBMIT SELECTED DEVICES TO THE FDA  UNDER A PRE-MARKET APPROVAL APPLICATION (PMA) OR THROUGH THE 510K PROCESS. THE 510K WOULD REQUIRE THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY ADMINISTRATIVE  SUBMISSIONS AS WELL AS A LIMITED SCIENTIFIC REVIEW BY THE FDA TO DETERMINE COMPLETENESS (ACCEPTANCE AND FILING REVIEWS); IN-DEPTH  SCIENTIFIC, REGULATORY, AND QUALITY SYSTEM REVIEW BY APPROPRIATE FDA PERSONNEL (SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW); REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION  BY THE APPROPRIATE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (PANEL REVIEW); AND FINAL DELIBERATIONS, DOCUMENTATION, AND NOTIFICATION OF THE FDA DECISION.  THE PMA PROCESS IS MORE EXTENSIVE, REQUIRING CLINICAL TRIALS TO SUPPORT THE APPLICATION. WE EXPECT TO APPLY TO THE FDA FOR CLEARANCE  OF OUR FIRST RDT (EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY) FOR FDA 510K APPROVAL IN EARLY 2020. WE ANTICIPATE THE FDA PROCESS WILL  BE COMPLETED WITHIN 9 MONTHS AFTER SUBMISSION. DURING THIS TIMELINE, WE WILL BE PREPARING DOCUMENTATION FOR ADDITIONAL RAPID TESTS  TO UNDERGO EITHER THE FDA PMA OR 510K PROCESS.  37  GENEREX  PLANS TO USE THE NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS SUBSIDIARY TO BUILD A MULTI-FACETED DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS FOCUSED ON PERSONALIZED MEDICINE.

THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH INVEST IN OUR NEW MSO MODEL WILL BE ALIGNED SOLELY WITH OUR GNBT  SHAREHOLDERS AND WILL RECEIVE DISCOUNT CODES TO PROCURE OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS EXCELLAGEN.  DME-IQ  NUGENEREX  DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS IS PLANNING A LAUNCH DME-IQ, A NOVEL SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS) SOLUTION FOR PHYSICIANS TO MANAGE IN-OFFICE  DISTRIBUTION OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME). DME-IQ SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPLIANT AND PROFITABLE IN-OFFICE  DME PROGRAMS. DME-IQ FOCUSES ON SEVERAL KEY AREAS WHICH INCLUDE NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF THE PHYSICIANS WITH KEY VENDORS TO DECREASE  THE COGS (COST OF GOODS SOLD), INCREASING INSURANCE COLLECTIONS BY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF THE CODING DURING THE BILLING PROCESS,  PROVIDING THE NECESSARY PERSONNEL TO MANAGE THE APPEALS PROCESSES, AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.  DME-IQ  WILL AUTOMATE AND PROVIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC PRACTICES WITH A PROPRIETARY, TABLET-BASED SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT IMMEDIATELY VERIFIES  PATIENT BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY. THIS UNIQUE SYSTEM MANAGES DME INVENTORY, COLLECTS PATIENT COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES, AND LINKS  PATIENT INFORMATION WITH THE DME PRODUCTS AND NECESSARY PATIENT FORMS ALL IN ONE EASY TO USE PLATFORM.  THE  DME MARKET  THE US  MARKET FOR DME IS LARGE AND GROWING, A RESULT OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISING PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASES REQUIRING  LONG-TERM CARE, THE RAPIDLY GROWING GERIATRIC POPULATION, AND THE TREND TOWARD HOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES. CHRONIC DISORDERS SUCH  AS DIABETES, DIABETIC FOOT & PRESSURE ULCERS, CHRONIC PAIN, AND CANCER THAT REQUIRE LONG-TERM PATIENT CARE AND POSTOPERATIVE  RECOVERY ARE DRIVING DEMAND FOR DME. ACCORDING TO A 2018 MARKET REPORT BY GRAND VIEW RESEARCH, INC., THE US DME MARKET IS EXPECTED  TO REACH $70.8 BILLION BY 2025, GROWING AT A 6.0% CAGR DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.

WITH THE DME-IQ SYSTEM, THE PRACTICE  GAINS CONTROL OF THEIR DME PROGRAM FROM AN OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, WHILE PATIENTS GAIN ACCESS TO A WIDER VARIETY  OF DME PRODUCTS THAT ARE CUSTOM FITTED FOR THEIR NEEDS.  THE  EXPLOSION OF HIGH DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE PLANS HAS RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC INCREASE OF PATIENT OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS FOR CARE, AND  THE SUBSEQUENT REQUIREMENT THAT PHYSICIANS SPEND MORE TIME AS COLLECTION AGENTS RATHER THAN DOCTORS. DME-IQ PROVIDES PRACTICE  WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS FOR DME WITH CUSTOM, TABLET-BASED SOFTWARE THAT REMOVES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FROM THE PRACTICE, FACILITATING  PATIENT ELIGIBILITY REVIEW, COLLECTION OF PATIENT CO-PAY AND DEDUCTIBLES, CENTRALIZED INSURANCE ADJUDICATION, DME PRODUCT PROCUREMENT,  AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ALLOW PHYSICIAN PRACTICES TO INCREASE REVENUE AND SERVICE QUALITY. THE LAUNCH OF DME-IQ ADVANCES  THE MISSION OF NDS TO PROVIDE PHYSICIANS WITH END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR PATIENT CENTRIC CARE.\u201d  39  NUGENEREX  REGENERATIVE MEDICINE  OLAREGEN  THERAPEUTIX, INC.

IS A REGENERATIVE MEDICINE COMPANY DEVELOPING A  TISSUE ENGINEERED THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS.  OVERVIEW  IN  JANUARY 2019, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN REGENTYS CORPORATION, A FLORIDA CORPORATION, A DEVELOPMENT-STAGE REGENERATIVE  MEDICINE COMPANY. SINCE ITS FORMATION IN MAY 2013 AS ASANA MEDICAL INC., REGENTYS HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A FIRST-IN-CLASS TISSUE  ENGINEERED THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES.  ULCERATIVE  COLITIS  ACCORDING  TO AN ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE LANCET ON DECEMBER 23, 2018 NAMED  WORLDWIDE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF INFLAMMATORY  BOWEL DISEASE IN THE 21ST CENTURY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF POPULATION-BASED STUDIES.  (2018 DEC 23;390(10114):2769-2778)  ,  ULCERATIVE COLITIS AFFECTS AN ESTIMATED 3.2 MILLION PATIENTS IN EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN. IT IS A CHRONIC, INFLAMMATORY  DISEASE THAT CAUSES SORES OR ULCERS IN THE LINING OF THE LARGE INTESTINE (THE COLON). IMMUNOLOGICAL IN NATURE, UC IS THOUGHT TO  BE FACILITATED BY A VARIETY OF HEREDITARY, GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND IT IS INCREASINGLY BEING DIAGNOSED IN MORE URBANIZED  AREAS. SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING URGENCY, BLEEDING, AND DIARRHEA, THAT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE.  REGENTYSTM  EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX HYDROGEL (\u201cECMH\u201d)  REGENTYS\u2019  INITIAL PRODUCT, ECMHTM RECTAL SOLUTION, IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS, NON-PHARMACOLOGIC, NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR MILLIONS  OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD TO MODERATE ULCERATIVE COLITIS.  ITS PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS A POWDER THAT IS RECONSTITUTED  WITH SALINE AND DELIVERED AS A LIQUID VIA ENEMA. AS ECMH REACHES BODY TEMPERATURE, IT GELS AND COATS THE MUCOSAL LINING OF THE  GI TRACT.  THE  CORE TECHNOLOGY IS DERIVED FROM ECM, A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FDA-APPROVED BASE NOW EXTENSIVELY USED FOR SURGICAL APPLICATIONS  AND WOUND TREATMENT. ECMH ACTS AS A BIO-SCAFFOLD, SEPARATING THE DAMAGED TISSUE FROM WASTE FLOW, COVERING ULCERATIONS TO LIMIT  THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, AND FACILITATING A HEALING ENVIRONMENT USING ENDOGENOUS (THE BODY\u2019S OWN) STEM CELLS.  PRE-CLINICAL  RESULTS  PUBLISHED  PRE-CLINICAL RESULTS IN THE  JOURNAL OF CROHN\u2019S AND COLITIS  HIGHLIGHT THE PROMISE OF REGENTYS TECHNOLOGY.  ANIMAL DATA SHOW THE ECMH THERAPY CAN BOTH ALLEVIATE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND FACILITATE HEALING IN UC PATIENTS. PREVIOUS PRE-CLINICAL  ECM ANIMAL DATA FOR APPROVED PRODUCTS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION WITH HUMAN DATA.  COMPETITION  CURRENTLY  FOUR BIOLOGICS ARE FDA-APPROVED, INCLUDING TOP-SELLING ANTIBODY MEDICINES HUMIRA\u00ae (ADALIMUMAB), SIMPONI\u00ae (GOLIMUMAB),  REMICADE\u00ae (INFLIXIMAB) AND ENTYVIO\u00ae (VEDOLIZUMAB), ALL OF WHICH ACT TO SUPPRESS THE PRO-INFLAMMATORY PROTEIN, TNF-A (TUMOR  NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA), A LEADING CAUSE OF THE PROLIFERATION OF ULCERATIVE COLIS AND OTHER FORMS OF IDB. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH THESE  OPTIONS, MORE THAN HALF OF ALL UC PATIENTS DO NOT ACHIEVE LONG-TERM REMISSION. MOREOVER, 20-30% OF NON-RESPONSIVE PATIENTS WILL  UNDERGO COLON REMOVAL SURGERY IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMEDIATE THE DISEASE.  REGENTYS  ADVANTAGES  WE  EXPECT OUR PRODUCT TO OFFER A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO PATIENTS NON-RESPONSIVE TO FIRST LINE THERAPIES SUCH AS 5-ASA. UNRESPONSIVE  PATIENTS WILL THEN NEED TO CHOOSE AMONG THERAPIES THAT ALTER THE BODY\u2019S IMMUNE SYSTEM OR POSE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS OR  PERHAPS BOTH. REGENTYS\u2019 TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE TARGETED TISSUE HEALING BUT POSE NONE OF THE HEALTH RISKS OF MORE  EXPENSIVE MARKET-LEADING BIOLOGICS THAT GENERALLY SUPPRESS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WE EXPECT TO PROVIDE OUR THERAPY AT A COST LESS  THAN OTHER THERAPIES.  41  MARKET  IN  2023, WHEN WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE APPROVAL, THE PROJECTED DRUG COSTS FOR UC ALONE ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED $7.5B GLOBALLY ACCORDING  TO A 2017 REPORT BY ALLIED MARKET RESEARCH; INCLUDING OTHER INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE INDICATIONS, THE GLOBAL MARKET IS EXPECTED  TO BE DOUBLE THE UC MARKET. BASED UPON THE NATURE OF IBD, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REGENTYS\u2019 TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES  VARIATIONS OF REGENTYS\u2019 CORE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING IBD DISEASES SUCH AS CROHN\u2019S, RECTAL MUCOSITIS,  PROCTITIS AND ANAL FISSURES.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  REGENTYS  IN-LICENSED PATENTS AND CO-DEVELOPED ITS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH. IT NOW HOLDS PATENT RIGHTS IN  US AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND HAS OTHER GLOBAL FILINGS PENDING; AS WELL, IT HAS PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING FOR SIMILAR INDICATIONS  PREDICATED ON ITS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER MAJOR GLOBAL MARKETS.  REGULATORY  PATH  THE FDA HAS  AFFIRMED OUR APPROACH TO FILE A 510(K)  DE NOVO  APPLICATION ON ITS ECM HYDROGEL. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL  AND HAS ENGAGED A CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE CONDUCT OF ITS FIRST-IN-HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS EXPECTED TO START  IN Q2/Q3 2020 IN AUSTRALIA.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENGAGED CONSULTANTS TO ASSIST IN MANAGING THE TRIALS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL  PROCESS IN AUSTRALIA, THE US AND EUROPE, JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE INITIALLY EXPECT TO UNDERTAKE CLINICAL TRIALS AND, AMONG OTHER  MARKETS, WHERE IT WILL FIRST SEEK GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL TO PROMOTE AND SELL MEDICAL DEVICES.  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT  SINCE  2013, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SUPPLEMENTED WITH PERSONNEL FROM  THE AFFILIATED MCGOWAN INSTITUTE OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. IN FEBRUARY 2018, REGENTYS ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH  (AND HAS RECEIVED A CO-INVESTMENT BY) COOK BIOTECH, INC., A GLOBAL LEADER IN ECM MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (COOKBIO). PRODUCT BATCHES  NOW ON HAND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. A LARGER CLINICAL BATCH WITH FINALIZED SPECIFICATIONS  WILL BE GENERATED IN THE COMING MONTHS FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS. THERE ARE ALTERNATE PROVIDERS OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WHO CAN  ASSIST WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE OPTIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ONGOING  DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND THE RELIANCE UPON CERTAIN BENCH AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND ECM PRODUCT EXPERTISE AND TECHNOLOGY,  ANY INTERRUPTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH COOKBIO WOULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES OF TIME AND  COST TO DUPLICATE THE PRODUCT.  MANUFACTURING  REGENTYS  HAS AN EXCLUSIVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT WITH COOKBIO FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIOMATERIAL AND USE OF ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION OF FINAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORK. MANAGEMENT HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER  FOR PRODUCT COMPONENTS AND KITTING. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATE SOURCES OF THESE MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY SERVICES. HOWEVER,  BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF REGULATION IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY, AND THE RELIANCE UPON THE COLLECTION, REPORTING AND MANAGEMENT  OF MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURING DATA, A CHANGE OF MANUFACTURER WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT THE TIME AND COST REQUIRED FOR CLINICAL  PRODUCT PRODUCTION AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.  OPERATIONS  CURRENTLY,  REGENTYS EMPLOYS FOUR FULL-TIME CONTRACT EMPLOYEE AND SEVERAL PART-TIME CONSULTANTS. WE SUPPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS BY  ENGAGING EXTERNAL LEGAL (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CORPORATE AND HEALTH CARE), ACCOUNTING AND TAX PROFESSIONALS. WE ALSO HAVE CONTRACTED  WITH INFORMATION SERVICES, REGULATORY AND CLINICAL TRIAL COMPANIES WHO MAKE AVAILABLE PROFESSIONALS TO MANAGE THE INFORMATION  SERVICES, REGULATORY, CLINICAL, AND COMPLIANCE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. UPON PAYMENT OF THE INTERIM NOTE, REGENTYS WILL FORMALLY  ADD TWO CONTRACT EMPLOYEES, ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND A THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER TO ASSIST WITH EMPLOYEE PAYROLL AND BENEFITS  AS WELL AS UNDERTAKE CLINICAL TRIAL ACTIVITIES SUING EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  42  NUGENEREX  SURGICAL PRODUCTS  MEDISOURCE  PARTNERS & PANTHEON MEDICAL \u2013 FOOT & ANKLE  PANTHEON  MEDICAL IS A MANUFACTURER OF ORTHOPEDIC FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY KITS THAT OFFER PHYSICIAN FRIENDLY \u201cALL-IN-ONE,\u201d  INTEGRATED SURGICAL KITS THAT INCLUDE PLATES, SCREWS, AND TOOLS REQUIRED FOR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS AND PODIATRISTS CONDUCTING FOOT  AND ANKLE SURGERIES.

ACCOUNTING  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  OUR  MAJOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE THE REFINEMENT OF OUR PLATFORM BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, OUR BUCCAL INSULIN PROJECT  (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) AND ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES.  WE  DID NOT EXPEND ANY MATERIAL RESOURCES ON OUR BUCCAL INSULIN (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) OR OTHER ORAL DELIVERY PRODUCTS IN THE FISCAL  QUARTERS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER LATE-STAGE TRIALS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED  STATES MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FUNDS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON HAND.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020 AND 2019, NGIO EXPENSED $142,200 AND $0, RESPECTIVELY, TO NSABP FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO NGIO\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNE THERAPEUTIC VACCINES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. ONE NGIO VACCINE IS  CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST CANCER, AND WE  HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL FOR AN NGIO VACCINE FOR H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AT THE  LEBANESE-CANADIAN HOSPITAL IN BEIRUT. ANTIGEN\u2019S PROSTATE CANCER VACCINE BASED ON AE37 HAS BEEN TESTED IN A COMPLETED  (AUGUST 2009) PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN GREECE.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, NGDX INCURRED $250,221 AND $141,067 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO ITS RAPID  DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, RESPECTIVELY.  BECAUSE  OF VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR BUCCAL INSULIN OR ANTIGEN\u2019S  PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES OR RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE THE SUCCESS OF CURRENT STUDIES NET OPERATING  LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO NGDX, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED FINANCING AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN  IF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLETED AND SUCCESSFUL, OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTIES, AND THE SUCCESS OF SUCH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS. FOR THE SAME REASONS, WE CANNOT  PREDICT WHEN ANY PRODUCTS MAY BEGIN TO PRODUCE NET CASH INFLOWS.  44  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE  ARE NO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SET FORTH IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SEC ON NOVEMBER  12, 2019, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS.  WE  HAVE ADOPTED A SEQUENCING POLICY WHEREBY, IN THE EVENT THAT RECLASSIFICATION OF CONTRACTS FROM EQUITY TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  IS NECESSARY PURSUANT TO ASC 815 DUE TO OUR INABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORIZED SHARES, SHARES WILL BE ALLOCATED  ON THE BASIS OF THE EARLIEST ISSUANCE DATE OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE INSTRUMENTS, WITH THE EARLIEST GRANTS RECEIVING THE FIRST ALLOCATION  OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES, AND ALL FUTURE INSTRUMENTS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF  INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES OR DIRECTORS.  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IT REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  GOING  CONCERN.  AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROFITABLE  AND HAVE REPORTED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  TO OPERATE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  . MANAGEMENT REVIEWS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING  AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS HAS OCCURRED BASED UPON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE  CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION.  MANAGEMENT DETERMINES VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 718, COMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES  VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO NON-EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND ASC 505, EQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES.  DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITY  .  FASB  ASC 815, DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, REQUIRES ALL DERIVATIVES TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AT FAIR VALUE. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITIES (NAMELY THOSE WITH A PRICE PROTECTION FEATURE) ARE SEPARATELY  VALUED AND ACCOUNTED FOR ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WITH ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND JULY 31, 2019, WE USED THE BINOMIAL LATTICE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR  VALUE OF THESE WARRANTS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF THE BINOMIAL LATTICE OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCLUDE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE  EXERCISE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS, APPLICABLE VOLATILITY RATES, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, EXPECTED DIVIDENDS AND THE INSTRUMENT\u2019S  REMAINING TERM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE VARIABLES  DURING A PERIOD CAN RESULT IN MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE (AND RESULTANT GAINS OR LOSSES) OF THIS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT.  AS  REPORTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS A SEQUENCING POLICY REGARDING SHARE SETTLEMENT WHEREIN INSTRUMENTS WITH THE EARLIEST ISSUANCE  DATE WOULD BE SETTLED FIRST. THE SEQUENCING POLICY ALSO CONSIDERS CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE ADDITIONAL SHARES, SUCH AS THOSE ISSUABLE  UPON A STOCK SPLIT, TO HAVE AN ISSUANCE DATE TO COINCIDE WITH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE ADDITIONAL SHARES.  ON  JANUARY 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NOTE PAYABLE WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY AT A PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT (VARIABLE) EXERCISE  PRICE WHICH CAUSES THE NUMBER TO BE CONVERTED INTO A NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES THAT \u201cAPPROACH INFINITY\u201d, AS THE UNDERLYING  STOCK PRICE COULD APPROACH ZERO. ACCORDINGLY, ALL CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY 24, 2019 ARE CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES  ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SEQUENCING POLICY.  45  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, WE HAD NET REVENUES OF $857,427 AND $3,442,265, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF OPERATIONS  OF VENETO WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $9,000 OF REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM PANTHEON AND OLAREGEN OF APPROXIMATELY $805,000 AND $44,000, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAD A NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 OF $7,280,030 AND $12,524,584, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2020 WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $4,397,000 IN THE  PRIOR FISCAL PERIOD AND $0 IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. ALSO, THERE WERE OPERATING LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4,558,000 AND $5,879,000  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THE $1,852,000 DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES IN THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 VERSUS THE COMPARATIVE PREVIOUS FISCAL QUARTER IS DUE TO THE DECREASE IN OPERATIONS  OF VENETO WHICH DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $3,274,000 WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $632,000 OF EXPENSES INCURRED FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED  ENTITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $585,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020.  OUR INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS $1,431,052 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S FISCAL THREE MONTHS OF $2,097,220 WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT RELATING TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES.  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, WE HAD NET REVENUES OF $1,579,088 AND $5,161,413, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAD A NET LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 OF $16,592,577 AND A NET GAIN OF $5,397,996 IN THE CORRESPONDING SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE NET  LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $9,434,000  AND OTHER EXPENSES CONSISTING OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $3,670,000, AND INTEREST EXPENSE  OF APPROXIMATELY $3,947,000. THE NET GAIN FOR THE SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR  VALUE OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $15,148,000 WHICH DID NOT EXIST DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE $662,212 INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 VERSUS THE COMPARATIVE PREVIOUS SIX MONTH PERIOD IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION  EXPENSE OF $585,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020.  OUR INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY $3,947,000 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S FISCAL THREE MONTHS OF APPROXIMATELY $2,262,000  WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT RELATING TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES.

AS  OF MARCH 13, 2020, THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR TWELVE MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. ANTICIPATED REVENUES  ASSOCIATED WITH MEDISOURCE AND PANTHEON ACQUISITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE CASH FLOW LANDSCAPE.  WHILE  WE HAVE FINANCED OUR DEVELOPMENT STAGE ACTIVITIES TO DATE PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND SECURITIES  CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS INVESTOR NOTES, AND RAISED APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 (INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES), OUR CASH BALANCES HAVE BEEN LOW THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2019.  46  MANAGEMENT  MAY SEEK TO MEET ALL OR SOME OF OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS THROUGH FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF  OUR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OFFERINGS AND OFFERINGS OF DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS THROUGH MERGER OR  ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  IN  ADDITION, MANAGEMENT IS ACTIVELY PURSUING FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND DIVESTITURES,  INDUSTRY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES, AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERS.

TABULAR  DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  GENEREX  IS A SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY AS DEFINED BY RULE 12B-2 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED  UNDER THIS ITEM.  RECENTLY  ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04,  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  (TOPIC 350), WHICH ELIMINATES  STEP 2 FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY SHOULD PERFORM ITS ANNUAL OR INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST BY  COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH  THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE, NOT TO EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING  UNIT. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE STANDARD EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2020. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU 2017-04 WILL  HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN  JULY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-11,  EARNINGS PER SHARE (TOPIC 260), DISTINGUISHING LIABILITIES FROM EQUITY (TOPIC  480) AND DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): I. ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES; II. REPLACEMENT  OF THE INDEFINITE DEFERRAL FOR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF CERTAIN NONPUBLIC ENTITIES AND CERTAIN MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS WITH A SCOPE EXCEPTION.  PART I OF THIS UPDATE ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITY  OF ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES. DOWN ROUND FEATURES ARE FEATURES OF CERTAIN EQUITY-LINKED  INSTRUMENTS (OR EMBEDDED FEATURES) THAT RESULT IN THE STRIKE PRICE BEING REDUCED ON THE BASIS OF THE PRICING OF FUTURE EQUITY  OFFERINGS. CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CREATES COST AND COMPLEXITY FOR ENTITIES THAT ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (SUCH AS WARRANTS  AND CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS) WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES THAT REQUIRE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT OR CONVERSION  OPTION. PART II OF THIS UPDATE ADDRESSES THE DIFFICULTY OF NAVIGATING  TOPIC 480, DISTINGUISHING LIABILITIES FROM  EQUITY  , BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF EXTENSIVE PENDING CONTENT IN THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. THIS PENDING  CONTENT IS THE RESULT OF THE INDEFINITE DEFERRAL OF ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS ABOUT MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  OF CERTAIN NONPUBLIC ENTITIES AND CERTAIN MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. THE AMENDMENTS IN PART II  OF THIS UPDATE DO NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNTING EFFECT. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER  DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN AN INTERIM PERIOD. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THE ASU  2017-11 IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  IN  FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT \u2013 REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).  RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  , WHICH WAS ISSUED TO ADDRESS THE INCOME  TAX ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DUE TO THE PROHIBITION OF BACKWARD TRACING  DUE TO AN INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE THAT WAS INITIALLY RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS ISSUE CAME ABOUT FROM THE ENACTMENT  OF THE TCJA ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 THAT CHANGED THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY  1, 2018 AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TERRITORIAL-STYLE SYSTEM FOR TAXING FOREIGN-SOURCE INCOME OF DOMESTIC MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACT (\u201cSAB118\u201d),  WHICH ALLOWS US TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD NOT TO EXTEND BEYOND ONE YEAR OF THE ENACTMENT. THE  COMPANY REMEASURED ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 31, 2018, APPLYING THE REDUCED CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE  AND RECORDED A PROVISIONAL DECREASE TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $31,876,520, WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION  ALLOWANCE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE  TAX ACT AND THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK-CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE  REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\u201d, WHICH ADDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO TOPIC 820 FOR THE RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE  OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO DEVELOP LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL  REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU 2018-13 WILL HAVE ON CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  51", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORP", "CIK": 1059784, "Date": "2020-03-20T00:00:00", "Ticker": "GNBT", "Name": "Generex Biotechnology Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 2834.0, "Business": "A1", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 820490211.0, "key": "20200320GNBT", "labelr1": 3.725490196078435, "labelr2": 2.079395085066164, "labelr3": 7.037037037037022, "labelr4": -6.574394463667808, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5724815, "prof1": 0.42751855, "return1&2": 0.9427258237888728, "return1&2&3": 0.8763858584111374, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9340029217668868, "return2": 0.9792060491493384, "return1": 0.9627450980392156, "return3": 0.9296296296296298, "return4": 1.0657439446366779, "1_day_return": 3.72549019607844, "cumulative_return1": 0.08423045486418188, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3790, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0691712256387318, "cumreturn1b": 0.5795491499862877, "cumreturn1c": 0.5613214252272707, "cumreturndow": 0.7449630964014816, "cumreturnsp500": 0.7173529135856145}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3793, "level_0": 3900, "index": 86053, "text": "ITEM 2.

THE INFORMATION INCLUDED HEREIN REPRESENTS OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING.  UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, OR TO UPDATE THE REASONS  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, EVEN IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES  AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE.  THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTACHED UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S  AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCUSSION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019.  EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  THE  COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE HAS STAYED STEADY THROUGH THE THREE QUARTERS, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN SALES, MANAGING COST OF SALES  NUMBERS, AND STRONG INVESTMENT RETURNS. THIS IS DUE TO THE CONTINUATION OF OUR QUALITY USA MADE PRODUCTS WITH THE ABILITY FOR  CUSTOMIZATION, OUR NOTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THE PURCHASE OF THE ASSETS OF LABOR SAVING DEVICES, INC. OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE  GAINING BUSINESS FROM A COMPETITOR THAT IS GETTING OUT OF THE SECURITY SWITCH BUSINESS AND TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT BUSINESSES THAT  MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT TO PURCHASE. NEW CHALLENGES THE COMPANY HAS ENDURED OVER THE NINE MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR INCLUDE CONTINUING  TO GET PRODUCT OUT TO CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELIER MANNER AND TO FILL THE STOCKROOM WITH INVENTORY TO GET BACK TO SHIPPING OUT CORE  PRODUCTS THE SAME DAY. ALSO, THE PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS HAS INCREASED WITH THE EXECUTION OF TARIFFS BY THE US GOVERNMENT AND OTHER  FACTORS. THE COVID-19 VIRUS IS ALSO A CONCERN FOR MANAGEMENT AS AVAILABILITY TO GET RAW MATERIALS MAY BE HAMPERED BY THE PANDEMIC.  BUT MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO WORK AT KEEPING OPERATIONS FLOWING AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING THE FACILITIES  RUNNING LEANER AND MORE PROFITABLE THAN EVER BEFORE.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  \u25cf  NET  SALES WERE $3,589,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WHICH IS A 3.88% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER LAST  YEAR. YEAR-TO-DATE NET SALES WERE $10,852,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020, WHICH IS A 2.85% INCREASE FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE STEADY GROWTH IN SALES IS DUE TO OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OUR ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO SEEING GROWTH SINCE A MAJOR COMPETITOR CLOSED ITS DOORS AT THE END OF 2019.  \u25cf  COST  OF GOODS SOLD WAS 51.04% OF NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND WAS 51.29% FOR THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  YEAR-TO-DATE COST OF GOODS SOLD PERCENTAGES WERE 50.33% FOR THE CURRENT NINE MONTHS AND 51.81% FOR THE CORRESPONDING NINE  MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHICH IS JUST SLIGHTLY OVER THE TARGET OF LESS THAN 50% FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS. MANAGEMENT  HAS SEEN INCREASES IN LABOR AND MATERIALS COSTS AND INITIATED A PRICE INCREASE THAT STARTED IN JANUARY 2020.  \u25cf  OPERATING  EXPENSES INCREASED BY $72,000 FOR THE QUARTER AS THEY INCREASED BY $107,000 FOR THE NINE-MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS LAST YEAR. THESE INCREASED COSTS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMMISSIONS AND WAGES  FOR RAISES AND THE HIRING OF MORE EMPLOYEES.  23  \u25cf  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS AT $834,000 WHICH IS A 0.24% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER  LAST YEAR, WHICH HAD INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $832,000. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS AT $2,690,000, WHICH IS A 7.99% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHICH HAD INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  OF $2,491,000.  \u25cf  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE UP $373,000 WHEN COMPARING TO THE CURRENT QUARTER TO THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR. COMPARATIVELY,  THERE IS AN INCREASE OF $808,000 IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE NUMBERS. THE MAJORITY OF ACTIVITY  IN THESE ACCOUNTS CONSISTS OF INVESTMENT INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, AND GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE OF INVESTMENTS, BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR  IS THAT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE NOW BEING SHOWN IN THE INCOME STATEMENT STARTING THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  \u25cf  OVERALL,  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS UP $191,000, OR 16.28%, FROM THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  SIMILARLY, NET INCOME FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS UP $737,000, OR 28.80%, FROM THE  SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25cf  EARNINGS  PER COMMON SHARE FOR QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WERE $0.28 PER SHARE AND $0.67 PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE  NUMBERS. EPS FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE $0.24 PER SHARE AND $0.52 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OPERATING  \u25cf  NET  CASH INCREASED $774,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $295,000 DURING THE CORRESPONDING  PERIOD LAST YEAR.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE DECREASED $460,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED WITH A $514,000 DECREASE FOR THE SAME PERIOD  LAST YEAR. THE CURRENT YEAR DECREASE IS A RESULT OF IMPROVED SALES AND COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IMPROVED OVER LAST  YEAR. AN ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SHOWS THAT THERE WERE ONLY 0.30% THAT WERE OVER 90 DAYS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  \u25cf  INVENTORIES  INCREASED $506,000 DURING THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $999,000 LAST YEAR. THE SMALLER INCREASE  IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES, NOT HAVING A STOCKPILE OF FINISHED GOODS, AND SOME ISSUES WITH GETTING  SOME VITAL RAW MATERIALS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  \u25cf  PREPAID  EXPENSES SAW A $43,000 DECREASE FOR THE CURRENT NINE MONTHS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY BEING DELIVERED THAT HAD BEEN PAID  FOR IN ADVANCE. THE PRIOR NINE MONTHS SHOWED A $164,000 DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES.  \u25cf  INCOME  TAX OVERPAYMENT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 DECREASED $142,000, AS THE OVERPAYMENT SHOWED AN INCREASE OF $106,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD THE PRIOR YEAR. THE MAIN REASON FOR THE CURRENT DECREASE IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED ADDITIONAL  INCOME WITHOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE INCOME TAX ESTIMATES.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE SHOWS A $16,000 INCREASE FOR THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO A $35,000 DECREASE  FOR THE PRIOR NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO PAY ALL INVOICES WITHIN TERMS, AND THE VARIANCE IN INCREASES IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPT OF PRODUCTS AND PAYMENT OF INVOICES.  \u25cf  ACCRUED  EXPENSES DID NOT HAVE ANY CASH FLOW CHANGE FOR THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO A $36,000 DECREASE FOR THE NINE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  24  INVESTING  \u25cf  AS  FOR OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $468,000 ON ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE  CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD, IN COMPARISON WITH THE CORRESPONDING NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHERE THERE WAS ACTIVITY OF $88,000.  \u25cf  ADDITIONALLY,  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURCHASE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MUNICIPAL BONDS AND QUALITY STOCKS. DURING THE NINE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF BUY/SELL ACTIVITY IN THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. NET CASH SPENT ON PURCHASES  OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS $640,000 COMPARED TO $839,000 SPENT IN THE PRIOR  NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO USE \u201cMONEY MANAGER\u201d ACCOUNTS FOR MOST STOCK TRANSACTIONS. BY DOING  THIS, THE COMPANY GIVES AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY FIRM, WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD, PERMISSION TO BUY AND SELL STOCKS  AT WILL. THE COMPANY PAYS A QUARTERLY SERVICE FEE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURCHASE BACK COMMON STOCK WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES. FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020,  THE COMPANY PURCHASED $71,000 WORTH OF TREASURY STOCK. THIS IS IN COMPARISON TO $62,000 SPENT IN THE SAME NINE MONTHS PERIOD  THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY PAID OUT DIVIDENDS OF $1,802,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020. THESE DIVIDENDS WERE PAID DURING  THE SECOND QUARTER. THE COMPANY DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.40 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND THESE DIVIDENDS  WERE PAID BY OCTOBER 31, 2019. AS FOR THE PRIOR YEAR NUMBERS, DIVIDENDS PAID WAS $1,752,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING JANUARY  31, 2019. A DIVIDEND OF $0.38 PER COMMON SHARE WAS DECLARED AND PAID DURING THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER LAST YEAR.  THE  FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF RATIOS TO HELP ANALYZE GEORGE RISK INDUSTRIES\u2019 PERFORMANCE.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  JANUARY 31, 2019  WORKING CAPITAL  (CURRENT ASSETS \u2013 CURRENT LIABILITIES)  $39,119,000  $35,493,000  CURRENT RATIO  (CURRENT ASSETS / CURRENT LIABILITIES)  16.831  16.299  QUICK RATIO  ((CASH + INVESTMENTS + AR) / CURRENT LIABILITIES)  14.597  13.963  NEW  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  THE  COMPANY AND ITS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ENHANCEMENTS TO PRODUCT LINES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS WHICH COMPLEMENT  EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND LOOK FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE WELL SUITED TO OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES. ITEMS  CURRENTLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE.  \u25cf  A  NEW FACE PLATE FOR OUR POOL ALARMS IS NEARING COMPLETION. THE INNOVATIVE DESIGN IS SLIM IN STYLE AND WILL ALSO ALLOW THE HOMEOWNER  TO CHANGE THE PLATE TO MATCH THEIR DE\u0301COR.  25  \u25cf  AN  UPDATED VERSION OF THE POOL ACCESS ALARM IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH ELECTRICAL LISTING TESTING. THIS NEXT-GENERATION MODEL  COMBINES OUR BATTERY OPERATED DPA SERIES WITH OUR HARD WIRED 289 SERIES. A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION OPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE  THROUGH JUMPER PIN SETTINGS.  \u25cf  WE  CONTINUE OUR WORK ON HIGH SECURITY SWITCHES. WE HAVE A TRIPLE BIASED HIGH SECURITY SWITCH DESIGN AND AN ADJUSTABLE MAGNET  DESIGN WAS COMPLETED FOR RECESSED MOUNTING APPLICATIONS. THIS IS READY TO BE SENT TO IN FOR ELECTRICAL LISTING TESTING.  \u25cf  WE  HAVE INTRODUCED THE GR1840 OVAL METAL DOOR CHANNEL MAGNET. THIS IS A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE OBSOLETE INTERLOGIX MAGNET.  THIS MAGNET FITS INTO THE TOP CHANNEL OF A METAL DOOR AND DOES NOT REQUIRE DRILLING INTO THE DOOR CORE. WE HAVE ALSO PAIRED  THIS WITH SEVERAL OF OUR 3\u20444\u201d AND 1\u201d STEEL DOOR CONTACTS.  \u25cf  WIRELESS  TECHNOLOGY IS A MAIN AREA OF FOCUS FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE CONSIDERING ADDING WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY TO SOME OF OUR CURRENT  PRODUCTS. A WIRELESS CONTACT SWITCH IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. ALSO, WE ARE WORKING ON WIRELESS VERSIONS OF OUR  POOL ACCESS ALARM AND ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS THAT WILL BE EASY TO INSTALL IN CURRENT CONSTRUCTION. WE ARE ALSO CONCENTRATING  ON MAKING PRODUCTS COMPATIBLE WITH WI-FI, SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY AND THE INCREASING POPULAR Z-WAVE STANDARD FOR WIRELESS HOME  AUTOMATION.  \u25cf  WE  ARE READY TO LAUNCH A NEW LABOR SAVING DEVICE\u2019S PRODUCT. IT IS A 12\u201d ADJUSTABLE HOLE CUTTER WHICH COMPLIMENTS  THE POPULAR 10\u201d HOLE CUTTER. USING A STANDARD DRILL, THIS TOOL ALLOWS YOU TO DRILL VARIOUS SIZE HOLES IN THE CEILING  FOR SPEAKERS AND CANNED LIGHTS. THE DUST BIN, WHICH BUTS AGAINST THE CEILING, KEEPS THE CEILING MATERIAL AND DUST ENCLOSED  MAKING FOR A CLEAN, TIME SAVING INSTALLATION.  \u25cf  ANOTHER  LSDI PRODUCT IS NEW LIGHTED BULLNOSE TIP IN A VARIETY OF COLORS (RED, GREEN AND BLUE) TO GO ALONG WITH THE STANDARD CLEAR  LIGHTS. THESE COLORED LIGHTS ARE PLACED ON FIBERFUSE WIRE RUNNING RODS WHICH ALLOWS FOR EASY LOCATION OF THE ROD ENDS IN DARK  PLACES SUCH AS ATTICS AND CRAWLSPACES. THE RODS CAN BE COLOR CODED FOR WIRE PATHS RUNNING INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS. LARGER BATTERIES  ADD TO THE LONGEVITY OF THESE NEW LIGHTS.  OTHER  INFORMATION  IN  ADDITION TO RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT IS ALWAYS OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ACQUIRING A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT  LINE THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG CASH POSITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS  COULD BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR OUTSIDE FINANCING. THE INTENT IS TO UTILIZE THE EQUIPMENT, MARKETING TECHNIQUES AND ESTABLISHED  CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS AND INCREASE SALES AND PROFITS.  THERE  ARE NO KNOWN SEASONAL TRENDS WITH ANY OF GRI\u2019S PRODUCTS, SINCE WE SELL TO DISTRIBUTORS AND OEM MANUFACTURERS. OUR PRODUCTS  ARE TIED TO THE HOUSING INDUSTRY AND WILL FLUCTUATE WITH BUILDING TRENDS.  RECENTLY  ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE  FOR ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES. ASU 2016-02 REQUIRES LESSEES TO CLASSIFY LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES AND TO RECORD  A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS REGARDLESS OF THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION.  THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OR  ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. ACCOUNTING FOR LESSORS REMAINS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM CURRENT GAAP. ASU 2016-02  IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING NOVEMBER 1, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-10  \u201cCODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 842, LEASES\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-10\u201d) AND ASU NO. 2018-11 \u201cLEASES (TOPIC  842) TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-11\u201d). ASU 2018-10 PROVIDES CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT AFFECT NARROW ASPECTS  OF THE GUIDANCE ISSUED IN ASU 2016-02. ASU 2018-11 ALLOWS ALL ENTITIES ADOPTING ASU 2016-02 TO CHOOSE AN ADDITIONAL (AND OPTIONAL)  TRANSITION METHOD OF ADOPTION, UNDER WHICH AN ENTITY INITIALLY APPLIES THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZES  A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. ASU 2018-11 ALSO ALLOWS  LESSORS TO NOT SEPARATE NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FROM THE ASSOCIATED LEASE COMPONENT IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE COMPANY ADOPTED  THE ASUS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS WILL BE UPGRADED TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS  OF THE NEW STANDARD, HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  26  IN  FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-02, RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  (ASU 2018-02). UNDER EXISTING U.S. GAAP, THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND LAWS ON DEFERRED TAX BALANCES ARE RECORDED AS  A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LAW WAS ENACTED. WHEN DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RELATED TO ITEMS ORIGINALLY  RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE ADJUSTED, CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS BECOME STRANDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2018-02 ALLOW A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  TO RETAINED EARNINGS (ACCUMULATED DEFICIT) FOR STRANDED INCOME TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE TAX ACT).  THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ABOUT STRANDED INCOME TAX EFFECTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL  YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IN ANY PERIOD IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ADOPTED ASU 2018-02 AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE  ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  IN  JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-09, \u201cCODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-09\u201d). ASU 2018-09 PROVIDES  AMENDMENTS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS IN THE FASB\u2019S ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION, WHICH APPLIES TO ALL REPORTING ENTITIES  WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AFFECTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE TRANSITION AND EFFECTIVE DATE GUIDANCE ARE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  OF EACH AMENDMENT. SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2018-09 DO NOT REQUIRE TRANSITION GUIDANCE AND WERE EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE OF  ASU 2018-09. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS DO HAVE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITH EFFECTIVE DATES FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER  DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE; HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE  THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-09 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT - DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK (TOPIC 820). THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IMPROVES  THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY REMOVED OR MODIFIED DISCLOSURES.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE TIMING AND IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE UPDATED PROVISIONS.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-14 TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURES FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS UNDER ASC 715-20.  THE ASU APPLIES TO EMPLOYERS THAT SPONSOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-14 AS  PART OF ITS DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK PROJECT, WHICH HAS AN OBJECTIVE AND PRIMARY FOCUS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURES  IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS PART OF THE PROJECT, DURING AUGUST 2018, THE BOARD ALSO ISSUED A CONCEPTS STATEMENT,  WHICH THE FASB USED AS A BASIS FOR AMENDING THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBTOPIC 715-20. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL  YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE TIMING AND IMPACT  OF ADOPTING THE UPDATED PROVISIONS.  27  IN  JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13(\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014CREDIT LOSSES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE  FASB ISSUED ASU 2019-05, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS- CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): TARGETED TRANSITION RELIEF AND CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS  TO TOPIC 326 IN ASU 2019-11, ASU 2019-04 AND ASU 2018-19. THE AMENDMENTS UPDATE GUIDANCE ON REPORTING CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL  ASSETS. THESE AMENDMENTS AFFECT LOANS, DEBT SECURITIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, NET INVESTMENTS IN LEASES, OFF BALANCE SHEET CREDIT  EXPOSURES, REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES, AND ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE THAT HAVE THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHT  TO RECEIVE CASH. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING  INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. ALL ENTITIES MAY ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED  EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE (THAT IS, A MODIFIED-RETROSPECTIVE  APPROACH). THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE FASB  ISSUED ASU 2019-10, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSS (TOPIC 326), DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815), AND LEASES (TOPIC  842),\u201d WHICH DEFERS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR PUBLIC FILERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED SMALL REPORTING COMPANIES (\u201cSRC\u201d)  AS DEFINED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2022, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. SINCE THE COMPANY IS AN SRC, IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT NEEDED UNTIL MAY 1, 2023. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE  TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-13 WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN  JANUARY 2020, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2020-01, \u201cINVESTMENTS - EQUITY SECURITIES (TOPIC 321), INVESTMENTS - EQUITY METHOD AND  JOINT VENTURES (TOPIC 323), AND DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815) - CLARIFYING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TOPIC 321, TOPIC 323,  AND TOPIC 815.\u201d THE ASU IS BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE COMPARABILITY  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS. ASU 2016-01 MADE TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING  PROVIDING AN ENTITY THE ABILITY TO MEASURE CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AT COST, LESS ANY  IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS CHANGES RESULTING FROM OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE IDENTICAL OR A SIMILAR  INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. AMONG OTHER TOPICS, THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER OBSERVABLE TRANSACTIONS  THAT REQUIRE IT TO EITHER APPLY OR DISCONTINUE THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES, THE AMENDMENTS IN  THE ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY  ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2020-01 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  28  GEORGE  RISK INDUSTRIES, INC.  PART  I.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, THE USE OF THE TERMS \"WINNEBAGO,\" \"WE,\" \"US,\" AND \"OUR\" REFERS TO WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A READER OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH A NARRATIVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MANAGEMENT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  OUR MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 (INCLUDING THE INFORMATION PRESENTED THEREIN UNDER RISK FACTORS), AS WELL AS OUR REPORTS ON FORMS 10-Q AND 8-K AND OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ALL AMOUNTS HEREIN ARE UNAUDITED.  OVERVIEW  WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES, INC. IS ONE OF THE LEADING U.S. MANUFACTURERS WITH A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF RECREATION VEHICLES (\"RV\"S) AND MARINE PRODUCTS USED PRIMARILY IN LEISURE TRAVEL AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITIES. WE PRODUCE OUR MOTORHOME UNITS IN IOWA AND INDIANA; OUR TOWABLE UNITS IN INDIANA; AND OUR MARINE UNITS IN FLORIDA. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RV AND MARINE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER. WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR MARINE PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER.  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION  THIS MD&A INCLUDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (\"GAAP\"), AS WELL AS CERTAIN ADJUSTED OR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN ORDER TO PRESENT COMPARABLE RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 FOR A DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF ITEMS THAT IMPACTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECT OF NON-RECURRING TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE REPORTED PERIODS AND TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS WHEN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED FAIR-VALUE INVENTORY STEP-UP, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND NON-OPERATING INCOME.  MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (A) TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS AND PEERS; (B) TO MEASURE OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS; (C) IN PRESENTATIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ENABLE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT BASIS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS ASSESSMENTS OF PERFORMANCE AND IN FORECASTING AND BUDGETING FOR OUR COMPANY; (D) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (E) TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS AND RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  NEWMAR CORPORATION  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR CORPORATION, DUTCH REAL ESTATE CORP, NEW-WAY TRANSPORT, AND NEW-SERV (COLLECTIVELY \"NEWMAR\") FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $360.3 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF $267.7 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS STIPULATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND 2.0 MILLION SHARES OF WINNEBAGO COMMON STOCK THAT WERE VALUED AT $92.6 MILLION ($46.29 PER SHARE DISCOUNTED AT 7.0% DUE TO LACK OF MARKETABILITY BECAUSE OF ONE YEAR LOCK-UP RESTRICTIONS). THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\")  (AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 9,  LONG-TERM DEBT  ) AND CASH ON HAND. NEWMAR IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF CLASS A AND SUPER C MOTORIZED RECREATION VEHICLES THAT ARE SOLD THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AUTHORIZED DEALERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  WE HAVE SIX OPERATING SEGMENTS: 1) GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES, 2) WINNEBAGO TOWABLES, 3) WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES, 4) NEWMAR MOTORHOMES, 5) CHRIS-CRAFT MARINE, AND 6) WINNEBAGO SPECIALTY VEHICLES. WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE BASED ON EACH OPERATING SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BELOW, WHICH EXCLUDES CERTAIN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS INCLUDE: 1) TOWABLE (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WHICH ARE NOT MOTORIZED AND ARE GENERALLY TOWED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES AND THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES OPERATING SEGMENTS AND 2) MOTORHOME (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE A MOTORIZED CHASSIS AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES AND NEWMAR MOTORHOMES OPERATING SEGMENTS.  THE CORPORATE / ALL OTHER CATEGORY INCLUDES THE CHRIS-CRAFT MARINE AND WINNEBAGO SPECIALTY VEHICLES OPERATING SEGMENTS AS WELL AS EXPENSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF THE ENTERPRISE. THESE EXPENSES INCLUDE ITEMS SUCH AS CORPORATE LEADERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS.

THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS RETAIL INFORMATION FOR 2020 AND 2019 ILLUSTRATES THAT RETAIL SALES REMAIN AT HEALTHY LEVELS. WE BELIEVE RETAIL DEMAND IS THE KEY DRIVER TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE MOST RECENT RVIA WHOLESALE SHIPMENT FORECASTS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2020, AS NOTED IN THE TABLE BELOW, INDICATE THAT INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2020.

FACILITY EXPANSION  DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH IN OUR TOWABLE SEGMENT, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED FACILITY EXPANSION PROJECTS IN OUR GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES AND WINNEBAGO TOWABLES OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES EXPANSION PROJECT CONSISTED OF THREE NEW PRODUCTION FACILITIES--TWO WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2018 AND ONE WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  THE FACILITY EXPANSION IN THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES DIVISION WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\"ERP\") SYSTEM TO REPLACE OUR LEGACY BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. THE NEW ERP PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR OUR CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. OUR INITIAL COST ESTIMATES HAVE GROWN FOR ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE ERP SYSTEM WITH ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, EXTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE, AND INCREASED INTERNAL STAFFING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE COST WILL BE EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD INCURRED AND 60% WILL BE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.

OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO INCREMENTAL AMORTIZATION RELATED TO THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING FOR NEWMAR, NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES OF NEWMAR AND ORGANIC GROWTH IN THE TOWABLE SEGMENT.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED IN THE SECOND THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE SECOND THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS PURSUANT TO PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY IS TO FIRST FUND OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, MAINTAIN A DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN OUR TARGETED ZONE, MAINTAIN REASONABLE LIQUIDITY, AND THEN RETURN EXCESS CASH OVER TIME TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  ON OCTOBER 18, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $70.0 MILLION. THERE IS NO TIME RESTRICTION ON THE AUTHORIZATION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE IF SHARE REPURCHASES REFLECT A PRUDENT USE OF OUR CAPITAL AND, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES IN THE FUTURE. AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAVE $58.9 MILLION REMAINING ON OUR BOARD REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH OUR \u201cINSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u201d: AMERICAN COUNTRY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cAMERICAN COUNTRY\u201d), AMERICAN SERVICE INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. (\u201cAMERICAN SERVICE\u201d), GATEWAY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cGATEWAY\u201d) AND GLOBAL LIBERTY INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK (\u201cGLOBAL LIBERTY\u201d) IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, ANCHOR GROUP MANAGEMENT INC. (\u201cAGMI\u201d). THIS SECTOR INCLUDES TAXI CABS, NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT, LIMOUSINE, LIVERY, INCLUDING CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES (\u201cTNCS\u201d) DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND BUSINESS AUTO. OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS BE THE PREFERRED SPECIALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE OUR VALUE PROPOSITION DELIVERS BENEFIT TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE LICENSED TO WRITE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY (\u201cP&C\u201d) INSURANCE IN  49  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d). THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT RETAIL AGENTS, AND ACTIVELY WRITE INSURANCE IN  42  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE EMBRACE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, ANALYTICS AND TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF BUILDING ON THE STRONG HERITAGE OUR SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES CULTIVATED IN THE NICHE MARKETS WE SERVE.  SINCE ATLAS\u2019 FORMATION IN 2010, WE HAVE DISPOSED OF NON-CORE ASSETS, CONSOLIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLACED INTO RUN-OFF CERTAIN NON-CORE LINES OF BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH AMERICAN COUNTRY, AMERICAN SERVICE AND GATEWAY, AND GLOBAL LIBERTY, ALONG WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, AGMI.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, CERTAIN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN IN REHABILITATION SINCE JULY 8, 2019.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  JUNE 30, 2019.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE  OUR PRIMARY TARGET MARKET IS MADE UP OF SMALL TO MID-SIZE TAXI, LIMOUSINE, OTHER LIVERY, INCLUDING TNC DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT OPERATORS. THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR LIGHTWEIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES TYPICALLY WITH THE MINIMUM LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE, MUNICIPAL OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR POLICYHOLDERS ARE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OR SMALL FLEET OPERATORS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS LIKE ILLINOIS, LOUISIANA, NEVADA AND NEW YORK, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH LARGER OPERATORS WHO RETAIN A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN RISK OF LOSS THROUGH HIGHER RETENTIONS, SELF-INSURANCE OR SELF-FUNDED CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITY ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT IN THE AREAS OF DAY-TO-DAY POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND CLAIMS HANDLING CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE PROPOSITION WE OFFER TO ALL OF OUR INSUREDS, GENERALLY ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE EXCESS COVERAGE ABOVE THE LEVELS OF RISK RETAINED BY THE INSUREDS WHERE A BETTER THAN AVERAGE LOSS RATIO IS EXPECTED. THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE SIGNIFICANT SPECIALIZED OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAINTAIN TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE.  THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR IS A SUBSET OF THE BROADER COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SEGMENT, WHICH OVER THE LONG TERM HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY PROFITABLE. IN MORE RECENT YEARS THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN PROFITABILITY PRESSURE. DATA COMPILED BY S&P GLOBAL ALSO INDICATES THAT IN 2018 THE TOTAL MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $40.4 BILLION. THE SIZE OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET CAN BE AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA OF AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CARRIERS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF EXCESS UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND HIGHER PREMIUM RATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATORS OF \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILES MAY BE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET TO TAKE VEHICLES OUT OF SERVICE, AS THEIR BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS REPUTATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON AVAILABILITY. OUR TARGET MARKET HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF TNC AND OTHER TRENDS RELATED TO MOBILITY. THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF TNC HAS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN TAXI VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO INSURE; HOWEVER, IT HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF LIVERY OPERATORS. MARKET RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE COMBINED ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL TAXI, LIVERY AND TNC COMPANIES EXPANDED DURING 2018.  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF OUR SURETY PROGRAM, GATEWAY\u2019S TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, AMERICAN SERVICE\u2019S NON-STANDARD PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS, ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI, OTHER LIABILITY, GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS. ALL OF THE OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS ARE IN RUN-OFF EXCEPT FOR OTHER LIABILITY AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS.  OUR SURETY PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF U.S. CUSTOMS BONDS. WE ENGAGE A FORMER AFFILIATE, AVALON RISK MANAGEMENT, TO HELP COORDINATE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CLAIMS HANDLING FOR THE SURETY BONDS WRITTEN AS THIS PROGRAM RUNS-OFF. THIS NON-CORE PROGRAM IS 100% REINSURED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AND HAS BEEN TRANSITIONED TO ANOTHER CARRIER.  THE GATEWAY TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS WERE PUT INTO RUN-OFF DURING 2012. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS 100% REINSURED RETROSPECTIVELY AND PROSPECTIVELY TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED DURING 2017.  NON-STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS PRINCIPALLY PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR PAYMENT HISTORY, DRIVING RECORD, PLACE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, VEHICLE TYPE OR OTHER FACTORS. SUCH DRIVERS TYPICALLY REPRESENT HIGHER THAN NORMAL RISKS AND PAY HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR COMPARABLE COVERAGE. CONSISTENT WITH ATLAS\u2019 FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, ATLAS HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM THE NON-STANDARD AUTO LINE. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES CEASED WRITING NEW AND RENEWAL POLICIES OF THIS TYPE IN 2011, AND EARNED PREMIUM DISCONTINUED IN 2012, ALLOWING SURPLUS AND RESOURCES TO BE DEVOTED TO THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS.  GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, WAS PLACED INTO RUN-OFF PRIOR TO ATLAS\u2019 ACQUISITION.THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL BOOK OF BUSINESS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, THAT IS STILL IN RUN-OFF.  ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI AND OTHER LIABILITY ARE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED ONLY TO INSUREDS WHO PURCHASE OUR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS NON-RENEWED IN 2018 DUE TO LIMITED DEMAND.  ASSIGNED RISK POOLS ARE ESTABLISHED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO COVER HIGH-RISK INSUREDS WHO CANNOT PURCHASE INSURANCE THROUGH CONVENTIONAL MEANS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORONAVIRUS IMPACT  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) ON OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN MANY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ISSUED TRAVEL ADVISORIES, CANCELED LARGE SCALE PUBLIC EVENTS AND CLOSED SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO CANCEL CONFERENCES AND TRAVEL PLANS AND REQUIRE EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  ADVERSE EVENTS SUCH AS HEALTH-RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT WORKING IN OUR OFFICES, THE INABILITY TO TRAVEL, POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS, AND OTHER MATTERS AFFECTING THE GENERAL WORK AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE CURRENT GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE.  2019 DEVELOPMENTS  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO TIMELY FILE ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, JUNE 30, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO DELAYS IN THE YEAR END AUDIT PROCESS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DELINQUENCY NOTICES FROM NASDAQ RELATED TO THESE FILINGS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS.  NASDAQ GRANTED THE COMPANY\u2019S REQUEST TO MOVE FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND GRANTED THE COMPANY AN EXTENSION TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS LISTING OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES CONTINUE TO TRADE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S 6.625% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2022 MOVED TO THE OTC PINK SHEETS ON OCTOBER 17, 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON APRIL 29, 2019, RSM US, LLP (\"RSM\") WAS DISMISSED AS THE CORPORATION\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  AT THE TIME RSM WAS DISMISSED, THE CORPORATION HAD NOT YET ENGAGED A SUCCESSOR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BAKER TILLY VIRCHOW KRAUSE, LLP (\u201cBAKER TILLY\u201d) WAS ENGAGED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO AUDIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THROUGHOUT 2019, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FURTHER STRENGTHENING ITS PROCESSES, REVIEWING ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES, A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY OR CERTAIN ASSETS, AND BALANCE SHEET STRENGTHENING OPTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF FACILITATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE GENERATION.  ATLAS CONCLUDED THAT THE UTILIZATION OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED MGA OPERATION TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS FOCUS, EXPERIENCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS.  A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED EFFECTIVE JUNE 10, 2019 BETWEEN ATLAS AND AMERICAN FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (NYSE: AFG), UNDER WHICH ATLAS WILL ACT AS AN UNDERWRITING MANAGER FOR AFG\u2019S NATIONAL INTERSTATE (\u201cNATL\u201d) SUBSIDIARY AND TRANSITION NEW AND RENEWAL PARATRANSIT BUSINESS TO NATL PAPER FOR THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING MGA RELATIONSHIPS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS AS WELL.  THE COMPANY AGREED THAT SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO SELL ITS MGA OPERATIONS, 49% OF THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE SALE OF AGMI WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES TO FACILITATE THE REHABILITATION PROCESS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS ALLOCATED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY.  DURING 2019, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (THE \u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d) PLACED ALL THREE OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES (AFTER GATEWAY WAS REDOMESTICATED IN ILLINOIS) INTO REHABILITATION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AS THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR.  WHILE IN REHABILITATION, THE OPERATIONS OF SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR ALTHOUGH ATLAS CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S OVERRIDING STRATEGIC PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A TRANSITION OF BUSINESS FROM THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKETS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME UTILIZING THE EXISTING PLATFORM OF THE MGA TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2019, NO NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY THE ASI POOL COMPANIES, AND ONLY NEW YORK AREA NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY GLOBAL LIBERTY, WHICH IS FOCUSING ITS RESOURCES ON NEW YORK AREA BUSINESS TO LEVERAGE THE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S HERITAGE IN THIS LARGE AND SPECIFIC MARKET. THE ASI POOL COMPANIES AND GLOBAL LIBERTY CONTINUED TO WRITE RENEWAL BUSINESS THAT MET THEIR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DURING 2019.  NON-RENEWALS RELATED TO ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 INSURANCE POLICIES BEGAN TOWARDS THE END OF 2019.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 22, 2020, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT WITH BUCKLE, A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY, TO PURCHASE THE STOCK OF ATLAS\u2019 INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY GATEWAY AND ITS CORPORATE CHARTER AND FORTY-SEVEN (47) STATE INSURANCE LICENSES AS WELL AS STATE STATUTORY DEPOSITS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER NECESSARY APPROVALS, FOR $4.7 MILLION PLUS THE VALUE OF ALL PURCHASED DEPOSITS, SUCH AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE REHABILITATOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REHABILITATION ESTATE OF GATEWAY, WITH A TENTATIVE CLOSING DATE IN APRIL OF 2020.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT BUCKLE WILL ENGAGE THE MGA AND CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUCKLE AND THAT BUCKLE WILL LEASE SPACE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS AND ITS MELVILLE, NY OFFICE.  THE TRANSACTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL AND A BID PROCESS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR AND APPROVED BY THE COURT, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL BE CONSUMMATED ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN OR AT ALL.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NUMEROUS CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND PRESS RELEASES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018 PROVIDE MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE ABOVE EVENTS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  II.

OUR UNDERWRITING APPROACH IS TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING UNDERWRITING PROFIT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE OWN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PHILOSOPHY IS TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING MARGIN OVER TOP LINE GROWTH. AS WITH ALL P&C INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE IMPACT OF PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES IS REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OVER TIME. UNDERWRITING CHANGES ON OUR IN-FORCE POLICIES OCCUR AS THEY ARE RENEWED. THIS CYCLE GENERALLY TAKES TWELVE MONTHS FOR OUR ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS TO EARN A FULL YEAR OF PREMIUM AT THE RENEWAL RATE.  WE APPROACH INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF SUPPORTING INSURANCE OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING A STABLE SOURCE OF INCOME TO SUPPLEMENT UNDERWRITING INCOME. THE GOALS OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE TO PROTECT CAPITAL WHILE OPTIMIZING INVESTMENT INCOME AND CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY. WE FOLLOW A FORMAL INVESTMENT POLICY, AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AT LEAST QUARTERLY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROVIDES INTERIM GUIDANCE AND ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO ASSET ALLOCATION, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.  AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITIES IN 2019, LIQUIDITY NEEDS RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  JUNE 30, 2019.  EXPENSES  NET CLAIMS INCURRED EXPENSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS WE WRITE AND OF THE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WE RECORD NET CLAIMS INCURRED BASED ON AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS WE EXPECT TO BE REPORTED ON CONTRACTS WRITTEN. WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH CASE RESERVES AT THE PROBABLE EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, AND BEGINNING IN 2016, THE USE OF CLAIM RELATED ANALYTICS. OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE NET CLAIMS INCURRED ACCURATELY AT THE TIME OF PRICING OUR CONTRACTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING OUR PROFITABILITY. THE AMOUNT REPORTED UNDER NET CLAIMS INCURRED IN ANY PERIOD INCLUDES PAYMENTS IN THE PERIOD NET OF THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE RESERVES FOR NET CLAIMS INCURRED BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS WELL AS ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE TRENDS OR CHANGES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS RELIED ON INDEPENDENT ACTUARIAL PROFESSIONALS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THIS REGARD, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA OF OUR BUSINESS.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART 1, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d  FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  JUNE 30, 2019.  ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PREMIUM TAXES. THE BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BY CEDING COMMISSIONS RECEIVED FROM ASSUMING REINSURERS THAT REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WRITTEN AND VARY DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT AND TYPES OF CONTRACTS WRITTEN.  OTHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL RELATED EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES, BENEFITS AND CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AWARDS UNDER OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, SUCH AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND OTHER GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR PERSONNEL EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN NATURE, CHANGES IN PREMIUM WRITINGS MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATING SCALE AND OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS.

THE DECREASE OF IN-FORCE PREMIUM SINCE  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM DECREASED PREMIUM WRITTEN IN THE LIVERY/TNC AND TAXI LINES.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  INVESTMENTS  OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY  ATLAS ALIGNS ITS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO SUPPORT THE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING CASH NEEDS OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS. ATLAS INVESTS PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RELATIVELY SHORT DURATIONS THAT CORRELATE WITH THE PAYOUT PATTERNS OF ATLAS\u2019 CLAIMS LIABILITIES. ATLAS ALSO INVESTS OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN SELECTIVE DIRECT INVESTMENTS WITH FAVORABLE RETURN ATTRIBUTES. A THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM MANAGES ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES AS APPROVED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ATLAS MONITORS THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH ITS MANDATE AND ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT GUIDELINES STRESS THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MARKET LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT PAYMENT OF LIABILITIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF RISK. WITH RESPECT TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES SECURITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION OF HOLDING THEM TO THEIR MATURITIES; HOWEVER, THE SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE IF LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARISE. TO THE EXTENT THAT INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR DECREASE, UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES MAY RESULT.

ACTUAL MATURITIES MAY DIFFER FROM CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES, BECAUSE CERTAIN ISSUERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL OR PREPAY OBLIGATIONS WITH OR WITHOUT CALL OR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. ATLAS HOLDS CASH AND HIGH GRADE SHORT-TERM ASSETS, WHICH, ALONG WITH FIXED INCOME SECURITY MATURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL CASH IS REQUIRED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS, ATLAS BELIEVES THAT A HIGH QUALITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PROVIDES US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY.

ATLAS IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENTS AND BALANCES RECEIVABLE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AGENTS AND REINSURERS. IT MONITORS CONCENTRATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RISK THROUGH POLICIES DESIGNED TO LIMIT AND MONITOR ITS EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS OR RELATED GROUPS (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS) AS WELL AS THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW OF THE CREDIT RATINGS OF ISSUERS IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDER IS NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURANCE POLICIES, HOWEVER, ARE DISTRIBUTED BY AGENTS WHO MAY MANAGE CASH COLLECTION ON ITS BEHALF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGENCY AGREEMENT. ATLAS HAS PROTOCOLS TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM SIMILAR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ACTIVITIES, OR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REINSURERS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURERS\u2019 INSOLVENCY.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT  ATLAS RECOGNIZES LOSSES ON SECURITIES FOR WHICH A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE WAS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF THE SECURITIES HOLDINGS TO DETERMINE IF DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ATLAS DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHARGES FOR SECURITIES IMPAIRMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THE LENGTH OF TIME SECURITIES MAY BE HELD IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION MAY VARY BASED ON THE OPINION OF THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYSES RELATED TO VALUATION AND TO THE VARIOUS CREDIT RISKS THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM RECAPTURING THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT. IN CASES OF SECURITIES WITH A MATURITY DATE WHERE THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER DETERMINES THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RISK OF DEFAULT PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A HOLDING, ATLAS WOULD ELECT TO HOLD THE SECURITY IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION UNTIL THE PRICE RECOVERS OR THE SECURITY MATURES. IN SITUATIONS WHERE FACTS EMERGE THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RECAPTURE OF PRINCIPAL, ATLAS MAY ELECT TO SELL SECURITIES AT A LOSS.  THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $35.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $115.4 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ASSESS THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME ASSETS, IF REQUIRED, ON A REGULAR BASIS.  DUE FROM REINSURERS  ATLAS PURCHASES REINSURANCE FROM THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS LIABILITY ON INDIVIDUAL RISKS AND ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE CLAIMS. REINSURANCE IS COVERAGE PURCHASED BY ONE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM ANOTHER FOR PART OF THE RISK ORIGINALLY UNDERWRITTEN BY THE PURCHASING (CEDING) INSURANCE COMPANY. THE PRACTICE OF CEDING INSURANCE TO REINSURERS ALLOWS AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS BY SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND TYPE OF RISK OR ON A PARTICULAR POLICY. AN EFFECT OF CEDING INSURANCE IS TO PERMIT AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO WRITE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE FOR RISKS IN GREATER NUMBERS OR IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE INSURE INDEPENDENTLY, BASED ON ITS STATUTORY CAPITAL, RISK TOLERANCE AND OTHER FACTORS.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO LIMIT NET EXPOSURE TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON ANY ONE LOSS OF $500,000 WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS. ATLAS ALSO PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST AWARDS IN EXCESS OF ITS POLICY LIMITS. ATLAS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS REINSURANCE NEEDS BASED ON BUSINESS VOLUME, MIX, AND SUPPLY LEVELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR ASI POOL COMPANIES AND THE GLOBAL QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY.  REINSURANCE CEDED DOES NOT RELIEVE ATLAS OF ITS ULTIMATE LIABILITY TO ITS INSUREDS IN THE EVENT THAT ANY REINSURER IS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THEREFORE, ATLAS ENTERS INTO REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH ONLY THOSE REINSURERS DEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED COVERAGE. REINSURANCE TREATIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION BY THE REINSURERS OR ATLAS ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION ANNUALLY. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF A REINSURER. ATLAS BELIEVES THAT THE AMOUNTS IT HAS RECORDED AS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED. ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, AND THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS HAD  $84.4 MILLION  RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS (EXCLUSIVE OF AMOUNTS PREPAID) AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $81.2 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE AMOUNT RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN CEDED CASE AND IBNR RESERVES AND THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON PAID CLAIMS.  ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. AS UNDERLYING RESERVES POTENTIALLY DEVELOP, THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS\u2019 REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS REINSURERS, AND THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE, AND AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR, IF NEEDED.  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JULY 31, 2019, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD TERMINATE ON A CUT-OFF BASIS.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 QUOTA SHARE CONTRACT WITH SWISS RE WAS TERMINATED ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.  DURING 2020, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY WOULD TERMINATE ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.

THE CHANGE TO THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN WRITTEN PREMIUM. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENT PROVISIONS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT.

THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF ATLAS\u2019 BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON SECURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, COMMISSIONS AND GENERAL EXPENSES.  AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ATLAS MAY DERIVE CASH FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CHARGE MANAGEMENT FEES TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY STATUTE OR OTHER REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS.

REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IN THE \u2018INVESTMENTS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY\u2019 SECTION. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN THE EVENT THAT DIVIDENDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY ARE INADEQUATE TO SERVICE ITS OBLIGATIONS, THE HOLDING COMPANY WOULD NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL, SELL ASSETS OR INCUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK SENIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ANY OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS THAT IS BY ITS TERMS EXPRESSLY SUBORDINATED OR JUNIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ALL OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS, BUT WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO ANY SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING SUCH SECURED INDEBTEDNESS.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION, THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL BE STRUCTURALLY SUBORDINATED TO THE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ATLAS\u2019 SUBSIDIARIES.  THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WERE ISSUED UNDER AN INDENTURE AND SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE THAT CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT: (I) THE ABILITY OF ATLAS TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, OR LEASE, SELL, ASSIGN OR TRANSFER ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS; (II) THE ABILITY OF ATLAS TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES; (III) THE ABILITY OF CERTAIN OF ATLAS\u2019 SUBSIDIARIES TO ISSUE EQUITY SECURITIES; (IV) THE ABILITY OF ATLAS TO PERMIT CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, OR LEASE, SELL, ASSIGN OR TRANSFER ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ASSETS; AND (V) THE ABILITY OF ATLAS AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO INCUR DEBT SECURED BY EQUITY SECURITIES OF CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

WE RECEIVE MOST PREMIUMS IN ADVANCE OF THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ON PAID CLAIMS.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $38.1 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES. SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS  $15.6 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THE REPAYMENT OF TWO COLLATERAL LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF SHARES REPURCHASED UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON MARCH 21, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO  650,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BLOCK PURCHASES, OR OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT UNTIL MARCH 21, 2018. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS NOT EXTENDED. THE COMPANY\u2019S DECISIONS AROUND THE TIMING, VOLUME, AND NATURE OF SHARE REPURCHASES, AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES REPURCHASED, WERE DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, AND OTHER FACTORS. DURING 2018,  255,505  SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY MANAGES CAPITAL USING BOTH REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES AND INTERNAL METRICS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, RETAINED EARNINGS (DEFICIT) AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST EACH MAINTAIN A MINIMUM STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF  $1.5 MILLION  ,  $2.4 MILLION  AND  $3.5 MILLION  UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ILLINOIS INSURANCE CODE, THE MISSOURI INSURANCE CODE AND THE NEW YORK INSURANCE CODE, RESPECTIVELY. DIVIDENDS MAY ONLY BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AND PAYMENTS MAY NOT BE MADE IF SUCH SURPLUS IS LESS THAN A STIPULATED AMOUNT. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES IS THE GREATER OF STATUTORY NET INCOME OR 10% OF TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY IS THE LOWER OF 10% OF STATUTORY SURPLUS OR 100% OF ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH OUR \u201cINSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u201d: AMERICAN COUNTRY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cAMERICAN COUNTRY\u201d), AMERICAN SERVICE INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. (\u201cAMERICAN SERVICE\u201d), GATEWAY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cGATEWAY\u201d) AND GLOBAL LIBERTY INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK (\u201cGLOBAL LIBERTY\u201d) IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, ANCHOR GROUP MANAGEMENT INC. (\u201cAGMI\u201d). THIS SECTOR INCLUDES TAXI CABS, NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT, LIMOUSINE, LIVERY, INCLUDING CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES (\u201cTNCS\u201d) DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND BUSINESS AUTO. OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS BE THE PREFERRED SPECIALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE OUR VALUE PROPOSITION DELIVERS BENEFIT TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE LICENSED TO WRITE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY (\u201cP&C\u201d) INSURANCE IN  49  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d). THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT RETAIL AGENTS, AND ACTIVELY WRITE INSURANCE IN  42  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE EMBRACE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, ANALYTICS AND TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF BUILDING ON THE STRONG HERITAGE OUR SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES CULTIVATED IN THE NICHE MARKETS WE SERVE.  SINCE ATLAS\u2019 FORMATION IN 2010, WE HAVE DISPOSED OF NON-CORE ASSETS, CONSOLIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLACED INTO RUN-OFF CERTAIN NON-CORE LINES OF BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH AMERICAN COUNTRY, AMERICAN SERVICE AND GATEWAY, AND GLOBAL LIBERTY, ALONG WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, AGMI.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, CERTAIN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN IN REHABILITATION SINCE JULY 8, 2019.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE  OUR PRIMARY TARGET MARKET IS MADE UP OF SMALL TO MID-SIZE TAXI, LIMOUSINE, OTHER LIVERY, INCLUDING TNC DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT OPERATORS. THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR LIGHTWEIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES TYPICALLY WITH THE MINIMUM LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE, MUNICIPAL OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR POLICYHOLDERS ARE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OR SMALL FLEET OPERATORS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS LIKE ILLINOIS, LOUISIANA, NEVADA AND NEW YORK, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH LARGER OPERATORS WHO RETAIN A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN RISK OF LOSS THROUGH HIGHER RETENTIONS, SELF-INSURANCE OR SELF-FUNDED CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITY ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT IN THE AREAS OF DAY-TO-DAY POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND CLAIMS HANDLING CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE PROPOSITION WE OFFER TO ALL OF OUR INSUREDS, GENERALLY ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE EXCESS COVERAGE ABOVE THE LEVELS OF RISK RETAINED BY THE INSUREDS WHERE A BETTER THAN AVERAGE LOSS RATIO IS EXPECTED. THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE SIGNIFICANT SPECIALIZED OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAINTAIN TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE.  THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR IS A SUBSET OF THE BROADER COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SEGMENT, WHICH OVER THE LONG TERM HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY PROFITABLE. IN MORE RECENT YEARS THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN PROFITABILITY PRESSURE. DATA COMPILED BY S&P GLOBAL ALSO INDICATES THAT IN 2018 THE TOTAL MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $40.4 BILLION. THE SIZE OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET CAN BE AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA OF AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CARRIERS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF EXCESS UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND HIGHER PREMIUM RATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATORS OF \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILES MAY BE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET TO TAKE VEHICLES OUT OF SERVICE, AS THEIR BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS REPUTATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON AVAILABILITY. OUR TARGET MARKET HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF TNC AND OTHER TRENDS RELATED TO MOBILITY. THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF TNC HAS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN TAXI VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO INSURE; HOWEVER, IT HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF LIVERY OPERATORS. MARKET RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE COMBINED ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL TAXI, LIVERY AND TNC COMPANIES EXPANDED DURING 2018.  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF OUR SURETY PROGRAM, GATEWAY\u2019S TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, AMERICAN SERVICE\u2019S NON-STANDARD PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS, ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI, OTHER LIABILITY, GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS. ALL OF THE OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS ARE IN RUN-OFF EXCEPT FOR OTHER LIABILITY AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS.  OUR SURETY PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF U.S. CUSTOMS BONDS. WE ENGAGE A FORMER AFFILIATE, AVALON RISK MANAGEMENT, TO HELP COORDINATE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CLAIMS HANDLING FOR THE SURETY BONDS WRITTEN AS THIS PROGRAM RUNS-OFF. THIS NON-CORE PROGRAM IS 100% REINSURED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AND HAS BEEN TRANSITIONED TO ANOTHER CARRIER.  THE GATEWAY TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS WERE PUT INTO RUN-OFF DURING 2012. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS 100% REINSURED RETROSPECTIVELY AND PROSPECTIVELY TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED DURING 2017.  NON-STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS PRINCIPALLY PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR PAYMENT HISTORY, DRIVING RECORD, PLACE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, VEHICLE TYPE OR OTHER FACTORS. SUCH DRIVERS TYPICALLY REPRESENT HIGHER THAN NORMAL RISKS AND PAY HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR COMPARABLE COVERAGE. CONSISTENT WITH ATLAS\u2019 FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, ATLAS HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM THE NON-STANDARD AUTO LINE. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES CEASED WRITING NEW AND RENEWAL POLICIES OF THIS TYPE IN 2011, AND EARNED PREMIUM DISCONTINUED IN 2012, ALLOWING SURPLUS AND RESOURCES TO BE DEVOTED TO THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS.  GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, WAS PLACED INTO RUN-OFF PRIOR TO ATLAS\u2019 ACQUISITION.THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL BOOK OF BUSINESS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, THAT IS STILL IN RUN-OFF.  ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI AND OTHER LIABILITY ARE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED ONLY TO INSUREDS WHO PURCHASE OUR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS NON-RENEWED IN 2018 DUE TO LIMITED DEMAND.  ASSIGNED RISK POOLS ARE ESTABLISHED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO COVER HIGH-RISK INSUREDS WHO CANNOT PURCHASE INSURANCE THROUGH CONVENTIONAL MEANS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORONAVIRUS IMPACT  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) ON OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN MANY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ISSUED TRAVEL ADVISORIES, CANCELED LARGE SCALE PUBLIC EVENTS AND CLOSED SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO CANCEL CONFERENCES AND TRAVEL PLANS AND REQUIRE EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  ADVERSE EVENTS SUCH AS HEALTH-RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT WORKING IN OUR OFFICES, THE INABILITY TO TRAVEL, POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS, AND OTHER MATTERS AFFECTING THE GENERAL WORK AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE CURRENT GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE.  2019 DEVELOPMENTS  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO TIMELY FILE ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, JUNE 30, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO DELAYS IN THE YEAR END AUDIT PROCESS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DELINQUENCY NOTICES FROM NASDAQ RELATED TO THESE FILINGS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS.  NASDAQ GRANTED THE COMPANY\u2019S REQUEST TO MOVE FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND GRANTED THE COMPANY AN EXTENSION TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS LISTING OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES CONTINUE TO TRADE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S 6.625% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2022 MOVED TO THE OTC PINK SHEETS ON OCTOBER 17, 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON APRIL 29, 2019, RSM US, LLP (\"RSM\") WAS DISMISSED AS THE CORPORATION\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  AT THE TIME RSM WAS DISMISSED, THE CORPORATION HAD NOT YET ENGAGED A SUCCESSOR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BAKER TILLY VIRCHOW KRAUSE, LLP (\u201cBAKER TILLY\u201d) WAS ENGAGED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO AUDIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THROUGHOUT 2019, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FURTHER STRENGTHENING ITS PROCESSES, REVIEWING ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES, A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY OR CERTAIN ASSETS, AND BALANCE SHEET STRENGTHENING OPTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF FACILITATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE GENERATION.  ATLAS CONCLUDED THAT THE UTILIZATION OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED MGA OPERATION TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS FOCUS, EXPERIENCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS.  A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED EFFECTIVE JUNE 10, 2019 BETWEEN ATLAS AND AMERICAN FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (NYSE: AFG), UNDER WHICH ATLAS WILL ACT AS AN UNDERWRITING MANAGER FOR AFG\u2019S NATIONAL INTERSTATE (\u201cNATL\u201d) SUBSIDIARY AND TRANSITION NEW AND RENEWAL PARATRANSIT BUSINESS TO NATL PAPER FOR THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING MGA RELATIONSHIPS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS AS WELL.  THE COMPANY AGREED THAT SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO SELL ITS MGA OPERATIONS, 49% OF THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE SALE OF AGMI WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES TO FACILITATE THE REHABILITATION PROCESS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS ALLOCATED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY.  DURING 2019, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (THE \u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d) PLACED ALL THREE OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES (AFTER GATEWAY WAS REDOMESTICATED IN ILLINOIS) INTO REHABILITATION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AS THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR.  WHILE IN REHABILITATION, THE OPERATIONS OF SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR ALTHOUGH ATLAS CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S OVERRIDING STRATEGIC PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A TRANSITION OF BUSINESS FROM THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKETS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME UTILIZING THE EXISTING PLATFORM OF THE MGA TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2019, NO NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY THE ASI POOL COMPANIES, AND ONLY NEW YORK AREA NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY GLOBAL LIBERTY, WHICH IS FOCUSING ITS RESOURCES ON NEW YORK AREA BUSINESS TO LEVERAGE THE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S HERITAGE IN THIS LARGE AND SPECIFIC MARKET. THE ASI POOL COMPANIES AND GLOBAL LIBERTY CONTINUED TO WRITE RENEWAL BUSINESS THAT MET THEIR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DURING 2019.  NON-RENEWALS RELATED TO ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 INSURANCE POLICIES BEGAN TOWARDS THE END OF 2019.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 22, 2020, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT WITH BUCKLE, A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY, TO PURCHASE THE STOCK OF ATLAS\u2019 INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY GATEWAY AND ITS CORPORATE CHARTER AND FORTY-SEVEN (47) STATE INSURANCE LICENSES AS WELL AS STATE STATUTORY DEPOSITS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER NECESSARY APPROVALS, FOR $4.7 MILLION PLUS THE VALUE OF ALL PURCHASED DEPOSITS, SUCH AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE REHABILITATOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REHABILITATION ESTATE OF GATEWAY, WITH A TENTATIVE CLOSING DATE IN APRIL OF 2020.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT BUCKLE WILL ENGAGE THE MGA AND CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUCKLE AND THAT BUCKLE WILL LEASE SPACE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS AND ITS MELVILLE, NY OFFICE.

OUR UNDERWRITING APPROACH IS TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING UNDERWRITING PROFIT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE OWN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PHILOSOPHY IS TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING MARGIN OVER TOP LINE GROWTH. AS WITH ALL P&C INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE IMPACT OF PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES IS REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OVER TIME. UNDERWRITING CHANGES ON OUR IN-FORCE POLICIES OCCUR AS THEY ARE RENEWED. THIS CYCLE GENERALLY TAKES TWELVE MONTHS FOR OUR ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS TO EARN A FULL YEAR OF PREMIUM AT THE RENEWAL RATE.  WE APPROACH INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF SUPPORTING INSURANCE OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING A STABLE SOURCE OF INCOME TO SUPPLEMENT UNDERWRITING INCOME. THE GOALS OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE TO PROTECT CAPITAL WHILE OPTIMIZING INVESTMENT INCOME AND CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY. WE FOLLOW A FORMAL INVESTMENT POLICY, AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AT LEAST QUARTERLY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROVIDES INTERIM GUIDANCE AND ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO ASSET ALLOCATION, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.  AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITIES IN 2019, LIQUIDITY NEEDS RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE.

EXPENSES  NET CLAIMS INCURRED EXPENSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS WE WRITE AND OF THE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WE RECORD NET CLAIMS INCURRED BASED ON AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS WE EXPECT TO BE REPORTED ON CONTRACTS WRITTEN. WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH CASE RESERVES AT THE PROBABLE EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, AND BEGINNING IN 2016, THE USE OF CLAIM RELATED ANALYTICS. OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE NET CLAIMS INCURRED ACCURATELY AT THE TIME OF PRICING OUR CONTRACTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING OUR PROFITABILITY. THE AMOUNT REPORTED UNDER NET CLAIMS INCURRED IN ANY PERIOD INCLUDES PAYMENTS IN THE PERIOD NET OF THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE RESERVES FOR NET CLAIMS INCURRED BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS WELL AS ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE TRENDS OR CHANGES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS RELIED ON INDEPENDENT ACTUARIAL PROFESSIONALS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THIS REGARD, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA OF OUR BUSINESS.

ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PREMIUM TAXES. THE BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BY CEDING COMMISSIONS RECEIVED FROM ASSUMING REINSURERS THAT REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WRITTEN AND VARY DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT AND TYPES OF CONTRACTS WRITTEN.  OTHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL RELATED EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES, BENEFITS AND CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AWARDS UNDER OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, SUCH AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND OTHER GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR PERSONNEL EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN NATURE, CHANGES IN PREMIUM WRITINGS MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATING SCALE AND OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS.

INCOME TAXES  UPON THE TRANSACTION FORMING ATLAS ON DECEMBER 31, 2010, A YEARLY LIMITATION AS REQUIRED BY IRC SECTION 382 THAT APPLIES TO CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP ON THE FUTURE UTILIZATION OF ATLAS\u2019 NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WAS CALCULATED. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 PRIOR PARENT RETAINED THOSE TAX ASSETS PREVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD NOT BE UTILIZED BY ATLAS AS A RESULT OF THIS LIMITATION. AS A RESULT, ATLAS\u2019 ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FUTURE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A PORTION OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERATED DURING PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT DETERMINED UNDER IRC SECTION 382. THE RESULT IS A MAXIMUM EXPECTED NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH ATLAS HAS AVAILABLE AFTER THE MERGER AND BELIEVED MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT TO BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, ATLAS CONSIDERS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  POSITIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE PROFIT WITH VEHICLES IN-FORCE AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS AND STEADY NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS;  \u2022  ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES IN CORE LINES AS THE COMMERCIAL AUTO MARKET IS FIRMING;  \u2022  OUR BELIEF THAT PREDICTIVE MODELING IN UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS SHOULD GENERATE BETTER PRICED RISKS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CREATE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OVER TIME; AND  \u2022  POSITIVE GROWTH TRENDS IN GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN EACH YEAR SINCE FORMATION.  NEGATIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  NET LOSSES GENERATED IN THE THREE MOST RECENT YEARS; AND  \u2022  YEARLY LIMITATION AS REQUIRED BY IRC SECTION 382 ON NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS GENERATED PRIOR TO 2013.  NET (LOSS) INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  ATLAS HAD A NET LOSS OF  $2.2 MILLION  AND  $6.2 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $5.6 MILLION  AND  $16.7 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. LOSS PER COMMON SHARE DILUTED WAS  $0.19  AND  $0.52  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE DILUTED OF  $0.47  AND  $1.39  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  III. FINANCIAL CONDITION  INVESTMENTS  OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY  ATLAS ALIGNS ITS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO SUPPORT THE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING CASH NEEDS OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS. ATLAS INVESTS PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RELATIVELY SHORT DURATIONS THAT CORRELATE WITH THE PAYOUT PATTERNS OF ATLAS\u2019 CLAIMS LIABILITIES. ATLAS ALSO INVESTS OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN SELECTIVE DIRECT INVESTMENTS WITH FAVORABLE RETURN ATTRIBUTES. A THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM MANAGES ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES AS APPROVED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ATLAS MONITORS THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH ITS MANDATE AND ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT GUIDELINES STRESS THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MARKET LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT PAYMENT OF LIABILITIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF RISK. WITH RESPECT TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES SECURITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION OF HOLDING THEM TO THEIR MATURITIES; HOWEVER, THE SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE IF LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARISE. TO THE EXTENT THAT INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR DECREASE, UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES MAY RESULT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH GAINS OR LOSSES BEING REALIZED.

THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE  $19.5 MILLION  AND  $25.0 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE IN CARRYING VALUE IS RELATED TO REDEMPTIONS OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS AND CHANGES IN CARRYING VALUE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .

ACTUAL MATURITIES MAY DIFFER FROM CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES, BECAUSE CERTAIN ISSUERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL OR PREPAY OBLIGATIONS WITH OR WITHOUT CALL OR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. ATLAS HOLDS CASH AND HIGH GRADE SHORT-TERM ASSETS, WHICH, ALONG WITH FIXED INCOME SECURITY MATURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL CASH IS REQUIRED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS, ATLAS BELIEVES THAT A HIGH QUALITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PROVIDES US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY.

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY HAVE A MODEST MARKET VALUE IMPACT ON THE ATLAS PORTFOLIO RELATIVE TO LONGER DURATION PORTFOLIOS. ATLAS CAN AND TYPICALLY DOES HOLD BONDS TO MATURITY BY MATCHING DURATION WITH THE ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

CREDIT RISK  CREDIT RISK IS DEFINED AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT TO DISCHARGE AN OBLIGATION. ATLAS IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENTS AND BALANCES RECEIVABLE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AGENTS AND REINSURERS. IT MONITORS CONCENTRATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RISK THROUGH POLICIES DESIGNED TO LIMIT AND MONITOR ITS EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR RELATED GROUPS (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS) AS WELL AS THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW OF THE CREDIT RATINGS OF ISSUERS IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDER IS NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURANCE POLICIES, HOWEVER, ARE DISTRIBUTED BY AGENTS WHO MAY MANAGE CASH COLLECTION ON ITS BEHALF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGENCY AGREEMENT. ATLAS HAS PROTOCOLS TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM SIMILAR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ACTIVITIES, OR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REINSURERS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURERS\u2019 INSOLVENCY.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT  ATLAS RECOGNIZES LOSSES ON SECURITIES FOR WHICH A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE WAS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF THE SECURITIES HOLDINGS TO DETERMINE IF DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ATLAS DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHARGES FOR SECURITIES IMPAIRMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THE LENGTH OF TIME SECURITIES MAY BE HELD IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION MAY VARY BASED ON THE OPINION OF THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYSES RELATED TO VALUATION AND TO THE VARIOUS CREDIT RISKS THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM RECAPTURING THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT. IN CASES OF SECURITIES WITH A MATURITY DATE WHERE THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER DETERMINES THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RISK OF DEFAULT PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A HOLDING, ATLAS WOULD ELECT TO HOLD THE SECURITY IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION UNTIL THE PRICE RECOVERS OR THE SECURITY MATURES. IN SITUATIONS WHERE FACTS EMERGE THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RECAPTURE OF PRINCIPAL, ATLAS MAY ELECT TO SELL SECURITIES AT A LOSS.  THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS  $19.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $115.4 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ASSESS THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME ASSETS, IF REQUIRED, ON A REGULAR BASIS.  DUE FROM REINSURERS  ATLAS PURCHASES REINSURANCE FROM THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS LIABILITY ON INDIVIDUAL RISKS AND ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE CLAIMS. REINSURANCE IS COVERAGE PURCHASED BY ONE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM ANOTHER FOR PART OF THE RISK ORIGINALLY UNDERWRITTEN BY THE PURCHASING (CEDING) INSURANCE COMPANY. THE PRACTICE OF CEDING INSURANCE TO REINSURERS ALLOWS AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS BY SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND TYPE OF RISK OR ON A PARTICULAR POLICY. AN EFFECT OF CEDING INSURANCE IS TO PERMIT AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO WRITE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE FOR RISKS IN GREATER NUMBERS OR IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE INSURE INDEPENDENTLY, BASED ON ITS STATUTORY CAPITAL, RISK TOLERANCE AND OTHER FACTORS.  ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO LIMIT NET EXPOSURE TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON ANY ONE LOSS OF $500,000 WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS. ATLAS ALSO PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST AWARDS IN EXCESS OF ITS POLICY LIMITS. ATLAS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS REINSURANCE NEEDS BASED ON BUSINESS VOLUME, MIX, AND SUPPLY LEVELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR ASI POOL COMPANIES AND THE GLOBAL QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REINSURANCE CEDED DOES NOT RELIEVE ATLAS OF ITS ULTIMATE LIABILITY TO ITS INSUREDS IN THE EVENT THAT ANY REINSURER IS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THEREFORE, ATLAS ENTERS INTO REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH ONLY THOSE REINSURERS DEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED COVERAGE. REINSURANCE TREATIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION BY THE REINSURERS OR ATLAS ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION ANNUALLY. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF A REINSURER. ATLAS BELIEVES THAT THE AMOUNTS IT HAS RECORDED AS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED. ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, AND THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS HAD  $88.5 MILLION  RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS (EXCLUSIVE OF AMOUNTS PREPAID) AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $81.2 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE AMOUNT RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN CEDED CASE AND IBNR RESERVES AND THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON PAID CLAIMS.  ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. AS UNDERLYING RESERVES POTENTIALLY DEVELOP, THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS\u2019 REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS REINSURERS, AND THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE, AND AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR, IF NEEDED.  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JULY 31, 2019, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD TERMINATE ON A CUT-OFF BASIS.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 QUOTA SHARE CONTRACT WITH SWISS RE WAS TERMINATED ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.

THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE PROVISION NECESSARILY INVOLVES RISKS THAT THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DEVIATE, PERHAPS SUBSTANTIALLY, FROM THE BEST ESTIMATES MADE. THE CHANGE TO THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN WRITTEN PREMIUM. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENT PROVISIONS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, ARE REFLECTED QUARTERLY IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME AS ESTIMATES ARE UPDATED.  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS FOR ALL DATA.

CALENDAR YEAR CLAIMS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE REPORTING PERIOD, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. CALENDAR YEAR RESULTS DO NOT CHANGE AFTER THE END OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING PERIOD, EVEN AS NEW CLAIM INFORMATION DEVELOPS. ACCIDENT YEAR CLAIMS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME AS THE ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS CHANGE DUE TO PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES FOR ALL ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THAT PERIOD.  THE CHANGE IN INCURRED RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS AND RUN-OFF COMMERCIAL AUTO.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  THE PURPOSE OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT CASH TO MEET ALL FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF ATLAS\u2019 BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON SECURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, COMMISSIONS AND GENERAL EXPENSES.  AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ATLAS MAY DERIVE CASH FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CHARGE MANAGEMENT FEES TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY STATUTE OR OTHER REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH PREMIUMS COLLECTED, INVESTMENT INCOME AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES AND MATURITY OF INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THEIR PARENTS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IN THE \u2018INVESTMENTS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY\u2019 SECTION. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN THE EVENT THAT DIVIDENDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY ARE INADEQUATE TO SERVICE ITS OBLIGATIONS, THE HOLDING COMPANY WOULD NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL, SELL ASSETS OR INCUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK SENIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ANY OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS THAT IS BY ITS TERMS EXPRESSLY SUBORDINATED OR JUNIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ALL OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS, BUT WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO ANY SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING SUCH SECURED INDEBTEDNESS.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION, THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL BE STRUCTURALLY SUBORDINATED TO THE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ATLAS\u2019 SUBSIDIARIES.

WE RECEIVE MOST PREMIUMS IN ADVANCE OF THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ON PAID CLAIMS.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS  $61.8 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES. SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS  $18.6 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THE REPAYMENT OF TWO COLLATERAL LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF SHARES REPURCHASED UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON MARCH 21, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO  650,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BLOCK PURCHASES, OR OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT UNTIL MARCH 21, 2018. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS NOT EXTENDED. THE COMPANY\u2019S DECISIONS AROUND THE TIMING, VOLUME, AND NATURE OF SHARE REPURCHASES, AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES REPURCHASED, WERE DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, AND OTHER FACTORS. DURING 2018,  255,505  SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY MANAGES CAPITAL USING BOTH REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES AND INTERNAL METRICS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, RETAINED EARNINGS (DEFICIT) AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST EACH MAINTAIN A MINIMUM STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF  $1.5 MILLION  ,  $2.4 MILLION  AND  $3.5 MILLION  UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ILLINOIS INSURANCE CODE, THE MISSOURI INSURANCE CODE AND THE NEW YORK INSURANCE CODE, RESPECTIVELY. DIVIDENDS MAY ONLY BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AND PAYMENTS MAY NOT BE MADE IF SUCH SURPLUS IS LESS THAN A STIPULATED AMOUNT. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES IS THE GREATER OF STATUTORY NET INCOME OR 10% OF TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY IS THE LOWER OF 10% OF STATUTORY SURPLUS OR 100% OF ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $8.33 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $575.0 MILLION ($555.7 MILLION NET OF RELATED FEES) FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING. WE USED SUCH PROCEEDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION (AS DEFINED BELOW), THE REPAYMENT OF PINNACLE DEBT ACQUIRED, THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN CONAGRA BRANDS DEBT, AND THE PAYMENT OF RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE INTEGRATION OF PINNACLE IS CONTINUING AND ON-TRACK. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES OF $305 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN THE INTEGRATION IS CONCLUDED.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REORGANIZED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE PINNACLE OPERATIONS INTO OUR LEGACY REPORTING SEGMENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS IS NOW BEING MANAGED. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REVISED SEGMENT PRESENTATION.  FISCAL 2020 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, RESULTS REFLECTED A DECREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, WITH ORGANIC (EXCLUDES THE IMPACTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DIVESTED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE ACQUISITION) DECREASES IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR REFRIGERATED & FROZEN SEGMENT, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT DECREASED DUE TO HIGHER INPUT COSTS, HIGHER BRAND BUILDING INVESTMENTS WITH RETAILERS, LOWER SALES VOLUMES, HIGHER INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, AND LOST PROFITS DUE TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SUPPLY CHAIN REALIZED PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SYNERGIES. OVERALL SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED IN EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR REFRIGERATED & FROZEN SEGMENT. CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THERE WERE DECREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\"SG&A\") EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF COST SYNERGIES AND REMOVAL OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY INCREASED STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE. WE RECOGNIZED LOWER EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT EARNINGS, LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE, AND HIGHER INCOME TAX EXPENSE, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. EXCLUDING ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $0.42.

WE HAVE APPROVED THE INCURRENCE OF UP TO $360.0 MILLION ($255.0 MILLION OF CASH CHARGES AND $105.0 MILLION OF NON-CASH CHARGES) IN CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES UNDER THE PINNACLE INTEGRATION RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  ALTHOUGH WE REMAIN UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ENTIRE PINNACLE INTEGRATION RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE ARE REPORTING ON ACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS FOR EACH MAJOR TYPE OF COST EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED, AND THE CHARGES THAT HAVE RESULTED OR WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTFLOWS.

COVID \u2013 19  THE IMPACT THAT THE RECENT NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS UNCERTAIN. WE EXPECT A DECREASE IN CONSUMER TRAFFIC IN AWAY-FROM-HOME FOOD OUTLETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 ACROSS ALL OF OUR MAJOR  37  MARKETS  WHICH WILL  NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR NET SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN OUR FOODSERVICE SEGMENT FOR AT LEAST THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020. WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED ORDERS FROM RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR FOOD AT HOME.  THE INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND MAY REVERSE IN THE COMING MONTHS AS CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR CHANGES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE NATURE AND TIMING OF WHEN THAT IMPACT MAY OCCUR. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY.  SEGMENT REVIEW  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REORGANIZED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE PINNACLE BUSINESS INTO OUR LEGACY REPORTING SEGMENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS IS NOW BEING MANAGED. WE NOW REFLECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FOUR REPORTING SEGMENTS: GROCERY & SNACKS, REFRIGERATED & FROZEN, INTERNATIONAL, AND FOODSERVICE. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REVISED SEGMENT PRESENTATION.  GROCERY & SNACKS  THE GROCERY & SNACKS REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED, SHELF STABLE FOOD PRODUCTS SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES.  REFRIGERATED & FROZEN  THE REFRIGERATED & FROZEN REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED, TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED FOOD PRODUCTS SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES.  INTERNATIONAL  THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED FOOD PRODUCTS, IN VARIOUS TEMPERATURE STATES, SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL AND FOODSERVICE CHANNELS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  FOODSERVICE  THE FOODSERVICE REPORTING SEGMENT INCLUDES BRANDED AND CUSTOMIZED FOOD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MEALS, ENTREES, SAUCES AND A VARIETY OF CUSTOM-MANUFACTURED CULINARY PRODUCTS PACKAGED FOR SALE TO RESTAURANTS AND OTHER FOODSERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.  PRESENTATION OF DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM ECONOMIC HEDGES OF FORECASTED CASH FLOWS IN SEGMENT RESULTS  DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE COMMODITY PRICE RISK AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ARE NOT DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. WE BELIEVE THESE DERIVATIVES PROVIDE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. AS SUCH, THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE WITH REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE REPORTING SEGMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION BEING ECONOMICALLY HEDGED IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS. IN THE EVENT THAT MANAGEMENT DETERMINES A PARTICULAR DERIVATIVE ENTERED INTO AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF A FORECASTED COMMODITY PURCHASE HAS CEASED TO FUNCTION AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE, WE CEASE RECOGNIZING FURTHER GAINS AND LOSSES ON SUCH DERIVATIVES IN CORPORATE EXPENSE AND BEGIN RECOGNIZING SUCH GAINS AND LOSSES WITHIN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS, IMMEDIATELY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE NET DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM ECONOMIC HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY CONSUMPTION AND THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK OF CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, UNDER THIS METHODOLOGY.

THE DECREASE IN VOLUMES REFLECTED LOWER IN MARKET PERFORMANCE IN OUR  HUNT'S  \u00ae  BRAND AND LOWER CONSUMPTION ACROSS MULTIPLE CATEGORIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER DUE TO A WARMER THAN NORMAL WINTER COMPARED TO HIGHER CONSUMPTION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD DUE TO WINTER STORMS. PRICE/MIX DECREASED BY 2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 1% FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES, WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD DUE TO INCREMENTAL TRADE AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND BRANDS.

SEE  \"ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY\"  ABOVE AS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTED THE COMPARABILITY OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  OUR PRIMARY FINANCING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES US FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF NECESSARY, WE USE SHORT-TERM DEBT PRINCIPALLY TO FINANCE ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR SEASONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, AND INVENTORIES, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED PAYROLL, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES), AND A COMBINATION OF EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO FINANCE BOTH OUR BASE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND OUR NON-CURRENT ASSETS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\") WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING FOR A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME OF $1.6 BILLION (SUBJECT TO INCREASE TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $2.1 BILLION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS). WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED A CREDIT FACILITY PRINCIPALLY AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT OUR RATIO OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION (\"EBITDA\") TO INTEREST EXPENSE BE NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1.0 AND OUR RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA NOT TO EXCEED CERTAIN DECREASING SPECIFIED LEVELS, RANGING FROM 5.25 THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 TO 3.75 FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 AND THEREAFTER. EACH RATIO IS TO BE CALCULATED ON A ROLLING FOUR-QUARTER BASIS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS.  WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND  MAY 26, 2019  . THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BORROWINGS DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $145.0 MILLION.  DURING FISCAL 2020 WE PREPAID THE REMAINING $400.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR $1.30 BILLION TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. PAYMENTS TOTALING $200.0 MILLION EACH WERE MADE IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020. THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED AFTER THESE REPAYMENTS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ALSO REDEEMED $250.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE OCTOBER 22, 2020.  44  AS OF THE END OF THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2020  ,  OUR SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE ALL INVESTMENT GRADE. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW AMOUNTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY  , ALTHOUGH BORROWING COSTS WOULD INCREASE. A DOWNGRADE OF OUR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING BORROWING COSTS AND CAUSING SHORTER DURATIONS, AS WELL AS MAKING ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER MORE DIFFICULT  , OR IMPOSSIBLE.  WE REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME AFTER CONSIDERING MARKET CONDITIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPURCHASE LIMITS AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD. UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR SHARES PERIODICALLY OVER SEVERAL YEARS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, AND MAY DO SO IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE. WE PLAN TO REPURCHASE SHARES UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED PROGRAM ONLY AT TIMES AND IN AMOUNTS AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIZATION OF ACHIEVING OUR LEVERAGE TARGETS. THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REMAINING SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS $1.41 BILLION.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2019, THE BOARD ANNOUNCED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.2125 PER SHARE, TO BE PAID ON MARCH 3, 2020, TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 31, 2020. SUBJECT TO MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS AND THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF $0.85 PER SHARE DURING FISCAL 2020.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR  LENDER'S  \u00ae  BAGEL BUSINESS FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $33.2 MILLION, SUBJECT TO FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR DSD SNACKS BUSINESS FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $139.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THUS FAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR UNDRAWN REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED OR NEEDED TO ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET IN RECENT WEEKS, WE ARE AWARE THAT THE IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAVE REDUCED THE AVAILABILITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. WE EXPECT THAT UNTIL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVE, ACCESSING THIS SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING COULD BE CHALLENGING OR AT ELEVATED COSTS.  WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF DEBT MATURING IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO PAY THIS DEBT, IN PART, FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, AND TO MAINTAIN OR HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE THE REMAINDER OF THE DEBT UPON MATURITY, AS MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT, FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, PROCEEDS FROM ANY DIVESTITURES AND OTHER DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, AND OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  CASH FLOWS  DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, WE USED $137.6 MILLION OF CASH, WHICH WAS THE NET RESULT OF $906.5 MILLION GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, $59.9 MILLION USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, $984.6 MILLION USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, AND AN INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $906.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO $745.1 MILLION GENERATED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF THE ADDITIONAL OPERATING RESULTS FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PINNACLE. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST AND TAX PAYMENTS AND THE COMPARATIVE IMPACT OF CASH PROCEEDS OF $47.5 MILLION RECEIVED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019. INCREASED SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILDS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECT INCREMENTAL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW INNOVATION ITEMS. THIS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS WITH CERTAIN LARGE SUPPLIERS, AND THE TIMING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CASH COLLECTIONS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $59.9 MILLION AND $5.30 BILLION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $265.3 MILLION AND THE NET PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES TOTALING $191.4 MILLION, INCLUDING THE SALES OF OUR DSD SNACKS AND  LENDER'S  \u00ae  BAGEL BUSINESSES. INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 CONSISTED MAINLY OF THE PURCHASE OF PINNACLE FOR $5.12 BILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $236.1 MILLION, AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR  DEL MONTE  \u00ae  PROCESSED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE BUSINESS IN CANADA TOTALING $32.2 MILLION.  45  CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $984.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $4.71 BILLION  IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2020 CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF THE REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT TOTALING $665.9  MILLION AND CASH DIVIDENDS PAID OF  $310.1 MILLION.  I  N THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2019  ,  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, WE ISSUED LONG-TERM DEBT THAT GENERATED $8.31 BILLION IN GROSS PROCEEDS AND ISSUED COMMON STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $555.  7  MILLION. THIS WAS REDUCED BY DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS AND BRIDGE FINANCING FEES TOTALING $95.2  MILLION. WE REPAID $3.  52  BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, REDUCED OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY $27  8.  3  MILLION, AND PAID  CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $253.0 MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $99.0 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND $236.6 MILLION AT MAY 26, 2019, OF WHICH $47.3 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND $144.8 MILLION AT MAY 26, 2019 WAS HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HAVE INVESTED OR WILL INVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS INDEFINITELY, OR THAT ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WILL BE REMITTED IN A TAX-NEUTRAL TRANSACTION, AND, THEREFORE, DO NOT PROVIDE DEFERRED TAXES ON THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR ESTIMATE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2020 IS APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR REPAYMENT OF DEBT, INCLUDING ANY REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENT OF ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (I.E., OBLIGATIONS TO TRANSFER FUNDS IN THE FUTURE FOR FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES OF GOODS OR SERVICES AT FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICES, SUCH AS \"TAKE-OR-PAY\" CONTRACTS). THE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO IN OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF SOURCED PRODUCT ARE AVAILABLE. OF THESE ITEMS, DEBT, NOTES PAYABLE, FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AND OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WERE RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS AS FOLLOWS.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  (IN MILLIONS)  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  TOTAL  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  AFTER 5 YEARS  LONG-TERM DEBT  $9,906.6  $901.7  $2,482.9  $1,000.1  $5,521.9  FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS  152.4  20.7  39.0  26.0  66.7  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  314.1  56.3  83.2  52.4  122.2  PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  1  AND OTHER CONTRACTS  1,393.5  1,143.9  130.8  59.6  59.2  NOTES PAYABLE  0.8  0.8  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL  $11,767.4  $2,123.4  $2,735.9  $1,138.1  $5,770.0  1  AMOUNTS INCLUDE OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS AND AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND/OR MAY BE CANCELLABLE. SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY SETTLEABLE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTRACTS, WHICH TOTALED $1.36 BILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WERE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  WE ARE ALSO CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COUPON INTEREST RATE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.7%.  THE OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE HAVE NOT BEEN REDUCED BY NON-CANCELLABLE SUBLEASE RENTALS OF $5.9 MILLION.  AS OF MAY 26, 2019, WE HAD AGGREGATE UNFUNDED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $131.7 MILLION AND $87.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SEVERAL INTERIM PENSION REMEASUREMENTS, WE HAD AGGREGATE UNFUNDED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $31.1 MILLION AND $85.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE AS THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS ARE REMEASURED EACH FISCAL YEAR, THEREBY RESULTING IN OUR INABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUCH PLANS. BASED ON CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO FUND ANY AMOUNT TO OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL MAKE PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $14.2 MILLION AND $10.8 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO FUND OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 14, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS  46  REPORT AND NOTE 19, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \u2013  EMPLOYMENT  -  RELATED BENEFITS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY  '  S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 2  6  , 201  9  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ESTIMATES OF THIS LIABILITY.  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ONLY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUTURE EVENT (E.G., GUARANTEES OF DEBT OR LEASE PAYMENTS OF A THIRD PARTY SHOULD THE THIRD PARTY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM). IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, SUCH COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1.7 MILLION, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD $52.0 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF. THESE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR SELF-INSURED WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.  IN CERTAIN LIMITED SITUATIONS, WE WILL GUARANTEE AN OBLIGATION OF AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY. WE GUARANTEE CERTAIN LEASES RESULTING FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE JM SWANK BUSINESS COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THE REMAINING TERMS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $0.7 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE GUARANTEE A CERTAIN LEASE RESULTING FROM AN EXITED FACILITY. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THE REMAINING TERM OF THIS ARRANGEMENT DID NOT EXCEED SEVEN YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $17.1 MILLION.  WE ALSO GUARANTEE AN OBLIGATION OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS PURSUANT TO A GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SPINOFF OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS (THE \"SPINOFF\") AND REMAINED IN PLACE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE SPINOFF UNTIL SUCH GUARANTEE OBLIGATION IS SUBSTITUTED FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED BY LAMB WESTON. PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 8, 2016 (THE \"SEPARATION AGREEMENT\"), BETWEEN US AND LAMB WESTON, THIS GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT IS DEEMED A LIABILITY OF LAMB WESTON THAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO LAMB WESTON AS PART OF THE SPINOFF. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ANY SUCH LIABILITY, REDUCED BY ANY INSURANCE PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY US, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT. LAMB WESTON IS A PARTY TO AN AGRICULTURAL SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND THROUGH 2020 (SUBJECT, AT LAMB WESTON\u2019S OPTION, TO EXTENSION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL FIVE-YEAR PERIODS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN RENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE SUBLESSOR. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE SUBLESSOR LAMB WESTON'S PERFORMANCE AND THE PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS (INCLUDING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) OWED BY LAMB WESTON UNDER THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $75.0 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THE FARMLAND ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT IS READILY MARKETABLE FOR LEASE TO OTHER AREA FARMING OPERATORS. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTEE, WOULD BE LARGELY MITIGATED.  THE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS DISCLOSED ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RESERVES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN INCOME TAXES, AS WE ARE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF SETTLEMENT OF OUR RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES. THE LIABILITY FOR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS $46.2 MILLION. THE NET AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS $32.4 MILLION. RECOGNITION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  725,827  SHARES FOR  $60 MILLION  UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  1.1 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $75 MILLION  UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $967 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE, CONTINUED GROWTH AND EARNINGS EXPANSION. BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION, WE EXPECT THE RECENT PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT STARTED IN CHINA AND HAS GROWN WORLDWIDE WILL REDUCE BUSINESS RESULTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, BUT DESPITE THE SHORT-TERM UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY THIS HEALTH CRISIS, WE REMAIN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR 2020 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR ACQUISITIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.

WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT BY REDUCING OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). WE MAY ALSO HEDGE EQUITY BALANCES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY ON A LONG TERM BASIS.TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE NET SALES INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS AS WE MANAGED FIELD INVENTORY LEVELS AHEAD OF OUR KEY SELLING SEASON, AS WELL AS FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT WALK POWER MOWERS DUE TO SOFT RETAIL DEMAND AS A RESULT OF EARLY SEASON SNOWFALLS IN KEY REGIONS.  NET SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS  INCREASED  BY  24.2 PERCENT  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RESULTED IN  AN INCREASE  IN OUR NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.5 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . THE NET SALES INCREASE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT AND OUR POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS IN KEY REGIONS. THE NET SALES INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SHIPMENTS OF OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS AND WALK POWER MOWERS.

GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  37.5 PERCENT  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  170  BASIS POINTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  WAS  $288.6 MILLION  , UP  33.8 PERCENT  COMPARED TO  $215.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  .

THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AND ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRATEGIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SYNERGY INITIATIVES, IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION AS A RESULT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND THE REVISED FLOOR PLAN FINANCING RATE STRUCTURE UNDER OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE, LOWER FREIGHT COSTS DUE TO COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, AND LOWER COMMODITY AND TARIFF COSTS. THESE INCREASES IN GROSS MARGIN AND ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE INCREMENTAL SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION.  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT AND ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS MARGIN EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS INTEGRATION COSTS AND CHARGES INCURRED FOR THE TAKE-DOWN OF THE INVENTORY FAIR VALUE STEP-UP AMOUNT RESULTING FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. RECONCILIATIONS OF ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE REPORTED U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SECTION TITLED \"ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS\" WITHIN THIS MD&A.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SG&A EXPENSE  INCREASED  140  BASIS POINTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW RESULTING IN INCREMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE, INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING, AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE; HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND INTEGRATION-RELATED EXPENDITURES; AS WELL AS HIGHER INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE, INCREASED CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS, AND HIGHER ENGINEERING EXPENSE RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN OUR LEGACY BUSINESSES. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DIRECT MARKETING EXPENSE IN OUR LEGACY BUSINESSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED  $3.4 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE INCURRED ON HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN INTEREST INCURRED ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , AS COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  $1.5 MILLION  WHEN COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS FROM OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE JOINT VENTURE, DECREASED INTEREST INCOME ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  18.6 PERCENT  COMPARED TO  15.0 PERCENT  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LOWER DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT FOR THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  21.0 PERCENT  , COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  20.9 PERCENT  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RECORDED AS EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS INTEGRATION COSTS AND CHARGES INCURRED FOR THE TAKE-DOWN OF THE INVENTORY FAIR VALUE STEP-UP AMOUNT RESULTING FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW.

THIS  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS MAINLY AS A RESULT OF STRATEGIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SYNERGY INITIATIVES AND IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX WITHIN OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT DUE TO SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION; AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION. THE NET EARNINGS INCREASE WAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE ON HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND A LOWER BENEFIT FROM THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WERE  $69.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.64  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO  $56.7 MILLION  , OR  $0.53  PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  20.8 PERCENT  PER DILUTED SHARE. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS INCREASE INCLUDED IMPROVED GROSS MARGINS MAINLY AS A RESULT OF STRATEGIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SYNERGY INITIATIVES AND IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX WITHIN OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT DUE TO SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION; AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION. THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION AS A RESULT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES AND A REVISED FLOOR PLAN FINANCING RATE STRUCTURE AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE, AND STRONG EARLY-SEASON ORDER ACTIVITY FOR OUR SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS. THE NET SALES INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS AS WE MANAGED FIELD INVENTORY LEVELS AHEAD OF OUR KEY SELLING SEASON.  SEGMENT EARNINGS  PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT EARNINGS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  INCREASED  16.5 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  AND DECREASED TO  17.2 PERCENT  FROM  19.3 PERCENT  WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER COMPARISON. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW RESULTING IN INCREMENTAL ADMINISTRATIVE, INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING, AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE; UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE INCREMENTAL SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION; AND HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS HIGHER INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXPENSE IN OUR LEGACY BUSINESSES. SOMEWHAT OFFSETTING THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION AS A RESULT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES AND A REVISED FLOOR PLAN FINANCING RATE STRUCTURE AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRATEGIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SYNERGY INITIATIVES, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING EXPENSE IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR BUSINESSES.  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT  SEGMENT NET SALES  WORLDWIDE NET SALES FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  INCREASED  14.3 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO INCREMENTAL ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWER SHIPMENTS AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPANDED MASS RETAIL CHANNEL AND INCREASED SALES OF POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF WALK POWER MOWERS DUE TO SOFT RETAIL DEMAND AS A RESULT OF EARLY SEASON SNOWFALLS IN KEY REGIONS.  SEGMENT EARNINGS  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  INCREASED  65.0 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , AND WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, INCREASED TO  13.0 PERCENT  FROM  9.0 PERCENT  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS INCREASE WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRATEGIC PRODUCTIVITY AND SYNERGY INITIATIVES, LOWER COMMODITY AND TARIFF COSTS, AND REDUCTIONS IN FREIGHT COST DUE TO COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES. THE INCREASE IN SEGMENT EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING COSTS AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION ON TOOLING RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.  OTHER ACTIVITIES  OTHER NET SALES  NET SALES FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SALES FROM OUR WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES LESS SALES FROM THE PROFESSIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS TO THE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES. NET SALES FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  INCREASED BY  $4.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , DUE TO INCREMENTAL SALES OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF A NORTHEASTERN U.S. DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.  OTHER OPERATING LOSS  THE OPERATING LOSS FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  INCREASED  $6.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM OUR CMW ACQUISITION, INCREASED EXPENSE RELATED TO CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS, HIGHER CORPORATE AND INTEGRATION COSTS AS A RESULT OF OUR CMW ACQUISITION, LOWER INCOME FROM OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE JOINT VENTURE, AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE OPERATING LOSS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR OUR WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES DRIVEN BY HIGHER SALES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE, REFER TO THE SECTION TITLED \"CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\" LOCATED WITHIN THE \"FINANCIAL POSITION\" SECTION OF THIS MD&A.  FINANCIAL POSITION  WORKING CAPITAL  OUR STRATEGY CONTINUES TO PLACE EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING ASSET UTILIZATION WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, ADJUSTING PRODUCTION PLANS, AND MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING ORDER REPLENISHMENT AND SERVICE LEVELS TO END-USERS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  INCREASED  $95.7 MILLION  , OR  42.4 PERCENT  , COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL RECEIVABLES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SALES WITHIN OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT DUE TO OUR EXPANDED MASS RETAIL CHANNEL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. INVENTORY LEVELS WERE  UP  $322.3 MILLION  , OR  77.4 PERCENT  , AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL INVENTORIES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, HIGHER RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT INVENTORIES TO SUPPORT OUR EXPANDED MASS RETAIL CHANNEL AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND HIGHER NET INVENTORY BALANCES IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR BUSINESSES AS WE MANAGED FIELD INVENTORY LEVELS AHEAD OF OUR KEY SELLING SEASON. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  INCREASED  $66.5 MILLION  , OR  23.6 PERCENT  , AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , MAINLY DUE TO INCREMENTAL ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND NEGOTIATING MORE FAVORABLE PAYMENT TERMS WITH SUPPLIERS AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL INITIATIVES.  CASH FLOW  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  $23.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  OF  $26.0 MILLION  . THIS YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH USE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH UTILIZED FOR PURCHASES OF INVENTORY AND HIGHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES NOT FINANCED THROUGH OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE DUE TO SALES TO A NEW MASS CHANNEL RETAIL PARTNER WITHIN OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET EARNINGS AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH SOURCE BENEFIT AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL INITIATIVES. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $15.0 MILLION  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LESS CASH UTILIZED FOR ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT. CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  $30.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , MAINLY DUE TO REDUCED CASH UTILIZED FOR PURCHASES OF TTC COMMON STOCK AND HIGHER NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MORE CASH UTILIZED FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS ON SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR BUSINESSES ARE SEASONALLY WORKING CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND REQUIRE FUNDING FOR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN PRODUCTION, REPLACEMENT PARTS INVENTORY, PAYROLL AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FACILITIES, EXPANSION AND RENOVATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS FOR FINANCING RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE NOT FINANCED WITH RED IRON OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES HISTORICALLY INCREASE BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL AS A RESULT OF TYPICALLY HIGHER SALES VOLUMES AND EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND TYPICALLY DECREASE BETWEEN MAY AND DECEMBER WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH EXISTING, AND POTENTIAL FUTURE, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENTS, QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, ALL AS APPLICABLE, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $69.9 MILLION.

OUR DOMESTIC AND NON-U.S. OPERATIONS MAINTAINED CREDIT LINES FOR IMPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT IN THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $13.1 MILLION  AND  $13.7 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD  $3.5 MILLION  OUTSTANDING ON SUCH LETTERS OF CREDIT AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  SEASONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE FINANCED FROM OPERATIONS, CASH ON HAND, AND WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR $600.0 MILLION UNSECURED SENIOR FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE 2023, AS APPLICABLE. INCLUDED IN OUR $600.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS A $10.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $30.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWINGLINE LOANS. AT OUR ELECTION, AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE NAMED BORROWERS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE ELECTION OF THE LENDERS TO FUND SUCH INCREASE, THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY MAY BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT UP TO $300.0 MILLION. FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND OTHER LAWFUL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACQUISITIONS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS DESCRIBED BELOW.  OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (OTHER THAN SWINGLINE LOANS), IF APPLICABLE, BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD THAT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE BETTER OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO (AS MEASURED QUARTERLY AND DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE) AND DEBT RATING OF TTC. SWINGLINE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE SWINGLINE LENDER OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD THAT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE BETTER OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO AND DEBT RATING OF TTC. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. OUR DEBT RATING FOR LONG-TERM UNSECURED SENIOR, NON-CREDIT ENHANCED DEBT WAS UNCHANGED DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BY STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP AT BBB AND BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE AT BAA3. IF OUR DEBT RATING FALLS BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND/OR OUR LEVERAGE RATIO RISES ABOVE 1.50, THE BASIS POINT SPREAD WE CURRENTLY PAY ON OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. HOWEVER, THE CREDIT COMMITMENT COULD NOT BE CANCELED BY THE BANKS BASED SOLELY ON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE. FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  , WE INCURRED INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.1 MILLION  AND  $0.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, ON THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINANCIAL COVENANTS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE AND MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS; AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS, RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, LIENS, AND OTHER MATTERS CUSTOMARILY RESTRICTED IN SUCH AGREEMENTS. MOST OF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM THRESHOLDS AND EXCEPTIONS. UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WE ARE NOT LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT FOR PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AS LONG AS, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING PRO FORMA EFFECT TO SUCH PAYMENTS, OUR LEVERAGE RATIO FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 3.5 (OR, AT OUR OPTION (WHICH WE MAY EXERCISE TWICE DURING THE TERM OF THE FACILITY) AFTER CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS WITH AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION IN EXCESS OF $75.0 MILLION, FOR THE FIRST FOUR QUARTERS FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OPTION, IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 4.0), PROVIDED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER GIVING EFFECT OF ANY SUCH PROPOSED ACTION, NO DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT WOULD EXIST. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE WERE NOT LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT FOR PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS RELATED TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , AND WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020  . IF WE WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY COVENANT REQUIRED BY THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CURE PERIOD, THE BANKS COULD TERMINATE THEIR COMMITMENTS UNLESS WE COULD NEGOTIATE A COVENANT WAIVER FROM THE BANKS. IN ADDITION, OUR LONG-TERM SENIOR NOTES, DEBENTURES, TERM LOAN FACILITIES, AND ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A COVENANT WAIVER OR REFINANCE OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  $14.0 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND  $1.9 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SUBLIMIT FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, RESULTING IN  $584.1 MILLION  OF UNUTILIZED AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  , WE HAD  $91.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND  $1.5 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SUBLIMIT FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT, RESULTING IN  $507.5 MILLION  OF UNUTILIZED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ON MARCH 2, 2020, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE FUNDED THE ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT  IN MARCH 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARTIALLY FUNDING THE PURCHASE PRICE OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND THE RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACQUISITION.

THE FUNDS UNDER BOTH TERM LOAN FACILITIES WERE RECEIVED ON APRIL 1, 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. THERE ARE NO SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY ON THE  $200.0 MILLION  THREE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY.

THE TERM LOAN FACILITIES MAY BE PREPAID AND TERMINATED AT OUR ELECTION AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAVE PREPAID  $100.0 MILLION  AND  $120.0 MILLION  AGAINST THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCES OF THE  $200.0 MILLION  THREE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND  $300.0 MILLION  FIVE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY, RESPECTIVELY.  OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE, BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS.

IF WE WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY COVENANT REQUIRED BY THIS PRIVATE PLACEMENT NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CURE PERIOD, OUR TERM LOAN FACILITIES, LONG-TERM SENIOR NOTES, DEBENTURES, AND ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WOULD BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A COVENANT WAIVER OR REFINANCE OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR PRIVATE PLACEMENT NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT.  CASH DIVIDENDS  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.25 PER SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  THAT WAS PAID ON JANUARY 9, 2020. THIS WAS AN INCREASE OF 11.1 PERCENT OVER OUR CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.225 PER SHARE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019.  SHARE REPURCHASES  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  , WE CURTAILED REPURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET UNDER OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE PLAN. WHILE WE MAY REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020  , WITH THE ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS, WE INTEND TO BE FLEXIBLE ON OUR SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020  IN LIGHT OF OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS AND DEPENDING ON DEBT REPAYMENTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND/OR OTHER FACTORS.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN THE SECTION TITLED \"WHOLESALE FINANCING\" BELOW.  WHOLESALE FINANCING  OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE WITH TCF INVENTORY FINANCE, INC. (\"TCFIF\"), A SUBSIDIARY OF TCF NATIONAL BANK, PROVIDES INVENTORY FINANCING TO CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. THAT ENABLES THEM TO CARRY REPRESENTATIVE INVENTORIES OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS. ON DECEMBER 20, 2019, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE AMENDED CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO THE RED IRON JOINT VENTURE. THE PURPOSE OF THESE AMENDMENTS WAS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO: (I) ADJUST CERTAIN RATES UNDER THE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING RATE STRUCTURE CHARGED TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS PARTICIPATING IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS THROUGH THE RED IRON JOINT VENTURE; (II) EXTEND THE TERM OF THE RED IRON JOINT VENTURE FROM OCTOBER 31, 2024 TO OCTOBER 31, 2026, SUBJECT TO TWO-YEAR EXTENSIONS THEREAFTER UNLESS EITHER WE OR TCFIF PROVIDES WRITTEN NOTICE TO THE OTHER PARTY OF NON-RENEWAL AT LEAST ONE YEAR PRIOR TO THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT TERM; (III) AMEND CERTAIN EXCLUSIVITY-RELATED PROVISIONS, INCLUDING THE DEFINITION OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO EXCLUSIVITY, INCLUSION OF A TWO-YEAR REVIEW PERIOD BY US FOR PRODUCTS ACQUIRED IN FUTURE ACQUISITIONS TO ASSESS, WITHOUT A COMMITMENT TO EXCLUSIVITY, THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND DETRIMENTS OF INCLUDING SUCH ACQUIRED PRODUCTS UNDER THE RED IRON FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, AND THE PRO-RATA PAYBACK OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF THE EXCLUSIVITY INCENTIVE PAYMENT WE RECEIVED FROM TCFIF IN 2016; (IV) EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY USED BY RED IRON PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF INVENTORY FROM US BY OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS FROM OCTOBER 31, 2024 TO OCTOBER 31, 2026 AND TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER SUCH REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM $550 MILLION TO $625 MILLION; AND (V) MEMORIALIZE CERTAIN OTHER NON-MATERIAL AMENDMENTS. UNDER SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN RED IRON AND THE DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, RED IRON PROVIDES LOANS TO THE DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE ADVANCES PAID BY RED IRON TO US. THE NET AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FINANCED FOR DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  WAS  $405.1 MILLION  AND  $428.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ALSO HAVE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING TO CERTAIN DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS NOT FINANCED THROUGH RED IRON, WHICH INCLUDE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY IN AUSTRALIA. THESE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FINANCED  $87.1 MILLION  AND  $7.8 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES FOR SUCH DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS DURING THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  ,  $161.1 MILLION  AND  $11.9 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES FINANCED BY THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES, EXCLUDING RED IRON, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OUTSTANDING.  WE ENTERED INTO A LIMITED INVENTORY REPURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH RED IRON. UNDER THE LIMITED INVENTORY REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE HAVE AGREED TO REPURCHASE PRODUCTS REPOSSESSED BY RED IRON AND TCFCFC, UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF  $7.5 MILLION  IN A CALENDAR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF OUR FLOOR PLAN FINANCING AGREEMENTS WITH THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO INVENTORY REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, FOR WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO REPURCHASE PRODUCTS REPOSSESSED BY THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE WERE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO REPURCHASE UP TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF  $128.2 MILLION  OF INVENTORY RELATED TO RECEIVABLES UNDER THESE INVENTORY REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INVENTORY REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IS LIMITED TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT PAID TO RED IRON OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS FOR REPURCHASES OF INVENTORY AND THE AMOUNT RECEIVED UPON ANY SUBSEQUENT RESALE OF THE REPOSSESSED PRODUCT. WE HAVE REPURCHASED IMMATERIAL AMOUNTS OF INVENTORY PURSUANT TO SUCH ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  . HOWEVER, A DECLINE IN RETAIL SALES OR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS OR DEALERS COULD CAUSE THIS SITUATION TO CHANGE AND THEREBY REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE FINANCED PRODUCT, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS EXISTING CONTRACTS, SUCH AS DEBT AGREEMENTS, OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS, UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS. OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS WITH RED IRON, OUR JOINT VENTURE WITH TCFIF, AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN WHICH INVENTORY RECEIVABLES FOR CERTAIN DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS ARE FINANCED BY RED IRON OR SUCH OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE USE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, IMPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT, AND SURETY BONDS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO ENSURE THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, AS REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS. OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO SUCH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS TO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS PERTAINING TO OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN THE SECTION TITLED \"WHOLESALE FINANCING\" ABOVE.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS  WE HAVE PROVIDED ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES AND METRICS THAT ARE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ACQUIRED CMW. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, REFER TO NOTE  2  ,  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  , WITHIN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED WITHIN PART 1, ITEM 1, \"FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  REPRESENT COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF VENTURE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS INTEGRATION COSTS AND CHARGES INCURRED FOR THE TAKE-DOWN OF THE INVENTORY FAIR VALUE STEP-UP AMOUNT RESULTING FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. ADDITIONALLY, WE ELECTED TO RECAST ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  FEBRUARY 1, 2019  TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION AND AS A RESULT, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WERE RESTATED TO BE INCLUSIVE OF THE COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  FEBRUARY 1, 2019.  2  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-09,  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: IMPROVEMENTS TO EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  , WHICH REQUIRES THAT ANY EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION BE IMMEDIATELY RECORDED WITHIN INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES SINCE OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  . REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7, \"MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\", AND PART II, ITEM 8, NOTE 1,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DATA  , WITHIN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE ADOPTED  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2016-03,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , WHICH MODIFIES THE MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED ON AN AMORTIZED COST BASIS FROM AN 'INCURRED LOSS' METHOD TO AN 'EXPECTED LOSS' METHOD. SUCH MODIFICATION OF THE MEASUREMENT APPROACH FOR CREDIT LOSSES ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT THAT A CREDIT LOSS BE CONSIDERED PROBABLE, OR INCURRED, TO IMPACT THE VALUATION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET MEASURED ON AN AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES TO BE BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS, AND A REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECAST THAT AFFECTS THE COLLECTABILITY OF THE RELATED FINANCIAL ASSET. THIS AMENDMENT WILL AFFECT TRADE RECEIVABLES, OFF-BALANCE-SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES, AND ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE OF THIS AMENDMENT THAT HAVE THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO RECEIVE CASH. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-13, FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820) - CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  , WHICH MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO ADD, MODIFY OR REMOVE CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY REMOVED OR MODIFIED DISCLOSURES. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-14,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS - DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS (TOPIC 715)  , WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2019-12,  INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740): SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES  , WHICH ELIMINATES CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS RELATED TO THE APPROACH FOR INTRAPERIOD TAX ALLOCATION, THE METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING INCOME TAXES IN AN INTERIM PERIOD, AND THE RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR OUTSIDE BASIS DIFFERENCES. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ALSO CLARIFIES AND SIMPLIFIES OTHER ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 740,  INCOME TAXES  . THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JANUARY 2020, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2020-01,  INVESTMENTS - EQUITY SECURITIES (TOPIC 321), INVESTMENTS - EQUITY METHOD AND JOINT VENTURES (TOPIC 323), AND DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815)  , WHICH CLARIFIED THAT BEFORE APPLYING OR UPON DISCONTINUING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AN INVESTMENT IN EQUITY SECURITIES AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER OBSERVABLE TRANSACTIONS THAT REQUIRE IT TO APPLY OR DISCONTINUE THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT ALTERNATIVE. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE FASB THAT WE HAVE NOT NOTED ABOVE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR DO NOT APPLY TO OUR OPERATIONS.

THE CORONAVIRUS), CHANGES TO U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICIES OR TRADE AGREEMENTS OR TRADE REGULATION AND/OR INDUSTRY ACTIVITY, THAT COULD OR HAVE IN THE PAST AFFECTED OUR PROFIT MARGINS, OPERATING RESULTS AND BUSINESSES AND COULD CONTINUE TO RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR PROFIT MARGINS, OPERATING RESULTS AND BUSINESSES.  \u2022  OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING GOLF COURSE REVENUES AND THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN GOLF COURSE RENOVATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS; THE LEVEL OF NEW GOLF COURSE DEVELOPMENT AND GOLF COURSE CLOSURES; INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS; DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE RENTAL, SPECIALTY AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS; THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROPERTY OWNERS OUTSOURCE THEIR LAWN CARE AND SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL ACTIVITIES; RESIDENTIAL  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND/OR MUNICIPAL COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY; CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, AG-IRRIGATION SOLUTIONS; THE TIMING AND OCCURRENCE OF WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS; AVAILABILITY OF CASH OR CREDIT TO PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT CUSTOMERS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS TO FINANCE NEW PRODUCT PURCHASES; AND THE AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES, BUDGET, AND SPENDING LEVELS FOR GROUNDS MAINTENANCE OR CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT.  \u2022  OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMERS BUYING OUR PRODUCTS AT MASS RETAILERS, DEALERS, AND HOME CENTERS; THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT AT MASS RETAILERS AND HOME CENTERS; CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING LEVELS; CHANGING BUYING PATTERNS OF CUSTOMERS; AND THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT SALES OR PROMOTIONAL EVENTS.  \u2022  OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR PROFIT MARGINS AND NET EARNINGS, CAN BE IMPACTED DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, AS OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS THAN OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS. SIMILARLY, WITHIN EACH SEGMENT, IF WE EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT GENERALLY CARRY HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING PROFIT MARGINS AND NET EARNINGS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  \u2022  WE INTEND TO GROW OUR BUSINESS IN PART THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BY OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OF CMW AND VENTURE PRODUCTS, AND ALLIANCES, STRONG CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND NEW JOINT VENTURES, INVESTMENTS, AND PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH COULD BE RISKY AND HARM OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, INVESTMENTS, AND PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH TRANSACTIONS RESULT IN DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS, WE EXPERIENCE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES, CUSTOMERS, OR CHANNEL PARTNERS, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND/OR LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCURRED AS A RESULT OF A TRANSACTION ARE SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN OFF, AND OTHER FACTORS. IF PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS DO NOT PRODUCE THE EXPECTED RESULTS OR INTEGRATION INTO OUR OPERATIONS TAKES MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED.  \u2022  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD GOODWILL OF  $362.1 MILLION  , WHICH IS MAINTAINED IN VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, INCLUDING GOODWILL FROM THE CMW ACQUISITION, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF  $347.6 MILLION  , WHICH TOGETHER COMPRISE  28.5 PERCENT  OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  . AS A RESULT OF OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED VENTURE PRODUCTS ACQUISITION, OUR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCES WILL LIKELY INCREASE. IF WE DETERMINE THAT OUR GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECORDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CMW ACQUISITION OR ANY OTHER PRIOR OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS HAVE BECOME IMPAIRED, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A CHARGE RESULTING FROM THE IMPAIRMENT. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR BUSINESS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE OR OVERESTIMATE BOTH CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, ARE NOT ABLE TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT TO FULFILL CUSTOMER DEMAND, AND/OR DO NOT PRODUCE OR MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS, OUR NET SALES, PROFIT MARGINS, NET EARNINGS, AND/OR WORKING CAPITAL COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT DECISIONS OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CUSTOMERS. ANY ADJUSTMENTS IN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF INVENTORIES BY OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CUSTOMERS MAY IMPACT OUR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND WORKING CAPITAL GOALS AS WELL AS OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  CHANGES IN THE COMPOSITION OF, FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF, AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH, OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CUSTOMERS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION IN ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES WITH NUMEROUS MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING SOME THAT HAVE LARGER OPERATIONS AND GREATER FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAN US. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AGAINST COMPETITORS\u2019 ACTIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IS GENERATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS ALSO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT ATTENTION AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES; EXPOSE US TO DIFFICULTIES PRESENTED BY INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, LEGAL, REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING, AND BUSINESS FACTORS, INCLUDING IMPLICATIONS OF WITHDRAWAL BY THE U.S. FROM, OR REVISION TO, INTERNATIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS, FOREIGN TRADE OR OTHER POLICY CHANGES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES, TRADE REGULATION AND/OR INDUSTRY ACTIVITY THAT FAVORS DOMESTIC COMPANIES, PANDEMICS AND/OR EPIDEMICS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 (E.G. THE CORONAVIRUS), OR WEAKENED INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL OR PRODUCE DESIRED LEVELS OF NET SALES. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL NET SALES ARE FINANCED BY THIRD PARTIES. THE TERMINATION OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES, ANY MATERIAL CHANGE TO THE TERMS OF OUR AGREEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES OR IN THE AVAILABILITY OR TERMS OF CREDIT OFFERED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS BY THESE THIRD PARTIES, OR ANY DELAY IN SECURING REPLACEMENT CREDIT SOURCES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS DEVELOP AND MARKET NEW PRODUCTS, THAT RESPOND TO CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PREFERENCES AND ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, INCLUDING BY INCORPORATING NEW, EMERGING AND/OR DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY BECOME PREFERRED BY OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR NET SALES COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  ANY DISRUPTION, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INCLEMENT WEATHER, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE-RELATED EVENTS, WORK SLOWDOWNS, STRIKES, PANDEMICS AND/OR EPIDEMICS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 (E.G. THE CORONAVIRUS), OR OTHER EVENTS, AT ANY OF OUR FACILITIES OR IN OUR MANUFACTURING OR OTHER OPERATIONS, OR THOSE OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, OR OUR INABILITY TO COST-EFFECTIVELY EXPAND EXISTING FACILITIES, OPEN AND MANAGE  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NEW FACILITIES, AND/OR MOVE PRODUCTION BETWEEN MANUFACTURING FACILITIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  OUR LABOR NEEDS FLUCTUATE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND ANY FAILURE BY US TO HIRE AND/OR RETAIN A LABOR FORCE TO ADEQUATELY STAFF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, PERFORM SERVICE OR WARRANTY WORK, OR OTHER NECESSARY ACTIVITIES OR BY SUCH LABOR FORCE TO ADEQUATELY AND SAFELY PERFORM THEIR JOBS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS, AND REPUTATION.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. IF OUR INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR INFORMATION SECURITY PRACTICES, OR THOSE OF OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS, FAIL TO ADEQUATELY PERFORM AND/OR PROTECT SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OR IF WE, OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS, OR THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS EXPERIENCE AN INTERRUPTION IN, OR BREACH OF, THE OPERATION OF SUCH SYSTEMS OR PRACTICES, INCLUDING BY THEFT, LOSS OR DAMAGE FROM UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, SECURITY BREACHES, NATURAL OR MAN-MADE DISASTERS, CYBER ATTACKS, COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALWARE, PHISHING, DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS, POWER LOSS OR OTHER DISRUPTIVE EVENTS, OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  OUR RELIANCE UPON PATENTS, TRADEMARK LAWS, AND CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS TO PROTECT OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM OTHERS WHO MAY SELL SIMILAR PRODUCTS. OUR PRODUCTS MAY INFRINGE THE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS, PROPERTIES, AND PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND REGULATIONS WITH WHICH COMPLIANCE MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR EXPENSES OR MODIFY OUR PRODUCTS OR OPERATIONS AND NON-COMPLIANCE MAY RESULT IN HARM TO OUR REPUTATION AND/OR EXPOSE US TO PENALTIES. GOVERNMENTAL POLICIES AND REGULATIONS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN LAWS, POLICIES, AND REGULATIONS IN THE U.S. OR OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS ALSO MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF, (I) TAXATION AND TAX POLICY CHANGES, TAX RATE CHANGES, NEW TAX LAWS, NEW OR REVISED TAX LAW INTERPRETATIONS OR GUIDANCE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, (II) CHANGES TO, OR ADOPTION OF NEW, HEALTHCARE LAWS OR REGULATIONS, OR (III) CHANGES TO U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL POLICIES OR TRADE AGREEMENTS OR TRADE REGULATION AND/OR INDUSTRY ACTIVITY THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL DUTIES OR OTHER CHARGES ON COMMODITIES, COMPONENTS, PARTS OR ACCESSORIES WE IMPORT.  \u2022  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, POLICIES, OR ASSUMPTIONS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  CLIMATE CHANGE LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS, OR ACCORDS MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS.  \u2022  COSTS OF COMPLYING WITH THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS RELATED TO OUR OWNERSHIP AND/OR LEASE OF REAL PROPERTY, SUCH AS CLEAN-UP COSTS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  LEGISLATIVE ENACTMENTS COULD IMPACT THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE WITHIN OUR MARKETS AND AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  \u2022  WE OPERATE IN MANY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AND WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VIOLATIONS OF THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND SIMILAR WORLDWIDE ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS. THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS COULD INCREASE THE RISK OF VIOLATIONS OF THESE LAWS IN THE FUTURE.  \u2022  WE ARE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT QUALITY ISSUES, PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS, AND OTHER LITIGATION FROM TIME TO TIME THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, OPERATING RESULTS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES, ATTRACT AND RETAIN OTHER QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, OR SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT EXECUTIVE OFFICER, KEY EMPLOYEE OR OTHER QUALIFIED PERSONNEL TRANSITIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MEET STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND OUR BUSINESS COULD SUFFER.  \u2022  WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS FLOOR PLANNING PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE INVENTORY FINANCING PROGRAMS TO CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS OF OUR PRODUCTS. ANY MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE AVAILABILITY OR TERMS OF CREDIT OFFERED TO OUR CUSTOMERS BY SUCH PROGRAMS, CHALLENGES OR DELAYS IN TRANSFERRING NEW DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS FROM ANY BUSINESS WE MIGHT ACQUIRE OR OTHERWISE TO SUCH PROGRAMS, OR ANY TERMINATION OR DISRUPTION OF OUR VARIOUS FLOOR PLANNING PROGRAMS OR ANY DELAY IN SECURING REPLACEMENT CREDIT SOURCES, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS.  \u2022  THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AND THE INDENTURES AND OTHER TERMS GOVERNING OUR SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, AND RESPOND TO CHANGING BUSINESS, MARKET, AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO COUNTERPARTY RISK IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH TERMS, ESPECIALLY THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS, OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS COULD BE TERMINATED AND OUR SENIOR NOTES, DEBENTURES, TERM LOAN FACILITIES, AND ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.  \u2022  THE ADDITION OF FURTHER LEVERAGE TO OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE COULD RESULT IN A DOWNGRADE TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS IN THE FUTURE AND THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR COST OF FUNDING AND OUR LIQUIDITY BY LIMITING THE ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS OR THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING FROM A VARIETY OF LENDERS.  \u2022  WE ARE EXPANDING AND RENOVATING OUR CORPORATE AND OTHER FACILITIES AND COULD EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS TO OUR OPERATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH EFFORTS.  \u2022  WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE OUR PROJECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OR OTHER BUSINESS INITIATIVES IN THE TIME PERIODS THAT WE ANTICIPATE, OR AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THESE AND OTHER UNCERTAINTIES AND FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE ANTICIPATED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS OR OTHERWISE COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OR OPERATING RESULTS, SEE OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS\" AND PART II, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS\" OF THIS REPORT.

SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS,  PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF BRIDGFORD FOODS CORPORATION TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR  ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING: GENERAL  ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS; THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND PRICING; SUCCESS OF OPERATING INITIATIVES; DEVELOPMENT  AND OPERATING COSTS; ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; ADVERSE PUBLICITY; ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS; CONSUMER TRIAL  AND FREQUENCY; CHANGES IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; AVAILABILITY, TERMS AND DEPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL; AVAILABILITY  OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL; COMMODITY, LABOR, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS; CHANGES IN, OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS;  WEATHER CONDITIONS; CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED IN THIS REPORT. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO BUDGETING, MARKETING,  AND OTHER MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE IN MANY RESPECTS AND THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERPRETATIONS AND PERIODIC REVISIONS  BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO ALTER OUR MARKETING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE  OR OTHER BUDGETS, WHICH MAY IN TURN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE READER  IS THEREFORE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO CONSIDER OTHER RISKS  DETAILED MORE FULLY IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 1, 2019 (THE \u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d).  WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULT OF ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE MADE  TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED REVENUES  AND EXPENSES DURING THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING PERIODS. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES NEEDED TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE ALLOWANCE  FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, PROMOTIONAL AND RETURNS ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY RESERVES, THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,  AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS TO RECORD BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE VIEW AS REASONABLE UNDER  THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSION  AS TO THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER INDEPENDENT SOURCES. AMOUNTS ESTIMATED RELATED  TO LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURED WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE AND PENSION BENEFITS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO  INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THESE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY SETTLE AT AMOUNTS WHICH VARY FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.  CURRENT  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT OUR PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION BE MEASURED USING AN INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (\u201cIRR\u201d)  ANALYSIS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCOUNT RATE SELECTION PROCESS. THE IRR CALCULATION FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF BRIDGFORD  FOODS CORPORATION IS MEASURED ANNUALLY AND BASED ON THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE. THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS 2.91% AS COMPARED TO 3.00% AS OF NOVEMBER 1, 2019. THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT  THE VALUE OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.  OUR  CREDIT RISK IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. LOSSES DUE TO CREDIT RISK HAVE RECENTLY BEEN  IMMATERIAL. THE PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT COLLECTION RISK. WE HAVE  SIGNIFICANT RECEIVABLES WITH A FEW LARGE, WELL KNOWN CUSTOMERS WHICH, ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY SECURE, COULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL  RISK SHOULD THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OPERATIONS SUDDENLY DETERIORATE. WE MONITOR THESE CUSTOMERS CLOSELY TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF  LOSS.  THE  TABLE BELOW SHOWS CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 20% OF CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cAR\u201d) OR 10% OF  CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED JANUARY 24, 2020 AND JANUARY 25, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.

REVENUES  ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606 \u2013 CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS UPON PASSAGE OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY  UPON PRODUCT PICK-UP, SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS. PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OWN LONG-HAUL  FLEET OR THROUGH A COMPANY OWNED DIRECT STORE DELIVERY SYSTEM.  12  OF 21  WE  RECORD THE CASH SURRENDER OR CONTRACT VALUE FOR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID IN DETERMINING THE EXPENSE  OR INCOME TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR THE PERIOD.  WE  PROVIDE TAX RESERVES FOR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURES RELATING TO AUDIT RESULTS, TAX PLANNING INITIATIVES  AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RESERVES REQUIRES JUDGMENTS ABOUT TAX ISSUES, POTENTIAL OUTCOMES AND  TIMING, AND IS A SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATE. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX AUDITS IS UNCERTAIN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION ADEQUATE  PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM THESE REVIEWS. ACTUAL OUTCOMES MAY  DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHENEVER ADVERSE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  OR BUSINESS CLIMATE INDICATE THAT EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SUCH LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT  TO SUPPORT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. IF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE RECORDED ASSETS, WE  RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE  PARTICIPATE IN \u201cMULTIEMPLOYER\u201d PENSION PLANS ADMINISTERED BY LABOR UNIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE PAY MONTHLY  CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNION TRUST FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH IS USED TO FUND PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. THE CONTRIBUTION  AMOUNT MAY CHANGE DEPENDING UPON THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO FUND THESE PENSION LIABILITIES AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL  AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. SHOULD WE WITHDRAW FROM THE UNION AND CEASE PARTICIPATION IN A UNION PLAN, FEDERAL  LAW COULD IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN. THE PENALTY WOULD BE RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE FUNDED  STATUS OF THE PLAN AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY OTHER PARTICIPATING COMPANIES.  WE  ARE SUBJECT TO  THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT,  AS AMENDED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cPPACA\u201d). REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW  INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS ON ACTIVE AND RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE, EXPANDING DEPENDENT COVERAGE TO AGE 26 AND  THE ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE PPACA INCLUDES  POTENTIAL EXCISE TAX ON THE VALUE OF BENEFITS THAT EXCEED A PRE-DEFINED LIMIT WHICH MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLAN LEVELS  IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THIS ADDITIONAL COST. FINALLY, THE PPACA INCLUDES PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS  TO ALL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (DEFINED AS 30 HOURS PER WEEK). THE HEALTH COVERAGE MUST MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUARIAL VALUE  OF THE BENEFITS OFFERED AND EMPLOYEE AFFORDABILITY. BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE MADE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE  THE PPACA WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE RULES THAT COMPEL AN EMPLOYER SUCH  AS BRIDGFORD FOODS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE COVERAGE TO ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES. THE RECENT TAX LAW CHANGES REMOVED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE  PROVISION THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE PPACA AND REQUIRES ALL INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE,  THE RECENT TAX CHANGES DID NOT ADJUST OR REMOVE THE EMPLOYER MANDATE. WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT PLANS MEET THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE  PPACA AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS MORE LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE BECOMES  AVAILABLE. THE POTENTIAL FUTURE EFFECTS AND COST OF COMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE PPACA ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME.  OVERVIEW  OF REPORTING SEGMENTS  WE  OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS \u2013 THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS (THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT),  AND THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS (THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT). FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SEPARATE  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. WE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE AN EXTENSIVE LINE OF FOOD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BISCUITS, BREAD DOUGH ITEMS,  ROLL DOUGH ITEMS, DRY SAUSAGE PRODUCTS AND BEEF JERKY.  FROZEN  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES BISCUITS, BREAD DOUGH ITEMS, ROLL DOUGH ITEMS AND SHELF STABLE  SANDWICHES. ALL ITEMS WITHIN THIS SEGMENT ARE CONSIDERED SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED AT THIS LEVEL. OUR FROZEN FOOD  BUSINESS COVERS THE UNITED STATES. PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE GENERALLY SUPPLIED TO FOOD SERVICE  AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS WHO TAKE TITLE TO THE PRODUCT UPON SHIPMENT RECEIPT THROUGH COMPANY LEASED LONG-HAUL VEHICLES. IN ADDITION  TO REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS, WE MAINTAIN A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT FOOD SERVICE AND RETAIL BROKERS COVERING MOST OF THE UNITED STATES.  BROKERS ARE COMPENSATED ON A COMMISSION BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROKER RELATIONSHIPS, IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OUR REGIONAL  SALES MANAGERS, ARE A VALUABLE ASSET PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER OPPORTUNITIES. REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS PERFORM  SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONS FOR US, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE  AND SUPPORT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND END PURCHASERS THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR BROKER NETWORK.  13  OF 21  SNACK  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY US.

REFER TO THE END OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO VAIL RESORTS, INC. TO TOTAL REPORTED EBITDA AND LONG-TERM DEBT, NET TO NET DEBT.  ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM REPORTED EBITDA AND NET DEBT ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS IN UNDERSTANDING AND ASSESSING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY. REPORTED EBITDA AND NET DEBT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, NET INCOME (LOSS), NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OR OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY. BECAUSE RESORT REPORTED EBITDA, TOTAL REPORTED EBITDA AND NET DEBT ARE NOT MEASUREMENTS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND ARE THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, RESORT REPORTED EBITDA, TOTAL REPORTED EBITDA AND NET DEBT, AS PRESENTED HEREIN, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, OUR SEGMENT REPORTED EBITDA (I.E. MOUNTAIN, LODGING AND REAL ESTATE), THE MEASURE OF SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  OVERVIEW  OUR OPERATIONS ARE GROUPED INTO THREE INTEGRATED AND INTERDEPENDENT SEGMENTS: MOUNTAIN, LODGING AND REAL ESTATE. WE REFER TO \u201cRESORT\u201d AS THE COMBINATION OF THE MOUNTAIN AND LODGING SEGMENTS.  27  MOUNTAIN SEGMENT  IN THE MOUNTAIN SEGMENT, THE COMPANY OPERATES THE FOLLOWING THIRTY-SEVEN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORTS AND REGIONAL SKI AREAS.  *DENOTES A DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORT WHICH GENERALLY RECEIVES A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF SKIER VISITS FROM LONG-DISTANCE TRAVELERS, AS OPPOSED TO OUR REGIONAL SKI AREAS WHICH TEND TO GENERATE SKIER VISITS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE LOCAL MARKETS.  ADDITIONALLY, WE OPERATE ANCILLARY SERVICES, PRIMARILY INCLUDING SKI SCHOOL, DINING AND RETAIL/RENTAL OPERATIONS, AND FOR OUR AUSTRALIAN SKI AREAS, INCLUDING LODGING AND TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS. MOUNTAIN SEGMENT REVENUE IS SEASONAL, WITH THE MAJORITY OF REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN SKI OPERATIONS OCCURRING IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AND THE MAJORITY OF REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR AUSTRALIAN SKI OPERATIONS OCCURRING IN OUR FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS. OUR NORTH AMERICAN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORTS AND REGIONAL SKI AREAS (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cRESORTS\u201d) ARE TYPICALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS FROM MID-NOVEMBER THROUGH MID-APRIL, WHICH IS THE PEAK OPERATING SEASON FOR THE MOUNTAIN SEGMENT, AND OUR AUSTRALIAN SKI AREAS ARE TYPICALLY OPEN FOR BUSINESS FROM JUNE TO EARLY OCTOBER. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER IS A SEASONALLY LOW PERIOD AS OUR NORTH AMERICAN SKI OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY NOT OPEN FOR BUSINESS UNTIL OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER, WHILE THE ACTIVITY OF OUR AUSTRALIAN SKI AREAS PEAK SEASON AND OUR NORTH AMERICAN SUMMER OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO OFFSET THE LOSSES INCURRED DURING THE SEASONALLY LOW PERIODS AT OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESORTS. REVENUE OF THE MOUNTAIN SEGMENT DURING THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS IS PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM SUMMER AND GROUP RELATED VISITATION AT OUR NORTH AMERICAN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORTS, RETAIL/RENTAL OPERATIONS AND PEAK SEASON AUSTRALIAN SKI OPERATIONS. OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF MOUNTAIN SEGMENT REVENUE IS THE SALE OF LIFT TICKETS (INCLUDING PASS PRODUCTS), WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 57% AND 58% OF MOUNTAIN NET REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  LIFT REVENUE IS DRIVEN BY VOLUME AND PRICING. PRICING IS IMPACTED BY BOTH ABSOLUTE PRICING, AS WELL AS THE MIX OF RESORT VISITATION OF GUESTS, WHICH IMPACTS THE PRICE POINTS AT WHICH VARIOUS PRODUCTS ARE PURCHASED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC MIX OF GUESTS THAT VISIT OUR NORTH AMERICAN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORTS IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PRIMARY CATEGORIES: (I) OUT-OF-STATE AND INTERNATIONAL (\u201cDESTINATION\u201d) GUESTS AND (II) IN-STATE AND LOCAL (\u201cLOCAL\u201d) GUESTS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, DESTINATION GUESTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 55% OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORT SKIER VISITS (EXCLUDING COMPLIMENTARY ACCESS), WHILE LOCAL GUESTS COMPRISED APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN DESTINATION MOUNTAIN RESORT SKIER VISITS (EXCLUDING COMPLIMENTARY ACCESS), WHICH COMPARES TO 53% AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019. DESTINATION GUESTS GENERALLY PURCHASE OUR HIGHER-PRICED LIFT TICKETS (INCLUDING PASS PRODUCTS) AND UTILIZE MORE ANCILLARY SERVICES SUCH AS SKI SCHOOL, DINING AND RETAIL/RENTAL, AS WELL AS LODGING AT OR AROUND OUR MOUNTAIN RESORTS. DESTINATION GUEST VISITATION IS LESS LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE WEATHER DURING THE CURRENT SEASON, BUT MAY BE MORE IMPACTED BY ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE  28  GLOBAL GEOPOLITICAL CLIMATE OR WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SKI SEASON. LOCAL GUESTS TEND TO BE MORE VALUE-ORIENTED AND WEATHER SENSITIVE.  WE OFFER A VARIETY OF PASS PRODUCTS FOR ALL OF OUR RESORTS, MARKETED TOWARDS BOTH DESTINATION AND LOCAL GUESTS. OUR PASS PRODUCT OFFERINGS RANGE FROM PROVIDING ACCESS TO ONE OR A COMBINATION OF OUR RESORTS FOR A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS TO OUR EPIC PASS, WHICH ALLOWS PASS HOLDERS UNLIMITED AND UNRESTRICTED ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR RESORTS. THE EPIC DAY PASS, WHICH WE BEGAN OFFERING FOR THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON, IS A CUSTOMIZABLE ONE TO SEVEN DAY PASS PRODUCT VALID AT EACH OF OUR RESORTS, PURCHASED IN ADVANCE OF THE SEASON, FOR THOSE SKIER AND RIDERS WHO EXPECT TO SKI A CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE SEASON. OUR PASS PROGRAM PROVIDES A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION TO OUR GUESTS, WHICH IN TURN ASSISTS US IN DEVELOPING A LOYAL BASE OF CUSTOMERS WHO COMMIT TO SKI AT OUR RESORTS GENERALLY IN ADVANCE OF THE SKI SEASON AND TYPICALLY SKI MORE DAYS EACH SEASON AT OUR RESORTS THAN THOSE GUESTS WHO DO NOT BUY PASS PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO STRATEGIC LONG-TERM SEASON PASS ALLIANCE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY MOUNTAIN RESORTS INCLUDING TELLURIDE SKI RESORT IN COLORADO, SUN VALLEY RESORT IN IDAHO, SNOWBASIN RESORT IN UTAH, HAKUBA VALLEY AND RUSUTSU RESORT IN JAPAN, RESORTS OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES IN CANADA, LES 3 VALLE\u0301ES IN FRANCE, 4 VALLE\u0301ES IN SWITZERLAND AND SKIRAMA DOLOMITI IN ITALY, WHICH FURTHER INCREASES THE VALUE PROPOSITION OF OUR PASS PRODUCTS. AS SUCH, OUR PASS PROGRAM DRIVES STRONG CUSTOMER LOYALTY; MITIGATES EXPOSURE TO MORE WEATHER SENSITIVE GUESTS; GENERATES ADDITIONAL ANCILLARY SPENDING; AND PROVIDES CASH FLOW IN ADVANCE OF WINTER SEASON OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR PASS PROGRAM ATTRACTS NEW GUESTS TO OUR RESORTS. ALL OF OUR PASS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE EPIC PASS AND EPIC DAY PASS, ARE PREDOMINATELY SOLD PRIOR TO THE START OF THE SKI SEASON. PASS PRODUCT REVENUE, ALTHOUGH PRIMARILY COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE SKI SEASON, IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SKI SEASON PRIMARILY BASED ON HISTORICAL VISITATION.  LIFT REVENUE CONSISTS OF PASS PRODUCT LIFT REVENUE (\u201cPASS REVENUE\u201d) AND NON-PASS PRODUCT LIFT REVENUE (\u201cNON-PASS REVENUE\u201d). FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, APPROXIMATELY 58% AND 53%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR TOTAL LIFT REVENUE RECOGNIZED WAS COMPRISED OF PASS PRODUCT REVENUE. PASS PRODUCT REVENUE RECOGNIZED YEAR TO DATE, WHICH IS PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER, REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 50% AND 51% OF OUR TOTAL NORTH AMERICAN PASS PRODUCT SALES FOR THE 2019/2020 AND 2018/2019 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASONS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE REMAINING NORTH AMERICAN PASS PRODUCT REVENUE ALMOST ENTIRELY RECOGNIZED AS LIFT REVENUE IN OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER ENDING APRIL 30. PASS PRODUCT REVENUE, ALTHOUGH PRIMARILY COLLECTED PRIOR TO THE SKI SEASON, IS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE SKI SEASON PRIMARILY BASED ON HISTORICAL VISITATION. FOR THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON, OUR HISTORICAL VISITATION TREND HAS SHIFTED THE ALLOCATION OF PASS HOLDER VISITATION TO OUR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER AS COMPARED TO OUR FISCAL SECOND QUARTER. AS A RESULT, OUR ALLOCATION OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 PASS REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 IS APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION LOWER THAN IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THE PRIOR YEAR ALLOCATION.  THE COST STRUCTURE OF OUR MOUNTAIN RESORT OPERATIONS HAS A SIGNIFICANT FIXED COMPONENT WITH VARIABLE EXPENSES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LAND USE PERMIT OR LEASE FEES, CREDIT CARD FEES, RETAIL/RENTAL COST OF SALES AND LABOR, SKI SCHOOL LABOR AND DINING OPERATIONS; AS SUCH, PROFIT MARGINS CAN FLUCTUATE GREATLY BASED ON THE LEVEL OF REVENUES.  LODGING SEGMENT  OPERATIONS WITHIN THE LODGING SEGMENT INCLUDE: (I) OWNERSHIP/MANAGEMENT OF A GROUP OF LUXURY HOTELS THROUGH THE ROCKRESORTS BRAND PROXIMATE TO OUR COLORADO AND UTAH MOUNTAIN RESORTS; (II) OWNERSHIP/MANAGEMENT OF NON-ROCKRESORTS BRANDED HOTELS AND CONDOMINIUMS PROXIMATE TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN RESORTS; (III) NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (\u201cNPS\u201d) CONCESSIONAIRE PROPERTIES, INCLUDING THE GRAND TETON LODGE COMPANY (\u201cGTLC\u201d); (IV) A COLORADO RESORT GROUND TRANSPORTATION COMPANY; AND (V) MOUNTAIN RESORT GOLF COURSES.  THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR LODGING PROPERTIES (INCLUDING MANAGED CONDOMINIUM UNITS AND OUR COLORADO RESORT GROUND TRANSPORTATION COMPANY) PROXIMATE TO OUR MOUNTAIN RESORTS IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MOUNTAIN SEGMENT AND GENERALLY EXPERIENCES SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO VISITATION BY DESTINATION GUESTS. REVENUES FROM SUCH PROPERTIES REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 93% OF LODGING SEGMENT NET REVENUE (EXCLUDING LODGING SEGMENT REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH REIMBURSEMENT OF PAYROLL COSTS) FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019. MANAGEMENT PRIMARILY FOCUSES ON LODGING NET REVENUE EXCLUDING PAYROLL COST REIMBURSEMENTS AND LODGING OPERATING EXPENSE EXCLUDING REIMBURSED PAYROLL COSTS (WHICH ARE NOT MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP) AS THE REIMBURSEMENTS ARE MADE BASED UPON THE COSTS INCURRED WITH NO ADDED MARGIN; AS SUCH, THE REVENUE AND CORRESPONDING EXPENSE HAVE NO EFFECT ON OUR LODGING REPORTED EBITDA, WHICH WE USE TO EVALUATE LODGING SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. REVENUE OF THE LODGING SEGMENT DURING OUR FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS IS GENERATED PRIMARILY BY THE OPERATIONS OF OUR NPS CONCESSIONAIRE PROPERTIES (AS THEIR OPERATING SEASON GENERALLY OCCURS FROM JUNE TO THE END OF SEPTEMBER); MOUNTAIN RESORT GOLF OPERATIONS AND SEASONALLY LOWER VOLUME FROM OUR OTHER OWNED AND MANAGED PROPERTIES AND BUSINESSES.  29  REAL ESTATE SEGMENT  THE PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES OF OUR REAL ESTATE SEGMENT INCLUDE THE SALE OF LAND PARCELS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS AND PLANNING FOR FUTURE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, INCLUDING ZONING AND ACQUISITION OF APPLICABLE PERMITS. WE CONTINUE UNDERTAKING PRELIMINARY PLANNING AND DESIGN WORK ON FUTURE PROJECTS AND ARE PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES WITH THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS RATHER THAN UNDERTAKING OUR OWN SIGNIFICANT VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BY THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS MOST OFTEN RESULT IN THE CREATION OF CERTAIN RESORT ASSETS THAT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO THE MOUNTAIN SEGMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT, DUE TO OUR LOW CARRYING COST OF REAL ESTATE LAND INVESTMENTS, WE ARE WELL SITUATED TO PROMOTE FUTURE PROJECTS BY THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WHILE LIMITING OUR FINANCIAL RISK. OUR REVENUE FROM THE REAL ESTATE SEGMENT AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSE CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY BASED UPON THE TIMING OF CLOSINGS AND THE TYPE OF REAL ESTATE BEING SOLD, CAUSING VOLATILITY IN THE REAL ESTATE SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  RECENT TRENDS, RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES  TOGETHER WITH THOSE RISK FACTORS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED IN OUR FORM 10-K, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT FACTORS (AS WELL AS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH FACTORS) THAT COULD IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CONDITION.  \u2022  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF SNOWFALL CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON MOUNTAIN AND LODGING REVENUE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARDS TO SKIER VISITS AND THE DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF GUEST VISITATION. TO HELP MITIGATE THIS IMPACT, WE SELL A VARIETY OF PASS PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SKI SEASON WHICH RESULTS IN A MORE STABILIZED STREAM OF LIFT REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, OUR PASS PRODUCTS PROVIDE A COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITION TO OUR GUESTS, WHICH IN TURN CREATE A GUEST COMMITMENT PREDOMINATELY PRIOR TO THE START OF THE SKI SEASON. DURING FISCAL 2019, PASS PRODUCT REVENUE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 47% OF TOTAL LIFT REVENUE. PASS REVENUE INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $41.1 MILLION, OR 17.2%, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PASS PRODUCT SALES FOR THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON COMPARED TO THE 2018/2019 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON. ADDITIONALLY, DEFERRED REVENUE RELATED TO NORTH AMERICAN PRODUCT PASS SALES WAS APPROXIMATELY $286.0 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, EXCLUDING DEFERRED REVENUE ASSUMED IN THE PEAK RESORTS ACQUISITION (COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $234.0 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019), WHICH WILL BE ALMOST ENTIRELY RECOGNIZED AS LIFT REVENUE DURING OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER ENDING APRIL 30, 2020, SUBJECT TO FINAL ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED UNDER U.S. GAAP.  \u2022  THE CURRENT OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS, WHICH ORIGINATED IN CHINA AND HAS RECENTLY SPREAD TO OTHER REGIONS, INCLUDING THE U.S., JAPAN AND EUROPE, HAS LED TO CERTAIN GLOBAL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER ADVERSE GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS.  ALTHOUGH WE ARE UNCERTAIN AS TO THE ULTIMATE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND THE IMPACT IT MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE SEEN A MARKED NEGATIVE CHANGE IN PERFORMANCE IN THE WEEK ENDED MARCH 8, 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR WEEK, WITH DESTINATION SKIER VISITS MODESTLY BELOW EXPECTATIONS. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE AND POTENTIALLY WORSEN IN UPCOMING WEEKS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR RELEVANT EVENTS SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SUCH DEVELOPMENTS AS THEY OCCUR.  \u2022  AFTER A CHALLENGING START IN THE EARLY SEASON, DESTINATION GUEST VISITATION AT OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE HOLIDAY PERIOD AND WAS IN LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS. THE IMPROVEMENT CONTINUED THROUGH JANUARY THOUGH COLORADO WAS MODESTLY BELOW OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE POST-HOLIDAY PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCE AT OUR PARK CITY RESORT. OUR PACIFIC NORTHWEST RESORTS (WHISTLER BLACKCOMB AND STEVENS PASS) EXPERIENCED THE LOWEST SNOWFALL IN OVER 30 YEARS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, RESULTING IN VERY POOR RESULTS THROUGH THE EARLY SEASON AND CRITICAL HOLIDAY PERIOD. VISITATION AT THOSE RESORTS CONTINUED TO BE CHALLENGING AND BELOW OUR EXPECTATION IN JANUARY, WITH WHISTLER BLACKCOMB EXPERIENCING WEAKER THAN EXPECTED RECOVERY IN NORTH AMERICAN AND INTERNATIONAL DESTINATION VISITATION. WE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT THE EARLY SEASON PERIOD RESULTS OR FUTURE WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL HAVE ON OUR SKIER VISITATION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON.  \u2022  KEY NORTH AMERICAN ECONOMIC INDICATORS HAVE REMAINED STEADY INTO CALENDAR YEAR 2020, INCLUDING STRONG CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND DECLINES IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. HOWEVER, THE GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN ECONOMY MAY BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CHALLENGES IN NORTH AMERICA OR DECLINING OR SLOWING GROWTH IN ECONOMIES OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, ACCOMPANIED BY DEVALUATION OF CURRENCIES, RISING INFLATION, TRADE TARIFFS AND LOWER COMMODITY PRICES. GIVEN THESE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT THE IMPACT OF THE OVERALL NORTH AMERICAN OR GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL BE ON OVERALL TRAVEL AND LEISURE SPENDING OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, ON OUR GUEST VISITATION, GUEST SPENDING OR OTHER RELATED TRENDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON.  \u2022  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  $393.8 MILLION  AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVER COMPONENT OF OUR EIGHTH AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF AUGUST 15, 2018 AND AS AMENDED MOST RECENTLY ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2019 (THE \u201cVAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d), WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOTAL COMMITMENT OF  $500.0 MILLION  LESS OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF  $25.0 MILLION  AND CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING OF  $81.2 MILLION  . ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A CREDIT FACILITY WHICH  30  SUPPORTS THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF WHISTLER BLACKCOMB (THE \u201cWHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  C$264.1 MILLION  (  $199.6 MILLION  ) AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVER COMPONENT OF THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOTAL COMMITMENT OF  C$300.0 MILLION  (  $226.7 MILLION  ) LESS OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF  C$35.0 MILLION  (  $26.4 MILLION  ) AND A LETTER OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING OF  C$0.9 MILLION  (  $0.7 MILLION  )).  WE BELIEVE THAT THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS ALLOW FOR SUFFICIENT FLEXIBILITY IN OUR ABILITY TO MAKE FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS, DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT. THIS, COMBINED WITH THE CONTINUED POSITIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF OUR MOUNTAIN AND LODGING SEGMENTS LESS RESORT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, HAS AND IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE US WITH SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE OUR LIQUIDITY WILL ALLOW US TO CONSIDER STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND OTHER FORMS OF RETURNING VALUE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES AND THE CONTINUED PAYMENT OF A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND.  \u2022  ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2019, THROUGH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, WE ACQUIRED 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OF PEAK RESORTS, INC. (\u201cPEAK RESORTS\u201d) AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $11.00 PER SHARE OR APPROXIMATELY  $264.5 MILLION  . IN ADDITION, CONTEMPORANEOUS WITH THE CLOSING THE TRANSACTION, PEAK RESORTS WAS REQUIRED TO PAY APPROXIMATELY  $70.2 MILLION  OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN OUTSTANDING DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WAS APPROXIMATELY  $334.7 MILLION  , FOR WHICH WE BORROWED APPROXIMATELY  $335.6 MILLION  UNDER THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT TO FUND THE ACQUISITION, REPAYMENT OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AND ASSOCIATED ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES. THE NEWLY ACQUIRED RESORTS INCLUDE: MOUNT SNOW IN VERMONT; HUNTER MOUNTAIN IN NEW YORK; ATTITASH MOUNTAIN RESORT, WILDCAT MOUNTAIN AND CROTCHED MOUNTAIN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE; LIBERTY MOUNTAIN RESORT, ROUNDTOP MOUNTAIN RESORT, WHITETAIL RESORT, JACK FROST AND BIG BOULDER IN PENNSYLVANIA; ALPINE VALLEY, BOSTON MILLS, BRANDYWINE AND MAD RIVER MOUNTAIN IN OHIO; HIDDEN VALLEY AND SNOW CREEK IN MISSOURI; AND PAOLI PEAKS IN INDIANA. THE ACQUISITION INCLUDED THE MOUNTAIN OPERATIONS OF THE RESORTS, INCLUDING BASE AREA SKIER SERVICES (FOOD AND BEVERAGE, RETAIL AND RENTAL, LIFT TICKET OFFICES AND SKI AND SNOWBOARD SCHOOL FACILITIES), AS WELL AS LODGING OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN RESORTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE ACQUISITION OF PEAK RESORTS WILL POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR ANNUAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS; HOWEVER WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE IMPACT THE NEW RESORTS WILL HAVE ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SUMMARY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  (IN THOUSANDS).

MOUNTAIN REPORTED EBITDA INCREASED BY $20.8 MILLION, OR  5.9%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG NORTH AMERICAN PASS SALES GROWTH FOR THE 2019/2020 NORTH AMERICAN SKI SEASON AND THE INCREMENTAL OPERATIONS OF PEAK RESORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RESULTS AT OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS AND WHISTLER BLACKCOMB AND AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. MOUNTAIN SEGMENT RESULTS INCLUDE $1.9 MILLION AND $2.9 MILLION OF ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE RECORDED WITHIN MOUNTAIN OTHER OPERATING EXPENSE. ADDITIONALLY, OPERATING RESULTS FROM WHISTLER BLACKCOMB, WHICH ARE TRANSLATED FROM CANADIAN DOLLARS TO U.S. DOLLARS, WERE POSITIVELY AFFECTED BY AN INCREASE IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  LIFT REVENUE INCREASED $36.8 MILLION, OR  8.2%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PASS PRODUCT REVENUE AND INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM PEAK RESORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NON-PASS REVENUE AT OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS AND WHISTLER BLACKCOMB. PASS REVENUE INCREASED 17.2%, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF AN INCREASE IN PRICING AND UNITS SOLD AND WAS ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY INCREASED PASS SALES TO DESTINATION GUESTS, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EPIC DAY PASS. NON-PASS REVENUE DECREASED 2.1% PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED NON-PASS VISITATION AT OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS AND WHISTLER BLACKCOMB, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NON-PASS ETP (EXCLUDING PEAK RESORTS) OF 4.0% AND INCREMENTAL NON-PASS REVENUE FROM PEAK RESORTS OF APPROXIMATELY $25.9 MILLION. TOTAL NON-PASS ETP, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PEAK RESORTS, DECREASED 10.9%.  SKI SCHOOL REVENUE INCREASED $10.5 MILLION, OR  11.4%  , PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM PEAK RESORTS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 MILLION, AS WELL AS INCREASED REVENUE FROM OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS AND WHISTLER BLACKCOMB. DINING REVENUE INCREASED $10.3 MILLION, OR  15.8%  , PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE FROM PEAK RESORTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN REVENUE AT OUR WESTERN U.S. RESORTS AND WHISTLER BLACKCOMB.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED BY $41.4 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH PAYMENTS OF $327.6 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF PEAK RESORTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS COMPARED TO CASH PAYMENTS OF $292.6 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF TRIPLE PEAKS AND STEVENS PASS DURING THE SIX MONTHS JANUARY 31, 2019. IN ADDITION, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DUE TO ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $8.3 MILLION DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $35.2 MILLION DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN PORTION OF OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT FROM $265.6 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WHICH WERE USED TO FUND THE TRIPLE PEAKS AND STEVENS PASS ACQUISITIONS, TO $335.6 MILLION  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WHICH WERE USED TO FUND THE PEAK RESORTS ACQUISITION. ADDITIONALLY, REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK DECREASED BY $63.6 MILLION. THESE DECREASES IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY (I) AN INCREASE IN NET PAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER PORTION OF OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT OF $53.0 MILLION, (II) AN INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID OF $23.3 MILLION, (III) AN INCREASE OF $15.3 MILLION IN NET PAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS UNDER OUR WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT AND (IV) A PAYMENT FOR CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WITH REGARD TO OUR LEASE FOR PARK CITY.  SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF CASH  WE HAD  $126.8 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO  $158.6 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  . WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT OUR MOUNTAIN AND LODGING SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS (PRIMARILY THOSE GENERATED IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS).  IN ADDITION TO OUR  $126.8 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  $393.8 MILLION  AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVER COMPONENT OF OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  (WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOTAL COMMITMENT OF  $500.0 MILLION  LESS OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $25.0 MILLION AND CERTAIN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING OF  $81.2 MILLION  ). ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD  C$264.1 MILLION  (  $199.6 MILLION  ) AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVER COMPONENT OF OUR WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH REPRESENTS THE TOTAL COMMITMENT OF  C$300.0 MILLION  (  $226.7 MILLION  ) LESS OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF  C$35.0 MILLION  (  $26.4 MILLION  ) AND A LETTER OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING OF  C$0.9 MILLION  (  $0.7 MILLION  ). WE EXPECT THAT OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE MET BY CONTINUED USE OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER BOTH THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT, IF NEEDED. THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDE ADEQUATE FLEXIBILITY AND ARE PRICED FAVORABLY WITH ANY NEW BORROWINGS CURRENTLY PRICED AT LIBOR PLUS 1.5% AND BANKERS ACCEPTANCE RATE PLUS 1.75%, RESPECTIVELY.  40  SIGNIFICANT USES OF CASH  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY INVESTED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR OUR RESORT OPERATIONS, AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, SUBJECT TO OPERATING PERFORMANCE PARTICULARLY AS IT RELATES TO DISCRETIONARY PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR RETAINED OWNERSHIP INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIRD-PARTY REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. CURRENTLY PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH-QUALITY STANDARDS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN INCREMENTAL DISCRETIONARY IMPROVEMENTS AT OUR RESORTS, THROUGHOUT OUR OWNED HOTELS AND IN TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN IMPACT THE FULL NETWORK. WE EVALUATE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON AN EXPECTED LEVEL OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION TO $160 MILLION ON RESORT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2020, EXCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS ASSOCIATED WITH INTEGRATIONS, THE ONE-TIME TRIPLE PEAKS AND STEVENS PASS TRANSFORMATION PLAN, ONE-TIME PEAK RESORTS CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, REAL ESTATE RELATED CAPITAL AND APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION OF REIMBURSABLE INVESTMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH INSURANCE RECOVERIES THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN CALENDAR 2019. WE EXPECT THAT OUR TOTAL CAPITAL PLAN, INCLUDING ONE-TIME ITEMS, WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $210 MILLION TO $215 MILLION. INCLUDED IN THESE ESTIMATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION TO $100 MILLION OF MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN APPEARANCE AND LEVEL OF SERVICE APPROPRIATE TO OUR RESORT OPERATIONS. DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES EXPECTED FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2020 INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER PROJECTS, A 250 ACRE LIFT-SERVED TERRAIN EXPANSION IN THE SIGNATURE MCCOY PARK AREA OF BEAVER CREEK, A NEW FOUR-PERSON HIGH SPEED LIFT TO SERVICE THE POPULAR PEAK 7 IN BRECKENRIDGE, A REPLACEMENT OF THE FOUR-PERSON PERU LIFT AT KEYSTONE WITH A SIX-PERSON HIGH SPEED CHAIRLIFT (SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT APPROVALS) AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SEATING CAPACITY AT THE RENDEZVOUS LODGE RESTAURANT ON BLACKCOMB MOUNTAIN AT WHISTLER BLACKCOMB. ADDITIONALLY, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER OUR COMPANY-WIDE DATA DRIVEN APPROACH, INCLUDING THE SECOND PHASE OF IMPLEMENTING OUR AUTOMATED DIGITAL MARKETING PLATFORM THAT WILL ALLOW US TO AGGREGATE A MORE HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE GUEST THAT WILL DRIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN PERSONALIZATION AND ENGAGEMENT ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING SKI SCHOOL AND RENTALS. WE ARE ALSO PLANNING TO COMPLETELY REVAMP AND UPGRADE OUR DIGITAL SKI RENTAL ONLINE PLATFORMS AND OUR EPICMIX MOBILE APP, WHICH WILL OFFER NEW FUNCTIONALITY AND AN IMPROVED USER EXPERIENCE. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE OUR SCALABILITY AND EFFICIENCY, INCLUDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN AUTOMATED WORKFORCE PLANNING SYSTEM TO OPTIMIZE OUR LABOR SCHEDULING AND IMPROVED FINANCIAL SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE BUSINESS ANALYTICS. WE ARE PLANNING TO COMPLETE THE $3 MILLION INITIAL PHASE OF A TWO-YEAR, $15 MILLION INVESTMENT PROGRAM ACROSS PEAK RESORTS. WE ARE ALSO PLANNING TO COMPLETE THE SECOND AND FINAL PHASE OF A TWO-YEAR, $35 MILLION INVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR CRESTED BUTTE, OKEMO AND STEVENS PASS, AND PLANNING TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION ON INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO PEAK RESORTS. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO UTILIZE CASH ON HAND, BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND/OR CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE THE CASH NECESSARY TO COMPLETE OUR CAPITAL PLANS.  ACQUISITION OF PEAK RESORTS  ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE TERM LOAN WAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $335.6 MILLION, AND WE UTILIZED THE PROCEEDS TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING STOCK OF PEAK RESORTS ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2019 AT A PURCHASE PRICE OF $11.00 PER SHARE OR APPROXIMATELY $264.5 MILLION, AND TO PREPAY CERTAIN PORTIONS OF PEAK RESORTS OUTSTANDING DEBT AND LEASE OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO BE PAID IN ORDER TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION.  DEBT  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE MAJORITY OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT ($1,522.0 MILLION OF THE TOTAL  $1,866.6 MILLION  DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  ) ARE NOT DUE UNTIL FISCAL 2025 AND BEYOND. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT, NET (INCLUDING LONG-TERM DEBT DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR) WAS  $1,880.6 MILLION  AND  $1,393.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. NET DEBT (DEFINED AS LONG-TERM DEBT, NET PLUS LONG-TERM DEBT DUE WITHIN ONE YEAR LESS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS) INCREASED FROM  $1,235.2 MILLION  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 TO  $1,753.8 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , PRIMARILY DUE TO $335.6 MILLION IN INCREMENTAL TERM LOANS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, RESULTING FROM THE SEPTEMBER 23, 2019 AMENDMENT OF OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PEAK RESORTS, WE ASSUMED CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF PEAK RESORTS, WHICH HAVE MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2021 THROUGH 2036 AND WERE RECORDED AT THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF APPROXIMATELY $184.7 MILLION. SEE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR (I) A REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $500.0 MILLION AND (II) A TERM LOAN FACILITY OF $1.25 BILLION. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE MET BY CONTINUED USE OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER BOTH THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT AND WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY CHANGING INTEREST RATES AS WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.9 BILLION  OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  . A 100-BASIS POINT CHANGE IN OUR BORROWING RATES WOULD CAUSE OUR ANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENTS TO CHANGE BY APPROXIMATELY  $9.4 MILLION  . ADDITIONALLY, THE ANNUAL PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FINANCING OF THE CANYONS RESORT TRANSACTION INCREASE BY THE GREATER OF CPI LESS 1%, OR 2%. THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, IN ADDITION TO INTEREST  41  RATE AND INFLATION CHANGES, MAY BE IMPACTED BY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS OR OTHER ALTERNATIVE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WE MAY ENTER INTO. OUR LONG TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS DEPEND UPON OPERATING RESULTS THAT IMPACT THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WHICH CAN BE MITIGATED BY ADJUSTMENTS TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FLEXIBILITY OF INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE FUTURE FINANCING. WE CAN RESPOND TO LIQUIDITY IMPACTS OF CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT BY MANAGING OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THE TIMING OF NEW REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY AND THE PAYMENT OF OUR REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK.  DIVIDEND PAYMENTS  IN FISCAL 2011, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE COMMENCEMENT OF A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF $0.60 PER SHARE, SUBJECT TO QUARTERLY DECLARATION. SINCE THE INITIAL COMMENCEMENT OF A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS ANNUALLY APPROVED AN INCREASE TO OUR CASH DIVIDEND ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND ON MARCH 5, 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF  $1.76  PER SHARE (OR APPROXIMATELY $71.0 MILLION PER QUARTER BASED UPON SHARES OUTSTANDING AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  ). FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF $3.52 PER SHARE (  $142.1 MILLION  IN THE AGGREGATE). THESE DIVIDENDS WERE FUNDED THROUGH AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND AND BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING PORTION OF OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT. SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, APPLICABLE LAW AND CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS, WE ANTICIPATE PAYING REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, OF THE DIVIDENDS TO BE PAID IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON OUR AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS, OVERALL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT, FUTURE PROSPECTS FOR EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS CONDUCTED UNDER AUTHORIZATIONS MADE FROM TIME TO TIME BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON MARCH 9, 2006, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INITIALLY AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 3,000,000 SHARES OF VAIL RESORTS COMMON STOCK (\u201cVAIL SHARES\u201d) AND LATER AUTHORIZED ADDITIONAL REPURCHASES OF UP TO 3,000,000 VAIL SHARES (JULY 16, 2008) AND 1,500,000 VAIL SHARES (DECEMBER 4, 2015), FOR A TOTAL AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE UP TO 7,500,000 VAIL SHARES. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY, WE REPURCHASED  95,618  VAIL SHARES (AT A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $21.4 MILLION  ) AND 353,007 VAIL SHARES (AT A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $85.0 MILLION). SINCE INCEPTION OF THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAVE REPURCHASED  6,000,341  VAIL SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $379.4 MILLION  . AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  ,  1,499,659  VAIL SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE TO REPURCHASE UNDER THE EXISTING REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. VAIL SHARES PURCHASED PURSUANT TO THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE HELD AS TREASURY SHARES AND MAY BE USED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE AWARD PLAN. REPURCHASES UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE MADE FROM TIME TO TIME AT PREVAILING PRICES AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, AND SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE TIMING AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF VAIL SHARES THAT MAY BE REPURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES AND COMPETING USES FOR CASH THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE, THE RESTRICTIONS IN OUR VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT, PREVAILING PRICES OF VAIL SHARES AND THE NUMBER OF VAIL SHARES THAT BECOME AVAILABLE FOR SALE AT PRICES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE ATTRACTIVE. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE.  COVENANTS AND LIMITATIONS  WE MUST ABIDE BY CERTAIN RESTRICTIVE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS. THE MOST RESTRICTIVE OF THOSE COVENANTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING COVENANTS: FOR THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT, NET FUNDED DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT); FOR THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT, CONSOLIDATED TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO AND CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT); AND FOR THE EPR SECURED NOTES, MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO AND CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE RATIO (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE EPR AGREEMENTS). IN ADDITION, OUR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, PAY DIVIDENDS ON OR REDEEM OR REPURCHASE STOCK, MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, MAKE CERTAIN AFFILIATE TRANSFERS AND MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS OR SALES OF ASSETS AND INCUR CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS. OUR BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY THE NET FUNDED DEBT TO ADJUSTED EBITDA RATIO, WHICH IS BASED ON OUR SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AS DEFINED IN THE VAIL HOLDINGS CREDIT AGREEMENT. OUR BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMMITMENT SIZE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE WHISTLER CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL RESTRICTIVE FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  . WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL MEET ALL APPLICABLE FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANTS IN OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING  JULY 31, 2020  . HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE WE WILL MEET SUCH FINANCIAL COVENANTS. IF SUCH COVENANTS ARE NOT MET, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEEK A WAIVER OR AMENDMENT FROM THE BANKS PARTICIPATING IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH WAIVERS OR AMENDMENTS WOULD BE GRANTED, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  42  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE OFF BALANCE SHEET TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUE, EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT FREIT\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS  REGARDING FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF FREIT, AND DO NOT RELATE  STRICTLY TO HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACTS. FREIT HAS TRIED, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY USING  WORDS SUCH AS \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATE,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cPLAN,\u201d  \u201cESTIMATE,\u201d OR WORDS OF SIMILAR MEANING.  ALTHOUGH FREIT BELIEVES THAT THE EXPECTATIONS  REFLECTED IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,  WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED. SUCH FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE  FOLLOWING: GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF RETAIL PRODUCTS OVER THE INTERNET, WHICH WILL, AMONG  OTHER THINGS, AFFECT DEMAND FOR RENTAL SPACE, THE AVAILABILITY OF PROSPECTIVE TENANTS, LEASE RENTS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF  TENANTS AND THE DEFAULT RATE ON LEASES, OPERATING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING; ADVERSE CHANGES  IN FREIT\u2019S REAL ESTATE MARKETS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, COMPETITION WITH OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNERS, COMPETITION CONFRONTED  BY TENANTS AT FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES; GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS AND INITIATIVES; ENVIRONMENTAL/SAFETY REQUIREMENTS; AND  RISKS OF REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITIONS.

OVERVIEW  FREIT IS AN EQUITY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT  TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) THAT IS SELF-ADMINISTERED AND EXTERNALLY MANAGED.

FREIT\u2019S PROPERTIES ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN NORTHERN NEW JERSEY, MARYLAND AND NEW YORK.  THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT.  THE U.S. ECONOMY GREW AN AVERAGE ANNUALIZED RATE OF 2.1% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. EMPLOYMENT REMAINS HEALTHY WITH AN UNEMPLOYMENT  RATE AT 3.6% IN JANUARY 2020 AND REAL INCOME CONTINUES TO GROW AT A SOLID PACE. IF THE U.S. ECONOMY IMPROVES, THE FEDERAL RESERVE  MAY INCREASE LENDING RATES WHICH MAY AFFECT THE REFINANCING OF MORTGAGES COMING DUE IN THE SHORT-TERM AND BORROWINGS FOR OTHER  PURPOSES. THERE COULD ALSO BE A PANDEMIC OF THE CORONAVIRUS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND FREIT\u2019S  RETAIL TENANTS.  RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES.  FREIT HAS AGGRESSIVELY INCREASED RENTAL RATES ON ITS STABILIZED PROPERTIES RESULTING IN FREIT\u2019S RENTAL REVENUES CONTINUING  TO SHOW YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES AT MOST OF ITS PROPERTIES. FREIT EXPECTS INCREASES IN RENTAL RATES TO TAPER; HOWEVER, THE INCREASED  RENTAL RATES THAT ARE IN PLACE SHOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT FUTURE REVENUES.  COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES.  THERE CONTINUES TO BE UNCERTAINTY IN THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON FREIT\u2019S RETAIL TENANTS,  WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON FREIT.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE\u2019S EXPLORATION OF POTENTIAL  STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS WILL RESULT IN ANY TRANSACTION BEING CONSUMMATED. FREIT DOES NOT INTEND TO DISCUSS OR DISCLOSE ANY DEVELOPMENTS  WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE\u2019S FUNCTIONS OR ACTIVITY, UNLESS AND UNTIL OTHERWISE DETERMINED THAT FURTHER DISCLOSURE  IS APPROPRIATE OR REQUIRED BY REGULATION OR LAW.

ON JANUARY 14, 2020, FREIT AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cSELLERS\u201d), ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND  SALE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cPURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AN AFFILIATE OF THE KUSHNER COMPANIES (THE \u201cPURCHASER\u201d),  PURSUANT TO WHICH THE SELLERS WILL SELL TO THE PURCHASER 100% OF SELLERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SEVEN APARTMENT PROPERTIES  HELD BY THE SELLERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PURCHASE PRICE DESCRIBED THEREIN, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PURCHASE AND  SALE AGREEMENT.  PAGE  20  INDEX  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT PROVIDES  FOR THE SALE OF THE FOLLOWING SEVEN PROPERTIES: BERDAN COURT, LOCATED IN WAYNE, NEW JERSEY; THE BOULDERS AT ROCKAWAY, LOCATED IN  ROCKAWAY, NEW JERSEY; PIERRE TOWERS, LOCATED IN HACKENSACK, NEW JERSEY; THE REGENCY CLUB, LOCATED IN MIDDLETOWN, NEW YORK; STATION  PLACE, LOCATED IN RED BANK, NEW JERSEY; STEUBEN ARMS, LOCATED IN RIVER EDGE, NEW JERSEY; AND WESTWOOD HILLS, LOCATED IN WESTWOOD,  NEW JERSEY. FREIT HAS A 100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN EACH OF THESE PROPERTIES, EXCEPT FOR (I) PIERRE TOWERS, IN WHICH FREIT HAS A  65% OWNERSHIP INTEREST, AND (II) WESTWOOD HILLS, IN WHICH FREIT HAS A 40% OWNERSHIP INTEREST.  THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE  100% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN EACH OF THE PROPERTIES IS $266,500,000, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS FOR THE  AMOUNT OF CERTAIN MORTGAGE LOANS ASSUMED BY THE PURCHASER AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY $76,815,000. AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT FREIT\u2019S  40% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN WESTWOOD HILLS AND 65% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN PIERRE TOWERS, THE SALE OF ALL SEVEN APARTMENT PROPERTIES,  IF CONSUMMATED, WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY $208,325,000 IN TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION PAID TO FREIT (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS),  AND WOULD BE EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A SUBSTANTIAL GAIN TO FREIT (AS MEASURED ON A GAAP BASIS).  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENTRY INTO THE  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE PURCHASER DELIVERED IN ESCROW A DEPOSIT IN THE FORM OF AN UNCONDITIONAL, IRREVOCABLE LETTER OF  CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF $15,000,000. SUCH DEPOSIT IS NON-REFUNDABLE, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMINATION OF THE PURCHASE  AND SALE AGREEMENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  PURSUANT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT,  THE PURCHASER HAS AGREED TO ASSUME, SUBJECT TO LENDER APPROVAL, THE OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE LOANS ON THE BERDAN COURT AND PIERRE TOWERS  PROPERTIES. IN THE EVENT ONE OR BOTH OF SUCH MORTGAGE LOANS ARE NOT ASSUMED, THEN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED  TO BE TERMINATED SOLELY AS TO THE PROPERTY OR PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORTGAGE LOAN OR LOANS THAT ARE NOT ASSUMED BY THE  PURCHASER, SUCH PROPERTY OR PROPERTIES WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TRANSACTION, AND THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE REDUCED BY AN AMOUNT  EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT(S) ALLOCATED TO SUCH PROPERTY OR PROPERTIES IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IF THE OWNERSHIP  STRUCTURE OF PIERRE TOWERS IS NOT CONVERTED INTO A TENANCY-IN-COMMON ON OR PRIOR TO FEBRUARY 28, 2020, THEN THE PURCHASE AND SALE  AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE TERMINATED SOLELY AS TO THE PIERRE TOWERS PROPERTY, SUCH PROPERTY WILL BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TRANSACTION,  AND THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE REDUCED BY AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT ALLOCATED TO SUCH PROPERTY IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT.  OF THE $266,500,000 AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE, $42,000,000 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO BERDAN COURT, AND $80,500,000 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED  TO PIERRE TOWERS.  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT  ALSO PROVIDES THAT THE REGENCY CLUB MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM THE TRANSACTION (AND THE PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE REDUCED BY AN AMOUNT  EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT(S) ALLOCATED TO SUCH PROPERTY IN THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT) IF CERTAIN TITLE MATTERS AFFECTING SUCH  PROPERTY ARE NOT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. OF THE $266,500,000 AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE, $27,250,000 HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE  REGENCY CLUB. THESE TITLE MATTERS HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED, AND THEREFORE, THE PURCHASER MAY NO LONGER ELECT TO  TERMINATE THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE REGENCY CLUB PURSUANT TO SUCH PROVISION.  AS THE LENDER FOR THE MORTGAGE LOAN ON  THE PIERRE TOWERS PROPERTY HAS ADVISED THE PARTIES THAT THE LENDER WOULD NOT AGREE TO AN ASSIGNMENT OF SUCH MORTGAGE LOAN TO THE  PURCHASER, ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, THE SELLERS AND THE PURCHASER ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT,  TERMINATING THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT SOLELY WITH RESPECT TO THE PIERRE TOWERS PROPERTY. AS A RESULT, AS PROVIDED IN THE  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WAS REDUCED FROM $266,500,000  TO $186,000,000 \u2013 A REDUCTION OF $80,500,000 (THE AMOUNT THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE PIERRE TOWERS PROPERTY IN THE PURCHASE  AND SALE AGREEMENT) \u2013 AND THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED BY FREIT UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WAS REDUCED  FROM $208,325,000 TO $156,000,000.  THE BOARD, FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATION  OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD, UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND CALENDAR QUARTER  OF 2020.  THE CLOSING OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE  AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED  THEREBY BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES CAST BY THE HOLDERS OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST OF THE TRUST (\u201cSHARES\u201d)  PRESENT IN PERSON OR REPRESENTED BY PROXY AT A MEETING OF THE TRUST\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS AT WHICH A QUORUM IS PRESENT. CONCURRENTLY  WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE TRUSTEES OF THE TRUST ENTERED INTO VOTING AGREEMENTS WITH THE PURCHASER  PURSUANT TO WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TRUSTEES AGREED TO VOTE AN AGGREGATE OF 872,812 SHARES HELD BY THEM AND OVER WHICH THEY  HAVE VOTING CONTROL, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 12.7% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES, IN FAVOR OF THE APPROVAL OF THE  PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  THE PARTIES\u2019 RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS  UNDER THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CUSTOMARY CONDITIONS. THERE IS NO DUE DILIGENCE OR FINANCING  CONTINGENCY.  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT CONTAINS  CUSTOMARY TERMINATION RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF EITHER THE SELLERS OR THE PURCHASER TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IF THE CLOSING  HAS NOT OCCURRED ON OR BEFORE JUNE 14, 2020. IN THE EVENT THAT THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT IS TERMINATED IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,  THE TRUST WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE PURCHASER A TERMINATION FEE OF $3.5 MILLION AND/OR REIMBURSE THE PURCHASER FOR CERTAIN OUT-OF-POCKET  EXPENSES (SUBJECT TO A CAP OF $2 MILLION).  PAGE  21  INDEX  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT CONTAINS  VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE PARTIES CUSTOMARY FOR A TRANSACTION OF THIS NATURE. UNTIL THE EARLIER  OF THE TERMINATION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE CLOSING OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE SELLERS WILL CONDUCT  THEIR RESPECTIVE BUSINESSES WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICABLE PROPERTIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE.  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT PROVIDES  THAT THE TRUST WILL CONVENE A MEETING OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF APPROVING THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT PROVIDES  THAT FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE SELLERS, ON THE ONE HAND, AND THE PURCHASER, ON THE OTHER HAND,  WILL INDEMNIFY ONE ANOTHER FOR CERTAIN LIABILITIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. (SEE NOTES 6 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE  OF PIERRE TOWERS WAS REORGANIZED INTO A TENANCY-IN-COMMON. (SEE NOTE 16 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR FURTHER DETAILS.)  ADOPTION OF PLAN OF LIQUIDATION.  ON JANUARY 14, 2020, THE BOARD ADOPTED  A PLAN OF VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION WITH RESPECT TO FREIT (THE \u201cPLAN OF LIQUIDATION\u201d), WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE VOLUNTARY  DISSOLUTION, TERMINATION AND LIQUIDATION OF FREIT BY THE SALE, CONVEYANCE, TRANSFER OR DELIVERY OF ALL OF FREIT\u2019S REMAINING  ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED,  AND THE TREASURY REGULATIONS THEREUNDER. THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON (I) APPROVAL BY A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES  CAST BY FREIT\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS PRESENT IN PERSON OR REPRESENTED BY PROXY AT A DULY CALLED MEETING OF FREIT\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS  AT WHICH A QUORUM IS PRESENT AND (II) THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (SEE  NOTE 6 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  UPON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PLAN OF  LIQUIDATION AND PURSUANT THERETO, FREIT IS AUTHORIZED TO SELL, OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF, ALL OF FREIT\u2019S REMAINING ASSETS FOR  CASH, NOTES OR SUCH OTHER ASSETS, UPON SUCH TERMS AS THE BOARD MAY DEEM ADVISABLE, AND WITHOUT FURTHER APPROVAL OF FREIT\u2019S  SHAREHOLDERS.  THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION PROVIDES THAT  THE PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND DISPOSITIONS OF FREIT\u2019S ASSETS MAY BE UTILIZED TO PAY OR CREATE A RESERVE FUND FOR THE PAYMENT  OF, OR OTHERWISE ADEQUATELY PROVIDE FOR, ALL OF THE LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF FREIT, AND WILL PAY ALL EXPENSES INCIDENTAL  TO THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION, INCLUDING ALL COUNSEL FEES, ACCOUNTANTS\u2019 FEES, ADVISORY FEES AND SUCH OTHER FEES AND TAXES AS  ARE NECESSARY TO EFFECTUATE THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION. IN ADDITION, FREIT WILL DISTRIBUTE THE REMAINING ASSETS OF FREIT, EITHER IN  CASH OR IN KIND, TO FREIT\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS IN CANCELLATION OR REDEMPTION OF THEIR SHARES IN ONE OR MORE DISTRIBUTIONS.  THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION FURTHER PROVIDES  THAT UPON A DETERMINATION OF THE BOARD, FREIT MAY TRANSFER ANY REMAINING ASSETS, INCLUDING ANY RESERVE FUND OR OTHER CASH ON HAND,  AND LIABILITIES TO A LIQUIDATING TRUST (OR OTHER LIQUIDATING ENTITY) AND SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH SUCH TRANSFER AND ASSIGNMENT, SHARES  OF BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SUCH LIQUIDATING TRUST (OR OTHER LIQUIDATING ENTITY) WILL BE DEEMED DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF FREIT\u2019S  SHAREHOLDERS.  UPON THE ADOPTION OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION,  FREIT WILL CEASE REPORTING ON THE GOING CONCERN BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING, AND THEREAFTER WILL REPORT ON THE LIQUIDATION  BASIS OF ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING. (SEE NOTE 7 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  ON JANUARY 14, 2020,  IN CONNECTION WITH ENTERING INTO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (SEE NOTE 6 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS), FREIT AND HEKEMIAN ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cFIRST AMENDMENT\u201d),  WHICH AMENDS THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. THE FIRST AMENDMENT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IF, AND ONLY IF, THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION BECOMES  EFFECTIVE (SEE NOTE 7 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS). THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROVIDES  THAT UPON THE CLOSING OF ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF FREIT\u2019S ENTIRE DIRECT OR INDIRECT INTEREST IN EACH REAL PROPERTY  OWNED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BY FREIT (EACH A \u201cTRUST PROPERTY\u201d), WHETHER PURSUANT TO THE PURCHASE  AND SALE AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN FURTHERANCE OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION, (A) THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE  AND BE OF NO FURTHER FORCE OR EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH TRUST PROPERTY AND (B) FREIT WILL PAY TO HEKEMIAN (I) ANY AND ALL COMMISSIONS  AND FEES FOR MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY FREIT PURSUANT TO THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IN RESPECT  OF THE APPLICABLE TRUST PROPERTY UP TO THE TERMINATION DATE, CALCULATED ON A PRO RATA BASIS, PLUS (II) A TERMINATION FEE IN RESPECT  TO SUCH TRUST PROPERTY EQUAL TO THE PRODUCT OF (X) THE TRUST\u2019S DIRECT OR INDIRECT PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SUCH TRUST  PROPERTY, MULTIPLIED BY (Y) 1.25, MULTIPLIED BY (Z) ONE (1) YEAR\u2019S BASE MANAGEMENT FEE (AS DEFINED IN THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  AND FIRST AMENDMENT) IN RESPECT OF SUCH TRUST PROPERTY.  IN ADDITION, THE FIRST  AMENDMENT AMENDS THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE THAT UPON THE CLOSING OF ANY SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF FREIT\u2019S ENTIRE  DIRECT OR INDIRECT INTEREST IN EACH TRUST PROPERTY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE IN FURTHERANCE  OF THE PLAN OF LIQUIDATION, FREIT WILL PAY TO HEKEMIAN A SALES FEE EQUAL TO 1.65% OF THE SALES PRICE FOR SUCH TRUST PROPERTY (REDUCED  FROM THE EXISTING RANGE OF 2.5% TO 4.5% IN THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IN THE EVENT THAT A TRUST PROPERTY  IS NOT WHOLLY OWNED, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY FREIT, THE SALES FEE PAYABLE TO HEKEMIAN WILL ONLY BE PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF FREIT\u2019S  PERCENTAGE OWNERSHIP SHARE OF THE APPLICABLE TRUST PROPERTY.  PAGE  22  INDEX  THE FIRST AMENDMENT PROVIDES THAT THE  FOREGOING FEES WILL BE PAID IN LIEU OF, AND WILL SUPERSEDE IN THEIR ENTIRETY, ANY OTHER PAYMENTS WHICH OTHERWISE WOULD BE PAYABLE  TO HEKEMIAN UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT ARISING OUT OF OR ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION OF FREIT\u2019S ENTIRE  DIRECT OR INDIRECT INTEREST IN EACH TRUST PROPERTY OR THE TERMINATION OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT IN RESPECT OF SUCH TRUST PROPERTY  (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY TERMINATION FEE, M&A TERMINATION FEE OR SALE OF PROPERTY FEE UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)). (SEE NOTE 8 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  FREIT CONTINUES TO MAKE ONLY THOSE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. THE RETAIL SPACE AT  THE ROTUNDA CONTINUES TO LEASE-UP AND IS APPROXIMATELY 86.5% LEASED AND 83.4% OCCUPIED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020. FREIT EXPECTS ROTUNDA\u2019S  OPERATIONS TO STABILIZE IN LATE 2020.  DEBT FINANCING AVAILABILITY.  FINANCING HAS BEEN AVAILABLE TO FREIT AND ITS AFFILIATES. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC REFINANCED ITS $115.3 MILLION  CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO WITH A NEW LOAN HELD BY AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5  MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,380,000. THIS LOAN  IS SECURED BY THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY, BEARS A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT 285 BASIS POINTS OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AND HAS A  MATURITY DATE OF FEBRUARY 6, 2021 WITH TWO ONE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED  AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR  RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION OF THIS LOAN FACILITY WAS  DRAWN DOWN AND THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.59%. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE  CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR ONE  YEAR. THIS INTEREST RATE CAP HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 5, 2020 AND A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 5, 2021.  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, BERDAN COURT, LLC  (\u201cBERDAN COURT\u201d), (OWNED 100% BY FREIT), REFINANCED ITS $17 MILLION LOAN (WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019) WITH  THE LENDER IN THE AMOUNT OF $28,815,000. THIS LOAN, SECURED BY AN APARTMENT BUILDING LOCATED IN WAYNE, NEW JERSEY, HAS A TERM OF  TEN YEARS AND BEARS A FIXED INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 3.54%. INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED EACH MONTH FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS  OF THE TERM AND THEREAFTER, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST WILL BE REQUIRED EACH MONTH THROUGH MATURITY. THIS REFINANCING  RESULTED IN: (I) A REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE FROM A FIXED RATE OF 6.09% TO A FIXED RATE OF 3.54% AND (II) NET REFINANCING  PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  ON APRIL 3, 2019, WESTFREIT, CORP. (OWNED  100% BY FREIT) EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO EXTEND ITS LOAN HELD BY M&T BANK, WITH A THEN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5  MILLION, FOR TWELVE MONTHS. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING ON JUNE 1, 2019, THE EXTENSION OF THIS LOAN SECURED BY THE WESTRIDGE SQUARE SHOPPING  CENTER, REQUIRED MONTHLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $47,250 PLUS INTEREST BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 240 BASIS POINTS  OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF MAY 1, 2020. FREIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE LENDER TO EXTEND THE LOAN.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE LOAN IS ENTERED INTO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE  LOAN WILL BE EXTENDED.  ON OCTOBER 27, 2017, FREIT\u2019S REVOLVING  LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE PROVIDENT BANK WAS RENEWED FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM ENDING ON OCTOBER 27, 2020 AT WHICH POINT NO FURTHER  ADVANCES SHALL BE PERMITTED AND PROVIDED THE LINE OF CREDIT IS NOT RENEWED BY THE LENDER, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF  THE LINE OF CREDIT SHALL CONVERT TO A COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN MATURING ON OCTOBER 31, 2022. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE CAN BE USED  FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE ARE SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON FREIT\u2019S  FRANKLIN CROSSING SHOPPING CENTER IN FRANKLIN LAKES, NEW JERSEY AND RETAIL SPACE IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY. THE TOTAL LINE OF CREDIT  WAS INCREASED FROM $12.8 MILLION TO $13 MILLION AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING WILL BE AT A FLOATING RATE OF 275  BASIS POINTS OVER THE 30-DAY LIBOR WITH A FLOOR OF 3.75%. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING  AND $13 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LOAN AGREEMENT  FOR EACH OF THE LOANS DESCRIBED ABOVE, FREIT MAY BE REQUIRED TO MEET OR MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS THROUGHOUT THE TERM  OF THE LOAN.  OPERATING  CASH FLOW.  FREIT EXPECTS THAT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH RESERVES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER MANDATORY  DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS OF INTEREST, BUT EXCLUDING BALLOON PAYMENTS), REAL ESTATE TAXES, RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS  AT PROPERTIES AND OTHER NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS A REIT FOR AT LEAST A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF FILING OF THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  PAGE  23  INDEX  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  PURSUANT TO THE SEC DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE  FOR \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\" THE SEC DEFINES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN BECAUSE OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT  OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE PREPARATION OF WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT  ESTIMATES BASED ON JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT CERTAIN AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES. ACCORDINGLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER  FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES USED, WHICH ARE OUTLINED IN NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, HAVE BEEN APPLIED CONSISTENTLY AS OF JANUARY  31, 2020, AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR ESTIMATES  REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT'S MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION: BASE RENTS, ADDITIONAL  RENTS BASED ON TENANTS' SALES VOLUME AND REIMBURSEMENT OF THE TENANTS' SHARE OF CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED  WHEN DUE FROM TENANTS. THE STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IS USED TO RECOGNIZE BASE RENTS UNDER LEASES IF THEY PROVIDE FOR VARYING RENTS OVER  THE LEASE TERMS. STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS REPRESENT UNBILLED RENTS RECEIVABLE TO THE EXTENT STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS EXCEED CURRENT RENTS  BILLED IN ACCORDANCE WITH LEASE AGREEMENTS. BEFORE FREIT CAN RECOGNIZE REVENUE, IT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS  COLLECTABILITY.  VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS: FREIT  ASSESSES THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS PERIODICALLY, OR WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE  CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WHEN FREIT DETERMINES THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY  BE IMPAIRED, THE MEASUREMENT OF ANY IMPAIRMENT IS BASED ON A PROJECTED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHOD DETERMINED BY FREIT'S MANAGEMENT.  WHILE FREIT BELIEVES THAT OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODS ARE REASONABLE, DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING SUCH CASH FLOWS MAY  SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF IMPAIRMENT.  REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COSTS: IT IS  FREIT\u2019S POLICY TO CAPITALIZE PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WHICH GENERALLY INCLUDE LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OTHER DIRECTLY  RELATED THIRD-PARTY COSTS. REAL ESTATE TAXES AND INTEREST COSTS INCURRED DURING THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES ARE ALSO  CAPITALIZED. FREIT CEASES CAPITALIZATION OF THESE COSTS WHEN THE PROJECT OR PORTION THEREOF BECOMES OPERATIONAL, OR WHEN CONSTRUCTION  HAS BEEN POSTPONED. IN THE EVENT OF POSTPONEMENT, CAPITALIZATION OF THESE COSTS WILL RECOMMENCE ONCE CONSTRUCTION ON THE PROJECT  RESUMES.  SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REAL ESTATE REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 (\u201cCURRENT QUARTER\u201d) INCREASED 4.5% TO $15,593,000, COMPARED TO $14,928,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 (\u201cPRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER\u201d). THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE  IN BASE RENTS ACROSS MOST PROPERTIES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE (OFFICE AND  RETAIL) AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY FROM AN AVERAGE OCCUPANCY RATE OF 81.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER TO 84.2% IN THE CURRENT  QUARTER.  NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO  COMMON EQUITY (\u201cNET (LOSS) INCOME-COMMON EQUITY\u201d) FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS A NET LOSS OF $2,262,000 (($0.32)  PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED), COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $459,000 ($0.07 PER SHARE BASIC AND DILUTED) FOR THE PRIOR  YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY $3.4 MILLION RELATED TO SPECIAL COMMITTEE EXPENSES FOR ADVISORY  AND LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN FISCAL 2020; OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE AS EXPLAINED ABOVE (CONSOLIDATED IMPACT OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION); AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION (CONSOLIDATED IMPACT OF $0.3  MILLION) DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON THE VARIABLE MORTGAGE LOANS.

PAGE  25  INDEX  NOI IS BASED ON OPERATING REVENUE AND  EXPENSES DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES, BUT EXCLUDES DEFERRED RENTS (STRAIGHT LINING),  DEPRECIATION, FINANCING COSTS AND OTHER ITEMS. FREIT ASSESSES AND MEASURES SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS BASED ON NOI.  SAME PROPERTY NOI: FREIT CONSIDERS SAME  PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cSAME PROPERTY NOI\u201d) TO BE A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURE OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  FREIT DEFINES SAME PROPERTY WITHIN BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS TO BE THOSE PROPERTIES THAT FREIT HAS OWNED AND  OPERATED FOR BOTH THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED, EXCLUDING THOSE PROPERTIES THAT FREIT ACQUIRED OR REDEVELOPED DURING  THOSE PERIODS. ANY NEWLY ACQUIRED PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN IN OPERATION FOR LESS THAN A YEAR, ANY PROPERTY THAT IS UNDERGOING A MAJOR  REDEVELOPMENT BUT MAY STILL BE IN OPERATION AT LESS THAN FULL CAPACITY, AND/OR ANY PROPERTY THAT HAS BEEN SOLD IS NOT CONSIDERED  SAME PROPERTY.  NOI AND SAME PROPERTY NOI ARE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES AND ARE NOT MEASURES OF OPERATING RESULTS OR CASH FLOW AS MEASURED BY GAAP, AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE  OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH NEEDS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOWS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.  COMMERCIAL SEGMENT  THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CONTAINS EIGHT  (8) SEPARATE PROPERTIES. SEVEN OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE MULTI-TENANTED RETAIL OR OFFICE CENTERS, AND ONE IS SINGLE TENANTED ON LAND  LOCATED IN ROCKAWAY, NEW JERSEY OWNED BY FREIT FROM WHICH IT RECEIVES MONTHLY RENTAL INCOME FROM A TENANT WHO HAS BUILT AND OPERATES  A BANK BRANCH ON THE LAND. ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019, FREIT SOLD A COMMERCIAL BUILDING, FORMERLY OCCUPIED AS A PATHMARK SUPERMARKET IN  PATCHOGUE, NEW YORK FOR A SALES PRICE OF $7.5 MILLION. THE SALE OF THIS PROPERTY, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $6.2  MILLION, RESULTED IN A GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION NET OF SALES FEES AND COMMISSIONS. NET CASH PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $2 MILLION WERE REALIZED AFTER PAYING OFF THE RELATED MORTGAGE ON THIS PROPERTY IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION. THE  SALE OF THIS PROPERTY ELIMINATES AN OPERATING LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION ($0.12 PER SHARE) INCURRED, ANNUALLY, SINCE PATHMARK  VACATED THE BUILDING IN DECEMBER 2015 (SEE NOTE 5 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE ABOVE UNDER  THE CAPTION SEGMENT INFORMATION, TOTAL REVENUE AND NOI FROM FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL SEGMENT FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED  BY 5.8% AND 13.0%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR ALL COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES  INCREASED SLIGHTLY BY 0.1% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE AND NOI WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ANNUAL OCCUPANCY RATE FOR THE COMMERCIAL SPACE (OFFICE AND RETAIL) AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY FROM AN  AVERAGE OCCUPANCY RATE OF 81.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER TO 84.2% IN THE CURRENT QUARTER.  SAME PROPERTY OPERATING RESULTS: FREIT\u2019S  COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CURRENTLY CONTAINS EIGHT (8) SAME PROPERTIES. (SEE DEFINITION OF SAME PROPERTY UNDER SEGMENT INFORMATION ABOVE.)  THE PATCHOGUE PROPERTY WAS EXCLUDED FROM SAME PROPERTY RESULTS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED BECAUSE THIS PROPERTY WAS SOLD IN FEBRUARY  2019. SAME PROPERTY REVENUE AND NOI FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED BY 5.8% AND 10.1%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR  YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE CHANGES RESULTED FROM THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.  LEASING: THE FOLLOWING TABLES REFLECT  LEASING ACTIVITY AT FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES FOR COMPARABLE LEASES (LEASES EXECUTED FOR SPACES IN WHICH THERE WAS A  TENANT AT SOME POINT DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD) AND NON-COMPARABLE LEASES FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER.

PAGE  26  INDEX  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT  FREIT CURRENTLY OPERATES EIGHT (8) MULTI-FAMILY  APARTMENT BUILDINGS OR COMPLEXES TOTALING 1,437 APARTMENT UNITS. ON JANUARY 14, 2020, FREIT AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES (COLLECTIVELY,  THE \u201cSELLERS\u201d), ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cPURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH AN  AFFILIATE OF THE KUSHNER COMPANIES (THE \u201cPURCHASER\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH THE SELLERS WILL SELL TO THE PURCHASER 100%  OF SELLERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN SEVEN APARTMENT PROPERTIES HELD BY THE SELLERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PURCHASE PRICE DESCRIBED  THEREIN, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT. (SEE NOTE 6 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS).  AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE ABOVE UNDER  THE CAPTION SEGMENT INFORMATION, TOTAL REVENUE AND NOI FROM FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER INCREASED  BY 3.4% AND 2.9%, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE AND NOI FOR THE CURRENT  QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN BASE RENTS ACROSS MOST PROPERTIES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY FOR ALL RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES  FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5% OVER THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER.  SAME PROPERTY OPERATING RESULTS: FREIT\u2019S  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT CURRENTLY CONTAINS EIGHT (8) SAME PROPERTIES. (SEE DEFINITION OF SAME PROPERTY UNDER SEGMENT INFORMATION ABOVE.)  SINCE ALL OF FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES ARE CONSIDERED SAME PROPERTIES IN THE CURRENT QUARTER, REFER TO THE PRECEDING  PARAGRAPH FOR DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN SAME PROPERTY RESULTS.  FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL REVENUE IS  PRINCIPALLY COMPOSED OF MONTHLY APARTMENT RENTAL INCOME. TOTAL RENTAL INCOME IS A FACTOR OF OCCUPANCY AND MONTHLY APARTMENT RENTS.  MONTHLY AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RENTS AT THE END OF THE CURRENT QUARTER AND THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER WERE $1,994 AND $1,947,  RESPECTIVELY. FOR COMPARABILITY PURPOSES, THE AVERAGE RESIDENTIAL RENT FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER HAS BEEN RESTATED TO  INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF STATION PLACE AND THE ICON. A 1% DECLINE IN ANNUAL AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, OR A 1% DECLINE IN AVERAGE RENTS FROM  CURRENT LEVELS, RESULTS IN AN ANNUAL REVENUE DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY $344,000 AND $323,000, RESPECTIVELY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES: SINCE ALL OF FREIT\u2019S  APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE BOULDERS, REGENCY, ICON AND STATION PLACE PROPERTIES, WERE CONSTRUCTED MORE THAN  25 YEARS AGO, FREIT TENDS TO SPEND MORE IN ANY GIVEN YEAR ON MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS THAN MAY BE SPENT ON NEWER PROPERTIES.  FUNDS FOR THESE CAPITAL PROJECTS WILL BE AVAILABLE FROM CASH FLOW FROM THE PROPERTY'S OPERATIONS AND CASH RESERVES.  FINANCING COSTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  (IN THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS)  FIXED RATE MORTGAGES (A).  1ST MORTGAGES  EXISTING  $2,211  $2,306  NEW  \u2014  \u2014  VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGES.  1ST MORTGAGES  EXISTING  1,632  1,890  NEW  \u2014  \u2014  OTHER  113  162  TOTAL FINANCING COSTS, GROSS  3,956  4,358  AMORTIZATION OF MORTGAGE COSTS  279  294  TOTAL FINANCING COSTS, NET  $4,235  $4,652  (A) INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE TO A FIXED INTEREST RATE OVER THE TERM OF THE LOAN.  TOTAL  FINANCING COSTS FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $417,000 OR 9.0% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER  WHICH IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES ON THE VARIABLE MORTGAGE LOANS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (\u201cG&A\u201d)  G&A EXPENSE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER  WAS $772,000 COMPARED TO $608,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF G&A ARE ACCOUNTING/AUDITING  FEES, LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES, AND TRUSTEES\u2019 AND CONSULTANT FEES.  DEPRECIATION  DEPRECIATION  EXPENSE FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS $2,932,000 COMPARED TO $2,824,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER.  PAGE  27  INDEX  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  NET  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $2.2 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OF $4.7 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER. FREIT EXPECTS THAT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH RESERVES  WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COVER MANDATORY DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS OF INTEREST, BUT EXCLUDING BALLOON PAYMENTS), REAL  ESTATE TAXES, RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AT PROPERTIES AND OTHER NEEDS TO MAINTAIN ITS STATUS AS A REIT FOR AT LEAST A PERIOD  OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF FILING OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH TOTALING $36.9 MILLION, COMPARED TO $42.5 MILLION AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE DECREASE IN CASH FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $2.2 MILLION IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING  ACTIVITIES, $0.3 MILLION IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $3.0 MILLION IN NET CASH USED  IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE DECLINE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPECIAL COMMITTEE EXPENSES  PAID IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION PAID OUT TO A RETIRED TRUSTEE  IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $4.8 MILLION.  IN FISCAL 2017, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC INCURRED  SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES AT THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY RELATED TO RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS, LEASING COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES  WHICH, IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEEDED REVENUES AS THE PROPERTY WAS STILL IN THE RENT UP PHASE AND THE CONSTRUCTION LOAN PREVIOUSLY  HELD WITH WELLS FARGO WAS AT ITS MAXIMUM LEVEL RESULTING IN NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DRAW. ACCORDINGLY, DURING FISCAL  2017 THE EQUITY OWNERS IN GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC (FREIT WITH A 60% OWNERSHIP AND ROTUNDA 100, LLC WITH A 40% OWNERSHIP) CONTRIBUTED  THEIR RESPECTIVE PRO-RATA SHARE OF ANY CASH NEEDS THROUGH LOANS TO GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31,  2019, ROTUNDA 100, LLC HAS FUNDED GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC WITH APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION AND $5.7 MILLION (INCLUDING INTEREST), RESPECTIVELY,  WHICH IS INCLUDED IN \u201cDUE TO AFFILIATE\u201d ON THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CREDIT LINE: ON OCTOBER 27, 2017, FREIT\u2019S  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT PROVIDED BY THE PROVIDENT BANK WAS RENEWED FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM ENDING ON OCTOBER 27, 2020 AT WHICH POINT  NO FURTHER ADVANCES SHALL BE PERMITTED AND PROVIDED THE LINE OF CREDIT IS NOT RENEWED BY THE LENDER, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL  BALANCE OF THE LINE OF CREDIT SHALL CONVERT TO A COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN MATURING ON OCTOBER 31, 2022. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE  CAN BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT. DRAWS AGAINST THE CREDIT LINE ARE SECURED BY MORTGAGES ON  FREIT\u2019S FRANKLIN CROSSING SHOPPING CENTER IN FRANKLIN LAKES, NEW JERSEY AND RETAIL SPACE IN GLEN ROCK, NEW JERSEY. THE TOTAL  LINE OF CREDIT WAS INCREASED FROM $12.8 MILLION TO $13 MILLION AND THE INTEREST RATE ON THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING WILL BE AT A FLOATING  RATE OF 275 BASIS POINTS OVER THE 30-DAY LIBOR WITH A FLOOR OF 3.75%. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS NO  AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AND $13 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT.  AS AT JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT\u2019S  AGGREGATE OUTSTANDING MORTGAGE DEBT WAS $351.8 MILLION, WHICH BEARS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.26% AND AN AVERAGE LIFE  OF APPROXIMATELY 4.1 YEARS. FREIT\u2019S FIXED RATE MORTGAGES ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION SCHEDULES THAT ARE LONGER THAN THE  TERMS OF THE MORTGAGES. AS SUCH, BALLOON PAYMENTS (UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS AT MORTGAGE DUE DATE) FOR ALL MORTGAGE DEBT WILL BE  REQUIRED AS FOLLOWS.  FISCAL YEAR  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024  2025  2026  2028  2029  ($ IN MILLIONS)  MORTGAGE \"BALLOON\" PAYMENTS  $21.9  $137.6 (A)  $14.4  $34.4  $9.0  $13.9  $18.2  $53.9  $26.0  (A) INCLUDES LOAN ON THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY LOCATED IN BALTIMORE, MARYLAND IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION REFINANCED WITH AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE ESTIMATED  FAIR VALUE AND NET CARRYING VALUE OF FREIT\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT AT JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019.  ($ IN MILLIONS)  JANUARY 31, 2020  OCTOBER 31, 2019  FAIR VALUE  $353.9  $352.9  CARRYING VALUE, NET  $349.1  $349.9  FAIR VALUES ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON MARKET INTEREST  RATES AT JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR ESTIMATION METHODS  MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THESE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES. THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON OBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 2 IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY  AS PROVIDED BY AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE).  FREIT EXPECTS TO REFINANCE THE INDIVIDUAL  MORTGAGES WITH NEW MORTGAGES WHEN THEIR TERMS EXPIRE. TO THIS EXTENT FREIT HAS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK. IF INTEREST RATES,  AT THE TIME ANY INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE NOTE IS DUE, ARE HIGHER THAN THE CURRENT FIXED INTEREST RATE, HIGHER DEBT SERVICE MAY BE REQUIRED,  AND/OR REFINANCING PROCEEDS MAY BE LESS THAN THE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE DEBT BEING RETIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, AT JANUARY 31, 2020, A 1%  INTEREST RATE INCREASE WOULD REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF FREIT\u2019S DEBT BY $9.7 MILLION, AND A 1% DECREASE WOULD INCREASE THE  FAIR VALUE BY $10.4 MILLION.  FREIT BELIEVES THAT THE VALUES OF ITS  PROPERTIES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO COMMAND REFINANCING PROCEEDS EQUAL TO OR HIGHER THAN THE MORTGAGE DEBT TO BE REFINANCED. FREIT CONTINUALLY  REVIEWS ITS DEBT LEVELS TO DETERMINE IF ADDITIONAL DEBT CAN PRUDENTLY BE UTILIZED FOR PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS FOR ITS REAL ESTATE  PORTFOLIO THAT WILL INCREASE INCOME AND CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS.  PAGE  28  INDEX  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, BERDAN COURT, LLC  (\u201cBERDAN COURT\u201d), (OWNED 100% BY FREIT), REFINANCED ITS $17 MILLION LOAN (WHICH MATURED ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019) WITH  THE LENDER IN THE AMOUNT OF $28,815,000. THIS LOAN, SECURED BY AN APARTMENT BUILDING LOCATED IN WAYNE, NEW JERSEY, HAS A TERM OF  TEN YEARS AND BEARS A FIXED INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 3.54%. INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED EACH MONTH FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS  OF THE TERM AND THEREAFTER, PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST WILL BE REQUIRED EACH MONTH THROUGH MATURITY. THIS REFINANCING  RESULTED IN: (I) A REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL INTEREST RATE FROM A FIXED RATE OF 6.09% TO A FIXED RATE OF 3.54% AND (II) NET REFINANCING  PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.6 MILLION WHICH CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  ON APRIL 3, 2019, WESTFREIT, CORP. (OWNED  100% BY FREIT) EXERCISED ITS OPTION TO EXTEND ITS LOAN HELD BY M&T BANK, WITH A THEN OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.5  MILLION, FOR TWELVE MONTHS. EFFECTIVE BEGINNING ON JUNE 1, 2019, THE EXTENSION OF THIS LOAN SECURED BY THE WESTRIDGE SQUARE SHOPPING  CENTER, REQUIRED MONTHLY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $47,250 PLUS INTEREST BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO 240 BASIS POINTS  OVER THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF MAY 1, 2020. FREIT IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE LENDER TO EXTEND THE LOAN.  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE LOAN IS ENTERED INTO, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE  LOAN WILL BE EXTENDED.  ON FEBRUARY 7, 2018, GRANDE ROTUNDA,  LLC REFINANCED ITS $115.3 MILLION CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO WITH A NEW LOAN HELD BY AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION IN THE  AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR RETAIL TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS IN THE  AMOUNT OF $3,380,000. THIS LOAN IS SECURED BY THE ROTUNDA PROPERTY, BEARS A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT 285 BASIS POINTS OVER THE  ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AND HAS A MATURITY DATE OF FEBRUARY 6, 2021 WITH TWO ONE-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION,  GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION,  CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY $118.5 MILLION  OF THIS LOAN FACILITY WAS DRAWN DOWN AND THE INTEREST RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.59%. ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED  AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR  RATE AT 3% FOR ONE YEAR. THIS INTEREST RATE CAP HAS AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF MARCH 5, 2020 AND A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 5, 2021.  INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS: TO REDUCE  INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, FREIT USES A \u201cPAY FIXED, RECEIVE FLOATING\u201d INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT FLOATING INTEREST  RATES TO FIXED INTEREST RATES OVER THE TERM OF A CERTAIN LOAN. FREIT ENTERS INTO THESE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT  IS USUALLY A HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL BANK. IN ESSENCE, FREIT AGREES TO PAY ITS COUNTERPARTIES A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST ON A DOLLAR  AMOUNT OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL (WHICH CORRESPONDS TO FREIT\u2019S MORTGAGE DEBT) OVER A TERM EQUAL TO THE TERM OF THE MORTGAGE NOTES.  FREIT\u2019S COUNTERPARTIES, IN RETURN, AGREE TO PAY FREIT A SHORT-TERM RATE OF INTEREST - GENERALLY LIBOR - ON THAT SAME NOTIONAL  AMOUNT OVER THE SAME TERM AS THE MORTGAGE NOTES.  FREIT HAS VARIABLE INTEREST RATE LOANS  SECURED BY ITS DAMASCUS CENTRE, REGENCY, WAYNE PSC AND STATION PLACE PROPERTIES. TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, FREIT ENTERED  INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS FOR EACH OF THESE LOANS. THESE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED VARIABLE INTEREST  RATE PAYMENTS TO FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS. THE CONTRACTS WERE BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $22,320,000 ($19,267,000  AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE SWAPS, A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $16,200,000 ($15,505,000 AT JANUARY 31,  2020) FOR THE REGENCY SWAP, A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $25,800,000 ($23,619,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE WAYNE PSC  SWAP AND A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $12,350,000 ($12,333,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) FOR THE STATION PLACE SWAP.  INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT: TO LIMIT  EXPOSURE ON INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY, FREIT USES AN INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT TO CAP A FLOATING INTEREST RATE AT A SET PRE-DETERMINED  RATE. FREIT ENTERS INTO CAP CONTRACTS WITH A COUNTERPARTY THAT IS USUALLY A HIGH-QUALITY COMMERCIAL BANK. IN ESSENCE, SO LONG AS  THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE IS BELOW THE CAP RATE, FREIT AGREES TO PAY ITS COUNTERPARTIES A VARIABLE RATE OF INTEREST ON A DOLLAR  AMOUNT OF NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL (WHICH CORRESPONDS TO FREIT\u2019S MORTGAGE DEBT). ONCE THE FLOATING INTEREST RATE RISES ABOVE THE  CAP RATE, FREIT\u2019S COUNTERPARTIES, IN RETURN, AGREE TO PAY FREIT A SHORT-TERM RATE OF INTEREST ABOVE THE CAP ON THAT SAME  NOTIONAL AMOUNT.  FREIT HAS A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE LOAN  SECURED BY ITS ROTUNDA PROPERTY. AS PART OF THE REFINANCING OF GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC\u2019S CONSTRUCTION LOAN HELD BY WELLS FARGO  WITH A NEW LOAN FROM AAREAL CAPITAL CORPORATION, GRANDE ROTUNDA, LLC PURCHASED AN INTEREST RATE CAP ON LIBOR FOR THE FULL AMOUNT  THAT CAN BE DRAWN ON THIS LOAN OF $121.9 MILLION, CAPPING THE ONE-MONTH LIBOR RATE AT 3% FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS LOAN.  THE CAP CONTRACT WAS BASED ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $121,900,000 ($121,900,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020) AND A TERM OF  TWO YEARS WITH THE LOAN BEING HEDGED AGAINST HAVING A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $118,520,000 AND A TERM OF THREE YEARS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASU 2017-12, WHICH  WAS ADOPTED BY FREIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, FREIT MARKS-TO-MARKET ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AND CAP CONTRACTS. AS THE  FLOATING INTEREST RATE VARIES FROM TIME-TO-TIME OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT WILL CHANGE UPWARD OR  DOWNWARD. IF THE FLOATING RATE IS HIGHER THAN THE FIXED RATE, THE VALUE OF THE CONTRACT GOES UP AND THERE IS A GAIN AND AN ASSET.  IF THE FLOATING RATE IS LESS THAN THE FIXED RATE, THERE IS A LOSS AND A LIABILITY. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAP ARE ACCOUNTED  FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS NOT AFFECTING FREIT\u2019S INCOME STATEMENT;  CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES WILL BE REPORTED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND APPEAR IN THE EQUITY SECTION  OF THE BALANCE SHEET. THIS GAIN OR LOSS REPRESENTS THE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE OF LIQUIDATING FIXED RATE SWAPS OR THE CAP CONTRACT  AND REPLACING THEM WITH LIKE-DURATION FUNDING AT CURRENT MARKET RATES, SOMETHING WE WOULD LIKELY NEVER DO. PERIODIC CASH SETTLEMENTS  OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO INTEREST EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2019, PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2017-12,  THE INTEREST RATE CAP WAS, FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, DEEMED TO BE AN INEFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE WITH A CORRESPONDING GAIN OR LOSS  BEING RECORDED IN FREIT\u2019S INCOME STATEMENT.  PAGE  29  INDEX  FREIT HAS THE FOLLOWING DERIVATIVE-RELATED  RISKS WITH ITS SWAP AND CAP CONTRACTS (\u201cCONTRACT\u201d): 1) EARLY TERMINATION RISK, AND 2) COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK.  EARLY TERMINATION RISK: IF FREIT  WANTS TO TERMINATE ITS CONTRACT BEFORE MATURITY, IT WOULD BE BOUGHT OUT OR TERMINATED AT MARKET VALUE; I.E., THE DIFFERENCE IN  THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ANTICIPATED NET CASH FLOWS FROM EACH OF THE CONTRACT\u2019S PARTIES. IF CURRENT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES  ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW FREIT\u2019S FIXED INTEREST RATE PAYMENTS, THIS COULD BE COSTLY. CONVERSELY, IF INTEREST RATES RISE ABOVE  FREIT\u2019S FIXED INTEREST PAYMENTS AND FREIT ELECTED EARLY TERMINATION, FREIT WOULD REALIZE A GAIN ON TERMINATION. AT JANUARY  31, 2020, THE SWAP CONTRACTS FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE, REGENCY, STATION PLACE AND WAYNE PSC WERE IN THE COUNTERPARTIES\u2019 FAVOR.  IF FREIT HAD TERMINATED THESE CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE IT WOULD HAVE REALIZED LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0 FOR THE ROTUNDA CAP, $239,000  FOR THE DAMASCUS CENTRE SWAPS, $917,000 FOR THE REGENCY SWAP, $1,122,000 FOR THE STATION PLACE SWAP AND $238,000 FOR THE WAYNE  PSC SWAP, ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS A LIABILITY IN FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS AT JANUARY 31,  2020. THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE FOR THE CONTRACT (GAIN OR LOSS) DURING SUCH PERIOD HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AND  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $390,000 IN COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.  IN FISCAL 2019, FREIT WAS  ACCOUNTING FOR ITS INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAP CONTRACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 815,  \u201cACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\u201d  . (SEE NOTE 2 AND 4 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS). FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF $2,364,000 IN  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS REPRESENTING THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAPS DURING SUCH PERIOD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019, FREIT RECORDED AN UNREALIZED LOSS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $154,000  FOR  GRANDE ROTUNDA\u2019S INTEREST RATE CAP REPRESENTING THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS INEFFECTIVE CASH FLOW HEDGE  DURING SUCH PERIOD. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GRANDE ROTUNDA INTEREST RATE CAP CONTRACT WAS $0.  COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK: EACH  PARTY TO A CAP OR SWAP CONTRACT BEARS THE RISK THAT ITS COUNTERPARTY WILL DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO MAKE A PERIODIC PAYMENT.  FREIT REDUCES THIS RISK BY ENTERING INTO SWAP OR CAP CONTRACTS ONLY WITH MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE EXPERIENCED MARKET  MAKERS IN THE DERIVATIVES MARKET.  DIVIDEND: IN VIEW OF FREIT HAVING ENTERED  INTO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES DID NOT DECLARE A DIVIDEND FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE  BOARD WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE DIVIDEND ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  STOCK OPTION PLAN  ON  MARCH 4, 2019, THE BOARD APPROVED THE GRANT OF AN AGGREGATE OF 5,000 NON-QUALIFIED SHARE OPTIONS UNDER THE PLAN TO THE CHAIRMAN  OF THE BOARD. THE OPTIONS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $15.00 PER SHARE, WILL VEST IN EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD  AND WILL EXPIRE 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WHICH WILL BE MARCH 3, 2029. (SEE NOTE 13 TO FREIT\u2019S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.)  PAGE  30  INDEX  ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d)  IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d). FREIT DOES  NOT INCLUDE SOURCES OR DISTRIBUTIONS FROM EQUITY/DEBT SOURCES IN ITS COMPUTATION OF FFO. ALTHOUGH MANY CONSIDER FFO AS THE STANDARD  MEASUREMENT OF A REIT\u2019S PERFORMANCE, FREIT MODIFIED THE NAREIT COMPUTATION OF FFO TO INCLUDE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO GAAP NET  INCOME THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF ITS DECISION MAKING PROCESS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO GAAP  NET INCOME ARE STRAIGHT-LINE RENTS AND RECURRING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS ON FREIT\u2019S RESIDENTIAL APARTMENTS. THE MODIFIED FFO  COMPUTATION IS REFERRED TO AS ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cAFFO\u201d). FREIT BELIEVES THAT AFFO IS A SUPERIOR MEASURE  OF ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FREIT COMPUTES FFO AND AFFO AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE)  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") (A)  NET (LOSS) INCOME  $(2,021  )  $435  DEPRECIATION OF CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES  2,932  2,824  AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED LEASING COSTS  113  127  DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS  (583  )  (294  )  FFO  $441  $3,092  PER SHARE - BASIC AND DILUTED  $0.06  $0.45  (A) AS PRESCRIBED BY NAREIT.

BASIC AND DILUTED  6,979  6,915  FFO AND AFFO DO NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED  FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME AS A MEASURE  OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FOR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE APPLICATION AND CALCULATION  OF FFO AND AFFO BY CERTAIN OTHER REITS MAY VARY MATERIALLY FROM THAT OF FREIT, AND THEREFORE FREIT\u2019S FFO AND AFFO MAY NOT  BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER REITS.  INFLATION  INFLATION CAN IMPACT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  OF FREIT IN VARIOUS WAYS. FREIT\u2019S COMMERCIAL TENANT LEASES NORMALLY PROVIDE THAT THE TENANTS BEAR ALL OR A PORTION OF MOST  OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE IMPACT OF INFLATIONARY INCREASES ON FREIT. APARTMENT LEASES ARE NORMALLY FOR A ONE-YEAR  TERM, WHICH MAY ALLOW FREIT TO SEEK INCREASED RENTS AS LEASES RENEW OR WHEN NEW TENANTS ARE OBTAINED, SUBJECT TO PREVAILING MARKET  CONDITIONS.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A NETWORKING SYSTEMS, SERVICES AND SOFTWARE COMPANY, PROVIDING SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE A WIDE RANGE OF NETWORK OPERATORS TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE NEXT-GENERATION NETWORKS THAT DELIVER SERVICES TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS. WE PROVIDE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THE TRANSPORT, SWITCHING, AGGREGATION, SERVICE DELIVERY AND MANAGEMENT OF VIDEO, DATA AND VOICE TRAFFIC ON COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE USED BY COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, CABLE AND MULTISERVICE OPERATORS, WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS, SUBMARINE NETWORK OPERATORS, GOVERNMENTS, ENTERPRISES, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND OTHER EMERGING NETWORK OPERATORS.  OUR SOLUTIONS INCLUDE OUR PORTFOLIO OF NETWORKING PLATFORMS, INCLUDING OUR CONVERGED PACKET OPTICAL AND PACKET NETWORKING PRODUCTS, THAT CAN BE APPLIED FROM THE NETWORK CORE TO END USER ACCESS POINTS, AND THAT ALLOW NETWORK OPERATORS TO SCALE CAPACITY, INCREASE TRANSMISSION SPEEDS, ALLOCATE TRAFFIC AND ADAPT DYNAMICALLY TO CHANGING END-USER SERVICE DEMANDS. WE OFFER PLATFORM SOFTWARE THAT PROVIDES MANAGEMENT AND DOMAIN CONTROL OF OUR HARDWARE SOLUTIONS AND AUTOMATES NETWORK LIFECYCLE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PROVISIONING EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES. THROUGH OUR BLUE PLANET\u00ae AUTOMATION SOFTWARE, WE  30  ENABLE NETWORK PROVIDERS TO USE NETWORK DATA, ANALYTICS AND POLICY-BASED ASSURANCE TO ACHIEVE CLOSED LOOP AUTOMATION ACROSS MULTI-VENDOR AND MULTI-DOMAIN NETWORK ENVIRONMENTS, STREAMLINING KEY BUSINESS AND NETWORK PROCESSES. TO COMPLEMENT OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, WE OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES THAT HELP OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD, OPERATE AND IMPROVE THEIR NETWORKS AND ASSOCIATED OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENTS.  WE REFER TO OUR COMPLETE PORTFOLIO VISION AS THE ADAPTIVE NETWORKTM. THE ADAPTIVE NETWORK EMPHASIZES A PROGRAMMABLE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE, SOFTWARE CONTROL AND AUTOMATION CAPABILITIES, AND NETWORK ANALYTICS AND INTELLIGENCE. BY TRANSFORMING NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURES INTO A DYNAMIC, PROGRAMMABLE ENVIRONMENT DRIVEN BY AUTOMATION AND ANALYTICS, NETWORK OPERATORS CAN REALIZE GREATER BUSINESS AGILITY, DYNAMICALLY ADAPT TO CHANGING END USER SERVICE DEMANDS AND RAPIDLY INTRODUCE NEW REVENUE-GENERATING SERVICES. THEY CAN ALSO GAIN VALUABLE REAL-TIME NETWORK INSIGHTS, ALLOWING THEM TO OPTIMIZE NETWORK OPERATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.  STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  INVESTMENT IN BLUE PLANET AUTOMATION SOFTWARE  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PURSUE BOTH ORGANIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND OUR BLUE PLANET AUTOMATION SOFTWARE AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO AND BUSINESS. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2019, WE ACQUIRED PRIVATELY HELD CENTINA SYSTEMS, INC. (\u201cCENTINA\u201d), A PROVIDER OF SERVICE ASSURANCE ANALYTICS AND NETWORK PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THE ACQUISITION OF CENTINA IS INTENDED TO ACCELERATE BLUE PLANET\u2019S SOFTWARE STRATEGY OF PROVIDING CLOSED LOOP, INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION SOLUTIONS THAT HELP COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ANALYZE NETWORK CONDITIONS, TRAFFIC DEMANDS AND RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, AND TO DETERMINE THE BEST PLACEMENT OF TRAFFIC FOR OPTIMAL SERVICE QUALITY AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION. SEE NOTE  4  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART 1 OF THIS REPORT.  INVESTMENT IN ADAPTIVE NETWORK OFFERINGS AND 5G INNOVATION  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO USE OUR SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT CAPACITY TO PUSH THE PACE OF INNOVATION IN OUR MARKETS AND PROVIDE OFFERINGS THAT PROMOTE OUR ADAPTIVE NETWORK VISION THROUGH FURTHER ADVANCES IN PROGRAMMABLE HARDWARE, ANALYTICS, AND CONTROL AND AUTOMATION. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE BEGAN MARKET TRIALS OF OUR FIFTH-GENERATION WAVELOGIC COHERENT MODEM TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS CAPABLE OF DELIVERING 800 GIGABITS OF CAPACITY PER SECOND OVER A SINGLE WAVELENGTH. WE EXPECT TO MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE IN CERTAIN CONVERGED PACKET OPTICAL PLATFORMS BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  IN FEBRUARY 2020, WE ANNOUNCED THE FUTURE ADDITION OF SEVERAL NEW WIRELINE ROUTING PLATFORMS TO SUPPORT THE DEMANDS OF MOBILE XHAUL (FRONTHAUL, MIDHAUL AND BACKHAUL) TRANSPORT AND TO ENABLE MOBILE NETWORK OPERATOR MIGRATION FROM 4G TO 5G NETWORKS. IN ADDITION, WE ENHANCED OUR BLUE PLANET INTELLIGENT AUTOMATION SOFTWARE PORTFOLIO FOR 5G AUTOMATION APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING VENDOR-AGNOSTIC NETWORK SLICING FEATURES AND DYNAMIC PLANNING CAPABILITIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BETTER ENABLE MOBILE NETWORK OPERATOR DELIVERY OF 5G MOBILE SERVICES. WE EXPECT TO MAKE THESE NEW PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020.  2025 TERM LOAN REFINANCING AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT  WE REFINANCED OUR EXISTING SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN WITH AN OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $693 MILLION AS OF JANUARY 23, 2020 AND MATURING ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2025 FOR A LOWER PER ANNUM RATE EQUAL TO (A) LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 1.75%, OR (B) A BASE RATE (SUBJECT TO A FLOOR OF 1.00%) PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 0.75%. ALL OTHER TERMS REMAIN IN EFFECT.  CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19)  WE HAVE TAKEN A NUMBER OF PRECAUTIONARY STEPS TO SAFEGUARD OUR BUSINESS AND OUR EMPLOYEES FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS COVID-19, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING TRAVEL BANS AND RESTRICTIONS, TEMPORARILY CLOSING OFFICES AND CANCELING PARTICIPATION IN VARIOUS INDUSTRY EVENTS. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS, INCLUDING FLEXIBLE WORKING ARRANGEMENTS, DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE ANY POTENTIAL BUSINESS DISRUPTION AND TO PROTECT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT OF THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS, TO DATE WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME DISRUPTION AND DELAY OF SUPPLY, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO CHINA, AND LOGISTICS CHALLENGES, INCLUDING CERTAIN LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CERTAIN SITES THAT HAVE IMPACTED OUR CUSTOMER FULFILLMENT OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. WE ARE MONITORING THE SITUATION AND ACTIVELY ASSESSING FURTHER POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND CUSTOMER DEMAND. HOWEVER, THE CORONAVIRUS SITUATION REMAINS DYNAMIC. FOR EXAMPLE, ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) RAISED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE CORONAVIRUS THREAT FROM HIGH TO VERY HIGH AT A GLOBAL LEVEL DUE TO THE CONTINUED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CASES AND AFFECTED COUNTRIES. AS A RESULT, THE BROADER IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REMAIN UNCERTAIN. IF THE CORONAVIRUS OR ITS ADVERSE EFFECTS BECOME MORE PREVALENT IN THE LOCATIONS WHERE WE, OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS OR MANUFACTURERS CONDUCT BUSINESS, OR WE EXPERIENCE MORE PRONOUNCED DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE CONSTRAINED SUPPLY OR CURTAILED CUSTOMER DEMAND THAT MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.  31  AVAILABLE INFORMATION.

THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD DECREASE IN NET SALES REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OFFSET, BY LOWER NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. NET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  45  INDEX  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $96.1 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  $86.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , AN  INCREASE  OF  $9.4  MILLION, OR  10.8%  .

DESPITE THE EXPECTED NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE STILL BELIEVE THIS SEGMENT WILL GROW IN FISCAL 2020.  BOOKINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE BOOKINGS WE ACHIEVED IN BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) FOR THIS SEGMENT WAS  1.03  . PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS IS NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE LOWER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES TO BOTH U.S. GOVERNMENT AND DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. OUR HEIGHTS  TM  SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO GAIN TRACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HEIGHTS  TM  NETWORKING PLATFORM WAS RECENTLY SELECTED BY A MAJOR MARITIME SERVICE PROVIDER IN ASIA AS THE BEST FIT FOR DEMANDING MARITIME APPLICATIONS. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER, WE WERE ALSO AWARDED A CONTRACT VALUED AT MORE THAN $8.8 MILLION FOR KA-BAND SOLID-STATE AMPLIFIERS TO BE USED IN AN IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY SATCOM APPLICATION. OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DETERIORATION IN MACROECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS ARE TEMPORARY AND THAT CONDITIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL 2020. HOWEVER, OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RESULTING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS. IF CURRENT POOR BUSINESS CONDITIONS INCLUDING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND ORDER DELAYS CONTINUE, FISCAL 2020 DELIVERIES AND OR OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR PIPELINE COULD SHIFT INTO FISCAL 2021.  NET SALES IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AS COMPARED TO THE NET SALES WE ACHIEVED IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL SALES TO KEY WIRELESS CUSTOMERS FOR 911 CALL ROUTING. SALES OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HAVE LONG SALES CYCLES AND ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFICULT-TO-PREDICT CHANGES IN THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES OF WIRELESS CARRIER CUSTOMERS, BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE POSITIONED WELL. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ANNOUNCED A CONTRACT WORTH $6.6 MILLION TO UPGRADE A NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEM FOR A NEW ENGLAND STATE, AS WELL AS A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION TOTALING AN ESTIMATED $14.2 MILLION TO PROVIDE ENHANCED 911 SERVICES TO A TIER ONE U.S. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LARGE OPPORTUNITIES PENDING RELATED TO UPGRADES TO NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEMS. OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS REMAIN FAVORABLE; AS SUCH, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 TO BE ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $65.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  $77.4  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $11.9  MILLION, OR  15.4%  . OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  40.5%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  47.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW, OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG AND DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS STILL APPEARS ROBUST. HOWEVER, LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW BELIEVE THAT NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, LARGELY DUE TO THE TIMING OF AND PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS RELATED TO OUR $98.6 MILLION U.S. ARMY GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT.  BOOKINGS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE HIGHER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  0.80  . BOOKINGS DURING THE QUARTER INCLUDE $13.4 MILLION OF INITIAL FUNDING RELATED TO A 10-YEAR, $211.0 MILLION IDIQ CONTRACT AWARDED TO US BY A PRIME CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION TROPOSCATTER SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS. WE BELIEVE THIS MULTI-YEAR OPPORTUNITY VALIDATES COMTECH\u2019S MARKET LEADING TROPOSCATTER TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPERTISE. PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS ARE NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  46  INDEX  NET SALES OF OUR MISSION-CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , LARGELY DUE TO LOWER NET SALES OF SATELLITE BASED SPACE COMPONENTS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH RELIABILITY ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONIC AND ELECTROMECHANICAL (\"EEE\") PARTS, AS WELL AS THE ABSENCE OF SALES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD RELATED TO OUR NEXT GENERATION MT-2025 MOBILE SATELLITE TRANSCEIVERS.  NET SALES OF OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE HIGHER THAN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF OUR SOLID-STATE, HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIERS AND RELATED SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING, DEPLOYMENT AND TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS BY OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.

GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE  SALES BY GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE AS FOLLOWS.

DOMESTIC SALES INCLUDE SALES TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO U.S. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THERE WERE  NO  CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  . INCLUDED IN DOMESTIC SALES, ARE SALES TO VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC. (\"VERIZON\"). SALES TO VERIZON WERE  10.1%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  (WHICH INCLUDE SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS) WERE  $35.3 MILLION  AND  $37.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S.,  NO  INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY (INCLUDING SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY) REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $60.6  MILLION AND  $61.2  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  DECREASE  OF  $0.6  MILLION REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  37.5%  AS COMPARED TO  37.3%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THIS SLIGHT INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT HISTORICALLY ACHIEVES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 PRIMARILY REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX, INCLUDING LOWER NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO ANTICIPATED MIX CHANGES, INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED CESSATION OF SALES TO AT&T FOR 911 WIRELESS CALL ROUTING WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  47  INDEX  OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG AND THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THIS SEGMENT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LEVEL ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY OF  $0.6  MILLION AND  $1.0  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED IN \"  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY,\"  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY AND RECORD A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED USAGE TRENDS.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. NEVERTHELESS, BASED ON EXPECTED BOOKINGS, EXPECTED TIMING OF OUR PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS AND THE ANTICIPATED MIX OF NET SALES BETWEEN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 TO BE THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $29.4  MILLION AND  $32.0  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $2.6  MILLION, OR  8.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  18.2%  AND  19.5%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $3.9 MILLION OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO THE REPOSITIONING OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, IN ADDITION TO A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. EXCLUDING THE $0.3 MILLION, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WOULD HAVE BEEN $29.7 MILLION, OR 18.4% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $28.1 MILLION, OR 17.1% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES.  AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECORDED AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS  $1.1 MILLION  IN BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT TOTAL FISCAL 2020 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER AND, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SIMILAR TO THE  19.1% RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  $13.7  MILLION AND  $14.0  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $0.3  MILLION, OR  2.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  8.5%  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $11.9  MILLION RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND  $1.7  MILLION AND  $2.0  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE REMAINING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $0.1  MILLION FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE SEEK CUSTOMER FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ADAPT OUR PRODUCTS TO SPECIALIZED CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , CUSTOMERS REIMBURSED US  $2.4  MILLION AND  $2.3  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT IS INCLUDED IN NET SALES WITH THE RELATED COSTS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS IN NEW PRODUCTS ACROSS ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE  8.4% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  AMORTIZATION RELATING TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES WAS  $5.2  MILLION (OF WHICH  $4.3  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $0.9  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  $4.3  MILLION (OF WHICH  $3.5  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $0.8  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE OF  $0.9  MILLION WAS DUE TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC IN JANUARY 2020.  48  INDEX  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES TOTAL ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.0  MILLION WHICH REFLECTS A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. SUCH TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ANY PENDING OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  SETTLEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A  $3.2  MILLION BENEFIT IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $6.0  MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS OF UHP AND GILAT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $1.8  MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITION OF SOLACOM. THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY  $3.6  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF GILAT AND UHP. THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT OUR ACQUISITION PLAN EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND TOTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MAY ULTIMATELY BE HIGHER.  OPERATING INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $6.2  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $12.4  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  UNALLOCATED  CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  $12.6  8.8  5.0  7.8  (11.4  )  (4.1  )  $6.2  12.4  PERCENTAGE OF RELATED NET SALES  13.1%  10.1%  7.6%  10.1%  NA  NA  3.8%  7.6%  THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  REFLECTS  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH CHARGE, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $12.7 MILLION, OR 14.6% OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES. THE SLIGHT DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT'S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE HIGHER THAN THE  10.1% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN NET SALES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, IN ADDITION TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE LOWER THAN THE 9.2% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER AND THE $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS  $1.2 MILLION  FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  EXCLUDING THE  $6.0 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $0.3 MILLION BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS DURING THE PERIOD, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WOULD HAVE BEEN  $12.0 MILLION  , OR  7.4%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $1.8 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES,  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS AND  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN $14.9 MILLION, OR 9.1% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECREASE FROM 9.1% TO  7.4%  REFLECTS CHANGES IN OVERALL SPENDING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  49  INDEX  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES, SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY CERTAIN ANNUAL NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS IN THE FORM OF FULLY-VESTED SHARE UNITS. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS, ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS. IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE OUR FISCAL 2020 BUSINESS GOALS, AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD BE LOWER THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 RANGE.  LOOKING FORWARD, UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE $23.6 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY: (I) INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (WHICH IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS) WHICH, IN FISCAL 2020, IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $12.0 MILLION TO $14.0 MILLION; (II) INCREASED COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING INCREMENTAL COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH; (III) THE ABSENCE OF A $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2020 RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE RULING IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER; (IV) INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES; AND (IV) OTHER INCREASED SPENDING AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY ASSUMED IN FISCAL 2020.  DESPITE THE INCURRENCE OF $8.4 MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $32,000 BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL $3.6 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR FISCAL 2020 GAAP CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES) IS ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE $41.4 MILLION OR  6.2% WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $1.6  MILLION AND  $2.3  MILLION FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE (INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS APPROXIMATELY  4.3%.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW EXPECT OUR FISCAL 2020 INTEREST EXPENSE RATE TO APPROXIMATE  4.5%  AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE TO APPROXIMATE  $7.0  MILLION. OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 CASH BORROWING RATE (WHICH EXCLUDES THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IS APPROXIMATELY  3.50%  TO  3.75%.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER FOR BOTH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS NOMINAL. ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WHICH, AT THIS TIME, ARE CURRENTLY YIELDING AN IMMATERIAL INTEREST RATE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS  $1.1  MILLION AND  $2.4  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (EXCLUDING DISCRETE TAX ITEMS) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS 23.0%. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.1 MILLION  . DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE OF LESS THAN  $0.1 MILLION.  OUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL 2017 AND 2018 ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF OUR STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. TCS'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 TO FEBRUARY 23, 2016, THE DATE WE ACQUIRED TCS, IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF TCS'S STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO CALENDAR YEAR 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. FUTURE TAX ASSESSMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  NET INCOME.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME WAS  $3.5  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $7.8  MILLION DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  50  INDEX  ADJUSTED EBITDA.

THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, AND DECREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET SALES IN THIS SEGMENT OFFSET BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT AS WELL AS UNALLOCATED SPENDING, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 INCLUDES SEVERAL ITEMS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN STILL SHIFT AND IMPACT OUR EXPECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  LOOKING FORWARD, BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG, THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED SALES, AND OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WE ARE TARGETING CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER IN FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE $93.5 MILLION WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019. AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE  14.0%  IN FISCAL 2020.  51  INDEX  A RECONCILIATION OF OUR FISCAL 2019 GAAP NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $93.5 MILLION  IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW (NUMBERS IN THE TABLE MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING).

THESE MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP IN THE ABOVE TABLES, BUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT ALL OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS OR COSTS ARE UNUSUAL, INFREQUENT OR NON-RECURRING. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. INVESTORS ARE ADVISED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR SEC FILINGS. WE HAVE NOT QUANTITATIVELY RECONCILED OUR FISCAL 2020 ADJUSTED EBITDA TARGET TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE BECAUSE ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT IMPACT THESE MEASURES, HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED, ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, OR CANNOT BE PREDICTED. FOR EXAMPLE, QUANTIFICATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES INPUTS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND MARKET PRICE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ASCERTAINABLE. ACCORDINGLY, RECONCILIATIONS TO THE NON-GAAP FORWARD LOOKING METRICS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT AND SUCH UNAVAILABLE RECONCILING ITEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  NET SALES.  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES WERE  $331.9  MILLION AND  $325.0  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  $6.9  MILLION, OR  2.1%  . THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. NET SALES BY OPERATING SEGMENT ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $190.4  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  $164.7  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , AN  INCREASE  OF  $25.7  MILLION, OR  15.6%  . OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  57.4%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  50.7%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . DESPITE THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE STILL BELIEVE THIS SEGMENT WILL GROW IN FISCAL 2020.  BOOKINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) FOR THIS SEGMENT WAS  0.91  . PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS IS NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE LOWER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES TO BOTH DOMESTIC AND U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. OUR HEIGHTS  TM  SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO GAIN TRACTION. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR HEIGHTS  TM  NETWORKING PLATFORM WAS RECENTLY SELECTED BY A MAJOR MARITIME SERVICE PROVIDER IN ASIA AS THE BEST FIT FOR DEMANDING MARITIME APPLICATIONS. DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER, WE WERE ALSO AWARDED A CONTRACT VALUED AT MORE THAN $8.8 MILLION FOR KA-BAND SOLID-STATE AMPLIFIERS TO BE USED IN AN IN-FLIGHT CONNECTIVITY SATCOM APPLICATION. OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS OUR ASSUMPTION THAT THE SUDDEN AND UNEXPECTED DETERIORATION IN MACROECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS CAUSED BY THE CORONAVIRUS ARE TEMPORARY AND THAT CONDITIONS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE DURING THE SECOND HALF OF OUR FISCAL 2020. HOWEVER, OUR UPDATED FISCAL 2020 OUTLOOK REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY RESULTING FROM THE CORONAVIRUS. IF CURRENT POOR BUSINESS CONDITIONS INCLUDING TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND ORDER DELAYS CONTINUE, FISCAL 2020 DELIVERIES AND OR OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR PIPELINE COULD SHIFT INTO FISCAL 2021.  53  INDEX  NET SALES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  OF OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AS COMPARED TO THE NET SALES WE ACHIEVED IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL SALES TO KEY WIRELESS CUSTOMERS FOR 911 CALL ROUTING. SALES OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SLIGHTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS HAVE LONG SALES CYCLES AND ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFICULT-TO-PREDICT CHANGES IN THE OVERALL PROCUREMENT STRATEGIES OF WIRELESS CARRIER CUSTOMERS, BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE POSITIONED WELL. FOR INSTANCE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ANNOUNCED A CONTRACT WORTH $6.6 MILLION TO UPGRADE A NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEM FOR A NEW ENGLAND STATE, AS WELL AS A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION TOTALING AN ESTIMATED $14.2 MILLION TO PROVIDE ENHANCED 911 SERVICES TO A TIER ONE U.S. WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIER. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LARGE OPPORTUNITIES PENDING RELATED TO UPGRADES TO NEXT GENERATION 911 SYSTEMS. OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS REMAIN FAVORABLE; AS SUCH, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 TO BE ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY AND LOCATION TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WERE  $141.5  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  $160.3  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $18.8  MILLION, OR  11.7%  . OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT REPRESENTED  42.6%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , AS COMPARED TO  49.3%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . HOWEVER, LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW BELIEVE THAT NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT WILL BE LOWER THAN THE LEVEL WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, LARGELY DUE TO THE TIMING OF AND PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS RELATED TO OUR $98.6 MILLION U.S. ARMY GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT.  BOOKINGS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OUR BOOK-TO-BILL RATIO (A MEASURE DEFINED AS BOOKINGS DIVIDED BY NET SALES) IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  0.80  . BOOKINGS DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD INCLUDE $13.4 MILLION OF INITIAL FUNDING RELATED TO A 10-YEAR, $211.0 MILLION IDIQ CONTRACT AWARDED TO US BY A PRIME CONTRACTOR TO PROVIDE NEXT GENERATION TROPOSCATTER SYSTEMS IN SUPPORT OF THE U.S. MARINE CORPS. WE BELIEVE THIS MULTI-YEAR OPPORTUNITY VALIDATES COMTECH\u2019S MARKET LEADING TROPOSCATTER TECHNOLOGIES AND EXPERTISE. ALSO, DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD, THE U.S ARMY AWARDED US A CONTRACT WITH A $98.6 MILLION CEILING TO PROVIDE GLOBAL FIELD SUPPORT SERVICES FOR MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATION (\"SATCOM\") TERMINALS AROUND THE WORLD. THESE SATCOM TERMINALS PROVIDE INTER AND INTRA-THEATER NETWORK COMMUNICATIONS WITH WORLDWIDE REACH BACK CAPABILITY. THE FIELD SUPPORT CONTRACT COVERS DIVERSE ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SKILLS TO SUPPORT THESE SATCOM TERMINALS, INCLUDING LOGISTICS, HELP DESK, NETWORK ENGINEERING, SECURITY ENGINEERING, RF AND SATELLITE SYSTEM ENGINEERING AND SUPPORT. TO DATE, THE CONTRACT HAS BEEN FUNDED AT $24.4 MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING EXPECTED TO OCCUR ACROSS THE TWELVE-MONTH PERFORMANCE PERIOD PLUS A POSSIBLE SIX-MONTH EXTENSION PERIOD. PERIOD-TO-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS IN BOOKINGS ARE NORMAL FOR THIS SEGMENT.  NET SALES OF OUR MISSION-CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET SALES TO THE U.S. ARMY OF OUR NEXT GENERATION MT-2025 MOBILE SATELLITE TRANSCEIVERS, AS WELL AS LOWER NET SALES OF SATELLITE BASED SPACE COMPONENTS, ANTENNAS AND HIGH RELIABILITY ELECTRICAL, ELECTRONIC AND ELECTROMECHANICAL (\u201cEEE\u201d) PARTS.  NET SALES OF OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE TRANSMISSION TECHNOLOGIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF OUR SOLID-STATE, HIGH-POWER AMPLIFIERS AND RELATED SWITCHING TECHNOLOGIES.  BOOKINGS, SALES AND PROFITABILITY IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT CAN FLUCTUATE DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING UNPREDICTABLE FUNDING, DEPLOYMENT AND TECHNOLOGY DECISIONS BY OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. AS SUCH, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR RESULTS MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF A TREND OR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  54  INDEX  GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE  SALES BY GEOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMER TYPE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  CONSOLIDATED  U.S. GOVERNMENT  17.8%  21.3%  72.5%  68.8%  41.2%  44.7%  DOMESTIC  56.4%  52.2%  9.4%  10.6%  36.3%  31.7%  TOTAL U.S.  74.2%  73.5%  81.9%  79.4%  77.5%  76.4%  INTERNATIONAL  25.8%  26.5%  18.1%  20.6%  22.5%  23.6%  TOTAL  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  100.0%  SALES TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS INCLUDE SALES TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (\"DOD\"), INTELLIGENCE AND CIVILIAN AGENCIES, AS WELL AS SALES DIRECTLY TO OR THROUGH PRIME CONTRACTORS.  DOMESTIC SALES INCLUDE SALES TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS TO U.S. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THERE WERE NO CUSTOMERS THAT REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  (WHICH INCLUDE SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS) WERE  $74.7 MILLION  AND  $76.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. EXCEPT FOR THE U.S.,  NO  INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY (INCLUDING SALES TO U.S. DOMESTIC COMPANIES FOR INCLUSION IN PRODUCTS THAT ARE SOLD TO A FOREIGN COUNTRY) REPRESENTED MORE THAN  10.0%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $124.2  MILLION AND  $119.0  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  INCREASE  OF  $5.2  MILLION REFLECTS HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER NET SALES IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  37.4%  AS COMPARED TO  36.6%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THIS INCREASE WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DRIVEN BY PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AS A RESULT OF THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN NET SALES IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THIS SEGMENT HISTORICALLY ACHIEVES HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW.  OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  DECREASED IN COMPARISON TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  PRIMARILY REFLECTS CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX, INCLUDING LOWER NET SALES OF OUR SATELLITE GROUND STATION EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES. LOOKING FORWARD, WE EXPECT OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2020 TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PERCENTAGE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO ANTICIPATED MIX CHANGES, INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED CESSATION OF SALES TO AT&T FOR 911 WIRELESS CALL ROUTING WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN COMPARISON TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG AND THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT FOR THIS SEGMENT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR OR SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE LEVEL ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  ARE PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY OF  $0.9 MILLION  AND  $1.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED IN \"  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES - PROVISIONS FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY,\"  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR INVENTORY AND RECORD A PROVISION FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED USAGE TRENDS.  55  INDEX  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. NEVERTHELESS, BASED ON EXPECTED BOOKINGS, EXPECTED TIMING OF OUR PERFORMANCE ON ORDERS AND THE ANTICIPATED MIX OF NET SALES BETWEEN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS AND GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENTS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, FOR FISCAL 2020 TO BE THE SAME OR SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $61.2  MILLION AND  $63.8  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING A  DECREASE  OF  $2.6  MILLION, OR  4.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  18.4%  AND  19.6%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED  $1.4 MILLION  OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS RELATED TO THE REPOSITIONING OF OUR LOCATION TECHNOLOGIES SOLUTIONS OFFERINGS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. EXCLUDING SUCH COSTS, OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE BEEN $58.5 MILLION, OR 18.0% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD REFLECTS THE ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECORDED AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS  $1.8 MILLION  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT TOTAL FISCAL 2020 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER AND, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SIMILAR TO THE  19.1% RECORDED IN FISCAL 2019.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  $28.6  MILLION AND  $27.2  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN  INCREASE  OF  $1.4  MILLION, OR  5.1%  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE  8.6%  AND  8.4%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $24.8  MILLION AND  $23.4  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, AND  $3.6  MILLION AND  $3.7  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE REMAINING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF  $0.2  MILLION FOR BOTH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  RELATED TO THE AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  WHENEVER POSSIBLE, WE SEEK CUSTOMER FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO ADAPT OUR PRODUCTS TO SPECIALIZED CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , CUSTOMERS REIMBURSED US  $5.1  MILLION AND  $7.3  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE REPORTED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT IS INCLUDED IN NET SALES WITH THE RELATED COSTS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AS WELL AS IN NEW PRODUCTS ACROSS ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT LINES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT SPENDING PLANS, WE EXPECT FISCAL 2020 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE  8.4% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  AMORTIZATION RELATING TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH FINITE LIVES WAS  $10.4  MILLION (OF WHICH  $8.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $1.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  $8.6  MILLION (OF WHICH  $6.9  MILLION WAS FOR THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT AND  $1.7  MILLION WAS FOR THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE OF  $1.9  MILLION WAS DUE TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC IN JANUARY 2020.  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES TOTAL ANNUAL AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.0  MILLION WHICH REFLECTS A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITIONS OF SOLACOM AND THE GD NG-911 BUSINESS AND APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS OF AMORTIZATION RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. SUCH TOTAL AMOUNT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ANY PENDING OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  SETTLEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LITIGATION.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE ADJUSTMENT IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  56  INDEX  ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $8.4  MILLION, INCLUDING EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC, AND OUR PENDING ACQUISITIONS OF UHP AND GILAT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE INCURRED ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES OF  $2.9  MILLION, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR FISCAL 2019 ACQUISITION OF SOLACOM. THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN OUR UNALLOCATED SEGMENT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY  $3.6  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF GILAT AND UHP. THERE IS NO CERTAINTY THAT OUR ACQUISITION PLAN EFFORTS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND TOTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MAY ULTIMATELY BE HIGHER.  OPERATING INCOME.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $15.5  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $19.7  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW.  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  2020  2019  ($ IN MILLIONS)  COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS  GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS  UNALLOCATED  CONSOLIDATED  OPERATING INCOME (LOSS)  $22.5  15.8  12.1  14.4  (19.1  )  (10.5  )  $15.5  19.7  PERCENTAGE OF RELATED NET SALES  11.8%  9.6%  8.6%  9.0%  NA  NA  4.7%  6.1%  THE COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  REFLECTS  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH CHARGE, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  WOULD HAVE BEEN $19.7 MILLION, OR 12.0% OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS, AND SLIGHT DECREASE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INCREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S NET SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY A DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT'S GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE, HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE HIGHER THAN THE  10.1% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\u2019S OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  INCLUDED $1.4 MILLION OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. EXCLUDING SUCH FACILITY EXIT COSTS, OPERATING INCOME IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WOULD HAVE BEEN  $15.8 MILLION  , OR  9.9%  OF RELATED SEGMENT SALES. THE DECREASE, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  FROM $15.8 MILLION, OR 9.9% TO $12.1 MILLION, OR 8.6%, WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT\u2019S NET SALES DURING THE MOST RECENT PERIOD, IN ADDITION TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CGC. LOOKING FORWARD, GIVEN EXPECTED SALES AND PRODUCT MIX ASSUMPTIONS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE EXPECT THIS SEGMENT\u2019S FISCAL 2020 OPERATING INCOME, IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, TO BE LOWER THAN THE 9.2% ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED BUSINESS AND SALES ACTIVITY AND HIGHER ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES DURING THE MOST RECENT SIX MONTH PERIOD, AND THE $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD RELATED TO A FAVORABLE RULING ISSUED BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WAS  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $2.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  EXCLUDING THE  $8.4  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WOULD HAVE BEEN  $23.9 MILLION  , OR  7.2%  OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. EXCLUDING THE  $3.9 MILLION  OF ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS,  $1.4 MILLION  OF FACILITY EXIT COSTS,  $2.9 MILLION  OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND  $3.2 MILLION  BENEFIT RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WOULD HAVE BEEN $24.7 MILLION, OR 7.6% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES. THE DECREASE FROM 7.6% TO  7.2%  REFLECTS CHANGES IN OVERALL SPENDING AS WELL AS INCREASED AMORTIZATION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 ASSUMES, SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR THREE FISCAL YEARS, THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO PAY CERTAIN ANNUAL NON-EQUITY INCENTIVE AWARDS IN THE FORM OF FULLY-VESTED SHARE UNITS. AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION CAN FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD BASED ON THE TYPE AND TIMING OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS, ESTIMATED FORFEITURES AND THE ACHIEVEMENT OF APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE GOALS. IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE OUR FISCAL 2020 BUSINESS GOALS, AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD BE LOWER THAN OUR CURRENT EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 RANGE.  57  INDEX  LOOKING FORWARD, UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN THE $23.6 MILLION INCURRED IN FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN UNALLOCATED EXPENSES IS EXPECTED TO BE DRIVEN BY: (I) INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (WHICH IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS) WHICH, IN FISCAL 2020, IS EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM $12.0 MILLION TO $14.0 MILLION; (II) INCREASED COMPENSATION COSTS, INCLUDING INCREMENTAL COSTS FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR ANTICIPATED GROWTH; (III) THE ABSENCE OF A $3.2 MILLION BENEFIT IN FISCAL 2020 RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE RULING IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR RELATED TO A LEGACY TCS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MATTER; (IV) INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES; AND (IV) OTHER INCREASED SPENDING AS A RESULT OF INCREASED BUSINESS ACTIVITY ASSUMED IN FISCAL 2020.  DESPITE THE INCURRENCE OF  $8.4  MILLION OF ACQUISITION PLAN EXPENSES AND A $32,000 BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF CERTAIN ESTIMATED CONTRACT SETTLEMENT COSTS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL $3.6 MILLION OF SUCH COSTS EXPECTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR FISCAL 2020 GAAP CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME (IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES) IS ANTICIPATED TO BE SIMILAR TO THE $41.4 MILLION OR  6.2% WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.4  MILLION AND  $4.9  MILLION FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LOWER INTEREST RATES. OUR EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE (INCLUDING AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS APPROXIMATELY  4.5%.  LOOKING FORWARD, WE NOW EXPECT OUR FISCAL 2020 INTEREST EXPENSE RATE TO APPROXIMATE  4.5%  AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE TO APPROXIMATE  $7.0  MILLION. OUR CURRENT AND EXPECTED FISCAL 2020 CASH BORROWING RATE (WHICH EXCLUDES THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS) IS APPROXIMATELY  3.50%  TO  3.75%.  WRITE-OFF OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE WROTE-OFF  $3.2 MILLION  OF DEFERRED FINANCING COSTS WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN PORTION OF OUR PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY. SEE \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  NOTE (11)  -  CREDIT FACILITY  \" FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. THERE WAS NO COMPARABLE CHARGE IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER.  INTEREST (INCOME) AND OTHER FOR BOTH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS NOMINAL. ALL OF OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE CURRENTLY INVESTED IN BANK DEPOSITS AND MONEY MARKET DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WHICH, AT THIS TIME, ARE CURRENTLY YIELDING AN IMMATERIAL INTEREST RATE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS  $2.3  MILLION AND  $0.2  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (EXCLUDING DISCRETE TAX ITEMS) FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  WAS 23.0%.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $0.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT WERE SETTLED DURING FISCAL 2020.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF $2.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO (I) THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF THE IRS AUDIT OF OUR FISCAL 2016 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN, AND (II) DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT WERE SETTLED DURING FISCAL 2019.  OUR FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL 2017 AND 2018 ARE SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF OUR STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO FISCAL 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. TCS'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN FOR THE TAX PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1, 2016 TO FEBRUARY 23, 2016, THE DATE WE ACQUIRED TCS, IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL FUTURE IRS AUDIT. NONE OF TCS'S STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS PRIOR TO CALENDAR YEAR 2015 ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT. FUTURE TAX ASSESSMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  NET INCOME.  DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME WAS  $9.9  MILLION AS COMPARED TO  $11.3  MILLION DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  58  INDEX  ADJUSTED EBITDA.

THE INCREASE IN OUR COMMERCIAL SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, AND THE SLIGHT DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET SALES AND CHANGES IN PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MIX DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THE DECREASE IN OUR GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, BOTH IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED SEGMENT NET SALES, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER NET SALES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  BECAUSE OUR CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, DEPENDS ON THE VOLUME OF SALES, SALES MIX AND RELATED GROSS PROFIT FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SEGMENT AS WELL AS UNALLOCATED SPENDING, IT IS INHERENTLY DIFFICULT TO FORECAST. IN ADDITION, OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020 INCLUDES SEVERAL ITEMS, THE TIMING OF WHICH CAN STILL SHIFT AND IMPACT OUR EXPECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  LOOKING FORWARD, BASED ON THE MIX AND ANTICIPATED TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RELATED TO ORDERS CURRENTLY IN OUR BACKLOG,  THE MIX AND TIMING OF EXPECTED NEW ORDERS AND RELATED SALES, AND OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS, WE ARE TARGETING CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA, IN DOLLARS, TO BE HIGHER IN FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE $93.5 MILLION WE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2019. AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES, ADJUSTED EBITDA IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE  14.0%  IN FISCAL 2020.  59  INDEX  A RECONCILIATION OF OUR FISCAL 2019 GAAP NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $93.5 MILLION  IS SHOWN IN THE TABLE BELOW (NUMBERS IN THE TABLE MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING).

OUR DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA MAY DIFFER FROM THE DEFINITION OF EBITDA OR ADJUSTED EBITDA USED BY OTHER COMPANIES AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO A MEASURE FREQUENTLY REQUESTED BY OUR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS MAY USE ADJUSTED EBITDA, ALONG WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONTAINED IN OUR SEC FILINGS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES. OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES FOR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME, NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE REFLECT THE GAAP MEASURES AS REPORTED, ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN ITEMS AS DESCRIBED. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AS THEY EXCLUDE THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE GRANTING OF EQUITY COMPENSATION AWARDS, AND ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE MEASURES ARE ADJUSTED AS DESCRIBED IN THE RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP IN THE ABOVE TABLES, BUT THESE ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT ALL OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS OR COSTS ARE UNUSUAL, INFREQUENT OR NON-RECURRING. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, FINANCIAL MEASURES DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. INVESTORS ARE ADVISED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR SEC FILINGS. WE HAVE NOT QUANTITATIVELY RECONCILED OUR FISCAL 2020 ADJUSTED EBITDA TARGET TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE BECAUSE ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ADJUSTMENTS TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH ARE SPECIFIC ITEMS THAT IMPACT THESE MEASURES, HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED, ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, OR CANNOT BE PREDICTED. FOR EXAMPLE, QUANTIFICATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REQUIRES INPUTS SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF SHARES GRANTED AND MARKET PRICE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY ASCERTAINABLE. ACCORDINGLY, RECONCILIATIONS TO THE NON-GAAP FORWARD LOOKING METRICS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WITHOUT UNREASONABLE EFFORT AND SUCH UNAVAILABLE RECONCILING ITEMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS INCREASED $0.9 MILLION FROM  $45.6 MILLION  AT  JULY 31, 2019  TO  $46.5 MILLION  AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  . THE INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $31.3 MILLION  AND  $13.0 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . THE PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD INCREASE IN CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES REFLECTS OVERALL CHANGES IN NET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PRINCIPALLY THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS, BILLINGS AND PAYMENTS.  \u2022  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS $13.7 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO $4.2 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WE PAID $11.2 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF CGC TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. THE REMAINING PORTION OF NET CASH USED IN BOTH PERIODS PRIMARILY REPRESENTED EXPENDITURES RELATING TO ONGOING EQUIPMENT UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS.  \u2022  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $16.7 MILLION  AND  $6.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE ENTERED INTO A CREDIT FACILITY AND REPAID IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY OF  $7.0 MILLION  . DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , WE PAID  $5.1 MILLION  AND  $5.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, IN CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. WE ALSO MADE  $5.2 MILLION  AND  $5.0 MILLION  OF PAYMENTS TO REMIT EMPLOYEES' STATUTORY TAX WITHHOLDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE NET SETTLEMENT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS DISCUSSED BELOW AND IN \"  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (11) - CREDIT FACILITY.\"  OUR INVESTMENT POLICY RELATING TO OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS INTENDED TO MINIMIZE PRINCIPAL LOSS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAXIMIZE THE INCOME WE RECEIVE WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING RISK. TO MINIMIZE RISK, WE GENERALLY INVEST OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS (BOTH GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL), CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, BANK DEPOSITS, AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. MANY OF OUR MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS INVEST IN DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BANK SECURITIES GUARANTEED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER AND OTHER SECURITIES ISSUED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS OR MARKET LIQUIDITY, WE BELIEVE OUR INVESTMENT POLICIES ARE APPROPRIATE IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. ULTIMATELY, THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IS DEPENDENT ON A WELL-FUNCTIONING LIQUID MARKET.  61  INDEX  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR MATERIAL SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF: (I) INTEREST PAYMENTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY; (II) PAYMENTS RELATED TO LEASE COMMITMENTS; (III) OUR ONGOING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, INCLUDING INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; AND (IV) PAYMENT OF ACCRUED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS.  AS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  \"NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE (2) - ACQUISITIONS,\"  AND THE SECTION ABOVE TITLED BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 2020, IN JANUARY 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \"MERGER AGREEMENT\") TO ACQUIRE GILAT SATELLITE NETWORKS LTD (\"GILAT\"). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, EACH GILAT ORDINARY SHARE WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION OF (I)  $7.18  IN CASH, WITHOUT INTEREST, PLUS (II)  0.08425  OF A SHARE OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, WITH CASH PAYABLE IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES. BASED ON SUCH CONSIDERATION, ON JANUARY 29, 2020, THE DATE WE ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, GILAT HAD AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $532.5 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO FUND THE GILAT ACQUISITION BY REDEPLOYING A PORTION OF BOTH OUR AND GILAT'S COMBINED UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH THE REMAINING FUNDS PROVIDED BY A NEW  $800.0 MILLION  GILAT ACQUISITION RELATED CREDIT FACILITY (SEE  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 11 - \"CREDIT FACILITY\"  ), THE EXACT TERMS OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE FINALIZED AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. AFTER CLOSING AND INCLUDING ESTIMATED TRANSACTION FEES OF  $28.6 MILLION  , WE EXPECT TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY $45.0 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND.  ALSO, IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE UHP NETWORKS INC., AND ITS SISTER COMPANY (TOGETHER, \"UHP\") FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE PAYABLE AT CLOSING OF APPROXIMATELY  $40.0 MILLION  , OF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE  $5.0 MILLION  TO BE PAID IN COMTECH COMMON STOCK WITH THE REMAINING BALANCE PAYABLE IN CASH. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES AN EARN-OUT UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $10.0 MILLION  PAYABLE, AT OUR ELECTION, IN CASH AND OR SHARES OF COMTECH COMMON STOCK, IF CERTAIN AGREED UPON SALES MILESTONES ARE REACHED IN THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD FOLLOWING CLOSING. WE EXPECT TO USE EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INCREASED BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO COMPLETE THE UHP ACQUISITION.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE FILED A  $400.0 MILLION  SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SEC FOR THE SALE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING DEBT. THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE BY THE SEC AS OF DECEMBER 14, 2018.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  MARCH 4, 2020  , WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $8.7 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PURSUANT TO OUR CURRENT  $100.0 MILLION  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM. OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO TIME RESTRICTIONS AND REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE IN OPEN-MARKET OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AND MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019.  ON  SEPTEMBER 24, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 4, 2019  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH WERE PAID ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2019  AND  FEBRUARY 14, 2020  , RESPECTIVELY. ON  MARCH 4, 2020  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF  $0.10  PER COMMON SHARE, PAYABLE ON  MAY 15, 2020  TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON  APRIL 15, 2020  . FUTURE DIVIDENDS REMAIN SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED, AS WELL AS BOARD APPROVAL.  OUR MATERIAL LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF MANDATORY INTEREST PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND LEASE COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY MET BOTH OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS WITH FUNDS PROVIDED BY A COMBINATION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR ANTICIPATED LEVEL OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING INCOME, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AMOUNTS POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET BOTH OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING CASH REQUIREMENTS.  ALTHOUGH IT IS DIFFICULT IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC AND CREDIT ENVIRONMENT TO PREDICT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF FINANCING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE, SHOULD OUR SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS INCREASE BEYOND OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CREDIT FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND/OR FINANCING FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON  OCTOBER 31, 2018  , WE ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \"CREDIT FACILITY\") WITH A SYNDICATE OF LENDERS, REPLACING OUR PRIOR CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF  FEBRUARY 23, 2016  (AS AMENDED BY THAT CERTAIN FIRST AMENDMENT, DATED AS OF  JUNE 6, 2017  (THE \"PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY\")).  THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES A SENIOR SECURED LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO  $550.0 MILLION  CONSISTING OF: (I) A REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY (\"REVOLVING LOAN FACILITY\") WITH A BORROWING LIMIT OF  $300.0 MILLION  ; (II) AN ACCORDION FEATURE ALLOWING US TO BORROW UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $250.0 MILLION  ; (III) A  $35.0 MILLION  LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT; AND (IV) A SWINGLINE LOAN CREDIT SUBLIMIT OF  $25.0 MILLION.  62  INDEX  THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES ON  OCTOBER 31, 2023  (THE \"REVOLVING MATURITY DATE\"). IF WE ISSUE NEW UNSECURED DEBT IN EXCESS OF  $5.0 MILLION  WITH A MATURITY DATE THAT IS LESS THAN  91  DAYS FROM  OCTOBER 31, 2023  , THE REVOLVING MATURITY DATE WOULD AUTOMATICALLY ACCELERATE SO THAT IT WOULD BE  91  DAYS EARLIER THAN THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NEW UNSECURED DEBT.  THE PROCEEDS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY WERE USED, IN PART, TO REPAY IN FULL THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY, AND ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE EXPECTED TO BE USED BY US FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WAS  $158.0 MILLION  , WHICH IS REFLECTED IN THE NON-CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD  $2.6 MILLION  OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY RELATED TO OUR GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS AND  NO  OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY RANGING FROM  $137.0 MILLION  TO  $169.0 MILLION.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY SHALL BE EITHER: (I) ALTERNATE BASE RATE BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST FROM THE APPLICABLE BORROWING DATE AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO (X) THE GREATEST OF (A) THE PRIME RATE (AS DEFINED) IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS EFFECTIVE RATE (AS DEFINED) IN EFFECT ON SUCH DAY PLUS 1/2 OF 1.00% PER ANNUM AND (C) THE ADJUSTED LIBO RATE (AS DEFINED) ON SUCH DAY (OR, IF SUCH DAY IS NOT A BUSINESS DAY, THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING BUSINESS DAY) PLUS  1.00%  PER ANNUM, PLUS (Y) THE APPLICABLE RATE (AS DEFINED), OR (II) EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR INTEREST FROM THE APPLICABLE BORROWING DATE AT A RATE PER ANNUM EQUAL TO (X) THE ADJUSTED LIBO RATE FOR SUCH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS (Y) THE APPLICABLE RATE. DETERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE RATE IS BASED ON A PRICING GRID THAT IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED) AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER FOR WHICH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MOST RECENTLY DELIVERED.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CUSTOMARY NEGATIVE COVENANTS, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATED EXCEPTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) LIENS, (II) INVESTMENTS, (III) INDEBTEDNESS, (IV) SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE CHANGES, INCLUDING MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, (V) DISPOSITIONS, (VI) RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, INCLUDING STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS, AND (VII) CERTAIN OTHER RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT (SUBJECT TO GRACE PERIODS, AS APPROPRIATE), SUCH AS PAYMENT DEFAULTS, CROSS-DEFAULTS TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, BANKRUPTCY AND INSOLVENCY, THE OCCURRENCE OF A DEFINED CHANGE IN CONTROL AND THE FAILURE TO OBSERVE THE NEGATIVE COVENANTS AND OTHER COVENANTS RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AMENDMENTS TO THE CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY FURTHER SYNDICATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS: (I) NO SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL UNTIL MATURITY; (II) A MAXIMUM SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO OF  3.75  X TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS (\"TTM\") ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\"ADJUSTED EBITDA\") AND A MAXIMUM TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO OF  4.50  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA, EACH WITH NO STEP DOWNS; AND (III) A MINIMUM INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO OF  3.25  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO WAS  1.60  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA COMPARED TO THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO OF  3.75  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA. OUR INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS  14.51  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA COMPARED TO THE MINIMUM INTEREST EXPENSE COVERAGE RATIO OF  3.25  X TTM ADJUSTED EBITDA. GIVEN OUR EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, WE ANTICIPATE MAINTAINING COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES (THE \"GUARANTORS\"). AS COLLATERAL SECURITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE GUARANTEES THEREOF, WE AND THE GUARANTORS HAVE GRANTED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE LENDERS, A LIEN ON, AND FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  ON DECEMBER 6, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE AMENDMENT IS TO PROVIDE FOR A MECHANISM TO REPLACE THE LIBO RATE FOR EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS WITH AN ALTERNATIVE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE, SHOULD THE LIBO RATE GENERALLY BECOME UNAVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE ON AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY BASIS.  CAPITALIZED TERMS USED BUT NOT DEFINED HEREIN HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH FOR SUCH TERMS IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AND THE PRIOR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AND FILED WITH THE SEC.  AS DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ABOVE ENTITLED \"  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \" IN CONNECTION WITH OUR AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE GILAT, WE ENTERED INTO AN $800 MILLION DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, THE TERMS OF WHICH WILL BE FINALIZED ON OR PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. THIS FACILITY IS EXPECTED TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY.  63  INDEX  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K.  COMMITMENTS  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, OTHER THAN AS DISCUSSED BELOW, WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO BINDING AND NON-BINDING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY COVERING ANTICIPATED PURCHASES OF INVENTORY AND EQUIPMENT.

IN FISCAL 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FULL AND FINAL WARRANTY SETTLEMENT WITH AT&T, THE LARGEST CUSTOMER/DISTRIBUTOR OF A SMALL PRODUCT LINE THAT WE REFER TO AS THE TCS 911 CALL HANDLING SOFTWARE SOLUTION. AS DISCUSSED IN  \"NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  -  NOTE (9)  -  ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES  ,  \"  PURSUANT TO THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE ISSUED THIRTY-SIX CREDITS TO AT&T OF $0.2 MILLION WHICH AT&T CAN APPLY ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO PURCHASES OF SOLUTIONS FROM US, BEGINNING OCTOBER 2017 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2020.

BASED ON SUCH CONSIDERATION, ON JANUARY 29, 2020, THE DATE WE ENTERED INTO THE MERGER AGREEMENT, GILAT HAD AN ENTERPRISE VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $532.5 MILLION.

THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF PERSONAL COMPUTING AND OTHER ACCESS DEVICES, IMAGING AND PRINTING PRODUCTS, AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, SOLUTIONS, AND SERVICES. WE SELL TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMBS AND LARGE ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS IN THE GOVERNMENT, HEALTH, AND EDUCATION SECTORS. WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: PERSONAL SYSTEMS, PRINTING AND CORPORATE INVESTMENTS. THE PERSONAL SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DESKTOP AND NOTEBOOK PCS, WORKSTATIONS, THIN CLIENTS, COMMERCIAL MOBILITY DEVICES, RETAIL POS SYSTEMS, DISPLAYS AND OTHER RELATED ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE, SUPPORT, AND SERVICES. THE PRINTING SEGMENT PROVIDES CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PRINTER HARDWARE, SUPPLIES, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS SCANNING DEVICES. CORPORATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE HP LABS AND CERTAIN BUSINESS INCUBATION AND INVESTMENT PROJECTS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH MARKET SEGMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO ENHANCED INNOVATION IN MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEMS, MULTI-ARCHITECTURE, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND OTHER KEY ATTRIBUTES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE INVESTING IN  END POINT SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS  . WE ARE  FOCUSED ON SERVICES INCLUDING DEVICE AS A SERVICE AS THE MARKET BEGINS TO SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED DUE TO OUR COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LINEUP.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS AND GRAPHICS, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR FOOTPRINT IN THE 3D PRINTING & DIGITAL MANUFACTURING MARKETPLACE. IN CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS, WE HAVE A CONTINUED FOCUS ON MANAGED PRINT SERVICES (\u201cMPS\u201d) AND INSTANT INK. IN GRAPHICS, WE OFFER A BROAD SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE SEGMENTS AND APPLICATIONS IN THE GRAPHICS INDUSTRY.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ONE SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO DYNAMIC MARKET TRENDS, SUCH AS FORECASTED DECLINING PC CLIENT MARKETS AND HOME PRINTING MARKETS. A SECOND SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS ARE EXERTING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE IN TARGETED AREAS AND ARE ENTERING NEW MARKETS, OUR EMERGING COMPETITORS ARE INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, AND OUR ALLIANCE PARTNERS IN SOME BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING OUR COMPETITORS IN OTHERS. A THIRD SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO BUSINESS MODEL CHANGES AND OUR GO-TO-MARKET EXECUTION IN AN EVOLVING DISTRIBUTION AND RESELLER LANDSCAPE, WITH INCREASING ONLINE AND OMNICHANNEL PRESENCE.  ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WE FACE AT THE SEGMENT LEVEL ARE SET FORTH BELOW.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS,  WE FACE CHALLENGES WITH INDUSTRY COMPONENT AVAILABILITY AND A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, A COMPETITIVE PRICING ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM NON-ORIGINAL SUPPLIES (WHICH INCLUDES IMITATION, REFILL OR REMANUFACTURED ALTERNATIVES), AND A WEAKENED MARKET IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES WITH ASSOCIATED PRICING SENSITIVITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PRESENT CHALLENGES. WE ALSO FACE CHALLENGES IN PRINTING, PRIMARILY IN EMEA, DUE TO OUR MULTI-TIER DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, INCLUDING LIMITING GREY MARKETING AND THE POTENTIAL MISUSE OF PRICING PROGRAMS. WE ALSO  OBTAIN MANY PRINTING COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE SOURCES DUE TO TECHNOLOGY, AVAILABILITY, PRICE, QUALITY OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE SOURCE THE  MAJORITY OF OUR A4 AND A PORTION OF OUR A3 PORTFOLIO OF  LASER PRINTER ENGINES AND LASER TONER CARTRIDGES FROM CANON. ANY DECISION BY EITHER PARTY TO NOT RENEW OUR AGREEMENT WITH CANON OR TO LIMIT OR REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE FROM LASERJET PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH CANON AND ANTICIPATE RENEWAL OF THIS AGREEMENT.  OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ALSO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES, TARIFF-DRIVEN HEADWINDS,  UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS, VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES, WEAKER MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND EVOLVING DYNAMICS IN THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT.  THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON OUR BUSINESS CANNOT BE KNOWN AT THIS TIME.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE INNOVATION WITH A VIEW TOWARDS DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALIGNED WITH GENERATING MARKET DEMAND AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS  AND ADAPTING OUR BUSINESS MODELS  , WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR END-TO-END PROCESSES, ANALYTICS AND EFFICIENCIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OPTIMIZING OUR SALES COVERAGE MODELS, ALIGNING OUR SALES INCENTIVES WITH OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, IMPROVING CHANNEL EXECUTION AND INVENTORY MANAGEMENT, STRENGTHENING OUR CAPABILITIES IN OUR AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS, STRENGTHENING OUR PRICING DISCIPLINE AND DEVELOPING AND CAPITALIZING ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  SPECIFICALLY, IN OCTOBER 2019, WE ANNOUNCED COST-REDUCTION AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THE WAY WE WORK, MOVE CLOSER TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND FACILITATE SPECIFIC INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS. THESE WERE FURTHER UPDATED IN FEBRUARY 2020. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE TRANSFORMING OUR OPERATING MODEL TO INTEGRATE OUR SALES FORCE INTO A SINGLE COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION AND REDUCING STRUCTURAL COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY THROUGH OUR RESTRUCTURING PLAN APPROVED IN SEPTEMBER 2019 (THE \u201cFISCAL 2020 PLAN\u201d). WE EXPECT TO INVEST SOME OF THE SAVINGS FROM THESE EFFORTS ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTING TO BUILD OUR DIGITAL CAPABILITIES. OVER TIME, WE EXPECT THESE INVESTMENTS WILL MAKE US MORE EFFICIENT AND ALLOW US TO ADVANCE OUR POSITIONS IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS AND PRINTING, WHILE ALSO DISRUPTING NEW INDUSTRIES WHERE WE SEE ATTRACTIVE MEDIUM TO LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THE RATE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE RETURNS THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FROM THESE INVESTMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE EXECUTION, INDUSTRY AND MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING OUR BUSINESS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. AS A RESULT, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN THE ANTICIPATED TIMING OF ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THESE EFFORTS, AND THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF THESE EFFORTS MAY NOT MATERIALIZE.  THE RECENT NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) OUTBREAK HAS IMPACTED AND COULD FURTHER IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS AS A RESULT OF QUARANTINES, FACILITY CLOSURES, AND TRAVEL AND LOGISTICS RESTRICTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OUTBREAK. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS TO BE TEMPORARY, THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AROUND ITS DURATION AND ITS BROADER IMPACT.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC.

XEROX PREVIOUSLY NOMINATED CANDIDATES FOR ELECTION TO HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE \u201cBOARD\u201d) AT HP\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS.  AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE OFFER IN CONSULTATION WITH HP\u2019S INDEPENDENT OUTSIDE FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS, THE BOARD DETERMINED THAT THE OFFER IS NOT IN THE BEST INTEREST OF HP\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS AND RECOMMENDED THAT HP STOCKHOLDERS REJECT THE OFFER AND NOT TENDER THEIR SHARES INTO THE OFFER.  ON MARCH 5, 2020, WE FILED A SOLICITATION/RECOMMENDATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14D-9 WITH THE SEC CONTAINING THE BOARD\u2019S RECOMMENDATION.  IN RESPONSE TO XEROX\u2019S ACTIONS, HP HAS INCURRED, AND EXPECTS TO INCUR IN THE FUTURE, SIGNIFICANT COSTS.  FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRENDS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS IN ITEM 1A OF PART II IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MD&A IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN MD&A IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31,  2019  , EXCEPT AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN \u201cNOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT, A MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR NET REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE SUPPLEMENT THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE WITH THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD REVENUES USING MONTHLY AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD AND DOES NOT ADJUST FOR ANY REPRICING OR DEMAND IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SO THAT NET REVENUE CAN BE VIEWED WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES OUR NET REVENUE RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY MEASURES ARE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A GAAP BASIS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE AND DEFINE SIMILARLY LABELED ITEMS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF THIS MEASURE FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC.

U.S. NET REVENUE DECREASED 1% TO $4.9 BILLION, WHILE NET REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REMAINED FLAT AT $9.7 BILLION. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECLINE IN SUPPLIES AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS AND WORKSTATIONS.

GROSS MARGIN  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR GROSS MARGIN INCREASED BY 1.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATE IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS DRIVEN BY LOWER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.

PROVISION FOR TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  22.8%  AND 10.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACCRUAL OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE GENERALLY DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% DUE TO FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED  $7 MILLION  OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS OF $48 MILLION AND $7 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER NET TAX BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $48 MILLION. FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND PERFORMANCE-ADJUSTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE IMMATERIAL.

THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, DESKTOPS AND WORKSTATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A 3.9% INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 1.4% DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (\u201cASPS\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASE IN DESKTOPS, NOTEBOOKS AND WORKSTATIONS.

PERSONAL SYSTEMS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE INCREASED 2.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ASPS.

THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN SUPPLIES, CONSUMER HARDWARE REVENUE AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. NET REVENUE FOR SUPPLIES DECREASED 6.9% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEMAND WEAKNESS. PRINTER UNIT VOLUME DECREASED 10.4% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY UNIT DECREASES IN BOTH CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL HARDWARE.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NET REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL HARDWARE DECREASED BY 1.3% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 11.5% DECREASE IN PRINTER VOLUME AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ASPS BY 3.8%. THE UNIT VOLUME DECLINE IN COMMERCIAL HARDWARE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WEAKNESS IN DEMAND AND OUR STRATEGY TO REBALANCE OUR PORTFOLIO TO A HIGHER PROFIT CUSTOMER MIX. THE INCREASE IN ASPS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  NET REVENUE FOR CONSUMER HARDWARE DECREASED 13.2% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD DUE TO A DECREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME BY 10.2% AND 3.5% DECREASE IN ASPS. THE UNIT VOLUME DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INKJET HOME CONSUMER BUSINESS AND LASERJET HOME BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN ASPS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  PRINTING EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED BY 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SUPPLIES REVENUE.  CORPORATE INVESTMENTS  THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE INVESTMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INCUBATION PROJECTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT CASH, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, NEW BORROWINGS, AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL PAPER AUTHORIZATION AND CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET HP\u2019S OPERATING CASH REQUIREMENTS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON ALL BORROWINGS, PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASES AND ANNUAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE EVENT THAT SUITABLE BUSINESSES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ACQUISITION THAT OFFER GOOD RETURN OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY MAY OBTAIN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE FINANCING FOR THESE ACQUISITIONS THROUGH ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS. WHILE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND OUR COST OF BORROWING MAY INCREASE UNDER CERTAIN BUSINESS, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESOURCES UNDER ALL SUCH CONDITIONS. OUR LIQUIDITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS INCLUDING THE RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I OF THIS REPORT AS WELL AS IN ITEM 1A OF PART II IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND THE MARKET RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d IN ITEM 3 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  ON FEBRUARY 22, 2020, HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED HP\u2019S SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $15.0 BILLION. HP\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO AUTHORIZED A CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM THAT WILL TARGET THE RETURN OF APPROXIMATELY $16.0 BILLION TO HP SHAREHOLDERS USING SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS DURING FISCAL 2020 TO FISCAL 2022. WE EXPECT THIS CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE REPURCHASE OF AT LEAST $8.0 BILLION OF HP SHARES IN THE TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING HP\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL MEETING.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES ARE HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NON-U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX WILL BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS AND BEGAN IN FISCAL YEAR 2019. WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON A SUBSEQUENT REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THIS CASH MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN INCOME TAX OR WITHHOLDING TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON REPATRIATION. AS WE EVALUATE THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REVISE THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND HOW TO UTILIZE SUCH FUNDS, INCLUDING REDUCING OUR GROSS DEBT LEVEL, OR OTHER USES.

DSO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR RECEIVABLES ARE OUTSTANDING. DSO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE NET REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DSO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE REVENUE LINEARITY.  DOS MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM PROCUREMENT TO SALE OF OUR PRODUCT. DOS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DOS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FOCUS ON INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.  DPO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES ARE OUTSTANDING. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DPO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INVENTORY PURCHASING VOLUME.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $0.2 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OF $0.6 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $0.4 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $1.2 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PAYMENT OF DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER.

WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RATING DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT, PREVIOUS DOWNGRADES HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, HAVE REDUCED MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HAVE REQUIRED THE POSTING OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL UNDER SOME OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, ANY FURTHER DOWNGRADE TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS BY ANY RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER IMPACT US IN A SIMILAR MANNER, AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF ANY SUCH DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION.

OVERVIEW  EATON VANCE CORP. PROVIDES ADVANCED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO FORWARD-THINKING INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS MANAGING INVESTMENT FUNDS AND PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. OUR CORE STRATEGY IS TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES AND TO OFFER LEADING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IN EXECUTING OUR CORE STRATEGY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED BROADLY DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION.  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS AS A COMPANY BASED PRINCIPALLY ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DELIVERED, CLIENT SATISFACTION, REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE, PROGRESS ACHIEVING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND SATISFACTION, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND SHAREHOLDER VALUE CREATED.  WE CONDUCT OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY BUSINESS THROUGH WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT AFFILIATES, WHICH INCLUDE: EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT (EVM), PARAMETRIC PORTFOLIO ASSOCIATES LLC (PARAMETRIC), ATLANTA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC (ATLANTA CAPITAL) AND CALVERT RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT (CALVERT). WE ALSO OFFER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES THROUGH MINORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE HEXAVEST INC. (HEXAVEST).  THROUGH EVM, ATLANTA CAPITAL, CALVERT AND OUR OTHER AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE ACTIVE EQUITY, INCOME, ALTERNATIVE AND BLENDED STRATEGIES ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT STYLES AND ASSET CLASSES, INCLUDING U.S., GLOBAL AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, FLOATING-RATE BANK LOANS, MUNICIPAL BONDS, GLOBAL INCOME, HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT GRADE BONDS, AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE MANAGE A RANGE OF SYSTEMATIC  41  INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING SYSTEMATIC EQUITY, SYSTEMATIC FIXED INCOME, SYSTEMATIC ALTERNATIVES AND MANAGED OPTIONS STRATEGIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE ALSO PROVIDE PORTFOLIO OVERLAY SERVICES AND MANAGE CUSTOM SEPARATE ACCOUNT PORTFOLIOS, INCLUDING CUSTOM CORETM EQUITY, LADDERED FIXED INCOME, MULTI-ASSET AND MULTI-MANAGER PORTFOLIOS. WE ALSO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND DISTRIBUTE, INVESTMENT FUNDS SUB-ADVISED BY UNAFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS, INCLUDING GLOBAL, EMERGING MARKET AND REGIONAL EQUITY AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES.  OUR BREADTH OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES SUPPORTS A WIDE RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND SERVICES OFFERED TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNT INVESTORS.  OUR EQUITY STRATEGIES ENCOMPASS A DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES, RISK PROFILES, INCOME LEVELS AND GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION. OUR INCOME INVESTMENT STRATEGIES COVER A BROAD DURATION, GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RANGE AND ENCOMPASS BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-FREE INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO OFFER ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN AND COMMODITY-BASED INVESTMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE MANAGE AND DISTRIBUTE A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, WE OPERATE IN ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, NAMELY AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER TO FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $518.2 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDS AND INDIVIDUAL SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS PRINCIPALLY THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. WE HAVE BROAD MARKET REACH, WITH DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS INCLUDING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BROKER-DEALERS, INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS, BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE SUPPORT THESE DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS WITH A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 160 SALES PROFESSIONALS COVERING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  WE EMPLOY A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 20 SALES PROFESSIONALS FOCUSED ON SERVING INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS WHO ACCESS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ON A DIRECT BASIS AND THROUGH INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE INVESTMENTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CLIENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKETPLACE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS, SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, ENDOWMENTS, FOUNDATIONS, FAMILY OFFICES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS.  OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE FEES RECEIVED FROM EATON VANCE-, PARAMETRIC- AND CALVERT-BRANDED FUNDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED FROM INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. OUR FEE REVENUES ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE, AND FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THE TOTAL VALUE AND MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A MATTER OF COURSE, INVESTORS IN OUR SPONSORED OPEN-END FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REDEEM THEIR INVESTMENTS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AND THERE ARE NO MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THEM FROM DOING SO. OUR MAJOR EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, DISTRIBUTION-RELATED EXPENSES, SERVICE FEE EXPENSE, FUND-RELATED EXPENSES, FACILITIES EXPENSE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, TEMPORARY EQUITY, INCOME TAXES, INVESTMENTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  42  CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING FOUR PRIMARY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES: (1) CAPITALIZING ON THE NEAR-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PRESENTED BY OUR MARKET-LEADING POSITIONS IN CUSTOMIZED INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS, RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, SPECIALTY WEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, AND THE ARRAY OF HIGH-PERFORMING ACTIVELY MANAGED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES WE OFFER ACROSS ASSET CLASSES AND INVESTMENT STYLES; (2) DEFENDING OUR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN, GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN, SYSTEMATIC EMERGING MARKET EQUITY AND CLOSED-END FUND BUSINESS FRANCHISES; (3) ENHANCING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BY DEVELOPING NEW VALUE-ADDED INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, LOWERING OPERATING COSTS, ADVANCING SUCCESSION PLANNING AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY PURSUING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (4) INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE, LEADERSHIP AND STAFF DEVELOPMENT, AND DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION.  IN JUNE 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A STRATEGIC INITIATIVE INVOLVING OUR PARAMETRIC, EVM AND EATON VANCE DISTRIBUTORS AFFILIATES TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN RULES-BASED, SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, CUSTOMIZED INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS. THE INITIATIVE HAS THREE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS: (1) REBRANDING EVM\u2019S RULES-BASED, SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES AS PARAMETRIC AND ALIGNING INTERNAL REPORTING CONSISTENT WITH THE REVISED BRANDING; (2) INTEGRATING UNDER EATON VANCE DISTRIBUTORS THE SALES TEAMS SERVING PARAMETRIC AND EVM CLIENTS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS IN THE REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISOR AND MULTI-FAMILY OFFICE MARKET; AND (3) COMBINING UNDER PARAMETRIC THE TECHNOLOGY AND OPERATING PLATFORMS SUPPORTING THE INDIVIDUAL SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNT BUSINESSES OF PARAMETRIC AND EVM. THE INTERNAL CHANGE PROCESS SUPPORTING THIS INITIATIVE IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.  WE NOW REPORT EQUITY, FIXED INCOME AND MULTI-ASSET SEPARATE ACCOUNTS MANAGED BY PARAMETRIC FOR WHICH CUSTOMIZATION IS A PRIMARY FEATURE AS PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS. THIS NEW INVESTMENT MANDATE REPORTING CATEGORY INCLUDES THE PARAMETRIC EQUITY AND MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIES THAT PREVIOUSLY COMPOSED OUR FORMER PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION CATEGORY, PRIMARILY CUSTOM CORE AND CENTRALIZED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE LADDERED BOND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS THAT WERE FORMERLY MANAGED BY EVM AND PREVIOUSLY CATEGORIZED AS FIXED INCOME FOR REPORTING PURPOSES. THESE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS COMBINE THE BENEFITS OF BENCHMARK-BASED INVESTING WITH THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PORTFOLIOS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, NET INFLOWS INTO PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS TOTALED $3.5 BILLION, GENERATING ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 9 PERCENT.  THE CALVERT FUNDS ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED FAMILIES OF RESPONSIBLY INVESTED MUTUAL FUNDS, ENCOMPASSING ACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY MANAGED EQUITY, FIXED AND FLOATING-RATE INCOME, AND MULTI-ASSET STRATEGIES MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CALVERT PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OR OTHER RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. SINCE CALVERT BECAME PART OF EATON VANCE IN DECEMBER 2016, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN CALVERT-BRANDED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND FURTHER DISTINGUISHED CALVERT AS A LEADER IN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) RESEARCH AND RESPONSIBLE ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING THE ATLANTA CAPITAL-SUBADVISED CALVERT EQUITY FUND, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN CALVERT STRATEGIES GREW TO A NEW HIGH OF $21.8 BILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2020 FROM $19.8 BILLION AT OCTOBER 31, 2019, REFLECTING NET INFLOWS OF $1.3 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $0.7 BILLION. CALVERT\u2019S $1.3 BILLION OF NET INFLOWS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 EQUATES TO ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 26 PERCENT.  WHILE CALVERT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY, OUR COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTING ALSO ENCOMPASSES OUR OTHER INVESTMENT AFFILIATES. EVM AND ATLANTA CAPITAL ARE INCREASINGLY UTILIZING CALVERT\u2019S PROPRIETARY ESG RESEARCH AS A COMPONENT OF THEIR FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROCESSES, AND PORTFOLIO CUSTOMIZATION TO REFLECT INDIVIDUAL CLIENT\u2019S RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA REMAINS A CENTRAL FEATURE OF PARAMETRIC SEPARATE ACCOUNT OFFERINGS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, PARAMETRIC MANAGED $25.6 BILLION OF CLIENT  43  ASSETS BASED ON CLIENT-SPECIFIED RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. ON AN OVERALL BASIS, EATON VANCE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PARTICIPANTS IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, A POSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO GROWING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RISING DEMAND FOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIES THAT INCORPORATE ESG-INTEGRATED INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND/OR SEEK TO ACHIEVE BOTH FAVORABLE INVESTMENT RETURNS AND POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT.  NET OUTFLOWS OF OUR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN STRATEGIES DECLINED TO $1.4 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 FROM $2.9 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND $2.6 BILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE IMPROVED FLOW RESULTS REFLECT A MORE FAVORABLE MARKET OUTLOOK FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF FLOATING-RATE LOANS, DRIVEN BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S ANNOUNCED PLAN TO PAUSE BENCHMARK SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATE CHANGES AND CONFIDENCE IN THE STRENGTH OF U.S. CREDIT MARKET CONDITIONS.  INVESTOR FLOWS INTO AND OUT OF OUR GLOBAL MACRO ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGIES NETTED TO APPROXIMATELY ZERO IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WHICH COMPARES TO NET OUTFLOWS OF $2.1 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND NET OUTFLOWS OF $500 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE IMPROVED FLOW RESULTS OF THESE STRATEGIES, WHICH HOLD LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS IN CURRENCY AND SHORT-DURATION SOVEREIGN DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF EMERGING AND FRONTIER MARKET COUNTRIES, REFLECT FAVORABLE INVESTOR RETURNS IN 2019 COMPARED TO DISAPPOINTING INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE IN 2018.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, EVM AND RELATED PARTIES FILED AN APPLICATION FOR EXEMPTIVE RELIEF WITH THE SEC, SEEKING PERMISSION TO OFFER EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFS) THAT WOULD EMPLOY A NOVEL METHOD OF SUPPORTING EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF THEIR SHARES. BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF CURRENT HOLDINGS WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED, THE PORTFOLIO TRADING ACTIVITY OF ETFS UTILIZING THE PROPOSED METHOD COULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PROPOSED APPROACHES TO LESS-TRANSPARENT ETFS THAT HAVE RECENTLY RECEIVED SEC EXEMPTIVE RELIEF, WE BELIEVE OUR METHOD SHOULD BE BROADLY APPLICABLE ACROSS FUND ASSET CLASSES AND CAN SUPPORT EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF FUND SHARES IN ALL MARKET CONDITIONS. IN CONJUNCTION WITH FILING THE EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION, WE FORMED A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS, TO MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ETFS UTILIZING THIS NEW METHOD, FOR WHICH THE TIMING AND LIKELIHOOD OF APPROVAL REMAINS UNCERTAIN.  PERFORMANCE  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, 77 CALVERT, EATON VANCE AND PARAMETRIC-BRANDED MUTUAL FUNDS OFFERED IN THE U.S. WERE RATED 4 OR 5 STARS BY MORNINGSTAR  TM  FOR AT LEAST ONE CLASS OF SHARES, INCLUDING 32 FIVE-STAR RATED FUNDS. AS MEASURED BY TOTAL RETURN NET OF EXPENSES, AT JANUARY 31, 2020 30 PERCENT OF OUR U.S. MUTUAL FUND ASSETS RANKED IN THE TOP QUARTILE OF THEIR MORNINGSTAR PEER GROUPS OVER THREE YEARS AND 58 PERCENT RANKED IN THE TOP QUARTILE OVER FIVE AND TEN YEARS. A GOOD SOURCE OF PERFORMANCE-RELATED INFORMATION FOR OUR FUNDS IS THEIR WEBSITES, AVAILABLE AT WWW.CALVERT.COM AND WWW.EATONVANCE.COM. INFORMATION ON THESE WEBSITES IS NOT INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. ON OUR FUNDS\u2019 WEBSITES, INVESTORS CAN ALSO OBTAIN OTHER CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FUNDS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT POLICIES, PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS, EXPENSES AND MORNINGSTAR RATINGS.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  PREVAILING EQUITY AND INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR SENTIMENT AFFECT THE SALES AND REDEMPTIONS OF OUR INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, MANAGED ASSET LEVELS, OPERATING RESULTS AND THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE S&P 500 INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 6.7 PERCENT AND THE MSCI EMERGING MARKET INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF EMERGING MARKET EQUITY PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 2.3 PERCENT. OVER THE SAME PERIODS, THE BARCLAYS U.S. AGGREGATE BOND INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. BOND MARKET PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 1.8 PERCENT.  44  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REACHED A NEW RECORD QUARTER-END HIGH OF $518.2 BILLION ON JANUARY 31, 2020, UP 17 PERCENT FROM $444.7 BILLION OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON JANUARY 31, 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE REFLECTS NET INFLOWS OF $28.6 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $45.0 BILLION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE OUR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT MANDATE, INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND INVESTMENT AFFILIATE. PRIOR-PERIOD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT, AVERAGE ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT AND NET FLOWS BY INVESTMENT MANDATE HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE RECLASSIFICATION OF BENCHMARK-BASED FIXED INCOME SEPARATE ACCOUNTS FROM FIXED INCOME TO PARAMETRIC CUSTOM PORTFOLIOS. PRIOR-PERIOD CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT AFFILIATE HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE SHIFT IN MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S SYSTEMATICALLY MANAGED INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES FROM EVM TO PARAMETRIC IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND THE ADOPTION OF A NEW POLICY TO REPORT THE MANAGED ASSETS OF INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS OVERSEEN BY MULTIPLE EATON VANCE AFFILIATES BASED ON THE STRATEGY\u2019S PRIMARY IDENTITY.

EXCLUDING THOSE ASSETS IDENTIFIED AS ASSETS OF CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES, LIQUID ASSETS REPRESENTED 29 PERCENT AND 32 PERCENT OF TOTAL ASSETS ON JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIQUID ASSET AMOUNTS ARE $280.6 MILLION AND $297.8 MILLION OF HIGHLY LIQUID SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES WITH REMAINING MATURITIES BETWEEN THREE AND 12 MONTHS HELD AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND OCTOBER 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN INVESTMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OUR SEED INVESTMENTS IN CONSOLIDATED FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT TREATED AS LIQUID ASSETS BECAUSE THEY MAY BE LONGER TERM IN NATURE.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, OUR DEBT CONSISTED OF $325 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.625 PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE IN JUNE 2023 AND $300 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.5 PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE IN APRIL 2027.  WE MAINTAIN A $300 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH SEVERAL BANKS THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 11, 2023. THE FACILITY, WHICH WE ENTERED INTO ON DECEMBER 11, 2018, PROVIDES THAT WE MAY BORROW AT LIBOR OR LIBOR-SUCCESSOR BENCHMARK-BASED RATES OF INTEREST THAT VARY DEPENDING ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE, AND REQUIRES US TO PAY AN ANNUAL COMMITMENT FEE ON ANY UNUSED PORTION. WE HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT JANUARY 31, 2020 OR AT ANY POINT DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY DAILY. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR MAIN USES OF CASH WILL BE PAYING DIVIDENDS, ACQUIRING SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK, MAKING SEED INVESTMENTS IN NEW INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PAYING THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING LIQUID ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT AND FORECASTED OPERATING CASH NEEDS. THE RISK EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT IF WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT IN THE FUTURE, RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. OUR ABILITY TO ENTER THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT SPREADS AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS AT SUCH TIME. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO ISSUE NEW DEBT, REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR SELL SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK AS NEEDED, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  RECOVERABILITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS  OUR $1.1 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 CONSISTED OF OUR 49 PERCENT EQUITY INTEREST IN HEXAVEST, OUR DIRECT INVESTMENTS IN COMPANY-SPONSORED FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES, INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE FUNDS WE CONSOLIDATE AND CERTAIN OTHER INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY AT COST. INVESTMENTS IN CONSOLIDATED FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS HELD DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY ARE GENERALLY IN LIQUID DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE. WE TEST OUR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING QUALITATIVE FACTORS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE WERE NO INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ON OUR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST.  62  WE ASSESS OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES, GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS IS WARRANTED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS AND AMORTIZING IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AS EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $17.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $34.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A DECREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES, A DECREASE IN NET INFLOWS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHORT-TERM DEBT SECURITIES AND AN INCREASE IN NET OUTFLOWS FROM INVESTMENT ACTIVITY OF CONSOLIDATED SPONSORED FUNDS AND SEPARATELY MANAGED ACCOUNTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE CASH SETTLEMENTS OF OUR OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $5.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $283.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE PRIMARILY REFLECTS A $262.4 MILLION DECREASE IN NET PURCHASES OF BANK LOANS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS BY CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES, A $27.2 MILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE SALE OF CLO ENTITY NOTE OBLIGATIONS AND A $1.5 MILLION DECREASE IN ADDITIONS TO EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENT, ALL PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $2.9 MILLION DECREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING CASH FLOWS  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $55.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. THE COMPANY USED $80.3 MILLION TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, PAID $8.4 MILLION TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL INTERESTS IN ATLANTA CAPITAL AND PARAMETRIC AND RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $36.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 4.9 MILLION SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. WE ANTICIPATE THAT REPURCHASES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN ONGOING USE OF CASH.  OUR DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER SHARE WERE $0.375 IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND WE PAID AN ADDITIONAL $2.3 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 VERSUS THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO DECLARE AND PAY QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR VOTING AND NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK COMPARABLE TO THE DIVIDEND DECLARED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF CONSOLIDATED CLO ENTITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED $68.5 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM A WAREHOUSE LINE OF CREDIT.  63  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER VARIOUS CONTRACTS RELATING TO DEBT, INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OPERATING LEASES. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, EXCEPT AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  VESTED PROFIT UNITS (NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS) HELD BY EMPLOYEES IN THE ATLANTA CAPITAL LONG\u2010TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN ARE NOT SUBJECT TO MANDATORY REDEMPTION. OUR REPURCHASE OF THESE NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS PREDICATED ON THE EXERCISE OF A SERIES OF PUT OPTIONS HELD BY PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS AND CALL OPTIONS HELD BY US. THE PUT OPTIONS PROVIDE THE PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE US TO REPURCHASE THEIR INTERESTS AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS OVER TIME. THE CALL OPTIONS WE HOLD PROVIDE US WITH THE RIGHT TO REQUIRE THE PROFIT UNIT HOLDERS TO SELL THEIR INTERESTS TO US AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS OVER TIME, AS WELL AS UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN EVENTS SUCH AS DEATH OR PERMANENT DISABILITY. THESE NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE REDEEMABLE AT FAIR VALUE. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF ANY PURCHASES OF VESTED PROFIT UNITS IN THE FUTURE. AT JANUARY 31, 2020, THERE ARE NO AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS OF ATLANTA CAPITAL TO REPURCHASE VESTED PROFIT UNITS. IN FISCAL 2017, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED A PHANTOM INCENTIVE PLAN FOR ATLANTA CAPITAL THAT PROVIDES FOR THE AWARD OF PHANTOM INCENTIVE UNITS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE INDEXED TO THE PER UNIT ENTERPRISE VALUE OF ATLANTA CAPITAL AND SETTLED IN SHARES OF OUR NON\u2010VOTING COMMON STOCK AT VESTING. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INTRODUCING THIS STOCK\u2010BASED COMPENSATION PLAN, WE CEASED GRANTING PROFIT UNITS TO EMPLOYEES OF ATLANTA CAPITAL UNDER THE LONG\u2010TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN.  WE REPORT ALL REDEEMABLE NON\u2010CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN TEMPORARY EQUITY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT  ESTIMATED REDEMPTION VALUE. THE ESTIMATED REDEMPTION VALUE OF OUR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS TOTALED $336.1 MILLION ON JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO $285.9 MILLION ON OCTOBER 31, 2019. REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS AT JANUARY 31, 2020 CONSISTED OF VESTED PROFIT UNITS HELD BY EMPLOYEES OF ATLANTA CAPITAL GRANTED UNDER THE ATLANTA CAPITAL LONG\u2010TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN OF $25.6 MILLION AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED SPONSORED FUNDS HELD BY THIRD\u2010PARTY SHAREHOLDERS OF $310.5 MILLION.  FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE CONSIDER THE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $4.8 MILLION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS, PRIMARILY FROM OPERATIONS IN THE U.K., THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO FUND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS OR TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS UNLESS REPATRIATED. IN CONSIDERATION OF THE TREATMENT OF TAXABLE DISTRIBUTIONS, UNDER THE 2017 TAX ACT, THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS AND LACK OF WITHHOLDING TAX IMPOSED BY CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, ANY FUTURE TAX LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO THESE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS IS IMMATERIAL.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT INVEST IN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET VEHICLES THAT PROVIDE FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT OR ENGAGE IN ANY LEASING ACTIVITIES THAT EXPOSE US TO ANY LIABILITY THAT IS NOT REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  64  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO UPDATES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019.

THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO SEEK TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN  FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME.  ON NOVEMBER 6,  2003, MR. TOKARZ ASSUMED HIS POSITIONS AS CHAIRMAN AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF THE COMPANY. HE AND THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS  (WHO, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2006, PROVIDE THEIR SERVICES TO THE COMPANY THROUGH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT ADVISER, TTG ADVISERS)  ARE SEEKING TO IMPLEMENT OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE (  I.E.  , TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME)  THROUGH MAKING A BROAD RANGE OF PRIVATE INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES.  THE INVESTMENTS CAN  INCLUDE SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED LOANS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SECURITIES, COMMON OR PREFERRED STOCK, EQUITY  INTERESTS, WARRANTS OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INTERESTS, AND OTHER PRIVATE EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE SIX NEW INVESTMENTS AND FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN SIX EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $44.9 MILLION. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, THE COMPANY MADE FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS IN FIVE EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8.3 MILLION.  THE  COMPANY'S PRIOR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION FROM VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS HAD FOCUSED ON INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES OF INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, APPROXIMATELY 3.2% OF THE CURRENT FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS CONSISTED OF LEGACY INVESTMENTS.  WE ARE, HOWEVER, SEEKING TO MANAGE THESE LEGACY INVESTMENTS TO TRY AND REALIZE MAXIMUM RETURNS. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO CAPITALIZE  ON OPPORTUNITIES TO REALIZE CASH RETURNS ON THESE INVESTMENTS WHEN PRESENTED WI  TH A POTENTIAL \"LIQUIDITY EVENT,\"  I.E., A SALE, PUBLIC OFFERING, MERGER OR OTHER REORGANIZATION.  OUR NEW PORTFOLIO  INVESTMENTS ARE MADE PURSUANT TO OUR CURRENT OBJECTIVE AND STRATEGY. WE ARE CONCENTRATING OUR INVESTMENT EFFORTS ON SMALL AND MIDDLE-MARKET  COMPANIES THAT, IN OUR VIEW, PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL RETURN FROM CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND/OR INCOME THOUGH OUR  CURRENT FOCUS IS MORE ON YIELD GENERATING INVESTMENTS WHICH CAN INCLUDE, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED LOANS, CONVERTIBLE  DEBT, COMMON AND PREFERRED EQUITY WITH A COUPON OR LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE AND WARRANTS OR RIGHTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INTERESTS (THE  \u201cYIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY\u201d). WE HAVE CONTINUED THE TRANSITION TO THE YIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY. WE HAVE DONE THIS THROUGH  SELLING A NUMBER OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR 2017 SALE OF U.S. GAS, OUR THEN-LARGEST PORTFOLIO COMPANY. THESE SALES AND  REPAYMENTS HAVE IMPROVED OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH PROVIDES US WITH FLEXIBILITY TO REDEPLOY CAPITAL INTO DEBT OR SIMILAR INCOME-PRODUCING  INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SEEK TO MONETIZE VARIOUS EQUITY INVESTMENTS TO FURTHER SUPPORT THE YIELD-FOCUSED STRATEGY.  WE PARTICIPATE IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY BUSINESS GENERALLY BY PROVIDING NEGOTIATED LONG-TERM EQUITY AND/OR DEBT INVESTMENT CAPITAL  TO PRIVATELY-OWNED SMALL AND MIDDLE-MARKET COMPANIES. OUR FINANCINGS ARE GENERALLY USED TO FUND GROWTH, BUYOUTS, ACQUISITIONS,  RECAPITALIZATIONS, NOTE PURCHASES AND/OR BRIDGE FINANCINGS. WE GENERALLY INVEST IN PRIVATE COMPANIES, THOUGH, FROM TIME TO TIME,  WE MAY INVEST IN PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT MAY LACK ADEQUATE ACCESS TO PUBLIC CAPITAL.  44  WE  MAY ALSO SEEK TO ACHIEVE OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE BY ESTABLISHING A SUBSIDIARY OR SUBSIDIARIES THAT WOULD SERVE AS GENERAL PARTNER  TO A PRIVATE EQUITY OR OTHER INVESTMENT FUND(S). IN FACT, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, WE ESTABLISHED MVC PARTNERS FOR THIS PURPOSE.  FURTHERMORE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A PE FUND, FOR WHICH AN INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF  THE COMPANY SERVES AS THE GP AND WHICH MAY RAISE UP TO $250 MILLION. ON OCTOBER 29, 2010, THROUGH MVC PARTNERS AND MVCFS, THE COMPANY  COMMITTED TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY $20.1 MILLION IN THE PE FUND. THE PE FUND CLOSED ON APPROXIMATELY $104 MILLION OF CAPITAL COMMITMENTS.  THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF, AND INVESTMENT IN, THE PE FUND FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING  THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MAKE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS THROUGH THE PE FUND. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY IS RESTRICTED  IN ITS ABILITY TO MAKE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS. FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE PE FUND, THE GP AND MVC PARTNERS ARE TOGETHER  ENTITLED TO RECEIVE 25% OF ALL MANAGEMENT FEES AND OTHER FEES PAID BY THE PE FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES AND UP TO 30% OF  THE CARRIED INTEREST GENERATED BY THE PE FUND. FURTHER, AT THE DIRECTION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE GP RETAINED TTG ADVISERS  TO SERVE AS THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER OF THE PE FUND. IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES, AND PURSUANT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS'  AUTHORIZATION AND DIRECTION, TTG ADVISERS IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE BALANCE OF THE FEES AND ANY CARRIED INTEREST GENERATED BY  THE PE FUND AND ITS PORTFOLIO COMPANIES. GIVEN THIS SEPARATE ARRANGEMENT WITH THE GP AND THE PE FUND, UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S  ADVISORY AGREEMENT WITH TTG ADVISERS, TTG ADVISERS IS NOT ENTITLED TO RECEIVE FROM THE COMPANY A MANAGEMENT FEE OR AN INCENTIVE  FEE ON ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT ARE INVESTED IN THE PE FUND. DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2012 AND THEREAFTER, MVC  PARTNERS WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY AS MVC PARTNERS\u2019 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE PE FUND  IS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF MVC PARTNERS OPERATIONS. PREVIOUSLY, MVC PARTNERS WAS PRESENTED AS A PORTFOLIO COMPANY ON THE SCHEDULE  OF INVESTMENTS. THE CONSOLIDATION OF MVC PARTNERS HAS NOT HAD ANY MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR NET RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OF THE COMPANY. ALSO, DURING FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2014, MVC TURF, INC. (\u201cMVC TURF\u201d) WAS CONSOLIDATED WITH  THE COMPANY AS MVC TURF WAS AN MVC WHOLLY-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY. THE CONSOLIDATION OF MVC TURF DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON  THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR NET RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. ON MARCH 7, 2017, THE COMPANY EXCHANGED ITS SHARES OF MVC TURF  FOR APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL SUBORDINATED DEBT IN TURF PRODUCTS.  MVC TURF IS NO LONGER CONSOLIDATED  WITH THE COMPANY. PLEASE SEE NOTE 2 OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u201cCONSOLIDATION\u201d FOR MORE INFORMATION.  AS A RESULT OF THE  CLOSING OF THE PE FUND, CONSISTENT WITH THE BOARD-APPROVED POLICY CONCERNING THE ALLOCATION OF INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES, THE PE  FUND RECEIVED A PRIORITY ALLOCATION OF ALL PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NON-DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENTS FOR THE  COMPANY DURING THE PE FUND'S INVESTMENT PERIOD THAT ENDED ON OCTOBER 28, 2014. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY BE CALLED FOR FOLLOW-ON INVESTMENTS  IN EXISTING PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OF THE PE FUND OR TO PAY OPERATING EXPENSES OF THE PE FUND UNTIL THE PARTNERSHIP IS NO LONGER EXTENDED.  ADDITIONALLY, IN PURSUIT  OF OUR OBJECTIVE, WE MAY ACQUIRE A PORTFOLIO OF EXISTING PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT INVESTMENTS HELD BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER  INVESTMENT FUNDS SHOULD SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARISE.  FURTHERMORE, PENDING  INVESTMENTS IN PORTFOLIO COMPANIES PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY, THE COMPANY MAY INVEST IN CERTAIN  SECURITIES ON A SHORT-TERM OR TEMPORARY BASIS.

AS A RESULT OF OVERWHELMING DEMAND IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA, IN JANUARY 2019 ASPEN UNIVERSITY BEGAN OFFERING BOTH DAY (JULY, NOVEMBER, MARCH SEMESTERS) AND EVENING/WEEKEND (JANUARY, MAY, SEPTEMBER SEMESTERS) PROGRAMS, EQUALING SIX SEMESTER STARTS PER YEAR. MOREOVER, IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AGI ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO OPEN A SECOND CAMPUS IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HONORHEALTH. THE INITIAL SEMESTER AT HONORHEALTH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S INNOVATIVE HYBRID (ONLINE/ON-CAMPUS) PROGRAM ALLOWS MOST OF THE CREDITS TO BE COMPLETED ONLINE (83 OF 120 CREDITS OR 69%), WITH PRICING OFFERED AT CURRENT LOW TUITION RATES OF $150/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES AND $325/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE CORE NURSING COURSES.

ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM IS OFFERED AS A FULL-TIME, THREE-YEAR (NINE SEMESTER) PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY HOLD A STATE NURSING LICENSE AND HAVE NO PRIOR NURSING EXPERIENCE. ASPEN IS ADMITTING STUDENTS INTO ONE OF TWO PROGRAM COMPONENTS: (1) A PRE-PROFESSIONAL NURSING COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT HAVE LESS THAN THE REQUIRED 41 GENERAL EDUCATION CREDITS COMPLETED (YEAR 1), AND (2) THE NURSING CORE COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPETITIVE EVALUATION PROCESS FOR ENTRY (YEARS 2-3).  PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM - FUTURE CAMPUS EXPANSION PLANS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY ANNOUNCED IN FEBRUARY 2020 THE SIGNING OF DEFINITIVE LEASE AGREEMENTS FOR TWO NEW ASPEN UNIVERSITY PRE-LICENSURE BSN CAMPUS LOCATIONS IN TAMPA, FLORIDA AND AUSTIN, TEXAS.  TAMPA, FLORIDA CAMPUS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY HAS EXECUTED A DEFINITIVE LEASE AGREEMENT FOR TEN YEARS TO OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 30,000 SQUARE FEET (SUITES 150 AND 450) OF THE TAMPA OAKS I PROPERTY LOCATED AT 12802 TAMPA OAKS BOULEVARD. THE BUILDING IS VISIBLE FROM THE INTERSECTION OF INTERSTATE 75 AND EAST FLETCHER AVENUE, NEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA, PROVIDING VISIBILITY TO APPROXIMATELY 126,500 CARS PER DAY. ASPEN IS TARGETING TO BEGIN ITS FIRST SEMESTER AT TAMPA OAKS I IN AUGUST 2020 IN CAMPUS SPACE FORMERLY OCCUPIED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF PHOENIX.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY HAS EXECUTED AN AGREEMENT WITH BAYFRONT HEALTH, A REGIONAL NETWORK OF SEVEN HOSPITALS AND OVER 1,900 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF SERVING THE RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA\u2019S GULF COAST TO PROVIDE REQUIRED CLINICAL PLACEMENTS FOR ASPEN\u2019S NURSING STUDENTS. IN ADDITION, CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED IN THE TAMPA METRO WITH JOHN HOPKINS ALL CHILDREN\u2019S HOSPITAL, INC., CARE CONNECTIONS AT HOME, GLOBAL NURSE NETWORK, LLC AND THE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS.  PRIOR TO COMMENCING ITS CAMPUS OPERATIONS, ASPEN IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL BY THE FLORIDA BOARD OF NURSING AND THE FLORIDA COMMISSION ON INDEPENDENT EDUCATION. INITIAL REQUIRED REGULATORY FILINGS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED.  AUSTIN, TEXAS CAMPUS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY HAS EXECUTED A DEFINITIVE LEASE AGREEMENT FOR EIGHT YEARS TO OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 22,000 SQUARE FEET IN A PORTION OF THE FIRST FLOOR OF THE FRONTERA CROSSING OFFICE BUILDING LOCATED AT 101 W. LOUIS HENNA BOULEVARD IN THE AUSTIN SUBURB OF ROUND ROCK. THE BUILDING IS SITUATED AT THE JUNCTION OF INTERSTATE 35 AND STATE HIGHWAY 45, ONE OF THE MOST HEAVILY TRAFFICKED FREEWAY EXCHANGES IN THE METRO WITH VISIBILITY TO APPROXIMATELY 143,362 CARS PER DAY. ASPEN IS TARGETING TO BEGIN ITS FIRST SEMESTER AT FRONTERA CROSSING IN NOVEMBER 2020 IN CAMPUS SPACE FORMERLY OCCUPIED BY THE ART INSTITUTE.  ASPEN HAS EXECUTED A CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT WITH BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH \u2013 CENTRAL DIVISION, THE LARGEST NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN TEXAS AND ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES. BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE INCLUDES 48 HOSPITALS, MORE THAN 800 PATIENT CARE SITES, MORE THAN 7,800 ACTIVE PHYSICIANS, OVER 47,000 EMPLOYEES AND THE SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH PLAN.  ASPEN IS WORKING WITH THE TEXAS BOARD OF NURSING, THE TEXAS HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING BOARD, AND THE TEXAS WORKFORCE COMMISSION TO COMPLETE THEIR RESPECTIVE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESSES AND IS REQUIRED TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM ALL AGENCIES PRIOR TO COMMENCING ITS CAMPUS OPERATIONS.  THESE NEW CAMPUSES WILL FOLLOW ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S EXISTING PRE-LICENSURE BSN MODEL BEING EXECUTED IN THE PHOENIX, ARIZONA METRO CAMPUSES. THIS MODEL OPERATES A STAND-ALONE CAMPUS RUNNING SIX SEMESTER STARTS PER ANNUM (THREE WEEKDAY  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEMESTERS, THREE WEEKNIGHT/WEEKEND SEMESTERS), IMPLEMENTED AS AN ACCELERATED THREE-YEAR PROGRAM AT A TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE LESS THAN $50,000.  AGI\u2019S PLAN FOR UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY (USU) TO IMPLEMENT MSN-FNP WEEKEND IMMERSIONS IN EVERY CAMPUS METRO.  AGI PLANS TO BUILD-OUT ON AVERAGE 10 EXAM ROOMS THAT WILL OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 3,000 SQUARE FEET IN EACH OF ITS BSN PRE-LICENSURE METROPOLITAN AREAS FOR UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY TO IMPLEMENT WEEKEND IMMERSIONS FOR ITS MSN-FAMILY NURSE PRACTITIONER (FNP) PROGRAM. AS A RESULT, FOLLOWING REGULATORY APPROVALS, BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020, WEEKEND IMMERSIONS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN FOUR METRO AREAS FOR USU MSN-FNP STUDENTS TO SELECT FROM; SAN DIEGO, PHOENIX, AUSTIN AND TAMPA.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN  SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IN THE SPRING OF 2014, THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, HAS GROWN FROM A NET NUMBER OF $649,890 AT APRIL 30, 2014 TO A NET NUMBER OF $20,195,419 AT JANUARY 31, 2020. THIS GROWTH COULD BE PORTRAYED AS THE ENGINE OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE ATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR A DEGREE OVER A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME HAS FUELED THE GROWTH OF THIS PLAN AND, AS A RESULT, THE INCREASE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE.  EACH STUDENT\u2019S RECEIVABLE ACCOUNT IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW MANY CLASSES A STUDENT TAKES EACH PERIOD. IF A STUDENT TAKES TWO CLASSES EACH EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD WHILE PAYING $250, $325 OR $375 A MONTH AS AN EXAMPLE, THAT STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE BALANCE WILL RISE ACCORDINGLY. THE CONVERSE IS TRUE ALSO. A STUDENT WHO TAKES COURSES AT A SLOWER PACE, EVEN TAKING TIME OFF BETWEEN EIGHT-WEEK TERMS, COULD HAVE A BALANCE DUE TO THEM. IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY HOWEVER THAT A STUDENT PARTICIPATING IN THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN WILL HAVE AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, AS THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM OF STUDY PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE FIXED MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN.  THE COMMON THREAD IS THE ACTUAL MONTHLY PAYMENT, WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT WITH NO INTEREST THAT EACH STUDENT COMMITS TO PAY OVER A FIXED NUMBER OF MONTHS. IF A STUDENT STOPS PAYING, THAT PERSON CAN NO LONGER REGISTER FOR A CLASS. IF A STUDENT DECIDES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE UNIVERSITY, THEIR ACCOUNT WILL BE SETTLED, EITHER THROUGH COLLECTION OF THEIR BALANCE OR DISBURSEMENT OF THE AMOUNT OWED THEM. ASPEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW BY 13% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FROM 5,259 TO 5,966, REPRESENTING 64% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  USU STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW FROM 1,101 TO 1,159 STUDENTS SEQUENTIALLY REPRESENTING 66% OF USU\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE  THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE FOR ANY PERIOD IS THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING THREE FACTORS.  1.  CASH RECEIPTS  2.  REVENUE  3.  THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED REVENUE  ALL THREE FACTORS EQUALLY DETERMINE THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF ONE QUARTER EXPERIENCES PARTICULARLY HIGH CASH RECEIPTS, THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL GO DOWN. THE SAME EFFECT IF CASH RECEIPTS ARE LOWER OR IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER OF THE OTHER FACTORS.  SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE CHANGE IN REVENUE DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO AN EQUALLY SIMILAR CHANGE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN CASH AND THE DEFERRAL MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. FOR NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE CHANGES IN THE RESERVE MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. ANY ADDITIONAL RESERVE OR WRITE-OFFS WILL INFLUENCE THE BALANCE.  AS IT IS A STRAIGHT MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR BOTH GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS PUBLIC, ONE CAN REASONABLY CALCULATE THE TWO NON-PUBLIC PIECES OF INFORMATION, NAMELY THE CASH RECEIPTS IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND THE WRITE-OFFS IN NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  FOR REVENUE, THE QUARTERLY CHANGE IS PRIMARILY BILLINGS AND THE NET IMPACT OF DEFERRED REVENUE. THE DEFERRAL FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER OR YEAR IS ADDED TO THE BILLINGS AND THE DEFERRAL AT THE END OF THE PERIOD IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE AMOUNT BILLED. THE TOTAL DEFERRED REVENUE AT THE END OF EVERY PERIOD IS REFLECTED IN THE LIABILITY SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET. DEFERRED REVENUE CAN VARY FOR MANY REASONS, BUT SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING OF THE CLASS STARTS IN RELATION TO THE END OF THE QUARTER WILL CAUSE CHANGES IN THE BALANCE.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS MENTIONED IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECTION, THE CHANGE IN REVENUE CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. REVENUE DOES NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF CASH RECEIVED WHEREAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DOES. DEPENDING ON THE MONTH AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED, IT IS LIKELY THAT REVENUE OR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL INCREASE AT A RATE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER. THE IMPACT OF CASH IS EASY TO SUBSTANTIATE AS IT AGREES TO DEPOSITS IN OUR BANK ACCOUNTS.  AGI RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES.  AT JANUARY 31, 2020, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS $1,759,824 WHICH REPRESENTS 8% OF THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE OF $21,955,243, THE SUM OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.  THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WHEN A STUDENT SIGNS UP FOR THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN, THERE IS A CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY CAN EXPECT TO EARN OVER THE LIFE OF THE STUDENT\u2019S PROGRAM. THIS CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT CANNOT BE RECORDED AS AN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE AS THE STUDENT DOES HAVE THE OPTION TO STOP ATTENDING. AS A STUDENT TAKES A CLASS, REVENUE IS EARNED OVER THAT EIGHT-WEEK CLASS. SOME STUDENTS ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRAM, TAKING TWO CLASSES EVERY EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD, AND AS WE DISCUSSED, THAT INCREASES THE STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. IF ANY PORTION OF THAT BALANCE WILL BE PAID IN A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS, THAT PORTION IS REFLECTED AS LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MONTHLY PAYMENT PLANS, OUR LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE HAS GROWN FROM $3,085,243 AT APRIL 30, 2019 TO $6,067,234 AT JANUARY 31, 2020. THE PRIMARY COMPONENT CONSIST OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER 36 AND 39 MONTHS. THE AVERAGE STUDENT COMPLETES THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAM IN 24 MONTHS, THEREFORE MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE SHORT-TERM.  INCLUDED BELOW IS A GRAPHIC OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL VALUE.  A  B  C  CLASSES TAKEN  LESS MONTHLY  PAYMENTS RECEIVED  PAYMENTS FOR CLASSES  TAKEN THAT ARE GREATER  THAN 12 MONTHS  EXPECTED CLASSES  TO BE TAKEN OVER  BALANCE OF PROGRAM.  SHORT-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  LONG-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  NOT RECORDED IN  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE SUM OF A, B AND C WILL EQUAL THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 (FISCAL 2020 Q3) COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 (FISCAL 2019 Q3)  REVENUES  REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 INCREASED TO $12,537,940 FROM $8,494,627 FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q3, AN INCREASE OF $4,043,313 OR 48%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LIFETIME VALUE (LTV). BY FOCUSING OUR MARKETING SPEND ON DELIVERING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LTV, WE INCREASED OUR AVERAGE REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (OR ARPU) BY 34%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS REVENUE GROWTH TO CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE PRIORITIZING OUR HIGHEST LTV DEGREE PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH PLANS.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 INCREASED 35% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY'S TRADITIONAL POST-LICENSURE ONLINE NURSING + OTHER BUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTED 59% OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUE IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q3, WHILE ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY 14.2% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q3. FINALLY, USU CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 27.3% OF THE TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3.  THE COMPANY NOW EXPECTS ANNUAL REVENUE GROWTH TO MEET OR EXCEED 42% FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 2020.  COST OF REVENUES (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION SHOWN SEPARATELY BELOW)  THE COMPANY\u2019S COST OF REVENUES CONSISTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES AND MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES FOR FISCAL 2020 Q3 INCREASED TO $2,623,252 OR 21% OF REVENUES FROM $1,753,982 OR 21% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q3, AN INCREASE OF $869,270 OR 50%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CLASS STARTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND ADDITIONAL FULL-TIME FACULTY STAFFING IN THE USU MSN-FNP PROGRAM AND THE PRE-LICENSURE BSN CAMPUSES IN PHOENIX.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES REPRESENTED 19% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3, WHILE USU INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES EQUALED 25% OF USU REVENUES DURING THE FISCAL 2020 Q3.  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 WERE $2,539,755 OR 20% OF REVENUES COMPARED TO $2,322,998 OR 27% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q3, AN INCREASE OF $216,757 OR 9%.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2020 Q3 INCLUDES $0.8 MILLION OF ONE-TIME EXPENSE ITEMS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2020 EQUITY FINANCING AND THE CFO TRANSITION. EXCLUDING THESE ONE-TIME EXPENSE ITEMS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WOULD HAVE INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY $1,598,545, MEANING THAT G&A WOULD HAVE GROWN AT 26% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE AMOUNT REPRESENTED 43% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3, WHILE USU GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS EQUALED 56% OF USU REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3.  AGI\u2019S GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 AND FISCAL 2019 Q3 ARE INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE AMOUNTS EQUALED $2.8 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDE CORPORATE EMPLOYEES IN THE NY CORPORATE OFFICE, IT, RENT, NON-CASH AGI STOCK BASED COMPENSATION, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES (LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, AND IR), AS WELL AS ONE-TIME EXPENSE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2020 EQUITY FINANCING AND THE CFO TRANSITION.

THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE IS MAINLY DUE TO A 60% DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AT USU FROM THE AGI ACQUISITION BACK IN LATE 2017.  OPERATING INCOME AND LOSS  THE COMPANY REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $(1,728,048) DURING THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 AS COMPARED TO $(2,421,686) FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q3, A DECREASE IN THE LOSS OF $693,638, OR 29% IMPROVEMENT.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION OF OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3. NOTE THAT ASPEN\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM ACCOUNTED FOR $0.5 MILLION OF THE $1.3 MILLION OPERATING INCOME GENERATED AT ASPEN UNIVERSITY, REMAINING THE HIGHEST MARGIN UNIT OF THE COMPANY AT 30%. USU GENERATED $44,755 OF OPERATING INCOME DURING THE FISCAL 2020 Q3, WHICH WAS THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF GENERATING OPERATING INCOME, WHILE AGI CORPORATE INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $(3.1) MILLION OF OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3.

THE OTHER EXPENSE IN 2020 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE AND THE WRITE-OFF OF DEBT DISCOUNT IN CONNECTION WITH A DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT RELATED TO ISSUED CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON JANUARY 22, 2020. THE WRITE-OFF WAS APPROXIMATELY $200,000 AND INCLUDED IN ONE-TIME EXPENSE ITEMS.  INCOME TAXES  INCOME TAXES EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 WAS $15,163 COMPARED TO $0 IN THE FISCAL 2019 Q3. ASPEN GROUP EXPERIENCED OPERATING LOSSES IN BOTH PERIODS. AS MANAGEMENT MADE A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS STEMMING FROM THESE LOSSES, THERE WAS NO TAX BENEFIT RECORDED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS IN EITHER QUARTER.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS APPLICABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS WAS $(2,281,052), OR NET LOSS PER BASIC SHARE OF $(0.12) FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q3 AS COMPARED TO $(2,355,940) FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q3, A DECREASE IN THE LOSS OF $74,888, OR 3% IMPROVEMENT.

THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TERM EXPECTATIONS THAT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WILL GROW AT APPROXIMATELY HALF THE RATE OF REVENUES. THERE IS A PORTION OF THESE COSTS THAT ARE VARIABLE WHICH INCREASED AS OUR REVENUES INCREASED; BUT THERE ALSO IS A FIXED COST COMPONENT THAT TENDS TO GROW AT A SLOWER RATE.  NOTE THAT AGI RECORDED $0.8 MILLION OF ONE-TIME G&A EXPENSE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE JANUARY 2020 EQUITY FINANCING AND THE CFO TRANSITION. EXCLUDING THOSE ONE-TIME ITEMS, G&A WOULD HAVE INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY ONLY $4,508,948, MEANING THAT G&A WOULD HAVE GROWN AT 25% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS MAINLY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AT USU FROM THE AGI ACQUISITION BACK IN LATE 2017. MOREOVER, AGI HAS MADE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE PHOENIX CAMPUSES AND WILL INVEST IN OTHER CAMPUS LOCATIONS THAT WILL CAUSE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  OPERATING INCOME AND LOSS  THE COMPANY REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $(3,696,873) DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO $(7,749,137) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, A DECREASE IN THE LOSS OF $4,052,264, OR 52% IMPROVEMENT.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $4.1 MILLION OF OPERATING INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.

DEFINITION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS INCLUDES BOTH FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, OR GAAP, AS WELL AS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. GENERALLY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS THAT EITHER EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY INCLUDED OR EXCLUDED IN THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE VIEWED AS SUPPLEMENTAL TO, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME, OPERATING INCOME, AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, LIQUIDITY OR ANY OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES. THEY MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF THE HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS OF ASPEN GROUP NOR ARE THEY INTENDED TO BE PREDICTIVE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE RESULTS. INVESTORS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  OUR MANAGEMENT USES AND RELIES ON EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH MANAGEMENT AND SHAREHOLDERS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN PLANNING, FORECASTING AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. OUR MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISON. OUR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE DESCRIBED EXCLUDED ITEMS.  ASPEN GROUP DEFINES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS EARNINGS (OR LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE THE ITEMS IN THE TABLE BELOW. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE WERE $1,010,124 OF NON-RECURRING CHARGES FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO $83,174 IN THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, AND $1,143,072 OF NON-RECURRING CHARGES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO $390,711 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019. THESE NON-RECURRING CHARGES, INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK BASED COMPENSATION THAT WERE ONE-TIME CHARGES AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CASH BASED COMPENSATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FROM WRITING OFF DEBT THAT WERE ONE-TIME CHARGES. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS MANAGEMENT, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO EVALUATE AND ASSESS OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AFTER REMOVING THE IMPACT OF ITEMS OF A NON-OPERATIONAL NATURE THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY.  WE HAVE INCLUDED A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, TOGETHER WITH THE RECONCILIATION TO GAAP, HELPS INVESTORS MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND OTHER COMPANIES. IN MAKING ANY COMPARISONS TO OTHER COMPANIES, INVESTORS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT COMPANIES USE DIFFERENT NON-GAAP MEASURES TO EVALUATE THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. INVESTORS SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SPECIFIC DEFINITION BEING USED AND TO THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN SUCH MEASURE AND THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE PROVIDED BY EACH COMPANY UNDER APPLICABLE SEC RULES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ALLOCABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS IS AS FOLLOWS.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31,  2020  2019  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(3,825,265)  $(7,430,550)  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (1,940,879)  (1,962,899)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  16,767,411  (1,019,689)  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH  $11,001,267  $(10,413,138)  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 TOTALED $(3,825,265) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(4,994,502) AND A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $(3,375,031), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $4,544,268 IN NON-CASH ITEMS.  THE NET LOSS INCLUDED $1,424,607 FOR INTEREST EXPENSE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS) OF APPROXIMATELY $7.1 MILLION WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN AND AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE RELATED TO THE TIMING OF CLASS STARTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS A FAVORABLE TREND IN WORKING CAPITAL OVER TIME, BUT THERE MAY BE VOLATILITY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.  SO, IN AGGREGATE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A GENERAL TREND TOWARD LOWER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IN FUTURE QUARTERS; HOWEVER, SOME QUARTERS COULD HAVE HIGHER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF MORE CASH USED TO SUPPORT CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. PROGRAM START TIMINGS AND THE RELATED FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID DRAWDOWNS ALSO IMPACT CASH TIMING.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 TOTALED $(7,430,550) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(7,668,295), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2,956,601 IN NON-CASH ITEMS AND $2,718,856 DECREASE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEM CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $4,209,576 WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $1,577,464 AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $866,129.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 TOTALED $(1,940,879) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE, INSTRUCTIONAL AND COMPUTER EQUIPMENT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 TOTALED $(1,962,899) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AS WE BUILD UP OUR CAMPUS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 TOTALED $16,767,411 WHICH REFLECTS $16,044,879 OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK, NET OF UNDER WRITER COSTS AND $768,381 OF PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $(51,282) OF DISBURSEMENTS FOR EQUITY OFFERING COSTS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 TOTALED $(1,019,689), WHICH REFLECTS THE REPAYMENT OF A PORTION OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS NET OF PAYMENT OF OFFERING COSTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JANUARY 23, 2020, THE COMPANY ISSUED $5 MILLION CONVERTIBLE NOTES TO EACH OF TWO LENDERS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE TWO $5 MILLION NOTES DUE UNDER TERM LOANS ENTERED INTO IN 2019. THE CLOSING OF THE REFINANCING WAS CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPANY CONDUCTING AN EQUITY FINANCING RESULTING IN GROSS PROCEEDS TO THE COMPANY OF AT LEAST $10 MILLION. ON JANUARY 22, 2020, THE COMPANY CLOSED ON AN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERING UNDER WHICH THE NET PROCEEDS WERE APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND THE CONDITION PRECEDENT TO THE CLOSING OF THE REFINANCING WAS SATISFIED.  THE COMPANY HAD CASH DEPOSITS OF APPROXIMATELY $19.1 MILLION ON MARCH 6, 2020, EXCLUDING $456,211 OF RESTRICTED CASH. FOLLOWING QUARTER END, THE COMPANY MADE PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO OUR CAMPUS EXPANSION STRATEGY. IN ADDITION TO ITS CASH, THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ACCESS TO THE $5 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH IS UNUSED. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS CASH RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FEATURE.  OUR CASH BALANCES ARE KEPT LIQUID TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH IS CONCENTRATED IN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASE FR-60, CAUTIONARY ADVICE REGARDING DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, FROM THE SEC, WE HAVE SELECTED OUR MORE SUBJECTIVE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATION PROCESSES FOR PURPOSES OF EXPLAINING THE METHODOLOGY USED IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATE, IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES PERTAINING TO THE ESTIMATE AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF TUITION AND FEES DERIVED FROM COURSES TAUGHT BY ASPEN ONLINE AS WELL AS FROM RELATED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT ASPEN PROVIDES TO ITS STUDENTS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE MATERIALS AND LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. TUITION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED PRO-RATA OVER THE APPLICABLE PERIOD OF INSTRUCTION. ASPEN MAINTAINS AN INSTITUTIONAL TUITION REFUND POLICY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TUITION TO BE REFUNDED IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS DURING STATED REFUND PERIODS. CERTAIN STATES IN WHICH STUDENTS RESIDE IMPOSE SEPARATE, MANDATORY REFUND POLICIES, WHICH OVERRIDE ASPEN\u2019S POLICY TO THE EXTENT IN CONFLICT. IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS AT A TIME WHEN A PORTION OR NONE OF THE TUITION IS REFUNDABLE, THEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, ASPEN RECOGNIZES AS REVENUE THE TUITION THAT WAS NOT REFUNDED. SINCE ASPEN RECOGNIZES REVENUE PRO-RATA OVER THE TERM OF THE COURSE AND BECAUSE, UNDER ITS INSTITUTIONAL REFUND POLICY, THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO REFUND IS NEVER GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN DEFERRED, UNDER ASPEN\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REFUNDED. ASPEN\u2019S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAVE STARTING AND ENDING DATES THAT DIFFER FROM ITS FISCAL QUARTERS. THEREFORE, AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, A PORTION OF REVENUE FROM THESE PROGRAMS IS NOT YET EARNED AND IS THEREFORE DEFERRED. ASPEN ALSO CHARGES STUDENTS ANNUAL FEES FOR LIBRARY, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. DEFERRED REVENUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF TUITION, FEES, AND OTHER STUDENT PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THE PORTION RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AND IT IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OTHER REVENUE MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS SALES OCCUR OR SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SELECT BOTH A PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PAYMENT OPTION WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS DUE TO ASPEN FOR TUITION, FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE MOST COMMON PAYMENT OPTION FOR ASPEN\u2019S STUDENTS IS PERSONAL FUNDS OR PAYMENT MADE ON THEIR BEHALF BY AN EMPLOYER. IN INSTANCES WHERE A STUDENT SELECTS FINANCIAL AID AS THE PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION, HE OR SHE OFTEN SELECTS PERSONAL CASH AS THE SECONDARY OPTION. IF A STUDENT WHO HAS SELECTED FINANCIAL AID AS HIS OR HER PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION WITHDRAWS PRIOR TO THE END OF A COURSE BUT AFTER THE DATE THAT ASPEN\u2019S INSTITUTIONAL REFUND PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, THE STUDENT WILL HAVE INCURRED THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE FULL COST OF THE COURSE. IF THE WITHDRAWAL OCCURS BEFORE THE DATE AT WHICH THE STUDENT HAS EARNED 100% OF HIS OR HER FINANCIAL AID, ASPEN WILL HAVE TO RETURN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE TITLE IV FUNDS TO THE DOE AND THE STUDENT WILL OWE ASPEN ALL AMOUNTS INCURRED THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID THAT THE STUDENT EARNED AND THAT ASPEN IS ENTITLED TO RETAIN. IN THIS CASE, ASPEN MUST COLLECT THE RECEIVABLE USING THE STUDENT\u2019S SECOND PAYMENT OPTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM STUDENTS, ASPEN RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES. ASPEN DETERMINES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS USING A GENERAL RESERVE METHOD BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND THE AGING OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN APPLIES RESERVES TO ITS RECEIVABLES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF THE RISK PRESENTED BY THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN WRITES OFF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES AT THE TIME THE BALANCES ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. ASPEN CONTINUES TO REFLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH AN OFFSETTING ALLOWANCE AS LONG AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF COLLECTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PRIMARY PAYERS OTHER THAN STUDENTS, ASPEN ESTIMATES ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BY EVALUATING SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS WHERE INFORMATION INDICATES THE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE AN INABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEYOND CONTRACTUAL TERMS. IN THESE CASES, ASPEN USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENT, BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, TO RECORD A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS AGAINST AMOUNTS DUE TO REDUCE THE RECEIVABLE TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THESE SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES ARE RE-EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED. THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE. ASPEN MAY ALSO RECORD A GENERAL ALLOWANCE AS NECESSARY.  DIRECT WRITE-OFFS ARE TAKEN IN THE PERIOD WHEN ASPEN HAS EXHAUSTED ITS EFFORTS TO COLLECT OVERDUE AND UNPAID RECEIVABLES OR OTHERWISE EVALUATE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE THAT ASPEN SHOULD ABANDON SUCH EFFORTS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  WE INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE FROM THE DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION. WE ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE OF ACQUISITIONS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT FAIR VALUE. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OVER THE AMOUNT ASSIGNED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WE EXPENSE TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AS INCURRED.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL CURRENTLY REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM EDUCACION SIGNIFICATIVA, LLC. GOODWILL HAS AN INDEFINITE LIFE AND IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT BOTH INDEFINITE LIVED AND DEFINITE LIVED ASSETS. ACCREDITATION AND REGULATORY APPROVALS AND TRADE NAME AND TRADEMARKS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES AND ACCORDINGLY ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS AND CURRICULUMS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES AND ARE AMORTIZED ACCORDINGLY.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES INVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  LIMONEIRA COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1990 AS THE SUCCESSOR TO SEVERAL BUSINESSES WITH OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA SINCE 1893. WE ARE PRIMARILY AN AGRIBUSINESS COMPANY FOUNDED AND BASED IN SANTA PAULA, CALIFORNIA, COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBLY USING AND MANAGING OUR APPROXIMATELY 15,700 ACRES OF LAND, WATER RESOURCES AND OTHER ASSETS TO MAXIMIZE LONG-TERM STOCKHOLDER VALUE. OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS CONSIST OF FRUIT PRODUCTION, SALES AND MARKETING, RENTAL OPERATIONS, REAL ESTATE AND CAPITAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES.  WE ARE ONE OF CALIFORNIA\u2019S OLDEST CITRUS GROWERS. ACCORDING TO SUNKIST GROWERS, INC. (\u201cSUNKIST\u201d), WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST GROWERS OF LEMONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND, ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA AVOCADO COMMISSION, ONE OF THE LARGEST GROWERS OF AVOCADOS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION TO GROWING LEMONS AND AVOCADOS, WE GROW ORANGES AND A VARIETY OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS. WE HAVE AGRICULTURAL PLANTINGS THROUGHOUT VENTURA, TULARE, SAN LUIS OBISPO AND SAN BERNARDINO COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA, YUMA COUNTY IN ARIZONA, LA SERENA, CHILE AND JUJUY, ARGENTINA, WHICH COLLECTIVELY CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 6,200 ACRES OF LEMONS, 900 ACRES OF AVOCADOS, 1,600 ACRES OF ORANGES AND 1,000 ACRES OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS. WE ALSO OPERATE OUR OWN PACKINGHOUSES IN SANTA PAULA AND OXNARD, CALIFORNIA AND YUMA, ARIZONA, WHERE WE PROCESS, PACK AND SELL LEMONS THAT WE GROW, AS WELL AS LEMONS GROWN BY OTHERS. WE HAVE A 47% INTEREST IN ROSALES S.A. (\u201cROSALES\u201d), A CITRUS PACKING, MARKETING AND SALES BUSINESS, A 90% INTEREST IN FRUTICOLA PAN DE AZUCAR S.A. (\u201cPDA\u201d), A LEMON AND ORANGE ORCHARD AND 100% INTEREST IN AGRICOLA SAN PABLO, SPA (\"SAN PABLO\"), A LEMON AND ORANGE ORCHARD, ALL OF WHICH ARE LOCATED NEAR LA SERENA, CHILE. WE HAVE A 51% INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE, TRAPANI FRESH CONSORCIO DE COOPERACION (\"TRAPANI FRESH\"), A LEMON GROWING, PACKING, MARKETING AND SELLING BUSINESS IN ARGENTINA.  OUR WATER RESOURCES INCLUDE WATER RIGHTS, USAGE RIGHTS AND PUMPING RIGHTS TO THE WATER IN AQUIFERS UNDER, AND CANALS THAT RUN THROUGH, THE LAND WE OWN. WATER FOR OUR FARMING OPERATIONS IS SOURCED FROM THE EXISTING WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LAND, WHICH INCLUDES RIGHTS TO WATER IN THE ADJUDICATED SANTA PAULA BASIN (AQUIFER) AND THE UN-ADJUDICATED FILLMORE AND PASO ROBLES BASINS (AQUIFERS). WE USE GROUND WATER FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BASIN AND WATER FROM LOCAL WATER AND IRRIGATION DISTRICTS IN TULARE COUNTY, WHICH IS IN CALIFORNIA\u2019S SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE ALSO USE GROUND WATER FROM THE CADIZ VALLEY BASIN IN CALIFORNIA'S SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND SURFACE WATER IN ARIZONA FROM THE COLORADO RIVER THROUGH THE YUMA MESA IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE DISTRICT (\u201cYMIDD\u201d). WE USE GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS AND SURFACE WATER FOR OUR PDA AND SAN PABLO FARMING OPERATIONS IN CHILE AND OUR TRAPANI FRESH FARMING OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA.  FOR MORE THAN 100 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN MAKING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND REAL ESTATE. WE CURRENTLY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THREE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE MULTI-FAMILY HOUSING AND SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  260  COMPLETED RENTAL UNITS AND ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY  1,500  UNITS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT.  BUSINESS DIVISION SUMMARY  WE HAVE THREE BUSINESS DIVISIONS: AGRIBUSINESS, RENTAL OPERATIONS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT. THE AGRIBUSINESS DIVISION IS COMPRISED OF FOUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: FRESH LEMONS, LEMON PACKING, AVOCADOS AND OTHER AGRIBUSINESS, AND INCLUDES OUR CORE OPERATIONS OF FARMING, HARVESTING, LEMON PACKING AND LEMON SALES OPERATIONS. THE RENTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION INCLUDES OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL RENTALS, LEASED LAND OPERATIONS AND ORGANIC RECYCLING. THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION INCLUDES OUR INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND DISCUSSION OF OUR FOUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE CONTAINED IN THE NOTES TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  AGRIBUSINESS DIVISION  THE AGRIBUSINESS DIVISION IS COMPRISED OF FOUR OF OUR REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: FRESH LEMONS, LEMON PACKING, AVOCADOS AND OTHER AGRIBUSINESS, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 97%, 96% AND 96% OF OUR FISCAL YEAR  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH FRESH LEMONS AND LEMON PACKING COMBINED REPRESENTED 87%, 80% AND 78% OF OUR FISCAL YEAR  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR LEMON FARMING IS INCLUDED IN OUR \u201cFRESH LEMONS\u201d AND \u201cLEMON PACKING\u201d REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS WITHIN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST GROWERS OF LEMONS AND AVOCADOS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE MARKET AND SELL LEMONS DIRECTLY TO OUR FOOD SERVICE, WHOLESALE AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, ASIA, AUSTRALIA AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , LEMON SALES WERE COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY  71%  IN DOMESTIC AND CANADIAN SALES,  25%  IN SALES TO DOMESTIC EXPORTERS AND  4%  IN INTERNATIONAL SALES. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $0.5 MILLION  OF LEMON AND ORANGE SALES IN CHILE BY PDA AND SAN PABLO AND  $0.2 MILLION  OF LEMON AND ORANGE SALES IN ARGENTINA BY TRAPANI FRESH IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  26  JANUARY 31, 2020  . WE SELL OUR ORANGES AND SPECIALTY CITRUS TO SUNKIST-LICENSED AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES. WE SELL OUR PISTACHIOS TO A ROASTER, PACKAGER AND MARKETER OF NUTS, AND OUR WINE GRAPES ARE SOLD TO VARIOUS WINE PRODUCERS.  HISTORICALLY, OUR AGRIBUSINESS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN SEASONAL IN NATURE WITH QUARTERLY REVENUE FLUCTUATING DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND VARIETY OF CROPS BEING HARVESTED. CULTURAL COSTS IN OUR AGRIBUSINESS TEND TO BE HIGHER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS AND LOWER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF EXPENSING CULTURAL COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT WERE INVENTORIED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OUR HARVEST COSTS GENERALLY INCREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND PEAK IN THE THIRD QUARTER COINCIDING WITH THE INCREASING PRODUCTION AND REVENUE.  FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICE ARE A FUNCTION OF GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND WITH WEATHER CONDITIONS, SUCH AS UNUSUALLY LOW TEMPERATURES, TYPICALLY HAVING THE MOST DRAMATIC EFFECT ON THE AMOUNT OF LEMONS SUPPLIED IN ANY INDIVIDUAL GROWING SEASON. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY MAINTAINING OUR OWN LEMON PACKING OPERATIONS, EVEN THOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THESE OPERATIONS ARE FIXED. AS A RESULT, COST PER CARTON IS A FUNCTION OF FRUIT THROUGHPUT. WHILE WE REGULARLY MONITOR OUR COSTS FOR REDUNDANCIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR COST REDUCTIONS, WE ALSO SUPPLEMENT THE NUMBER OF LEMONS WE PACK IN OUR PACKINGHOUSE WITH ADDITIONAL LEMONS PROCURED FROM OTHER GROWERS. BECAUSE THE FRESH UTILIZATION RATE FOR OUR LEMONS, OR PERCENTAGE OF LEMONS WE HARVEST AND PACK THAT ARE SOLD TO THE FRESH MARKET, IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF LEMONS WE PACK AND, CONSEQUENTLY, THE PRICE WE RECEIVE PER 40-POUND BOX, WE ONLY PACK LEMONS FROM OTHER GROWERS IF WE DETERMINE THEIR LEMONS ARE OF GOOD QUALITY.  OUR AVOCADO PRODUCING BUSINESS IS IMPORTANT TO US, YET IT FACES CONSTRAINTS ON GROWTH AS THERE IS LITTLE ADDITIONAL LAND THAT CAN BE COST-EFFECTIVELY ACQUIRED TO SUPPORT NEW AVOCADO ORCHARDS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALSO, AVOCADO PRODUCTION IS CYCLICAL AS AVOCADOS TYPICALLY BEAR FRUIT ON A BI-ANNUAL BASIS WITH LARGE CROPS IN ONE YEAR FOLLOWED BY SMALLER CROPS THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE OUR AVOCADO PRODUCTION CAN BE VOLATILE, THE PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW REALIZED FROM OUR AVOCADOS HELPS TO DIVERSIFY OUR FRUIT PRODUCTION BASE.  IN ADDITION TO GROWING LEMONS AND AVOCADOS, WE GROW ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS, TYPICALLY UTILIZING LAND NOT SUITABLE FOR GROWING HIGH QUALITY LEMONS. WE REGULARLY MONITOR THE DEMAND FOR THE FRUIT WE GROW IN THE EVER-CHANGING MARKETPLACE TO IDENTIFY TRENDS. FOR INSTANCE, WHILE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF ORANGES IN THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN DECREASING SINCE 2000 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CONSUMERS INCREASING THEIR CONSUMPTION OF MANDARIN ORANGES AND OTHER SPECIALTY CITRUS, THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET DEMAND FOR U.S. ORANGES HAS INCREASED. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE FOCUSED OUR ORANGE PRODUCTION ON HIGH QUALITY LATE SEASON NAVEL ORANGES PRIMARILY FOR EXPORT TO JAPAN, CHINA AND KOREA, WHICH ARE TYPICALLY HIGHLY PROFITABLE NICHE MARKETS. WE PRODUCE OUR SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS IN RESPONSE TO IDENTIFIED CONSUMER TRENDS AND BELIEVE THAT WE ARE A LEADER IN THE NICHE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF CERTAIN OF THESE HIGH MARGIN FRUITS. WE CAREFULLY MONITOR THE RESPECTIVE MARKETS OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS AND WE BELIEVE THAT DEMAND FOR THE TYPES AND VARIETIES OF SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER CROPS THAT WE GROW WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  OTHER DIVISIONS  OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION INCLUDES OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL RENTALS, LEASED LAND OPERATIONS AND ORGANIC RECYCLING. OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS DIVISION REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 3%, 4% AND 4% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  AND  2017  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR RESIDENTIAL RENTAL UNITS GENERATE RELIABLE CASH FLOWS, WHICH WE USE TO PARTIALLY FUND THE OPERATIONS OF ALL THREE OF OUR BUSINESS DIVISIONS AND PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MANY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING OUR AGRIBUSINESS EMPLOYEES, A UNIQUE EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT THAT HELPS US MAINTAIN A DEPENDABLE, LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BASE. IN ADDITION, OUR LEASED LAND BUSINESS PROVIDES US WITH A TYPICALLY PROFITABLE DIVERSIFICATION. REVENUE FROM RENTAL OPERATIONS IS GENERALLY LEVEL THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION INCLUDES OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS. THE REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION HAD NO REVENUE IN FISCAL YEARS  2019  ,  2018  OR  2017  . WE RECOGNIZE THAT LONG-TERM STRATEGIES ARE REQUIRED FOR SUCCESSFUL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. OUR GOAL IS TO REDEPLOY REAL ESTATE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW INTO THE EXPANSION OF OUR AGRIBUSINESS AND OTHER INCOME PRODUCING REAL ESTATE. FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND JOINT VENTURES, IT IS NOT UNUSUAL FOR THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND COSTS, PARTNER CONTRIBUTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, PROJECT LOANS AND OTHER FINANCING ASSUMPTIONS AND PROJECT CASH FLOWS TO BE IMPACTED BY GOVERNMENT APPROVALS, PROJECT REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FINANCING SOURCES AND PRODUCT DEMAND AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS. SUCH FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY.  27  WATER RESOURCES  OUR WATER RESOURCES INCLUDE WATER RIGHTS, USAGE RIGHTS AND PUMPING RIGHTS TO THE WATER IN AQUIFERS UNDER, AND CANALS THAT RUN THROUGH, THE LAND WE OWN. WATER FOR OUR FARMING OPERATIONS LOCATED IN VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA IS SOURCED FROM THE EXISTING WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LAND, WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 8,600-ACRE FEET OF ADJUDICATED WATER RIGHTS IN THE SANTA PAULA BASIN (AQUIFER) AND THE UN-ADJUDICATED FILLMORE BASIN. WE USE A COMBINATION OF GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS THAT DERIVE WATER FROM THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BASIN AND WATER FROM VARIOUS WATER DISTRICTS AND IRRIGATION DISTRICTS IN TULARE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS IN THE AGRICULTURALLY PRODUCTIVE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE USE GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS WHICH DERIVE WATER FROM THE CADIZ VALLEY BASIN AT THE CADIZ RANCH IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. OUR WINDFALL FARMS PROPERTY LOCATED IN SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY, CALIFORNIA OBTAINS WATER FROM WELLS THAT DERIVE WATER FROM THE PASO ROBLES BASIN. OUR ASSOCIATED CITRUS PACKERS, INC. (\"ASSOCIATED\") FARMING OPERATIONS IN YUMA, ARIZONA SOURCE WATER FROM THE COLORADO RIVER THROUGH THE YMIDD, WHERE WE HAVE ACCESS TO APPROXIMATELY 11,700-ACRE FEET OF CLASS 3 COLORADO RIVER WATER RIGHTS. WE USE GROUND WATER PROVIDED BY WELLS AND SURFACE WATER FOR OUR PDA AND SAN PABLO FARMING OPERATIONS IN LA SERENA, CHILE AND OUR TRAPANI FRESH FARMING OPERATIONS IN ARGENTINA.  CALIFORNIA HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED PERIODS OF BELOW AVERAGE PRECIPITATION. PRECIPITATION IN 2019 BROUGHT RELIEF TO CALIFORNIA\u2019S DROUGHT CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THE FEW YEARS PRIOR TO 2019 WERE AMONG THE MOST SEVERE DROUGHTS ON RECORD. RAINFALL, SNOW LEVELS AND WATER CONTENT OF SNOW PACK WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW HISTORICAL AVERAGES. THESE CONDITIONS RESULTED IN REDUCED WATER LEVELS IN STREAMS, RIVERS, LAKES, AQUIFERS AND RESERVOIRS. FEDERAL OFFICIALS OVERSEE THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT, CALIFORNIA\u2019S LARGEST WATER DELIVERY SYSTEM AND 100% OF THE CONTRACTED AMOUNT OF WATER WAS PROVIDED TO SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FARMERS IN 2019, 2018 AND 2017 COMPARED TO 75% IN 2016 AND ZERO FOR 2015 AND 2014.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE EQUAL PARTNERS IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE LEWIS GROUP OF COMPANIES (\u201cLEWIS\u201d) FOR THE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EAST AREA I REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION, WE FORMED LIMONEIRA LEWIS COMMUNITY BUILDERS, LLC (THE \"LLCB\" OR \"JOINT VENTURE\") AS THE DEVELOPMENT ENTITY. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE PROJECT BROKE GROUND TO COMMENCE MASS GRADING IN NOVEMBER 2017. THE JOINT VENTURE HAS CLOSED ON LOTS SALES REPRESENTING 244 UNITS THROUGH  JANUARY 31, 2020  . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION SEE NOTE 7 \u2013 REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  ON MAY 30, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A  51%  INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE, TRAPANI FRESH, FORMED WITH FGF TRAPANI (\u201cFGF\u201d), A MULTI-GENERATIONAL, FAMILY OWNED CITRUS OPERATION IN ARGENTINA. TO CONSUMMATE THE TRANSACTION, WE FORMED A SUBSIDIARY UNDER THE NAME LIMONEIRA ARGENTINA S.A.U. (\u201cLIMONEIRA ARGENTINA\u201d) AS THE MANAGING PARTNER AND ACQUIRED A  51%  INTEREST IN AN ARGENTINE TRUST THAT HOLDS A  75%  INTEREST IN FINCA SANTA CLARA (\u201cSANTA CLARA\u201d), A RANCH WITH APPROXIMATELY  1,200  ACRES OF PLANTED LEMONS. TRAPANI FRESH CONTROLS THE TRUST AND GROWS, PACKS, MARKETS AND SELLS FRESH CITRUS. TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID FOR OUR INTEREST IN TRAPANI FRESH WAS  $15,000,000.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL OUR SEVILLA PROPERTY FOR $2,700,000.

THE INCREASE IN AGRIBUSINESS COSTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED AGRIBUSINESS PRODUCTION AND THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, SALARIES AND BENEFITS, AND CERTAIN CORPORATE  EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  \u2022  TOTAL OTHER INCOME  WAS SIMILAR IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  \u2022  INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION) DECREASED  $4.6 MILLION  IN THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED INCOME BEFORE TAXES AS A RESULT OF DECREASED OPERATING INCOME.  35  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION FLUCTUATES DURING THE YEAR DEPENDING ON SEASONAL PRODUCTION CYCLES, WEATHER EVENTS AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS. TYPICALLY, OUR FIRST AND LAST FISCAL QUARTERS COINCIDE WITH THE FALL AND WINTER MONTHS DURING WHICH WE ARE GROWING CROPS THAT ARE HARVESTED AND SOLD IN THE SPRING AND SUMMER, WHICH ARE OUR SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS. TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL DEMAND AND INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS OF OUR AGRIBUSINESS AND REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND TO SUPPLEMENT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WE UTILIZE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND AGRICULTURAL INPUTS AND FARM MANAGEMENT PRACTICES UNTIL SUFFICIENT RETURNS FROM CROPS ALLOW US TO REPAY AMOUNTS BORROWED. RAW MATERIALS NEEDED TO PROPAGATE THE VARIOUS CROPS GROWN BY US CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FERTILIZER, HERBICIDES, INSECTICIDES, FUEL AND WATER, ALL OF WHICH ARE READILY AVAILABLE FROM LOCAL SOURCES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $12.2 MILLION  AND  $4.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET LOSS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS  $6.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET LOSS OF  $4.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  . THE COMPONENTS OF NET LOSS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  CONSIST OF A DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME OF  $5.4 MILLION  , A DECREASE IN TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE OF  $1.8 MILLION  AND AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  $1.4 MILLION.  \u2022  THE ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET LOSS TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED  $2.2 MILLION  OF CASH IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO PROVIDING $5.3 MILLION OF CASH IN THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND UNREALIZED LOSS ON STOCK IN CALAVO.  \u2022  THE CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  USED  $7.5 MILLION  OF OPERATING CASH IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO USING $5.1 MILLION OF OPERATING CASH IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, GROWERS PAYABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $6.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $9.8 MILLION  DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  . NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AGRICULTURE PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $3.7 MILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , COMPRISED OF  $3.5 MILLION  FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RELATED TO ORCHARD AND VINEYARD DEVELOPMENT AND  $0.2 MILLION  FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE CONTRIBUTED  $2.8 MILLION  TO THE JOINT VENTURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EAST AREA I REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $5.1 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, COMPRISED OF $4.6 MILLION FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RELATED TO ORCHARD AND VINEYARD DEVELOPMENT AND THE PURCHASE OF A PHOTOVOLTAIC SOLAR ARRAY AND $0.3 MILLION FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WE PURCHASED AN AGRICULTURE PROPERTY FOR $0.4 MILLION AND CONTRIBUTED $4.0 MILLION TO THE JOINT VENTURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR EAST AREA I REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $19.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $14.9 MILLION  DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2019.  THE  $19.1 MILLION  OF CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE AMOUNT  $20.7 MILLION  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS, IN AGGREGATE, OF  $1.5 MILLION  . THE $14.9 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF NET BORROWINGS OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE AMOUNT $16.7 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COMMON AND PREFERRED DIVIDENDS, IN AGGREGATE, OF $1.5 MILLION.  36  TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  IN JUNE 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER LOAN AGREEMENT (THE \u201cLOAN AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH FARM CREDIT WEST, FLCA (\"FARM CREDIT WEST\") WHICH INCLUDES A REVOLVING CREDIT SUPPLEMENT AND A NON-REVOLVING CREDIT SUPPLEMENT (THE \u201cSUPPLEMENTS\u201d). ON JANUARY 29, 2018, WE AMENDED THE REVOLVING CREDIT SUPPLEMENT TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY FROM  $60.0 MILLION  TO  $75.0 MILLION  . THE SUPPLEMENTS PROVIDE AGGREGATE BORROWING CAPACITY OF  $115.0 MILLION  COMPRISED OF  $75.0 MILLION  UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT SUPPLEMENT AND  $40.0 MILLION  UNDER THE NON-REVOLVING CREDIT SUPPLEMENT. THE BORROWING CAPACITY BASED ON COLLATERAL VALUE WAS  $115.0 MILLION  AT  JANUARY 31, 2020.  THE INTEREST RATE FOR ANY AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTS IS BASED ON THE ONE-MONTH LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT ON A MONTHLY BASIS. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN RANGES FROM 1.60% TO 2.35% DEPENDING ON THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS PLUS THE REMAINING AVAILABLE COMMITMENT DIVIDED BY CURRENT LIABILITIES. ON JULY 1, 2019, AND ON EACH ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER, WE HAVE THE OPTION TO CONVERT THE INTEREST RATE IN USE UNDER EACH SUPPLEMENT FROM THE PRECEDING LIBOR-BASED CALCULATION TO A VARIABLE INTEREST RATE, OR THE REVERSE, AS APPLICABLE. ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTS ARE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL ON JULY 1, 2022.  ALL INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE SUPPLEMENTS, IS SECURED BY A FIRST LIEN ON CERTAIN OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES IN TULARE AND VENTURA COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND CERTAIN OF OUR BUILDING FIXTURES AND IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENTS IN MUTUAL WATER COMPANIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLEDGED AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES. THE LOAN AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY DEFAULT PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDE THAT SHOULD AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCUR, FARM CREDIT WEST, AT ITS OPTION, MAY DECLARE ALL OR ANY PORTION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT TO BE IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE WITHOUT DEMAND, NOTICE OF NON-PAYMENT, PROTEST OR PRIOR RECOURSE TO COLLATERAL, AND TERMINATE OR SUSPEND OUR RIGHT TO DRAW OR REQUEST FUNDS ON ANY LOAN OR LINE OF CREDIT.  THE LOAN AGREEMENT SUBJECTS US TO AFFIRMATIVE AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, FINANCIAL REPORTING REQUIREMENTS, REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN AND REPAIR ANY COLLATERAL, RESTRICTIONS ON THE SALE OF ASSETS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE USE OF PROCEEDS, PROHIBITIONS ON THE INCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL DEBT AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF MAJOR ASSETS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A COVENANT THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN A DEBT SERVICE COVERAGE RATIO GREATER THAN 1.25:1.0 MEASURED ANNUALLY AT OCTOBER 31.  IN FEBRUARY 2020, WE RECEIVED AN ANNUAL PATRONAGE DIVIDEND OF  $966,000  FROM FARM CREDIT WEST. THIS DIVIDEND WAS ACCRUED AT JANUARY 31, 2020, OF WHICH  $667,000  WAS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND  $299,000  REDUCED OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT ASSETS.  IN MARCH 2020, WE ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT WITH FARM CREDIT WEST FOR A $15.0 MILLION REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT SECURED BY THE WINDFALL INVESTORS, LLC PROPERTY. THE LOAN MATURES IN 2043 AND FEATURES A 3-YEAR DRAW PERIOD FOLLOWED BY 20 YEARS OF FULLY AMORTIZED LOAN PAYMENTS. THE INTEREST RATE IS VARIABLE WITH MONTHLY INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS DURING THE 3-YEAR DRAW PERIOD AND MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS THEREAFTER.  WE FINANCE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR FARM CREDIT WEST CREDIT FACILITY. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE THE FARM CREDIT WEST TERM LOANS, THE WELLS FARGO TERM LOAN, THE BANCO DE CHILE TERM LOAN AND A NOTE PAYABLE TO THE SELLERS OF A LAND PARCEL. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE FARM CREDIT WEST CREDIT FACILITY, THE FARM CREDIT WEST TERM LOANS, THE WELLS FARGO TERM LOAN, THE BANCO DE CHILE TERM LOAN AND THE NOTE PAYABLE CAN BE FOUND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY FROM OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  . IN ADDITION, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL A PORTION OF OUR INVESTING CASH FLOWS TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY BASED ON OUR LIQUIDITY DEMANDS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR FISCAL YEAR  2019  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS.  IN JANUARY 2018, THE JOINT VENTURE ENTERED INTO A  $45.0 MILLION  UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT LOAN AGREEMENT AND PROMISSORY NOTE (THE \u201cLOAN\u201d) WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. TO FUND EARLY DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. THE LOAN ORIGINALLY MATURED IN JANUARY 2020 AND WAS EXTENDED TO FEBRUARY 22, 2021 PER THE TERMS THEREOF. THE INTEREST RATE ON THE LOAN IS LIBOR PLUS  2.85%  AND IS PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE LOAN CONTAINS CERTAIN CUSTOMARY DEFAULT PROVISIONS AND THE JOINT VENTURE MAY PREPAY ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LOAN WITHOUT  37  PENALTY. THE JOINT VENTURE RECORDED A  $45.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING LOAN BALANCE AT  JANUARY 31, 2020  RELATED TO THIS LOAN. THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LOAN ARE GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN PRINCIPALS FROM LEWIS AND BY US.  FIXED RATE AND VARIABLE RATE DEBT  DETAILS OF AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN LONG-TERM DEBT CAN BE FOUND ABOVE AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND IN NOTE 7 \u2013 REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT AND NOTE 8 \u2013 EQUITY IN INVESTMENTS IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR FISCAL YEAR  2019  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE HAVE INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.  INFLATION  HISTORICALLY, INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN INFLATION, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AVAILABLE RELEVANT DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS AS NEW OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFLECT OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ON NOVEMBER 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\"ASU\") NO. 2016-02, LEASES (AS AMENDED, \"ASU 2016-02\" OR THE \"NEW LEASE STANDARD\"). A LEASE IS DEFINED AS A CONTRACT THAT CONVEYS THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN IDENTIFIED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT ARE, OR CONTAIN, LEASES AS BOTH A LESSEE AND A LESSOR. THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES HAVE BEEN UPDATED AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD.  LEASES  ACCOUNTING FOR OPERATING LEASES AS A LESSEE  - IN OUR ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ENTER INTO LEASES AS A LESSEE GENERALLY FOR AGRICULTURAL LAND AND PACKINGHOUSE EQUIPMENT. WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE OR CONTAINS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO USE AN UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE, MEASURED ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM AT COMMENCEMENT DATE. AS NONE OF THE OUR LEASES PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS.  LEASE EXPENSE FOR MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS WE HAVE ELECTED TO RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE HAVE MATERIAL LEASES WITH RELATED PARTIES WHICH ARE FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 15 - RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. CERTAIN OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LAND AGREEMENTS CONTAIN VARIABLE COSTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LEASED PROPERTY. SUCH VARIABLE LEASE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THESE LAND AGREEMENTS ALSO CONTAIN COSTS FOR NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SUCH AS WATER USAGE. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SEPARATELY. FOR ALL OTHER AGREEMENTS, WE GENERALLY COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS IN CALCULATING THE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. SEE NOTE 13 - LEASES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  38  ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES AS A LESSOR  - WE LEASE IN WHICH WE ACT AS THE LESSOR INCLUDES LAND AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL UNITS AND ARE ALL CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES. CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN VARIABLE INCOME BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LEASED ASSET. CERTAIN OF OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS SUCH AS WATER, UTILITIES AND COMMON AREA SERVICES. WE HAVE ELECTED TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FOR OUR LESSOR ARRANGEMENTS AND THE COMBINED COMPONENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR ENTIRELY UNDER ASC 842. THE UNDERLYING ASSET IN AN OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENT IS CARRIED AT DEPRECIATED COST WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. DEPRECIATION IS CALCULATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING ASSET. WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  - WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR AGRIBUSINESS REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE STANDARD IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. TO ACHIEVE THAT CORE PRINCIPLE, AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE FOLLOWING STEPS.  \u2022  IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT(S) WITH A CUSTOMER;  \u2022  IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT;  \u2022  DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE;  \u2022  ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT; AND  \u2022  RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION.  WE DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE METHOD BY WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE BY ANALYZING THE NATURE OF THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES BEING PROVIDED AS WELL AS THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CONTRACTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ACCOUNT FOR A CONTRACT WHEN IT HAS APPROVAL AND COMMITMENT FROM BOTH PARTIES, THE RIGHTS OF THE PARTIES ARE IDENTIFIED, PAYMENT TERMS ARE IDENTIFIED, THE CONTRACT HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE AND COLLECTABILITY OF CONSIDERATION IS PROBABLE. A CONTRACT'S TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE (I.E., PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION) IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTRACT AND EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS VALUED BASED ON ITS ESTIMATED RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE.  WE RECOGNIZE THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AND TRANSFER CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT TO THE RESPECTIVE CUSTOMER. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE THAT IS RECOGNIZED IS BASED ON THE TRANSACTION PRICE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND INCLUDES ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION SUCH AS ALLOWANCES FOR ESTIMATED CUSTOMER DISCOUNTS OR CONCESSIONS, WHERE APPLICABLE. THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND IS INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT WILL NOT OCCUR IN A FUTURE PERIOD.  AGRIBUSINESS REVENUE  - REVENUE FROM LEMON SALES IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN THE CUSTOMER TAKES CONTROL OF THE FRUIT FROM OUR PACKINGHOUSE WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE TRANSFER OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER. WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT ANY SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS INCURRED AFTER CONTROL OF THE GOODS HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AS AGRIBUSINESS COSTS.  OUR AVOCADOS, ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER SPECIALTY CROPS ARE PACKED AND SOLD BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES. WE DELIVER THE MAJORITY OF OUR AVOCADO PRODUCTION FROM OUR ORCHARDS TO CALAVO. THESE AVOCADOS ARE THEN PACKED BY CALAVO AT ITS PACKINGHOUSE AND SOLD AND DISTRIBUTED UNDER CALAVO BRANDS TO ITS CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES RELATED TO OUR ORANGES, SPECIALTY CITRUS AND OTHER SPECIALTY CROPS ARE SIMILAR TO OUR ARRANGEMENT WITH CALAVO. OUR ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUR THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE SUCH THAT WE ARE THE PRODUCER AND SUPPLIER OF THE PRODUCT AND THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE REVENUES WE RECOGNIZE RELATED TO THE FRUITS SOLD TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE BASED ON THE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF THE FRUITS DELIVERED, THE MARKET PRICE FOR SUCH FRUIT, LESS THE PACKINGHOUSES\u2019 CHARGES TO PACK AND MARKET THE FRUIT. SUCH PACKINGHOUSE CHARGES INCLUDE THE GRADING, SIZING, PACKING, COOLING, RIPENING AND MARKETING OF THE RELATED FRUIT. WE CONTROL THE PRODUCT UNTIL IT IS DELIVERED TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AT WHICH TIME CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT IS TRANSFERRED TO THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. SUCH THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSE CHARGES ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AS THEY ARE NOT FOR DISTINCT SERVICES. THE IDENTIFIABLE BENEFIT WE RECEIVE FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES FOR PACKAGING AND MARKETING SERVICES CANNOT BE SUFFICIENTLY SEPARATED FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES\u2019 PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BENEFIT RECEIVED FROM THE THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES FOR SUCH SERVICES AND AS SUCH, THESE COSTS ARE CHARACTERIZED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF CERTAIN OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS IS RECORDED BASED ON ESTIMATED PROCEEDS PROVIDED BY CERTAIN OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING PARTNERS (CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES) DUE TO THE TIME BETWEEN WHEN THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED BY US AND THE CLOSING OF THE POOLS FOR SUCH FRUITS AT THE END OF EACH MONTH OR HARVEST PERIOD. CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES ARE AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVES OR FUNCTION IN A SIMILAR MANNER AS AN AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE. WE ESTIMATE THE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING  39  THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD, WITH THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT BEING THE QUANTITIES ACTUALLY SHIPPED EXTENDED BY THE PRICES REPORTED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT TIME OF DELIVERY TO THE PACKINGHOUSES RELATING TO FRUITS THAT ARE IN POOLS THAT HAVE NOT YET CLOSED AT MONTH END IF: (A) THE RELATED FRUITS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO AND ACCEPTED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES (I.E., CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES OBTAIN CONTROL) AND (B) SALES PRICE INFORMATION HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES (BASED ON THE MARKETPLACE ACTIVITY FOR THE RELATED FRUIT) TO ESTIMATE WITH REASONABLE CERTAINTY THE FINAL SELLING PRICE FOR THE FRUIT UPON THE CLOSING OF THE POOLS. IN SUCH INSTANCES, WE HAVE THE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT AND CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES HAVE THE PRESENT RIGHT TO DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM, THE DELIVERED FRUIT. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THERE IS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN THE EARLY PERIODS OF THE POOL WILL OCCUR ONCE THE FINAL POOL PRICES HAVE BEEN REPORTED BY THE PACKINGHOUSES. HISTORICALLY, THE REVENUE THAT IS RECORDED BASED ON THE SALES PRICE INFORMATION PROVIDED TO US BY CALAVO AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PACKINGHOUSES AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY, HAVE NOT MATERIALLY DIFFERED FROM THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS THAT ARE PAID AFTER THE MONTHLY OR HARVEST PERIOD POOLS ARE CLOSED.  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY INTERNATIONAL PACKINGHOUSES. IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE HAVE THE EXCLUSIVE ABILITY TO DIRECT THE USE OF, AND OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE REMAINING BENEFITS FROM THE FRUIT, AND ARE THEREFORE ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL. AS SUCH, WE RECORD THE RELATED REVENUE AND COSTS OF THE FRUIT GROSS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  REVENUE FROM CROP INSURANCE PROCEEDS IS RECORDED WHEN THE AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY DETERMINED AND UPON ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT.  RENTAL REVENUE  - WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR RENTAL OPERATIONS REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, LEASES. MINIMUM RENTAL REVENUES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RESPECTIVE INITIAL LEASE TERM. CONTINGENT RENTAL REVENUES ARE CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED AS TO THE PERCENTAGE OF RENT RECEIVED BY US AND ARE BASED ON FEES COLLECTED BY THE LESSEE. SUCH REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ACTUAL RESULTS, BASED ON COLLECTED FEES REPORTED BY THE TENANT, ARE RECEIVED. OUR RENTAL ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT ON A MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY BASIS.  REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT COSTS  - WE CAPITALIZE THE PLANNING, ENTITLEMENT, CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR VARIOUS REAL ESTATE PROJECTS. COSTS THAT ARE NOT CAPITALIZED, WHICH INCLUDE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND MARKETING EXPENSES, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. A REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS CONSIDERED SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE UPON THE CESSATION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. ONCE A PROJECT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED, FUTURE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS INCURRED TO SELL THE REAL ESTATE ARE EVALUATED FOR CAPITALIZATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 340-40, AND INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT AND COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT ARE CAPITALIZED ONLY IF THE COSTS RELATE DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED CONTRACT, ENHANCE RESOURCES TO SATISFY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED.  FINANCING AND PAYMENT  - OUR PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF OUR CUSTOMER AND THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED. PAYMENT TERMS DIFFER BY JURISDICTION AND CUSTOMER BUT PAYMENT IS GENERALLY REQUIRED IN A TERM RANGING FROM 30 TO 60 DAYS FROM DATE OF SHIPMENT OR SATISFACTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE DO NOT PROVIDE FINANCING WITH EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS BEYOND GENERALLY STANDARD COMMERCIAL PAYMENT TERMS FOR THE APPLICABLE INDUSTRY.  PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AND EXEMPTIONS  - TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES AND THAT ARE RELATED TO THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM REVENUES.  WE DO NOT DISCLOSE THE VALUE OF UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR (I) CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL EXPECTED LENGTHS OF ONE YEAR OR LESS OR (II) CONTRACTS FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE AMOUNT TO WHICH WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO INVOICE FOR THE SERVICES PERFORMED.  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  - PDA AND SAN PABLO\u2019S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE CHILEAN PESO. OUR BALANCE SHEETS ARE TRANSLATED TO U.S. DOLLARS AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATES AND THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE RESULTING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  INCOME TAXES  - DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE COMPUTED ANNUALLY FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND INCOME TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WILL RESULT IN TAXABLE OR DEDUCTIBLE AMOUNTS IN THE FUTURE. SUCH DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON ENACTED TAX LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE TO PERIODS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT TAXABLE INCOME. A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED, WHEN NECESSARY, TO REDUCE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED.  TAX BENEFITS FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ARE ONLY RECOGNIZED IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  40  FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS  - BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 805, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE ACQUISITION METHOD REQUIRES IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND ANY NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED BE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE ACQUISITION DATE, WHICH IS THE DATE THAT THE ACQUIRER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED AS THE PURCHASE PRICE EXCEEDS THE NET FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. ACQUISITIONS THAT DO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS UNDER THE ASC ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS ASSET ACQUISITIONS. ASSET ACQUISITIONS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BY ALLOCATING THE COST OF THE ACQUISITION TO THE INDIVIDUAL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS. GOODWILL IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN AN ASSET ACQUISITION WITH ANY CONSIDERATION IN EXCESS OF NET ASSETS ACQUIRED ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED ASSETS ON A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE BASIS. TRANSACTION COSTS ARE EXPENSED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION AND ARE CONSIDERED A COMPONENT OF THE COST OF THE ACQUISITION IN AN ASSET ACQUISITION.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  - WE EVALUATE OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING OUR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN  - AS DISCUSSED IN THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE SPONSOR A DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN THAT WAS FROZEN IN JUNE 2004, AND NO FUTURE BENEFITS ACCRUED TO PARTICIPANTS SUBSEQUENT TO THAT TIME. ONGOING ACCOUNTING FOR THIS PLAN UNDER FASB ASC 715 PROVIDES GUIDANCE AS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ESTIMATED PENSION EXPENSE, PENSION LIABILITY AND MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. THIRD-PARTY ACTUARIAL CONSULTANTS PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO US. IN DEVELOPING THIS DATA, CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED, INCLUDING AMONG OTHER THINGS, DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN AND MORTALITY TABLES. DURING 2019, THE SOCIETY OF ACTUARIES (\u201cSOA\u201d) RELEASED A NEW MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE TABLE, REFERRED TO AS MP-2019, WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BETTER REFLECT MORTALITY IMPROVEMENTS AND IS TO BE USED IN CALCULATING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OBLIGATIONS. IN ADDITION, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE TO MEASURE THE PENSION OBLIGATION DECREASED TO 3.0%. WE USED THE LATEST MORTALITY TABLES RELEASED BY THE SOA THROUGH OCTOBER 2019 TO MEASURE OUR PENSION OBLIGATION AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND COMBINED WITH THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC ASSUMPTIONS, OUR PENSION LIABILITY INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 MILLION AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019. FURTHER CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS RECORDED THAT ARE RELATED TO OUR DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN TO REFLECT FUTURE EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD  BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED  ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE  ARE FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING PROPRIETARY ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS  TO THE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES OF PATHOGEN AND HYGIENIC CONTROL. OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS BASED ON PATENTED STABILIZED  IONIC SILVER, AND OUR INITIAL PRODUCTS CONTAIN SILVER DIHYDROGEN CITRATE, OR SDC. SDC IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM, NON-TOXIC ANTIMICROBIAL  AGENT, WHICH OFFERS 24-HOUR RESIDUAL PROTECTION AND FORMULATES WELL WITH OTHER COMPOUNDS. AS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY, WE BELIEVE  SDC IS DISTINGUISHED FROM EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIOR EFFICACY, REDUCED TOXICITY, NON-CAUSTICITY,  AND THE INABILITY OF BACTERIA TO FORM A RESISTANCE TO IT.  WE  BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR SAFE, NON-TOXIC AND EFFECTIVE SDC-BASED SOLUTIONS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER  PURE  \u00ae  HARD SURFACE AS A FOOD CONTACT SURFACE SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT TO RESTAURANT CHAINS, FOOD PROCESSORS,  AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. WE ALSO OFFER PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID. WE RECEIVED  THE REQUIRED FDA APPROVALS TO MARKET PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW POULTRY AND  FRESH PRODUCE IN DECEMBER 2015 AND JANUARY 2016, RESPECTIVELY. BECAUSE ADDITIONAL USDA APPROVAL WAS NOT REQUIRED, WE BEGAN MARKETING  PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR FRESH PRODUCE FOLLOWING OUR RECEIPT OF FDA APPROVAL IN JANUARY 2016.  IN  JULY 2016, WE RECEIVED A \u201cNO OBJECTION LETTER\u201d FROM THE USDA\u2019S FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE (FSIS) GRANTING  APPROVAL FOR SDC-BASED PURE CONTROL TO BE USED AS A SPRAY OR DIP APPLIED TO POULTRY CARCASSES, PARTS AND ORGANS IN PRE-OLR (ON-LINE  REPROCESSING) AND POST CHILL PROCESSING OF FRESH POULTRY. IN JANUARY 2017, WE SUBMITTED AN ADDITIONAL FCN TO THE FDA TO ALLOW  USE OF HIGHER SDC CONCENTRATIONS IN POULTRY PROCESSING, ALLOWING THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADJUST TO VARYING PLANT AND PROCESSING CONDITIONS.  IN MAY 2017, WE RECEIVED A FINAL LETTER FROM THE FDA FOR THIS FCN AS WELL AS A \u201cNO OBJECTION LETTER\u201d FROM THE USDA\u2019S  FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION SERVICE (FSIS) GRANTING APPROVAL FOR THE HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF SDC-BASED PURE CONTROL TO BE USED  AS A SPRAY OR DIP APPLIED TO POULTRY CARCASSES, PARTS AND ORGANS IN PRE-OLR (ON-LINE REPROCESSING) AND POST CHILL PROCESSING OF  FRESH POULTRY. WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON COMPLETING IN-PLANT VALIDATION TRIALS FOR PURE CONTROL IN PRE- AND POST OLR POULTRY  PROCESSING APPLICATIONS, WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 65% TO 75% OF THE TOTAL PROCESSING AID MARKET FOR POULTRY PROCESSING.  WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPTIMIZE THE APPLICATION OF PURE CONTROL IN OLR TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN USDA APPROVAL FOR USE IN THIS STAGE OF  POULTRY PROCESSING.  SUBJECT  TO THE RESULTS OF OUR FOCUSED IN-PLANT VALIDATION EFFORTS FOR OUR APPROVED PRODUCE AND POULTRY SOLUTIONS, WE INTEND TO SEEK APPROVAL  TO UTILIZE PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW MEATS, INCLUDING BEEF AND PORK. IN ADDITION TO OUR DIRECT  SALES EFFORTS WITH PURE HARD SURFACE AND PURE CONTROL, WE MARKET AND SELL OUR SDC-BASED PRODUCTS INDIRECTLY THROUGH THIRD-PARTY  DISTRIBUTORS.  15  BUSINESS  STRATEGY  OUR  GOAL IS TO BECOME A SUSTAINABLE COMPANY BY COMMERCIALIZING THE SDC-BASED PRODUCTS WE HAVE DEVELOPED WITH OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM. WE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING LEADING ANTIMICROBIAL PRODUCTS THAT ADDRESS FOOD SAFETY RISKS ACROSS THE FOOD INDUSTRY  SUPPLY CHAIN. KEY ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY INCLUDE.  \u25cf  EXPANDING  SALES AND DISTRIBUTION FOR OUR PRODUCTS INTO THE FOOD INDUSTRY WITH A FOCUS ON A DUAL TRACK OF FOOD SAFETY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  \u25cf  HARD  SURFACE DISINFECTANT  - COMMERCIALIZING OUR CURRENT EPA REGISTERED PURE HARD SURFACE DISINFECTANT AND SANITIZER FOR  USE IN FOODSERVICE OPERATIONS, FOOD MANUFACTURING AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION.  \u25cf  DIRECT  FOOD CONTACT  - COMMERCIALIZING FDA APPROVED PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR FRESH PRODUCE;  COMMERCIALIZING FDA APPROVED PURE CONTROL AS A FOOD PROCESSING AND INTERVENTION AID FOR FOOD PROCESSORS TREATING RAW POULTRY  IN PRE AND POST OLR APPLICATIONS. WE ARE CONTINUING TO OPTIMIZE THE APPLICATION OF PURE CONTROL IN OLR TO ATTEMPT TO GAIN  USDA APPROVAL FOR USE IN THIS STAGE OF POULTRY PROCESSING. ADDITIONALLY, SUBJECT TO THE RESULTS OF OUR FOCUSED IN-PLANT VALIDATION  EFFORTS FOR OUR APPROVED PRODUCE AND POULTRY SOLUTIONS, WE INTEND TO SEEK APPROVAL TO UTILIZE PURE CONTROL AS A DIRECT FOOD  CONTACT PROCESSING AID FOR RAW MEATS, INCLUDING BEEF AND PORK.  \u25cf  ESTABLISHING  STRATEGIC ALLIANCES TO MAXIMIZE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM;  \u25cf  DEVELOPING  ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS; AND  \u25cf  PROTECTING  AND ENHANCING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  IN  ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS ADDRESSING FOOD SAFETY, WE INTEND TO LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THROUGH LICENSING AND DISTRIBUTION  COLLABORATIONS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND ENTER INTO NEW MARKETS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY GENERATE MULTIPLE SOURCES OF  REVENUE.  FINANCIAL  OVERVIEW  THIS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF OUR REVENUE AND EXPENSES.  REVENUE  WE  CONTRACT MANUFACTURE AND SELL SDC-BASED PRODUCTS FOR END USE, AND AS A RAW MATERIAL FOR MANUFACTURING USE. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT  THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PRIOR  TO SATISFYING REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE RECORDED AS DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD  COST  OF GOODS SOLD FOR PRODUCT SALES INCLUDES DIRECT AND INDIRECT COSTS TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MATERIALS CONSUMED, MANUFACTURING  OVERHEAD, SHIPPING COSTS, SALARIES, BENEFITS, RESERVED INVENTORY, AND RELATED EXPENSES OF OPERATIONS. DEPRECIATION RELATED TO  MANUFACTURING IS SYSTEMATICALLY ALLOCATED TO INVENTORY PRODUCED, AND EXPENSED THROUGH COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME INVENTORY  IS SOLD.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS FOR PERSONNEL IN BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT,  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COSTS, SALES, FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. OTHER SELLING, GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE PRODUCT MARKETING, ADVERTISING, AND TRADE SHOW COSTS, AS WELL AS PUBLIC RELATIONS AND INVESTOR  RELATIONS, FACILITY COSTS, AND LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES.  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT  OUR  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FOCUSED ON LEVERAGING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS  AND APPLICATIONS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL AND RELATED COSTS, PRODUCT REGISTRATION EXPENSES,  AND THIRD-PARTY TESTING. WE EXPENSE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS INCURRED.  16  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  FLUCTUATIONS  IN OPERATING RESULTS  OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE FLUCTUATED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD IN THE PAST AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE  FUTURE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE AFFECTED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BY SEVERAL FACTORS THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE  TO THESE PERIODIC FLUCTUATIONS, INCLUDING THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR PRODUCT SALES, AND THE PROGRESS  AND TIMING OF EXPENDITURES RELATED TO SALES AND MARKETING, AS WELL AS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. DUE TO THESE FLUCTUATIONS, WE BELIEVE  THAT THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT A RELIABLE INDICATION OF OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  COMPARISON  OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019  NET  PRODUCT SALES  NET  PRODUCT SALES WERE $349,000 AND $394,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $45,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, TWO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 14% AND 10% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES. ALL OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES WERE U.S. BASED  SALES.

THE DECREASE OF $368,000 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS  AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS AND CONSULTANTS SUPPORTING OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  FUNCTIONS.  17  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $60,000 AND $67,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE  OF $7,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON RESEARCH SUPPORTING OUR FDA APPROVALS.

THE DECREASE OF $237,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS, AND A REDUCTION IN SALES OF OUR RAW MATERIAL  INGREDIENT,  SILVE\u0301RION  \u00ae.  FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, TWO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 17% AND 10% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES, RESPECTIVELY.  NO OTHER INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OR MORE OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES. ALL OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES WERE U.S. BASED  SALES.  FOR  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, TWO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 16% AND 12% OF OUR NET PRODUCT SALES, RESPECTIVELY.

THE DECREASE OF $65,000  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PRODUCT SALES.  GROSS  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET PRODUCT SALES, OR GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, WAS 60% AND 63% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALE OF LOWER MARGIN FORMULATIONS  AND PACKAGING CONFIGURATIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR PERIOD.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS $2,100,000 AND $4,312,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE OF $2,212,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED PERSONNEL COSTS, AS WELL AS, DECREASED BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT,  MARKETING, BOARD FEES AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE, WAS $547,000 AND $2,201,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE OF $1,654,000 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PRIOR YEAR ACCELERATED VESTING  OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HELD BY DAVE PFANZELTER, THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD  (SEE  NOTE 6  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q  ).  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $142,000 AND $164,000 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE  OF $22,000 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON RESEARCH SUPPORTING OUR FDA APPROVALS.  18  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION  OF ASSETS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. AS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $1,791,000  AND USED CASH IN OPERATIONS OF $958,000. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN  WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEING ISSUED. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT  UPON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS PLAN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO  NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. IN ADDITION, OUR INDEPENDENT  REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S JULY 31, 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, HAS RAISED SUBSTANTIAL  DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  SINCE  OUR INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF SECURITIES, DEBT FINANCING, AND  REVENUE FROM PRODUCT SALES AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF RECURRING LOSSES, AND AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 WE HAVE INCURRED  A CUMULATIVE NET LOSS OF $125,269,000.  AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $321,000 IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED WITH $473,000 IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF JULY  31, 2019. THE NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FUNDS USED TO RUN OUR OPERATIONS OFFSET  BY THE OCTOBER 2019 PRIVATE PLACEMENT FINANCING. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, WE HAD $672,000 OF CURRENT LIABILITIES,  INCLUDING $569,000 IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, COMPARED WITH $738,000 OF CURRENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING $553,000 IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  AS OF JULY 31, 2019. THE NET DECREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN WAGE ACCRUALS.  IN  ADDITION, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH OUR EXECUTIVES THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CASES, PROVIDE  FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SALARY AND CERTAIN OTHER BENEFITS IF THESE EXECUTIVES ARE TERMINATED UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES. THESE  AGREEMENTS GENERALLY EXPIRE UPON TERMINATION FOR CAUSE OR WHEN WE HAVE MET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS. AS OF JANUARY  31, 2020, NO EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED RESULTING IN THE OBLIGATION OF ANY SUCH PAYMENTS.  OUR  FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FORWARD-LOOKING FACTORS. THESE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE  FOLLOWING: THE ACCEPTANCE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, OUR PRODUCTS; OUR SUCCESS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PARTNERS IN SELLING OUR PRODUCTS;  OUR SUCCESS AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR PARTNERS IN OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVALS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS; THE COSTS OF FURTHER DEVELOPING  OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES; THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE INVEST IN NEW PRODUCT AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT; AND THE COSTS  ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONTINUED OPERATION, AND ANY FUTURE GROWTH, OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AND OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING  FACTORS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  UNTIL  WE CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS OF OFFERINGS  OF OUR EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR THAT,  IF AVAILABLE, FINANCING WILL BE OBTAINED ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE  ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WOULD LIKELY RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS  BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC  FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. FURTHER, ANY CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS WE ENTER  INTO TO RAISE FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH OUR RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL  BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY  REQUIRE US TO DELAY OR SCALE BACK OUR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER.  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY UNUSED CREDIT FACILITIES OR OTHER SOURCES OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE TO US AT THIS TIME. WE INTEND TO SECURE ADDITIONAL  WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH SALES OF ADDITIONAL DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES. OUR INTENDED FINANCING INITIATIVES ARE SUBJECT TO RISK,  AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OR TERMS OF THESE OR ANY FUTURE FINANCINGS.  19  IF  WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT CAPITAL, IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS. IT COULD CAUSE  US TO FAIL TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN, FAIL TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES, OR FAIL TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES  OR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IT ALSO MAY REQUIRE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY MODIFY OUR BUSINESS MODEL AND OPERATIONS TO REDUCE SPENDING  TO A SUSTAINABLE LEVEL, WHICH MAY INCLUDE DELAYING, SCALING BACK OR ELIMINATING SOME OR ALL OF OUR ONGOING AND PLANNED INVESTMENTS  IN CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, AND  SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, AMONG OTHER INVESTMENTS. IF ADEQUATE FUNDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO  REDUCE OR CEASE OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER.  SUBSEQUENT  TO JANUARY 31, 2020, WE ISSUED A TOTAL OF 6,896,551 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $2.0M  (SEE  NOTE 8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q  ).  WE BELIEVE OUR AVAILABLE CASH, OUR CURRENT EFFORTS TO MARKET AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE EXPENSES,  WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CASH RESOURCES TO SATISFY OUR NEEDS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET HAVE, AND WE MAY NEVER  HAVE, SIGNIFICANT CASH INFLOWS FROM PRODUCT SALES OR FROM OTHER SOURCES OF REVENUE TO OFFSET OUR ONGOING AND PLANNED INVESTMENTS  IN, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND SALES AND MARKETING, AMONG  OTHER INVESTMENTS. SOME OR ALL OF OUR ONGOING OR PLANNED INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION, IRRESPECTIVE OF OUR CASH  RESOURCES, WE MAY BE CONTRACTUALLY OR LEGALLY OBLIGATED TO MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS WHICH CANNOT BE POSTPONED.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, OR GAAP.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF  ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH  FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER  SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  IN  ADDITION, THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED AND PRESENTED ON  A BASIS ASSUMING WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. UNTIL WE CAN GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CASH FROM OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE  TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS WITH THE PROCEEDS OF OFFERINGS OF OUR EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES. HOWEVER, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT ADDITIONAL  FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED OR THAT, IF AVAILABLE, FINANCING WILL BE OBTAINED ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS WOULD LIKELY  RESULT. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS  AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS. FURTHER, ANY CONTRACTS  OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS WE ENTER INTO TO RAISE FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH OUR RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCTS OR TECHNOLOGY, AND  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH CONTRACTS OR LICENSE ARRANGEMENTS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT  ALL. HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO DELAY OR SCALE BACK OUR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES  OR CEASE OUR OPERATIONS ALTOGETHER. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO RECOVERABILITY OR CLASSIFICATION  OF RECORDED ASSETS AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED LIABILITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CRITICAL TO AID YOU IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL  RESULTS.  20  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d),  TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (\u201cTOPIC 606\u201d). UNDER TOPIC 606, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT AN AMOUNT  THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING GOODS OR SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER.  THIS PRINCIPLE IS APPLIED USING THE FOLLOWING 5-STEP PROCESS.  1.  IDENTIFY  THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER  2.  IDENTIFY  THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  3.  DETERMINE  THE TRANSACTION PRICE  4.  ALLOCATE  THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT  5.  RECOGNIZE  REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED  UNDER  TOPIC 606, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES  TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  OUR  TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IS BASED ON PATENTED STABILIZED IONIC SILVER, AND OUR INITIAL PRODUCTS CONTAIN SILVER DIHYDROGEN CITRATE,  OR SDC. SDC IS A BROAD-SPECTRUM, NON-TOXIC ANTIMICROBIAL AGENT, WHICH OFFERS 24-HOUR RESIDUAL PROTECTION AND FORMULATES WELL WITH  OTHER COMPOUNDS. WE SELL VARIOUS CONFIGURATIONS AND DILUTIONS OF SDC DIRECT TO CUSTOMERS AND THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS. WE CURRENTLY  OFFER PURE  \u00ae  HARD SURFACE AS A FOOD CONTACT SURFACE SANITIZER AND DISINFECTANT TO RESTAURANT CHAINS, FOOD PROCESSORS  AND FOOD TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES. WE ALSO OFFER PURE CONTROL  \u00ae  AS A DIRECT FOOD CONTACT PROCESSING AID.  CONTRACT  TERMS FOR UNIT PRICE, QUANTITY, SHIPPING AND PAYMENT ARE GOVERNED BY SALES AGREEMENTS AND PURCHASE ORDERS WHICH WE CONSIDER TO  BE A CUSTOMER\u2019S CONTRACT IN ALL CASES. THE UNIT PRICE IS CONSIDERED THE OBSERVABLE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE FOR THE ARRANGEMENTS.  ANY PROMOTIONAL OR SALES DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED EVENLY TO THE UNITS SOLD FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING STANDALONE SELLING PRICE.  PRODUCT  SALES GENERALLY CONSIST OF A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION THAT WE SATISFY AT A POINT IN TIME. WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUE WHEN  THE FOLLOWING EVENTS HAVE OCCURRED: (A) WE HAVE TRANSFERRED PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE PRODUCTS, (B) WE HAVE A PRESENT RIGHT TO  PAYMENT, (C) THE CUSTOMER HAS LEGAL TITLE TO THE PRODUCTS, AND (D) THE CUSTOMER BEARS SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP  OF THE PRODUCTS.  OUR  DIRECT CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTER SALES ARE INVOICED BASED ON RECEIVED PURCHASE ORDERS. OUR PAYMENT TERMS ON INVOICED DIRECT CUSTOMER  AND DISTRIBUTOR SALES RANGE BETWEEN 30 AND 90 DAYS AFTER WE SATISFY OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS  ARE ON 30 DAY PAYMENT TERMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NO RIGHT OF RETURN ON INVOICED SALES AND MAINTAIN NO ALLOWANCE FOR SALES RETURNS.  SHIPPING  AND HANDLING ARE TREATED AS ACTIVITIES TO FULFILL PROMISES TO CUSTOMERS AND ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO A CUSTOMER, IF APPLICABLE, REPRESENT  REVENUES EARNED FOR THE GOODS PROVIDED. COSTS RELATED TO SUCH SHIPPING AND HANDLING BILLINGS ARE CLASSIFIED AS COST OF SALES.  WE  DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT CATEGORIES OF REVENUE THAT MAY IMPACT HOW THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH  FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC FACTORS.  VARIABLE  CONSIDERATION  WE  RECORD REVENUE FROM CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE TRANSACTION PRICE WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO AFTER TRANSFERRING  CONTROL OF THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE OFFER SALES PROMOTIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS DISCOUNTS. VARIABLE CONSIDERATION  IS ESTIMATED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION ONLY TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF REVENUE WILL NOT OCCUR.  21  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION  WE  GRANT EQUITY-BASED AWARDS UNDER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS OR STAND-ALONE CONTRACTS. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT AWARDS USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL. THIS FAIR VALUE IS THEN AMORTIZED OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIODS  OF THE AWARDS. THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL REQUIRES THE INPUT OF SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING PRICE VOLATILITY  OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND EXPECTED LIFE OF THE OPTION. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE  IS BASED ON AWARDS ULTIMATELY EXPECTED TO VEST, AND THEREFORE IS REDUCED BY EXPECTED FORFEITURES. CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS USED  UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR NET LOSS AND NET LOSS PER SHARE.  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  IN  ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, IF INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXIST, WE ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE AFFECTED LONG-LIVED ASSETS BY DETERMINING  WHETHER THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS CAN BE RECOVERED THROUGH UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. IF IMPAIRMENT IS  INDICATED, WE MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET  AND WE RECORD THE IMPAIRMENT AS A REDUCTION IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET AND A CHARGE TO OPERATING RESULTS. ESTIMATING  THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-LIVED ASSETS REQUIRES JUDGMENT, AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY  FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, NO IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS WAS INDICATED  OR RECORDED.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE ANY ADDITIONAL SALES OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES OR ARRANGE FOR DEBT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND PLANNED ACQUISITIONS AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  18  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN THE NOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN GENERAL, MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ON INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTY PROFESSIONALS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED ALL NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE IN EFFECT.

OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS.  UTILIZING OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM (THE \"PLATFORM\"), A COMPREHENSIVE BANK OF UNIQUE, WELL CHRACTERIZED PDX MODELS, WE PROVIDE SELECT SERVICES TO PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING PERSONALIZED APPROACHES TO DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY PERFORMING STUDIES TO PREDICT THE EFFICACY OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS, OUR PLATFORM FACILITATES DRUG DISCOVERY WITH LOWER COSTS AND INCREASED SPEED OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS INCREASED ADOPTION OF EXISTING DRUGS.  OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES A NOVEL APPROACH TO SIMULATING THE RESULTS OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS USED IN DEVELOPING ONCOLOGY DRUGS. IT CAN COST UP TO $100,000 PER PATIENT IN ONCOLOGY CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE TYPICAL COST FOR EACH PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR INCREASES FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION IN THE PRE-CLINICAL SETTING TO APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN PHASE III. SIMULATING TRIALS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND PATIENTS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CAN LOWER THE RISK OF SPENDING RESOURCES ON DRUGS THAT DO NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PATH THEY PURSUE WILL BE FOCUSED ON AN APPROPRIATE PATIENT POPULATION AND A SUCCESSFUL COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR TOS PROGRAM. OUR POS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE THE FOCUS OF OUR GROWTH MOVING FORWARD.  IN DECEMBER 2019, A NOVEL STRAIN OF CORONAVIRUS WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN WUHAN, HUBEI PROVINCE, CHINA. ANY OUTBREAK OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES, OR OTHER ADVERSE PUBLIC HEALTH DEVELOPMENTS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS  19  OPERATIONS. THESE COULD INCLUDE DISRUPTIONS OR RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL, PURSUE PARTNERSHIPS AND OTHER BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, RECEIVE SHIPMENTS OF BIOLOGIC MATERIALS, AS WELL AS BE IMPACTED BY THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE FACILITIES OF SUPPLIERS. WE ARE ACTIVELY MONITORING THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND OPERATIONS. WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE VIRUS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS AT THIS TIME, WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT THE CORONAVIRUS WILL HAVE DUE TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE ULTIMATE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, THE DURATION OF THE OUTBREAK, AND ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS HAVE TYPICALLY ARISEN FROM THE FUNDING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE MET THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CASH, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF OUR SECURITIES, AND SALES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE COMPANY HAD NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY  $72,000  AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF  $360,000  . AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , THE COMPANY HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $70.6 MILLION  , A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF  $0.3 MILLION  AND CASH OF  $3.3 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH ON HAND, TOGETHER WITH EXPECTED POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM THE FILING OF THIS 10-Q. HOWEVER, SHOULD OUR REVENUE EXPECTATIONS NOT MATERIALIZE, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE COST REDUCTION STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED WITHOUT DISRUPTING THE BUSINESS OR RESTRUCTURING THE COMPANY. SHOULD THE COMPANY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUCH CAPITAL ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO INCREASED SALES, BOTH IN NUMBER AND SIZE OF STUDIES, AND CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  ADDITIONALLY, CUSTOMERS ARE SEEKING MORE COMPLEX STUDY DESIGNS AND END POINT ANALYSIS TESTING, LEADING TO LARGER CONTRACTS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO REVENUE GROWTH.  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $4.3 MILLION  AND  $3.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $900,000  OR  26.1%  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  52.0%  AND  46.7%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND SUPPLY EXPENSES. THE OVERALL EXPENSE INCREASE IS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH THE EXPECTED CONTRIBUTION BASED ON THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND STUDY VOLUME. COST OF ONCOLOGY SOLUTIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $12.0 MILLION  AND  $10.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $2.0 MILLION  OR  20.0%  .  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  48.8%  AND  48.5%  , RESPECTIVELY. GROSS MARGIN VARIES BASED ON TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPENSE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AND WAS IMPACTED BY THE INCREASE IN COSTS ON GROWING STUDY VOLUME IN ADVANCE OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE INCREASE IN COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND SUPPLY EXPENSES RELATED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND STUDY VOLUME.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.4 MILLION  AND  $1.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.   RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $4.0 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $485,000  OR  13.7%  . THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO INCREASED COMPENSATION AND LAB SUPPLY EXPENSE AS WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO OFFER NEW PDX MODELS, EX-VIVO ASSAYS AND TO EXPAND OUR ENDPOINT ANALYSIS TESTING.  SALES AND MARKETING  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.3 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  48.7%  . SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $3.2 MILLION  AND  $2.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $1.0 MILLION  OR  47.6%  . THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS IS MAINLY DUE TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE DRIVEN BY THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR SALES FORCE AND COMMISSIONS EARNED.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE  $1.6 MILLION  AND  $1.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $400,000  , OR  27.2%  . THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES AS WELL AS A NON-RECURRING BAD DEBT WRITE-OFF. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 WERE  $4.1 MILLION  AND  $3.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $807,000  OR  24.4%  . THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION, PROFESSIONAL FEES, AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN RECRUITING COSTS.  INFLATION  INFLATION DOES NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  21  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $360,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.6 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE OPERATING LOSS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED JULY 31, 2019, AND, A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS DUE TO TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $334,000 AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF APPROXIMATELY $913,000.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.7 MILLION  AND  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF LAB EQUIPMENT REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANY'S NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $378,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.4 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS DUE TO A DECREASE IN OPTION AND WARRANT EXERCISES DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD.

WE BEGAN OPERATIONS IN 1979 AND AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OPERATED 5,815 STORES IN THE U.S., 608 STORES IN MEXICO AND 38 STORES IN BRAZIL. EACH STORE CARRIES AN EXTENSIVE PRODUCT LINE FOR CARS, SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES, VANS AND LIGHT TRUCKS, INCLUDING NEW AND REMANUFACTURED AUTOMOTIVE HARD PARTS, MAINTENANCE ITEMS, ACCESSORIES AND  NON-AUTOMOTIVE  PRODUCTS. AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, IN 4,942 OF OUR DOMESTIC STORES, WE ALSO HAD A COMMERCIAL SALES PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES COMMERCIAL CREDIT AND PROMPT DELIVERY OF PARTS AND OTHER PRODUCTS TO LOCAL, REGIONAL AND NATIONAL REPAIR GARAGES, DEALERS, SERVICE STATIONS AND PUBLIC SECTOR ACCOUNTS. WE ALSO HAVE COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS IN STORES IN MEXICO AND BRAZIL. WE ALSO SELL THE ALLDATA BRAND AUTOMOTIVE DIAGNOSTIC AND REPAIR SOFTWARE THROUGH WWW.ALLDATA.COM AND WWW.ALLDATADIY.COM. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL AUTOMOTIVE HARD PARTS, MAINTENANCE ITEMS, ACCESSORIES AND  NON-AUTOMOTIVE  PRODUCTS THROUGH WWW.AUTOZONE.COM AND OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS CAN MAKE PURCHASES THROUGH WWW.AUTOZONEPRO.COM. WE ALSO PROVIDE PRODUCT INFORMATION ON OUR DURALAST BRANDED PRODUCTS THROUGH WWW.DURALASTPARTS.COM. WE DO NOT DERIVE REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR OR INSTALLATION SERVICES.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE TWELVE AND TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE EXPECTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AUGUST 29, 2020. EACH OF THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR CONSISTS OF 12 WEEKS, AND THE FOURTH QUARTER CONSISTS OF 16 OR 17 WEEKS. THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 HAS 16 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2019 HAD 17 WEEKS. OUR BUSINESS IS SOMEWHAT SEASONAL IN NATURE, WITH THE HIGHEST SALES GENERALLY OCCURRING DURING THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER AND THE LOWEST SALES GENERALLY OCCURRING IN THE MONTHS OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  NET SALES WERE UP 2.6% FOR THE QUARTER DRIVEN BY NEW STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES (SALES FROM STORES OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR) OF (0.8%). DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED 8.2%, WHICH REPRESENTS 22% OF OUR TOTAL SALES. OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED 2.0% TO $407.9 MILLION, WHILE NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED 1.6% OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR TO $299.3 MILLION. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 7.8% TO $12.39 PER SHARE FROM $11.49 PER SHARE IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  OUR BUSINESS IS IMPACTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS WITHIN THE ECONOMY THAT AFFECT BOTH OUR CONSUMER AND OUR INDUSTRY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FUEL COSTS, WAGE RATES AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. GIVEN THE NATURE OF THESE MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR FOR HOW LONG CERTAIN TRENDS WILL CONTINUE, NOR CAN WE PREDICT TO WHAT DEGREE THESE TRENDS WILL IMPACT US IN THE FUTURE.  ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT OUTBREAK OF A NOVEL STRAIN OF THE CORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), WHICH ORIGINATED IN CHINA AND HAS SPREAD GLOBALLY, HAS LED TO ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE NATIONAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE CREATED CONTINGENCY PLANS FOR THOSE MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES BELIEVED TO BE AT RISK, INCLUDING THOSE SOURCED FROM CHINA AND ELSEWHERE, AND CONTINUE TO REVIEW AND UPDATE OUR PLANS AS CIRCUMSTANCES EVOLVE. WHILE WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS THUS FAR FROM THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE IMPACT THAT COVID-19 WILL HAVE DUE TO NUMEROUS UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE, THE DURATION OF THE OUTBREAK, ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES AND OTHER UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDINGLY, CONTINUED BUSINESS DISRUPTION RELATING TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, OUR STORE HOURS AND OUR WORKFORCE AVAILABILITY AND MAY ALSO MAGNIFY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH SOURCING QUALITY MERCHANDISE DOMESTICALLY AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. AT FAVORABLE PRICES, ALL OF WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, FAILURE AND MAINTENANCE RELATED CATEGORIES REPRESENTED THE LARGEST PORTION OF OUR SALES MIX, AT APPROXIMATELY 85% OF TOTAL SALES WITH DISCRETIONARY MAKING UP THE REMAINING, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WITH FAILURE RELATED CATEGORIES CONTINUING TO BE THE LARGEST PORTION OF OUR SALES MIX. WE DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY FUNDAMENTAL SHIFTS IN OUR CATEGORY SALES MIX AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR. OUR SALES MIX CAN BE IMPACTED BY SEVERE OR UNUSUAL WEATHER OVER A SHORT-TERM PERIOD. OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF THE WEATHER ON OUR SALES MIX IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  THE TWO STATISTICS WE BELIEVE HAVE THE MOST POSITIVE CORRELATION TO OUR MARKET GROWTH OVER THE LONG-TERM ARE MILES DRIVEN AND THE NUMBER OF SEVEN YEAR OLD OR OLDER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. WHILE OVER THE LONG-TERM WE HAVE SEEN A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN OUR NET SALES AND THE NUMBER OF MILES DRIVEN, WE HAVE ALSO SEEN TIME FRAMES OF MINIMAL CORRELATION IN SALES PERFORMANCE AND MILES DRIVEN. DURING THE PERIODS OF MINIMAL CORRELATION BETWEEN NET SALES AND MILES DRIVEN, WE BELIEVE NET SALES HAVE BEEN POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF SEVEN YEAR OLD OR OLDER VEHICLES ON THE ROAD. THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE U.S. LIGHT VEHICLE FLEET CONTINUES TO TREND IN OUR INDUSTRY\u2019S FAVOR. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AUTO CARE ASSOCIATION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019, FOR THE 8  TH  CONSECUTIVE YEAR, THE AVERAGE AGE OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD HAS EXCEEDED 11 YEARS. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND THROUGH NOVEMBER 2019 (LATEST PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION), MILES DRIVEN IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN ESSENTIALLY FLAT.  TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020  COMPARED WITH TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019  NET SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED $63.1 MILLION TO $2.514 BILLION, OR 2.6%, OVER NET SALES OF $2.451 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL AUTO PARTS SALES INCREASED BY 2.6%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET SALES OF $56.5 MILLION FROM NEW STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES OF (0.8%). DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED $42.3 MILLION, OR 8.2%, TO $556.9 MILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $1.366 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.325 BILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. GROSS PROFIT, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS 54.3% COMPARED TO 54.1% DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLY CHAIN LEVERAGE.  OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $958.1 MILLION, OR 38.1% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $925.1 MILLION, OR 37.7% OF NET SALES DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, WERE HIGHER THAN LAST YEAR WITH DELEVERAGE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOMESTIC STORE PAYROLL.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $44.3 MILLION COMPARED WITH $41.4 MILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE BORROWING LEVELS OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. AVERAGE BORROWINGS FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $5.464 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.119 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATES WERE 3.0% FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND 3.1% FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 17.7% OF PRETAX INCOME FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, AND 17.8% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET INCOME FOR THE TWELVE WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED BY $4.6 MILLION TO $299.3 MILLION DUE TO THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY 7.8% TO $12.39 FROM $11.49 IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON CURRENT QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM STOCK REPURCHASES SINCE THE END OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS AN INCREASE OF $0.55.  TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020  COMPARED WITH TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 9, 2019  NET SALES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED $214.4 MILLION TO $5.307 BILLION, OR 4.2%, OVER NET SALES OF $5.092 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL AUTO PARTS SALES INCREASED BY 4.2%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET SALES OF $106.6 MILLION FROM NEW STORES AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC SAME STORE SALES OF 1.4%. DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL SALES INCREASED $116.9 MILLION, OR 11.0%, TO $1.178 BILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $2.867 BILLION, OR 54.0% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $2.743 BILLION, OR 53.9% OF NET SALES, DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLY CHAIN LEVERAGE.  OPERATING, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $1.959 BILLION, OR 36.9% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $1.855 BILLION, OR 36.4% OF NET SALES. DELEVERAGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DOMESTIC STORE PAYROLL.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $88.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $80.4 MILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE BORROWING LEVELS OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. AVERAGE BORROWINGS FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $5.327 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $5.045 BILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATES WERE 3.1% FOR EACH OF THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 20.8% OF PRETAX INCOME FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, AND 20.0% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE BENEFIT OF STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WAS $16.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $25.2 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET INCOME FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 INCREASED BY $3.6 MILLION TO $649.6 MILLION DUE TO THE FACTORS SET FORTH ABOVE, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED BY 6.9% TO $26.70 FROM $24.97 IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPACT ON CURRENT QUARTER DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM STOCK REPURCHASES SINCE THE END OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS AN INCREASE OF $1.09.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS OUR CASH FLOWS REALIZED THROUGH THE SALE OF AUTOMOTIVE PARTS, PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $651.6 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $817.1 MILLION PROVIDED DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  OUR NET CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $174.9 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $176.2 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $190.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $195.8 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE OPENED 50 NET NEW STORES. IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WE OPENED 39 NET NEW STORES. INVESTING CASH FLOWS WERE IMPACTED BY OUR WHOLLY OWNED CAPTIVE, WHICH PURCHASED $56.3 MILLION AND SOLD $70.8 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020. DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, THE CAPTIVE PURCHASED $21.1 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND SOLD $34.5 MILLION IN MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES.  OUR NET CASH FLOWS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020 WERE $502.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $661.5 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY RESULTED IN $242.7 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER, AS COMPARED TO $103.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. STOCK REPURCHASES WERE $764.8 MILLION IN THE CURRENT TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD AS COMPARED WITH $847.1 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FOR THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS PROVIDED $48.7 MILLION. IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS PROVIDED $107.6 MILLION.  DURING FISCAL 2020, WE EXPECT TO INCREASE THE INVESTMENT IN OUR BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019. OUR INVESTMENTS CONTINUE TO BE DIRECTED PRIMARILY TO NEW STORES, SUPPLY CHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING STORES. THE AMOUNT OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN OUR NEW STORES IS IMPACTED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS, INCLUDING SUCH FACTORS AS WHETHER THE BUILDING AND LAND ARE PURCHASED (REQUIRING HIGHER INVESTMENT) OR LEASED (GENERALLY LOWER INVESTMENT), LOCATED IN THE U.S., MEXICO OR BRAZIL, OR LOCATED IN URBAN OR RURAL AREAS.  IN ADDITION TO THE BUILDING AND LAND COSTS, OUR NEW STORES REQUIRE WORKING CAPITAL, PREDOMINANTLY FOR INVENTORIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NEGOTIATED EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM SUPPLIERS, REDUCING THE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIRED AND RESULTING IN A HIGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO INVENTORY RATIO. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE LEVERAGING OUR INVENTORY PURCHASES; HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO DO SO MAY BE LIMITED BY OUR VENDORS\u2019 CAPACITY TO FACTOR THEIR RECEIVABLES FROM US. CERTAIN VENDORS PARTICIPATE IN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHEREBY THEY FACTOR THEIR RECEIVABLES FROM US, ALLOWING THEM TO RECEIVE PAYMENT ON OUR INVOICES AT A DISCOUNTED RATE. EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM OUR VENDORS HAVE ALLOWED US TO CONTINUE OUR HIGH ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO INVENTORY RATIO. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS INVENTORY, WAS 105.7% AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, COMPARED TO 108.5% AT FEBRUARY 9, 2019.  DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENTS (EITHER IN THE FORM OF LEASED OR PURCHASED PROPERTIES OR ACQUISITIONS), WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL RELY PRIMARILY ON INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY TO SUPPORT A MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND STOCK REPURCHASES. THE BALANCE MAY BE FUNDED THROUGH NEW BORROWINGS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS AND FAVORABLE EXPERIENCES IN THE DEBT MARKETS IN THE PAST.  FOR THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020, OUR ADJUSTED  AFTER-TAX  RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (\u201cROIC\u201d) WAS 35.3% AS COMPARED TO 33.5% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE USE ADJUSTED ROIC TO EVALUATE WHETHER WE ARE EFFECTIVELY USING OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR OVERALL OPERATING PERFORMANCE. REFER TO THE \u201cRECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF OUR CALCULATION.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT FACILITIES  WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER EXTENSION, NEW COMMITMENT AND AMENDMENT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 18, 2017 (THE \u201cEXTENSION AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 18, 2016, AS AMENDED, MODIFIED, EXTENDED OR RESTATED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT: (I) OUR BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS INCREASED FROM $1.6 BILLION TO $2.0 BILLION; (II) OUR OPTION TO INCREASE THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS \u201cREFRESHED\u201d AND THE AMOUNT OF SUCH OPTION REMAINED AT $400 MILLION; (III) THE MAXIMUM BORROWING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT MAY, AT OUR OPTION, SUBJECT TO LENDERS APPROVAL, BE INCREASED FROM $2.0 BILLION TO $2.4 BILLION; (IV) THE TERMINATION DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS EXTENDED FROM NOVEMBER 18, 2021 UNTIL NOVEMBER 18, 2022; AND (V) WE HAVE THE OPTION TO MAKE ONE ADDITIONAL WRITTEN REQUEST OF THE LENDERS TO EXTEND THE TERMINATION DATE THEN IN EFFECT FOR AN ADDITIONAL YEAR. UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE MAY BORROW FUNDS CONSISTING OF EURODOLLAR LOANS, BASE RATE LOANS OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. INTEREST ACCRUES ON EURODOLLAR LOANS AT A DEFINED EURODOLLAR RATE, DEFINED AS LIBOR PLUS THE APPLICABLE PERCENTAGE, AS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT, DEPENDING UPON OUR SENIOR, UNSECURED,  (NON-CREDIT  ENHANCED) LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS. INTEREST ACCRUES ON BASE RATE LOANS AS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $3.2 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE ALSO MAINTAIN A LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO REQUEST THE PARTICIPATING BANK TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT ON OUR BEHALF UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $25 MILLION. THE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY IS IN ADDITION TO THE LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT MAY BE ISSUED UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $25.0 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LETTER OF CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES IN JUNE 2022.  IN ADDITION TO THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER THE COMMITTED FACILITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE HAD $219.4 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020. THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT HAVE VARIOUS MATURITY DATES AND WERE ISSUED ON AN UNCOMMITTED BASIS.  ALL SENIOR NOTES ARE SUBJECT TO AN INTEREST RATE ADJUSTMENT IF THE DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED TO THE SENIOR NOTES ARE DOWNGRADED (AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS). FURTHER, THE SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION THAT REPAYMENT OF THE SENIOR NOTES MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE EXPERIENCE A CHANGE IN CONTROL (AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENTS). OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN MINIMAL COVENANTS, PRIMARILY RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS. UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, COVENANTS INCLUDE RESTRICTIONS ON LIENS, A MAXIMUM DEBT TO EARNINGS RATIO, A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND A CHANGE OF CONTROL PROVISION THAT MAY REQUIRE ACCELERATION OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS MAY BE ACCELERATED AND COME DUE PRIOR TO THE APPLICABLE SCHEDULED PAYMENT DATE IF COVENANTS ARE BREACHED OR AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OCCURS. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, THE $1.273 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND THE $500 MILLION 4.000% SENIOR NOTES DUE NOVEMBER 2020 WERE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS WE HAD THE ABILITY AND INTENT TO REFINANCE THEM ON A LONG-TERM BASIS THROUGH AVAILABLE CAPACITY IN OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $1.997 BILLION OF AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR $2.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO REPLACE THESE SHORT-TERM OBLIGATIONS WITH LONG-TERM FINANCING FACILITIES.  OUR ADJUSTED DEBT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND RENT (\u201cEBITDAR\u201d) RATIO WAS 2.6:1 AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020 AND WAS 2.5:1 AS OF FEBRUARY 9, 2019. WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED DEBT AS THE SUM OF TOTAL DEBT, FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES AND RENT TIMES SIX; AND WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDAR BY ADDING INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, RENT, SHARE-BASED EXPENSE AND PENSION TERMINATION CHARGES TO NET INCOME. ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IS CALCULATED ON A TRAILING FOUR QUARTER BASIS. WE TARGET OUR DEBT LEVELS TO A RATIO OF ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN OUR INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR DEBT LEVELS. TO THE EXTENT EBITDAR CONTINUES TO GROW IN FUTURE YEARS, WE EXPECT OUR DEBT LEVELS TO INCREASE; CONVERSELY, IF EBITDAR DECLINES, WE WOULD EXPECT OUR DEBT LEVELS TO DECREASE. REFER TO THE \u201cRECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d SECTION FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF OUR CALCULATION.  STOCK REPURCHASES  FROM JANUARY 1, 1998 TO FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAVE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 147.5 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $22.188 BILLION, INCLUDING 669,967 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $764.8 MILLION DURING THE TWENTY-FOUR WEEK PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 15, 2020. ON OCTOBER 7, 2019, THE BOARD VOTED TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZATION BY $1.25 BILLION. THIS RAISED THE TOTAL VALUE OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE REPURCHASED TO $23.15 BILLION. CONSIDERING CUMULATIVE REPURCHASES AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAD $961.9 MILLION REMAINING UNDER THE BOARD\u2019S AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK.  SUBSEQUENT TO FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WE HAVE REPURCHASED 156,035 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF $166.1 MILLION.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  SINCE OUR FISCAL YEAR END, WE HAVE CANCELLED, ISSUED AND MODIFIED  STAND-BY  LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT ARE PRIMARILY RENEWED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO COVER DEDUCTIBLE PAYMENTS TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR TOTAL  STAND-BY  LETTERS OF CREDIT COMMITMENT AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WAS $247.6 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $101.2 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019, AND OUR TOTAL SURETY BONDS COMMITMENT AT FEBRUARY 15, 2020, WAS $42.2 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $36.7 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019.  FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 15, 2020, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  RECONCILIATION OF  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES NOT DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THESE  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR DETERMINING OUR OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND ARE USED TO ASSIST MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING PERFORMANCE AND IN MAKING APPROPRIATE BUSINESS DECISIONS TO MAXIMIZE STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 VALUE.

HOWEVER, WE HAVE PRESENTED  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, AS WE BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS. FURTHERMORE, OUR MANAGEMENT AND THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD USE THE ABOVE MENTIONED  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES TO ANALYZE AND COMPARE OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS AND TO DETERMINE PAYMENTS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.

FOR A DISCUSSION OF RISKS AND ACTIONS TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, SEE \u201c  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND COULD IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC (COVID-19).  \u201d UNDER ITEM 1A, \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d MANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS IDENTIFIED BELOW ARE, AND WILL BE, AMPLIFIED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC (COVID-19).  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND COULD IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC (COVID-19).  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VOLATILE, NEGATIVE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONDITIONS ON OUR CLIENTS\u2019 BUSINESSES AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON GENERATING AND MAINTAINING ONGOING, PROFITABLE CLIENT DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADAPTATION AND EXPANSION OF OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ONGOING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SUCH DEMAND OR AN INABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CLIENT DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONALS WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS, OUR BUSINESS, THE UTILIZATION RATE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  WE COULD FACE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT CLIENT AND/OR ACCENTURE DATA FROM SECURITY BREACHES OR CYBERATTACKS.  \u2022  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR LEVEL OF TAXES, AS WELL AS AUDITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND TAX PROCEEDINGS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR PROFITABILITY COULD MATERIALLY SUFFER IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, IF OUR COST-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR IF WE EXPERIENCE DELIVERY INEFFICIENCIES.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS AND OUR GROWTH STRATEGY TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND IN OUR KEY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, WE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN RISKS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE INCUR LEGAL LIABILITY.  \u2022  OUR WORK WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SIZE, WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEES MAY DEPEND ON OUR REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIANCE PARTNERS OR IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE AND ESTABLISH NEW ALLIANCES IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  WE MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AT ACQUIRING, INVESTING IN OR INTEGRATING BUSINESSES, ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES OR DIVESTING BUSINESSES.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR IF OUR SERVICES OR SOLUTIONS INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHARE PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  \u2022  CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR IN THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE FEES SUBJECT TO THE ATTAINMENT OF TARGETS OR SPECIFIC SERVICE LEVELS. THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL, IT MAY DILUTE OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN US.  \u2022  WE ARE INCORPORATED IN IRELAND AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO ENFORCE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY RELATED TO OUR INCORPORATION IN IRELAND.  \u2022  IRISH LAW DIFFERS FROM THE LAWS IN EFFECT IN THE UNITED STATES AND MIGHT AFFORD LESS PROTECTION TO SHAREHOLDERS.

THE LEVEL OF REVENUES WE ACHIEVE IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MARKET-LEADING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS AND TO DEPLOY SKILLED TEAMS OF PROFESSIONALS QUICKLY AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED THAT LEVEL OF VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY GLOBALLY AND HAS CREATED ECONOMIC DISRUPTION. WE ARE ACTIVELY MANAGING OUR BUSINESS TO RESPOND TO THE IMPACT.  THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN AND U.K. POUND. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  AS ANNOUNCED ON JANUARY 13, 2020, EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, WE BEGAN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS UNDER A NEW GROWTH MODEL THROUGH OUR THREE GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND GROWTH MARKETS, WHICH WILL BECOME OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE OUR FORM 8-K FILED ON JANUARY 13, 2020.  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONG, RESULTING IN GROWTH ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  , REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS, SOLID IN COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND RESOURCES AND MODEST IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE EXPERIENCED LOCAL CURRENCY REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS VERY STRONG IN GROWTH MARKETS AND NORTH AMERICA AND MODEST IN EUROPE. REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS STRONG IN BOTH OUTSOURCING AND CONSULTING DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  . WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINED COMPETITIVE, PRICING WAS RELATIVELY STABLE. WE USE THE TERM \u201cPRICING\u201d TO MEAN THE CONTRACT PROFITABILITY OR MARGIN ON THE WORK THAT WE SELL.  IN OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . CONSULTING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS, MODEST GROWTH IN RESOURCES AND COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND SLIGHT GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES.  OUR CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR DIGITAL-, CLOUD- AND SECURITY-RELATED SERVICES AND ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DELIVER COST SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO INTEGRATE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GROW AND TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES.  IN OUR OUTSOURCING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . OUTSOURCING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . OUTSOURCING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES AND STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE, COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY, PRODUCTS AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMAND TO ASSIST CLIENTS WITH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DIGITAL-RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD ENABLEMENT. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING THEIR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENCY.  AS WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  1.0%  AND  1.4%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITHIN RECENT RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2020  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  1.5%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. WE HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HEADCOUNT, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH SERVE OUR CLIENTS, TO APPROXIMATELY  509,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , COMPARED  TO APPROXIMATELY  477,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS  14%  , DOWN FROM  15%  IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN SKILL SETS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, COMPENSATION INCREASES  BECOME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1ST OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  WE STRIVE TO ADJUST PRICING AND/OR THE MIX OF RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF COMPENSATION INCREASES ON OUR MARGIN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO: KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR AMOUNTS OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING; RECOVER INCREASES IN COMPENSATION; DEPLOY OUR EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY ON A TIMELY BASIS; MANAGE ATTRITION; AND/OR EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE AND UTILIZE NEW EMPLOYEES.  GROSS MARGIN (REVENUES LESS COST OF SERVICES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES) FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS  30.2%  , COMPARED WITH  29.2%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  WAS  31.1%  COMPARED WITH  30.2%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LABOR AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN  FISCAL 2019.  SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WERE  16.8%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  AND  16.7%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , COMPARED WITH  16.0%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  AND  15.8%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . FOR BOTH THE SECOND QUARTER AND  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  ,  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN  FISCAL 2019  , SALES AND MARKETING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED  60  BASIS POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELLING AND OTHER BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT COSTS. FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN  FISCAL 2019  , GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED  20  AND  30  BASIS  POINTS, RESPECTIVELY,  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER TECHNOLOGY AND FACILITIES COSTS.  OPERATING MARGIN (OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES) FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WAS  13.4%  , COMPARED WITH  13.3%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020  WAS  14.5%  , COMPARED WITH  14.3%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, THE SHAREHOLDERS OF GENEREX (THE FORMER SHAREHOLDERS  OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC.) ACQUIRED A MAJORITY (APPROXIMATELY 90%) OF THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF GREEN MT., AND GENEREX  BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GREEN MT.; GREEN MT. CHANGED ITS CORPORATE NAME TO GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (\"GENEREX  IDAHO\"), AND GENEREX CHANGED ITS CORPORATE NAME TO GBC - DELAWARE, INC. BECAUSE THE REVERSE ACQUISITION RESULTED IN GBC -  DELAWARE, INC. SHAREHOLDERS (FORMALLY GENEREX SHAREHOLDERS) BECOMING THE MAJORITY HOLDERS OF GENEREX IDAHO, GBC DELAWARE, INC.  WAS TREATED AS THE ACQUIRING CORPORATION IN THE TRANSACTION FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THUS, OUR, GBC - DELAWARE, INC. (FORMALLY  GENEREX), HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ESSENTIALLY REPRESENTED THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS  INC., WERE DEEMED TO BE THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF GENEREX IDAHO.  28  IN  APRIL 1999, WE COMPLETED A REORGANIZATION IN WHICH GBC - DELAWARE, INC. MERGED WITH GENEREX IDAHO. IN THIS TRANSACTION, ALL OUTSTANDING  SHARES OF GENEREX IDAHO WERE CONVERTED INTO SHARES OF GBC - DELAWARE, INC.; GENEREX IDAHO CEASED TO EXIST AS A SEPARATE ENTITY,  AND WE, GBC - DELAWARE, INC., CHANGED OUR CORPORATE NAME BACK TO \"GENEREX BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION.\" THIS REORGANIZATION  DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR CURRENT FINANCIAL REPORTING.  FOLLOWING OUR  REORGANIZATION IN 1999, GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC., WHICH WAS INCORPORATED IN ONTARIO, CANADA, REMAINED AS OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY.  ALL OF OUR CANADIAN OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED BY GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC.; GENEREX PHARMACEUTICALS INC. IS THE 100% OWNER OF  1097346 ONTARIO INC., WHICH WAS ALSO INCORPORATED IN ONTARIO, CANADA. IN AUGUST 2003, WE ACQUIRED  NUGENEREX IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY,  INC. (FORMERLY  ANTIGEN EXPRESS, INC.) (\u201cNGIO\u201d), A DELAWARE INCORPORATED COMPANY. ANTIGEN IS ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNOLOGIES AND IMMUNOMEDICINES FOR THE TREATMENT OF MALIGNANT, INFECTIOUS, AUTOIMMUNE AND ALLERGIC DISEASES.  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 GENEREX ISSUED A DIVIDEND OF NGIO TO GENEREX SHAREHOLDERS IN THE AMOUNT OF 1 SHARE OF ANTIGEN FOR EVERY 4  SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK. GENEREX STILL MAINTAINS MAJORITY CONTROL OF NGIO.  WE  FORMED GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC., WHICH IS ORGANIZED IN BERMUDA, IN JANUARY 2001 IN CONNECTION WITH A JOINT VENTURE WITH ELAN INTERNATIONAL  SERVICES, LTD., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF ELAN CORPORATION, PLC, (\u201cELAN\u201d) TO PURSUE THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN  OF OUR AND ELAN'S DRUG DELIVERY TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING OUR PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY FOR THE BUCCAL DELIVERY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  IN DECEMBER 2004, WE AND ELAN AGREED TO TERMINATE THE JOINT VENTURE. UNDER THE TERMINATION AGREEMENT, WE RETAINED ALL OF OUR INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY RIGHTS AND OBTAINED FULL OWNERSHIP OF GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC.; GENEREX (BERMUDA), INC. DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONDUCT ANY  BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. WE HAVE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARIES INCORPORATED IN THE U.S. AND CANADA WHICH ARE DORMANT AND DO NOT CARRY ON  ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.  ON  JANUARY 18, 2017, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS IN HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, LLC (\u201cHDS\u201d). IN DECEMBER  2018, WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING INTEREST IN HDS. THE COMPANY, NOW A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GENEREX, HAS BEEN RENAMED NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS, LLC (NGDX), AND IS MANAGED BY PRESIDENT HAROLD HAINES, PHD.  ON  OCTOBER 3, 2018, OUR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS, LLC (\u201cNUGENEREX\u201d), ENTERED INTO AN  ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cVENETO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH VENETO HOLDINGS, L.L.C. (\u201cVENETO\u201d),  PURSUANT TO WHICH NUGENEREX PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS OF VENETO AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE \u201cASSETS\u201d). THE VENETO ASSET  PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS REGARDING PAYMENT TERMS, CONFIDENTIALITY AND INDEMNIFICATION, AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY  PROVISIONS.  EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 3, 2018, NUGENEREX ASSIGNED THE VENETO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC.  THE  SOLE MEMBER OF NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC IS NUGENEREX MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF GENEREX  BIOTECHNOLOGY CORPORATION.  ALSO,  ON OCTOBER 3, 2018, WE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS FROM VENETO (THE \u201cFIRST CLOSING ASSETS\u201d), PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF THE  OPERATING ASSETS OF (A) SYSTEM DISPENSING PHARMACIES, (B) A CENTRAL ADJUDICATING PHARMACY, (C) A WHOLESALE PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING  COMPANY, AND (D) AN IN-NETWORK LABORATORY.  ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE CONSUMMATED THE ACQUISITION OF VENETO ASSETS (THE \u201cSECOND CLOSING ASSETS\u201d), CONSISTING PRIMARILY  OF VENETO\u2019S MANAGEMENT SERVICES ORGANIZATION BUSINESS AND OTHER ASSETS. THE AGGREGATE PRICE FOR THE FIRST CLOSING ASSETS  AND THE SECOND CLOSING ASSETS WAS $30,000,000. WE ISSUED A PROMISSORY NOTE IN THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $35,000,000 (THE \u201cNEW  NOTE\u201d) CONSISTING OF THE $30,000,000 PURCHASE PRICE AND A $5,000,000 ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, AS THE SOLE CONSIDERATION  PAYABLE ON THE SECOND CLOSING DATE. ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT TO THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT  (THE \u201cAMENDMENT\u201d) RESTRUCTURING PAYMENT OF THE NEW NOTE.  29  ON  MARCH 28, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AMENDMENT, A \u201cRESTRUCTURING AGREEMENT\u201d WITH VENETO AND THE EQUITY OWNERS  OF VENETO TO RESTRUCTURE THE PAYMENT OF THE NEW NOTE THAT PROVIDED, IN LIEU OF ANY CASH PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY DELIVERED ON MAY  23, 2019 11,760,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK; PLUS AN AGGREGATE 5,500,000 SHARES OF THE COMMON STOCK OF OUR SUBSIDIARY, ANTIGEN.  THE VENETO ASSETS ACQUIRED BY GENEREX INCLUDED MANAGEMENT SERVICES OPERATIONS, SYSTEMS, FACILITIES, AND OTHER SERVICES.  ON  JANUARY 7, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN REGENTYS CORPORATION (\u201cREGENTYS\u201d) FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $15,000,000,  AMONG WHICH $400,000 WAS PAID IN CASH AND THE REMAINDER WAS PAID BY THE ISSUANCE OF A PROMISSORY NOTE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $14,342,414  FOR A TOTAL NET PURCHASE PRICE OF $14,742,414. THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED TOTALED $907,883 AND GOODWILL OF $13,834,581.  INSTALLMENTS PAYABLE UNDER THE NOTE WERE TIED TO SPECIFIC BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES AND DATES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, AN  ADDITIONAL $150,000 WAS PAID FOR A TOTAL OF $1,162,000 AGAINST THE NOTE. REGENTYS IS DEVELOPING A NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR INFLAMMATORY  BOWEL DISEASES SUCH AS ULCERATIVE COLITIS AND CROHN\u2019S DISEASE.  ON  JANUARY 7, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN OLAREGEN THERAPEUTIX INC. (\u201cOLAREGEN\u201d) FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $12,000,000,  AMONG WHICH $400,000 WAS PAID IN CASH AND THE REMAINDER WAS PAID BY THE ISSUANCE OF A PROMISSORY NOTE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $11,472,334  FOR A TOTAL NET PURCHASE PRICE OF $11,872,663. THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED TOTALED $2,461,439 AND GOODWILL OF  $9,411,224. $1,754,800 PRINCIPAL WAS PAID AGAINST THE NOTE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND AN ADDITIONAL $13,770 WAS PAID SUBSEQUENTLY  FOR A TOTAL AGGREGATE OF $1,768,570 OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE $400,000 INITIAL PAYMENT. OLAREGEN IS LAUNCHING AN  FDA-510(K) CLEARED WOUND CARE PRODUCT.  ON  MAY 10, 2019, WE ACQUIRED FROM A THIRD PARTY THE OUTSTANDING SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IN OLAREGEN IN EXCHANGE FOR 4 MILLION SHARES  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, PLUS THE ISSUANCE OF A $2 MILLION PROMISSORY NOTE INCREASING OUR INTEREST IN OLAREGEN TO  APPROXIMATELY 62% OF THE OLAREGEN\u2019S OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES.  ON AUGUST 16,  2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL 900,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN OLAREGEN  FROM OTHER SHAREHOLDERS OF OLAREGEN IN EXCHANGE FOR 1,905,912 SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK AND 476,478 SHARES OF NGIO COMMON  STOCK WHICH INCREASED OUR INTEREST IN OLAREGEN TO APPROXIMATELY 77% OF THE OLAREGEN\u2019S OUTSTANDING VOTING SHARES. IN SEPTEMBER  2019, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ALL OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF OLAREGEN INTO COMMON STOCK OF OLAREGEN.  ON  FEBRUARY 14, 2020, OLAREGEN EXCHANGED ALL OF ITS OUTSTANDING SHARES FOR 5,950,000 SHARES OF GENEREX COMMON STOCK AND 2,765,000  SHARES OF NGIO IN. AFTER THIS TRANSACTION, GENEREX OWNS 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OLAREGEN.  HISTORICAL  BUSINESS  HISTORICALLY,  WE HAVE BEEN A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ORAL-LYN BUCCAL INSULIN SPRAY FOR DIABETES.  ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARY NGIO, WE HAVE A DEEP INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO OF IMMUNOTHERAPY ASSETS RELATING TO THE  \u201cII-KEY\u201d TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTIVATES THE IMMUNE RESPONSE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CANCER AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES. WE HAVE  COMPLETED A PHASE IIB CLINICAL TRIAL OF AE37 IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC PEPTIDE VACCINE WITH THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY IN OVER 300 WOMEN WITH  BREAST CANCER.  IN  2017, WE ACQUIRED HDS (NOW NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS) AND THEIR DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCT PORTFOLIO OF RAPID POINT-OF-CARE EXPRESS TEST KITS  AND CASSETTES FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING.  WE BELIEVE THAT  THESE LEGACY DIAGNOSTICS, DIABETES AND CANCER ASSETS ARE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT VALUE WHICH IS NOT BEING RECOGNIZED DUE TO MISSTEPS  IN THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PROCESS BY PREVIOUS MANAGEMENT, RESULTING INABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL NECESSARY TO FUND FURTHER DEVELOPMENT.  WE THINK THE PRODUCTS AND IP PORTFOLIO RETAIN SIGNIFICANT VALUE. A RECENTLY SIGNED CO-DEVELOPMENT DEAL WITH A MAJOR PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY FOR AE37 IN TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER, AND A LICENSING DEAL IN CHINA FOR AE37 IN PROSTATE CANCER ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL  FOR AE37 IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINE. ADDITIONALLY, ORAL-LYN HAS BEEN REFORMULATED TO ENTER CLINICAL TRIALS FOR TYPE II DIABETES.  THE HDS EXPRESS DIAGNOSTIC TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN EXPANDED WITH THE NEW, PATENT-PENDING EXPRESS II TECHNOLOGY AND A NEW PRODUCT PIPELINE.  WE FILLED OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ORDER FOR 40,000 UNITS OF ITS  NGDX -MALARIA PF/PV CASSETTE TEST KIT  TO  IMRES, BV, A NETHERLANDS-BASED MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, AND WAS RECENTLY GRANTED A CE MARK CERTIFICATION UNDER THE EUROPEAN  MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (MDD) FOR ITS THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY  ,  A RAPID POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC  ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SYPHILIS. AS PART OF THE REORGANIZATION PLAN, WE PLACED  OUR LEGACY ASSETS INTO SEPARATE SUBSIDIARIES UNDER THE NUGENEREX FAMILY OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS, NGIO, AND  NUGENEREX THERAPEUTICS (ORAL-LYN AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY). OUR STRATEGY IS TO SPIN OUT NGIO AS A SEPARATELY TRADED  PUBLIC COMPANY, TO REIGNITE THE ORAL-LYN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WITH A REFORMULATED BUCCAL INSULIN SPRAY, AND TO BUILD OUT THE DIAGNOSTICS  BUSINESS, AS DETAILED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS, HOWEVER THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC  OBJECTIVES.  30  TREATMENT  OF LEGACY ASSETS  GENEREX  AND ITS SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES HAVE EXTENSIVE PATENT PORTFOLIOS, WITH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FOR COMPOSITION OF MATTER, FORMULATION,  DESIGN, AND USE IN A NUMBER OF THERAPEUTIC AREAS, ACROSS MULTIPLE INDICATIONS. AS DESCRIBED, WE PLAN TO BUILD OUR LEGACY ASSETS  WITH THE ULTIMATE GOAL TO SPIN-OUT SUCH ASSETS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO NUGENEREX SUBSIDIARY  COMPANIES IN AN EFFORT TO UNLOCK THE POTENTIAL UNREALIZED VALUE OF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR  THESE DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES IN MAJOR MARKETS FOR IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY, DIABETES, AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING.  \u2022  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS  : ORAL-LYN (BUCCAL INSULIN) AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY  \u2022  NUGENEREX  IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY.  PHASE II AE37 + KEYTRUDA IN TNBC; ANTIGEN EXPRESS (II-KEY), LICENSING,  PARTNERSHIPS, INVESTOR DIVIDEND PAID (1:4) FOR SPIN-OUT  \u2022  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS.  NGDX EXPRESS II RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE.  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS  NUGENEREX  THERAPEUTICS HOUSES THE LEGACY DIABETES ASSETS, ORAL-LYN AND RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BUCCAL  DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS APPLICATION TO MANY LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AND DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A CONVENIENT,  NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADMINISTER SUCH DRUGS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AS POSSIBLE  CANDIDATES FOR DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING CANNABINOID MEDICINES. TO THAT END WE HAVE ENTERED INTO A LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH SCIENTUS  PHARMACEUTICALS FOR THE USE OF THE RAPIDMIST TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF CANNABINOIDS.  BUCCAL  DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS  OUR  BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES THE PREPARATION OF PROPRIETARY FORMULATIONS IN WHICH AN ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL AGENT IS PLACED  IN A SOLUTION WITH A COMBINATION OF ABSORPTION ENHANCERS AND OTHER EXCIPIENTS CLASSIFIED \u201cGENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS SAFE\u201d  (\"GRAS\") BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) WHEN USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIFIED QUANTITIES  AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. THE RESULTING FORMULATIONS ARE AEROSOLIZED WITH A PHARMACEUTICAL GRADE CHEMICAL PROPELLANT AND ARE ADMINISTERED  TO PATIENTS USING OUR PROPRIETARY RAPIDMISTTM BRAND METERED DOSE INHALER. THE DEVICE IS A SMALL, LIGHTWEIGHT, HAND-HELD,  EASY-TO-USE AEROSOL APPLICATOR COMPRISED OF A CONTAINER FOR THE FORMULATION, A METERED DOSE VALVE, AN ACTUATOR AND DUST CAP. USING  THE DEVICE, PATIENTS SELF-ADMINISTER THE FORMULATIONS BY SPRAYING THEM INTO THE MOUTH. THE DEVICE CONTAINS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS,  THE NUMBER BEING DEPENDENT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON THE CONCENTRATION OF THE FORMULATION. ABSORPTION OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AGENT  OCCURS IN THE BUCCAL CAVITY, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE INNER CHEEK WALLS. IN CLINICAL STUDIES OF OUR FLAGSHIP ORAL INSULIN PRODUCT  GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM, INSULIN ABSORPTION IN THE BUCCAL CAVITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS AND SAFE.  BUCCAL  INSULIN PRODUCT \u2013 GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  INSULIN  IS A HORMONE THAT IS NATURALLY SECRETED BY THE PANCREAS TO REGULATE THE LEVEL OF GLUCOSE, A TYPE OF SUGAR, IN THE BLOODSTREAM.  THE TERM \u201cDIABETES\u201d REFERS TO A GROUP OF DISORDERS THAT ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE INABILITY OF THE BODY TO PROPERLY  REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. WHEN GLUCOSE IS ABUNDANT, IT IS CONVERTED INTO FAT AND STORED FOR USE WHEN FOOD IS NOT AVAILABLE.  WHEN GLUCOSE IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM FOOD, THESE FACTS ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO FREE FATTY ACIDS THAT STIMULATE GLUCOSE PRODUCTION.  INSULIN ACTS BY STIMULATING THE USE OF GLUCOSE AS FUEL AND BY INHIBITING THE PRODUCTION OF GLUCOSE. IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL, A  BALANCE IS MAINTAINED BETWEEN INSULIN SECRETION AND GLUCOSE METABOLISM.  31  ACCORDING  TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC), THERE ARE TWO MAJOR TYPES OF DIABETES. TYPE 1 DIABETES (JUVENILE ONSET DIABETES OR INSULIN  DEPENDENT DIABETES) REFERS TO THE CONDITION WHERE THE PANCREAS PRODUCES LITTLE OR NO INSULIN. TYPE 1 DIABETES ACCOUNTS FOR 5-10  PERCENT OF DIABETES CASES (CDC). IT OFTEN OCCURS IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS. TYPE 1 DIABETICS MUST TAKE DAILY INSULIN INJECTIONS,  TYPICALLY THREE TO FIVE TIMES PER DAY, TO REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PROVIDES A NEEDLE-FREE MEANS  OF DELIVERING INSULIN FOR THESE PATIENTS.  ACCORDING  TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (ADULT ONSET OR NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS), THE BODY DOES  NOT PRODUCE ENOUGH INSULIN, OR CANNOT PROPERLY USE THE INSULIN PRODUCED. TYPE 2 DIABETES IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF THE DISEASE  AND ACCOUNTS FOR 90-95 PERCENT OF DIABETES CASES, ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION. IN ADDITION TO INSULIN THERAPY,  TYPE 2 DIABETICS MAY TAKE ORAL DRUGS THAT STIMULATE THE PRODUCTION OF INSULIN BY THE PANCREAS OR THAT HELP THE BODY TO MORE EFFECTIVELY  USE INSULIN. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PROVIDES A SIMPLE MEANS OF DELIVERING NEEDED INSULIN TO THIS MAJOR COHORT OF INDIVIDUALS.  STUDIES  IN DIABETES HAVE IDENTIFIED A CONDITION CLOSELY RELATED TO AND PRECEDING DIABETES, CALLED IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT). PEOPLE  WITH IGT DO NOT USUALLY MEET THE CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF DIABETES MELLITUS. THEY HAVE NORMAL FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS BUT  TWO HOURS AFTER A MEAL THEIR BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IS FAR ABOVE NORMAL. WITH THE INCREASE USE OF GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TESTS THE NUMBER  OF PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH THIS PRE-DIABETIC CONDITION IS EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY. PER THE 2017 DIABETES ATLAS UPDATE, PUBLISHED  BY THE INTERNATIONAL DIABETES FEDERATION (IDF), APPROXIMATELY 40 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 425 MILLION  PEOPLE WORLD-WIDE SUFFER FROM IGT. GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION TO PROVIDING MEAL-TIME INSULIN TO THE MILLIONS  OF IGT SUFFERERS. THIS THERAPEUTIC AREA IS CURRENTLY BEING INVESTIGATED.  THERE  IS NO KNOWN CURE FOR DIABETES. THE IDF ESTIMATES THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY APPROXIMATELY 382 MILLION DIABETICS WORLDWIDE PER THEIR  2017 DIABETES ATLAS UPDATE AND IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT OVER 592 MILLION PEOPLE BY THE YEAR 2035. THERE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER  37 MILLION PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM DIABETES IN NORTH AMERICA ALONE AND DIABETES IS THE SECOND LARGEST CAUSE OF DEATH BY DISEASE  IN NORTH AMERICA.  A  SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS (  I.E.  , DRUGS COMPOSED OF MOLECULES WITH A HIGH MOLECULAR WEIGHT AND FAIRLY COMPLEX  AND LARGE SPATIAL ORIENTATION) HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES OR ARE PRESENTLY UNDERGOING CLINICAL TRIALS AS  PART OF THE PROCESS TO OBTAIN SUCH APPROVAL, INCLUDING VARIOUS PROTEINS, PEPTIDES, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, HORMONES AND VACCINES.  UNLIKE SMALL MOLECULE DRUGS, WHICH GENERALLY CAN BE ADMINISTERED BY VARIOUS METHODS, LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN  ADMINISTERED PREDOMINATELY BY INJECTION. THE PRINCIPAL REASONS FOR THIS HAVE BEEN THE VULNERABILITY OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS TO  DIGESTION AND THE RELATIVELY LARGE SIZE OF THE MOLECULE ITSELF, WHICH MAKES ABSORPTION INTO THE BLOOD STREAM THROUGH THE SKIN  INEFFICIENT OR INEFFECTIVE. THE RAPIDMIST TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A RECOGNIZED AND PROVEN DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR THE DELIVERY OF  LARGE MOLECULES DIRECTLY INTO THE BLOOD STREAM WITH THE ATTENDANT ADVANTAGES.  ORAL-LYN  HISTORY  IN  MAY 2005, WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FROM THE ECUADORIAN MINISTRY OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKETING AND SALE OF GENEREX  ORAL-LYNTM FOR TREATMENT OF TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THE DELIVERY AND INSTALLATION OF A  TURNKEY GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM PRODUCTION OPERATION AT THE FACILITIES OF PHARMABRAND IN QUITO, ECUADOR. THE FIRST COMMERCIAL  PRODUCTION RUN OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM IN ECUADOR WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2006. WHILE ECUADOR PRODUCTION CAPABILITY MAY BE SUFFICIENT  TO MEET THE NEEDS OF SOUTH AMERICA, IT IS BELIEVED TO BE INSUFFICIENT FOR WORLDWIDE PRODUCTION FOR FUTURE COMMERCIAL SALES AND  CLINICAL TRIALS.  ON  THE BASIS OF THE TEST RESULTS IN ECUADOR AND OTHER PRE-CLINICAL DATA, WE MADE AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG (\u201cIND\u201d)  SUBMISSION TO HEALTH CANADA (CANADA'S EQUIVALENT TO THE FDA) IN JULY 1998, AND RECEIVED PERMISSION FROM THE CANADIAN REGULATORS  TO PROCEED WITH CLINICAL TRIALS IN SEPTEMBER 1998. WE FILED AN IND APPLICATION WITH THE FDA IN OCTOBER 1998, AND RECEIVED FDA  APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH HUMAN TRIALS IN NOVEMBER 1998.  WE  BEGAN OUR CLINICAL TRIAL PROGRAMS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES IN JANUARY 1999. BETWEEN JANUARY 1999 AND SEPTEMBER 2000, WE  CONDUCTED CLINICAL TRIALS OF OUR INSULIN FORMULATION INVOLVING APPROXIMATELY 200 SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 1 AND TYPE 2 DIABETES AND  HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. THE STUDY PROTOCOLS IN MOST TRIALS INVOLVED ADMINISTRATION OF TWO DIFFERENT DOSES OF OUR INSULIN FORMULATION  FOLLOWING EITHER A LIQUID SUSTACAL MEAL OR A STANDARD MEAL CHALLENGE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THESE STUDIES WAS TO EVALUATE OUR INSULIN  FORMULATION'S EFFICACY IN CONTROLLING POST-PRANDIAL (MEAL RELATED) GLUCOSE LEVELS. THESE TRIALS DEMONSTRATED THAT OUR INSULIN  FORMULATION CONTROLLED POST-PRANDIAL HYPERGLYCEMIA IN A MANNER COMPARABLE TO INJECTED INSULIN. IN APRIL 2003, A PHASE II-B CLINICAL  TRIAL PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED IN CANADA. IN SEPTEMBER 2006, A CLINICAL TRIAL APPLICATION RELATING TO OUR GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  PROTOCOL FOR LATE-STAGE TRIALS WAS APPROVED BY HEALTH CANADA. THE FDA\u2019S REVIEW PERIOD FOR THE PROTOCOL LAPSED WITHOUT OBJECTION  IN JULY 2007.  32  IN  LATE APRIL 2008, WE INITIATED PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS IN NORTH AMERICA FOR GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM WITH THE FIRST SUBJECT SCREENING  IN TEXAS. OTHER CLINICAL SITES PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDY WERE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES (TEXAS, MARYLAND, MINNESOTA AND CALIFORNIA),  CANADA (ALBERTA), EUROPEAN UNION (ROMANIA, POLAND AND BULGARIA), EASTERN EUROPE (RUSSIA AND UKRAINE),) AND ECUADOR. APPROXIMATELY  450 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE PROGRAM AT APPROXIMATELY 70 CLINICAL SITES AROUND THE WORLD. THE PHASE III PROTOCOL CALLED FOR  A SIX-MONTH TRIAL WITH A SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM AND  THE RAPIDMISTTM DIABETES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM WITH THAT OF STANDARD REGULAR INJECTABLE HUMAN INSULIN THERAPY AS MEASURED BY  HBA1C, IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE-1 DIABETES MELLITUS. THE FINAL SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL IN AUGUST 2011. AFTER APPROPRIATE VALIDATION,  THE DATA FROM APPROXIMATELY 450 PATIENTS WAS TABULATED, REVIEWED AND ANALYZED. THOSE RESULTS FROM THE PHASE III TRIAL ALONG WITH  A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSES OF APPROXIMATELY 40 PRIOR ORAL-LYN CLINICAL STUDIES WERE COMPILED AND SUBMITTED  TO THE FDA IN LATE DECEMBER 2011 IN A COMPREHENSIVE PACKAGE INCLUDING A COMPOSITE METANALYSIS OF ALL SAFETY DATA. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY  PLAN TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ON ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS OF ORAL-LYNTM UNTIL AFTER SUCH TIME THAT WE SECURE ADDITIONAL  FINANCING. HOWEVER, WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN A FORMULATION ENHANCEMENT PROJECT WITH THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK AT THE UNIVERSITY  OF TORONTO AND THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH, ONTARIO TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF INSULIN REACHING THE BLOOD STREAM. WE BELIEVE THAT  THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM AN ANIMAL STUDY ARE ENCOURAGING,  IN  THE PAST, WE ENGAGED A GLOBAL CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO PROVIDE MANY STUDY RELATED SITE SERVICES, INCLUDING INITIATION,  COMMUNICATION WITH SITES, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND DOCUMENTATION; A GLOBAL CENTRAL LAB SERVICE COMPANY TO ARRANGE FOR THE LOGISTICS  OF KITS AND BLOOD SAMPLES SHIPMENT AND TESTING; AN INTERNET-BASED CLINICAL ELECTRONIC DATA MANAGEMENT COMPANY TO ASSIST US WITH  GLOBAL DATA ENTRY, PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND DATA STORAGE/PROCESSING OF THE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIAL AND REGULATORY PROCESSES. IN  THE PAST, WE HAVE CONTRACTED WITH THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO PRODUCE SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF THE RAPIDMISTTM COMPONENTS,  THE INSULIN, AND THE RAW MATERIAL EXCIPIENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF CLINICAL TRIAL BATCHES OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM.  FUTURE  PLANS  WE  HAVE REFORMULATED THE ORIGINAL ORAL-LYN BUCCAL INSULIN AS A NEW PATENTABLE ORAL-LYN 2 THAT REQUIRES ONLY 2 - 3 PRE-PRANDIAL (BEFORE  MEAL) SPRAYS FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES. THE REFORMULATED ORAL-LYN 2 WAS MADE POSSIBLE BY NEW TECHNIQUES IN PROTEIN  CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION SCIENCE, THAT WITH MINIMAL CHANGES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS AND CONTENT OF THE COMPONENTS,  ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW AND IMPROVED, CONCENTRATED INSULIN FORMULATION FOR IMPROVED DIABETES MANAGEMENT.  NUGENEREX  HAS ENGAGED THE UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO\u2019S CENTER FOR MOLECULAR DESIGN AND PRE-FORMULATIONS (CMDP) THROUGH THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH  NETWORK WITH THE GOAL OF ENHANCING THE ORAL-LYNTM 2 FORMULATION TO MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE TO PATIENTS AND PROSPECTIVE COMMERCIALIZATION  PARTNERS BY INCREASING THE BIOAVAILABILITY OF INSULIN IN THE PRODUCT AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SPRAYS REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE EFFECTIVE  PRANDIAL METABOLIC CONTROL FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF NUGENEREX CONSULTANT DR. LAKSHMI P. KOTRA, B.PHARM.  (HONS), PH.D., OF CMDP, PRELIMINARY EFFORTS SUCCEEDED IN INCREASING THE INSULIN CONCENTRATION IN THE PRODUCT BY APPROXIMATELY  400 - 500% AS CONFIRMED BY A VARIETY OF  IN VITRO  TESTING PROCEDURES, WHILE PRESERVING THE SOLUBILITY, STABILITY,  BIOLOGIC ACTIVITY, AND POTENCY OF THE INSULIN IN THE FORMULATION.  NUGENEREX  SUBSEQUENTLY ENTERED INTO A RESEARCH SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH PURSUANT TO WHICH DR. DANA ALLEN, DVM, MSC.  AND DR. RON JOHNSON, DVM, PH.D. OF THE ONTARIO VETERINARY COLLEGE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH CONDUCTED A STUDY OF THE RELATIVE  BIOAVAILABILITY OF THE ENHANCED FORMULATION IN DOGS IN THE UNIVERSITY\u2019S COMPARATIVE CLINICAL RESEARCH FACILITY. THE UNIVERSITY  HAD PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED THE STUDIES OF THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION OF GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, SAFETY, AND  TOXICITY.  33  IN  THE NEW STUDIES, THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM 2 FORMULATION WAS COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION IN A BLINDED,  PARALLEL CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING FASTED, AWAKE, HEALTHY MATURE BEAGLE DOGS. EACH DOG RECEIVED THREE SPRAYS OF EITHER THE ENHANCED  FORMULATION OR THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION. EACH DOG WAS OBSERVED WITH ASSESSMENTS OF SERUM INSULIN AND GLUCOSE MEASURED OVER A TWO-HOUR  PERIOD. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS OBSERVED IN ANY OF THE ANIMALS.  IN  THE DOGS GIVEN THE ENHANCED GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FORMULATION (5X), THERE WAS A GREATER THAN 20-FOLD INCREASE IN SERUM INSULIN  AT 15 MINUTES  (EXCLUDING ONE DOG WHO HAD LITTLE RESPONSE AT ANY TIME POINT; (WITH DOG INCLUDED IT WAS GREATER THAN 5-FOLD))  AND  ALMOST 500% GREATER ABSORPTION OF INSULIN OVER THE TWO-HOUR TEST PERIOD COMPARED TO DOGS GIVEN THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION (1X).  THERE WAS A 33% DECREASE IN SERUM GLUCOSE AT 30 MINUTES IN DOGS TREATED WITH THE ENHANCED GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM FORMULATION,  COMPARED TO A 12% INCREASE IN SERUM GLUCOSE IN DOGS TREATED WITH THE ORIGINAL FORMULATION.  THE  RESULTS OF THE DOG STUDIES COUPLED WITH THE POSITIVE FINDINGS FROM THE  IN VITRO  WORK PROVIDE SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE  TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE REMAINING CLINICAL AND REGULATORY WORK NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE FDA APPROVAL OF THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM  FORMULATION THROUGH A 505(B)2 NDA.  THE  COMBINED RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE ENHANCED NUGENEREX ORAL-LYNTM 2 WILL BE ABLE TO BE USED BY PEOPLE WITH EITHER  TYPE 1 OR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AS A SAFE, SIMPLE, FAST, FLEXIBLE, AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PRE-PRANDIAL INSULIN INJECTIONS  WITH DOSING OF ONLY TWO TO FOUR SPRAYS REQUIRED BEFORE MEALS.  THE  ORAL-LYN SAFETY DATABASE CONTAINS INFORMATION ON 1,496 SUBJECTS. EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-NINE (869) SUBJECTS WERE EXPOSED TO ORAL-LYN,  WHILE 627 SERVED AS CONTROL SUBJECTS AND WERE EXPOSED TO COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE ORAL ANTIHYPERGLYCEMICS, INJECTED INSULIN, OR  ORAL-LYN PLACEBO. THERE WERE 695 SUBJECTS IN PK/PD STUDIES (368, ORAL-LYN; 327, CONTROL) AND 801 SUBJECTS IN EFFICACY TRIALS (501,  ORAL-LYN; 300, CONTROL).  TWO  HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO (272) ORAL-LYN SUBJECTS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (132 IN PK/PD STUDIES; 140 IN EFFICACY STUDIES)  WHILE 278 CONTROL SUBJECTS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (111 IN PK/PD STUDIES; 167 IN EFFICACY STUDIES). WITH RESPECT TO  ADVERSE EVENTS BY MAXIMUM SEVERITY THERE APPEARED TO BE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORAL-LYN AND THE CONTROL GROUPS IN  EITHER THE EFFICACY OR THE PK STUDIES.  IN  SUMMARY, THERE APPEAR TO BE NO INDICATIONS OF ANY SIGNIFICANT UNEXPECTED ADVERSE EVENTS. THE EXPECTED EVENTS OF HYPOESTHESIA ORAL,  THROAT IRRITATION, DRY THROAT, AND COUGH WERE FOR THE MOST PART MILD AND COULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE ORAL-LYN THERAPY ESPECIALLY  DURING THE LEARNING PHASE OF ADMINISTRATION. THERE WAS AN INDICATION OF OVERLAP OF SOME OF THESE EVENTS WITH MULTIPLE EVENT TERMS  IN THE CONSTELLATION OF UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT INFECTION THAT APPEARED TO BE BALANCED ACROSS THERAPY GROUPS.  OUR  STRATEGY IS TO REVITALIZE OUR DIABETES PROGRAM BY ADVANCING THE REFORMULATED BUCCAL SPRAY ORAL-LYN 2 FOR THE TREATMENT OF TYPE  II DIABETES, AND TO INTEGRATE ORAL-LYN 2 THERAPY INTO OUR END-TO-END SOLUTION FOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT THROUGH OUR MSO MODEL.  BEYOND  ORAL-LYN 2 FOR TYPE II DIABETES, NUGENEREX DRUG DELIVERY SOLUTIONS WILL ADVANCE THE RAPIDMIST BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY WITH  ADDITIONAL SMALL AND LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS WHICH WILL BENEFIT FROM AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION.  NUGENEREX  IMMUNO-ONCOLOGY (NGIO, FORMERLY ANTIGEN EXPRESS)  NGIO IS DEVELOPING  IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC PRODUCTS AND VACCINES BASED ON OUR PROPRIETARY, PATENTED PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY, II-KEY. THE II-KEY IS A PEPTIDE  DERIVED FROM THE MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX (MHC) CLASS II ASSOCIATED INVARIANT CHAIN (II) THAT REGULATES THE FORMATION,  TRAFFICKING, AND ANTIGEN-PRESENTING FUNCTIONS OF MHC CLASS II COMPLEXES, ESSENTIAL FOR THE ACTIVATION OF T CELLS IN THE IMMUNE  RESPONSE. T CELLS RECOGNIZE ANTIGENIC EPITOPES WHEN THEY ARE 'PRESENTED' TO THEM BY SPECIFIC MOLECULES, TERMED (MHC) ON THE SURFACE  OF INFECTED OR MALIGNANT CELLS. THIS INTERACTION ACTIVATES THE T CELLS, STIMULATING A MULTICELLULAR CASCADE OF ACTIONS THAT ELIMINATES  THE DISEASED CELL AND PROTECTS AGAINST FUTURE DISEASE RECURRENCE.  34  WHEN  THE II-KEY PEPTIDE IS LINKED TO AN ANTIGENIC EPITOPE, IT CAN BIND TO MHC CLASS II MOLECULES, DISPLACING RESIDENT ANTIGENS FROM  THE ANTIGEN BINDING GROOVE, ESSENTIALLY 'HIJACKING' THE MHC CLASS II COMPLEX TO PRESENT THE II-KEY EPITOPE TO SELECTIVELY ACTIVATE  T-CELL TH1 RESPONSES, THEREBY INCREASING THE INTENSITY AND DURATION OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE.  NGION HAS DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF II-KEY HYBRID PEPTIDES FOR THE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC TARGETING OF TUMOR ASSOCIATED ANTIGENS  (TAAS) IN CANCER AND FOR VACCINES AGAINST INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  II-KEY  HYBRID PEPTIDES CAN ALSO BE USED TO SELECTIVELY ACTIVATE TH2 RESPONSES AND THEREBY INDUCE TOLERANCE TO ANTIGENS INVOLVED IN HARMFUL  IMMUNE REACTIONS, E.G. AUTOIMMUNITY, ALLERGY, AND TRANSPLANT REJECTION.  AE37  \u2013 II-KEY/HER2/NEU HYBRID IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINE  OUR  MOST ADVANCED IMMUNOTHERAPY VACCINE IS AE37, AN  II-KEY-HYBRID MOLECULE  THAT CONTAINS THE HER2/NEU ANTIGENIC PEPTIDE  LINKED TO THE II-KEY TO ENHANCE IMMUNE STIMULATION AGAINST HER2, WHICH IS EXPRESSED IN NUMEROUS CANCERS, INCLUDING BREAST, PROSTATE,  AND BLADDER CANCERS. WE HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL OF AE37 IN BREAST CANCER: A PHASE IB SAFETY AND IMMUNOLOGY STUDY  OF AE37 AND GM-CSF IN 16 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAD COMPLETED ALL FIRST-LINE THERAPIES AND WHO WERE DISEASE-FREE AT THE TIME  OF ENROLLMENT TO THE STUDY  (HOLMES ET AL. RESULTS OF THE FIRST PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE NOVEL II-KEY HYBRID PREVENTIVE  HER-2/NEU PEPTIDE (AE37) VACCINE. J CLIN ONCOL 2008;26:3426-33)  . FURTHERMORE, WE COMPLETED A PHASE IIB TRIAL OF AE37 IN THE  PREVENTION OF CANCER RECURRENCE IN WOMEN WHO WERE AT HIGH RISK OF RECURRENCE AFTER UNDERGOING SUCCESSFUL PRIMARY STANDARD OF CARE  BREAST CANCER THERAPIES AND WERE DISEASE FREE AT TIME OF ENROLLMENT. THOUGH THE STUDY ENROLLED 300 SUBJECTS, THE RESULTS WERE  NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DUE TO A COMPLETE LACK OF RECURRENCE IN THE 160 WOMEN WITH HER2-3+ POSITIVE TUMORS WHO WERE TREATED  WITH HERCEPTIN DURING PRIMARY THERAPY. THOUGH THE TRIAL WAS NOT POWERED TO EVALUATE THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENCE IN SUBGROUPS,  THE TRIAL INDICATED EFFICACY IN THE SUBSET OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HER2 1+, 2+, AND TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER.  BASED  ON THE RESULTS FROM THIS TRIAL, NUGENEREX HAS ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT WITH MERCK SHARPE & DOHME B.V. (MERCK)  AND THE NATIONAL SURGICAL ADJUVANT BREAST AND PROSTATE PROGRAM (NSABP) TO CONDUCT A PHASE II TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY  AND EFFICACY OF AE37 IN COMBINATION WITH THE ANTI-PD-1 THERAPY, KEYTRUDA (PEMBROLIZUMAB) IN PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC TRIPLE-NEGATIVE  BREAST CANCER. THE TRIAL BEGAN ENROLLING PATIENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  IN  ADDITION TO THE BREAST CANCER PROGRAM, NUGENEREX HAS CONDUCTED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN PROSTATE CANCER, ENROLLING THIRTY-TWO  HER-2/NEU+, CASTRATE-SENSITIVE, AND CASTRATE-RESISTANT PROSTATE CANCER PATIENTS TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND STRONG IMMUNOLOGICAL  RESPONSE TO AE37. WE ARE ADVANCING AE37 FOR THE TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER THROUGH A LICENSING AND RESEARCH AGREEMENT WITH  SHENZHEN BIOSCIEN  PHARMACEUTICALS CO., LTD. (\u201cSHENZHEN\u201d), FOR WHICH NUGENEREX HAS RECEIVED A $700,000 UPFRONT  PAYMENT, WITH ADDITIONAL FUTURE MILESTONE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS.  IN  EXCHANGE FOR EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO AE37 FOR PROSTATE CANCER IN CHINA, SHENZHEN IS FINANCING AND CONDUCTING THE PHASE II TRIALS IN  THE EUROPEAN UNION AND PHASE III TRIALS GLOBALLY UNDER INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION ON HARMONISATION (\u201cICH\u201d) GUIDELINES,  WITH NUGENEREX RETAINING THE RIGHTS TO ALL CLINICAL DATA FOR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS AND COMMERCIALIZATION IN THE REST OF THE WORLD  OUTSIDE CHINA.  FUTURE  PLANS  NGIO HAS BEEN  ESTABLISHED TO NOT ONLY TO ADVANCE THE NGIO CORE TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO TO EXPAND OUR PORTFOLIO IN THE FIELD OF IMMUNOTHERAPY AND  PERSONALIZED MEDICINE THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND ACQUISITIONS. AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY, WE ARE PLANNING TO SPIN-OUT NGIO AS A SEPARATE,  PUBLICLY TRADED ENTITY TO UNLOCK THE TRUE VALUE OF THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS AS IT CREATES A PURE PLAY IN IMMUNOTHERAPY,  WHICH WILL FOSTER INVESTMENT AND COLLABORATION.  AS  AN INITIAL STEP IN ACCOMPLISHING THE SPIN-OUT OF NGIO, ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE ISSUED A STOCK DIVIDEND TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, WHEREBY  OUR SHAREHOLDERS RECEIVED 1 SHARE OF NGIO FOR EVERY 4 SHARES OF OUR STOCK HELD ON THE DIVIDEND DATE. THE STOCK DIVIDENDS WILL  ENABLE OUR STOCKHOLDERS TO DIRECTLY PARTICIPATE IN THE POTENTIALLY PROMISING FUTURE OF NGIO, WHILE CREATING A LARGE SHAREHOLDER  BASE WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SUBSTANTIAL LIQUIDITY IMMEDIATELY UPON SPIN-OUT TO A NATIONAL EXCHANGE, WHICH WILL PROVIDE NGIO WITH  READY ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FINANCE ITS ON-GOING CLINICAL AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES.  35  ADDITIONALLY,  WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH MULTIPLE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND BIOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT COMPANIES TO ACQUIRE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES  TO AUGMENT THE NGIO DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.  ON FEBRUARY  28, 2020, THE COMPANY SIGNED A CONTRACT FROM THE CHINA TECHNOLOGY EXCHANGE, BEIJING ZHONGHUA INVESTMENT FUND MANAGEMENT CO., LTD.,  AND SINOTEK-ADVOCATES INTERNATIONAL INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENT (SHENZHEN) CO., LTD. TO DEVELOP A COVID-19 VACCINE USING THE II-KEY PEPTIDE  VACCINE PLATFORM OF NUGENEREX IMMUNE-ONCOLOGY (NGIO). THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT INCLUDE AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $1 MILLION TO INITIATE  THE PROJECT WORK IN THE UNITED STATES, A $5 MILLION LICENSING FEE FOR THE II-KEY TECHNOLOGY, PAYMENT BY THE CHINESE CONSORTIUM  FOR ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COVID-19 VACCINE, AND A SUBSTANTIAL ROYALTY ON EACH DOSE OF VACCINE  PRODUCED.  UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENT, GENEREX WILL GENERATE A SERIES OF II-KEY PEPTIDES LINKED WITH NCOV-2019 CORONAVIRUS EPITOPES, AS PREDICTED BY  PROPRIETARY COMPUTER ALGORITHMS AND DELIVER THEM TO OUR PARTNERS IN CHINA FOR TESTING AGAINST BLOOD SAMPLES FROM PATIENTS WHO HAVE  RECOVERED FROM COVID-19. THIS SCREENING PROGRAM SHOULD YIELD DATA INDICATING WHICH II-KEY-NCOV EPITOPES ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE HUMAN  IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND THEREFORE ARE POTENTIAL PEPTIDE VACCINE CANDIDATES. ONCE THE MOST REACTIVE PEPTIDES ARE IDENTIFIED, THE GROUP  PLANS TO MANUFACTURE MULTI-VALENT II-KEY PEPTIDE VACCINES FOR EVALUATION IN HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS IN CHINA. WHEN THE OPTIMAL VACCINE  FORMULATION IS DETERMINED, GENEREX INTENDS TO INITIATE THE REQUISITE CLINICAL TRIALS OF THE II-KEY-NCOV PEPTIDE VACCINE FOR APPROVAL  IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE FINALIZED OUR CORPORATE ACQUISITION STRATEGY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND HAVE INITIATED THE SPIN-OUT  PROCESS FOR NGIO IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS (FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS LLC)  OUR  WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS (FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS LLC OR HDS) IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING,  MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING RAPID POINT-OF-CARE IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. THESE ARE COMMONLY REFERRED  AS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS (\u201cRDTS\u201d). WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL RDTS BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY EXPRESS PLATFORMS  AS WELL AS STANDARD \u201cCASSETTE\u201d DEVICES.  SINCE  ITS FOUNDING, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AN EXPANDING LINE OF RDTS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE  DIAGNOSIS. THESE INCLUDE PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV), TUBERCULOSIS, MALARIA, HEPATITIS B, HEPATITIS C, SYPHILIS,  AND OTHERS. THESE ASSAYS ARE ALL QUALITATIVE IN NATURE AND PROVIDE A SIMPLE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE RESULT DIRECTLY AT THE CLINICAL  SITE. THEY CAN BE USED FOR DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS, TRIAGE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER ASSAYS DEPENDING ON WHICH DISEASE IS BEING  CONSIDERED.  EACH  DEVICE INCORPORATES A TEST STRIP CONTAINING REAGENT LINES (STRIPES) THAT HAVE BEEN IMPREGNATED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES  THAT DETECT THE TARGET MOLECULES SPECIFIC TO AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE. THE TEST STRIPS ARE INCORPORATED INTO OUR PROPRIETARY EXPRESS  PLATFORMS WHICH ARE EASY-TO-USE AND USER-FRIENDLY DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES. THERE ARE TWO EXPRESS PLATFORMS; THE EXPRESS AND THE EXPRESS  II. THE EXPRESS II IS AN UPGRADED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL EXPRESS AND ITS USE INVOLVES FEWER OPERATOR STEPS, MAKING IT OF HIGHER  CLINICAL UTILITY VALUE. THE EXPRESS II PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO BE USED IN A BROAD RANGE OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY MEDICAL SETTINGS  AND FOR DIRECT USE BY CONSUMERS IN THE HOME. IT IS SIMPLE TO USE, WITH FEWER STEPS OF OPERATION THAN OTHER RAPID POINT-OF-CARE  TESTS. A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD TAKEN BY A SIMPLE FINGER STICK IS ADDED DIRECTLY TO THE DEVICE AND THE ASSAY IS ACTIVATED BY PLACING  A POD OF BUFFER SOLUTION ONTO THE DEVICE. RESULTS CAN BE READ IN AS EARLY AS 5 MINUTES, AND NO LONGER THAN 30 MINUTES. THE ACCURACY  OF THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY IS EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN STANDARD LABORATORY ASSAYS FOR SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES WITH  SENSITIVITIES AND SPECIFICITIES OF OVER 99%.  WE  BELIEVE THAT EACH SYSTEM DELIVERS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES WHICH ENHANCE THE USE, APPLICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF EACH DIAGNOSTIC. THIS  EASE OF USE IN THE EXPRESS DELIVERY SYSTEMS IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT OUR RDTS PERFORM EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING  THE MOST ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE TEST RESULTS AVAILABLE WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, MINIMIZING THE TRANSFERENCE OF A POTENTIALLY  INFECTED BLOOD SAMPLE. THE EXPRESS AND CASSETTE DIAGNOSTIC KITS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING ARE DESIGNED FOR USE IN RESOURCE-POOR  COUNTRIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, ESPECIALLY IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA, WHERE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COORDINATES POPULATION SCREENING  FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES. WE RECENTLY FILLED OUR FIRST INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL ORDER FOR 40,000 UNITS OF ITS  NGDX -MALARIA  PF/PV CASSETTE TEST KIT  TO IMRES, BV, A NETHERLANDS-BASED MEDICAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS WAS RECENTLY GRANTED A CE MARK CERTIFICATION UNDER THE EUROPEAN MEDICAL DEVICES DIRECTIVE (MDD) FOR ITS THE EXPRESS  II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY  ,  A RAPID POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY FOR THE DETECTION OF SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES IN PRIMARY  AND SECONDARY SYPHILIS. THE ASSAY IS BASED UPON NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTIC\u2019S INNOVATIVE PATENT PENDING POINT-OF-CARE DIAGNOSTIC  PLATFORM, THE EXPRESS II. THE ACCURACY OF THE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY IS EQUAL TO OR BETTER THAN STANDARD LABORATORY  ASSAYS FOR SYPHILIS ANTIBODIES WITH SENSITIVITIES AND SPECIFICITIES OF OVER 99%.  36  WITH  THE RECEIPT OF THE CE MARK CERTIFICATION FOR ITS RAPID POINT-OF-CARE EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY, WE BELIEVE NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS IS WELL SITUATED TO ENTER INTO THIS GROWING SYPHILIS TESTING MARKET AND WILL NOW PURSUE MARKETING EFFORTS IN EUROPE  AND, IN PARALLEL, BEGIN PLANS FOR THE FILING OF A 510K APPLICATION WITH THE UNITED STATES FDA FOR MARKETING CLEARANCE IN THE UNITED  STATES. TO THIS END, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS IS FULLY QUALIFIED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TEST DEVELOPER AND MANUFACTURER UNDER FDA GOOD MANUFACTURING  PROCEDURES (GMP) AND IS CERTIFIED BY THE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ORGANIZATION FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF MEDICAL DEVICES UNDER ISO  13485-2016 REGULATIONS.  NUGENEREX  DIAGNOSTICS HAS JUST BEGUN A NEW INITIATIVE WHICH REVOLVES AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTITATIVE RAPID DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS. THESE  ASSAYS ALLOW LABORATORY PERSONNEL AND CLINICIANS TO ASSESS THE ABSOLUTE AMOUNT OF SPECIFIC TARGET MOLECULES IN BLOOD OR SERUM  SAMPLES AS OPPOSED TO \u201cYES\u201d OR \u201cNO\u201d RESULTS OF QUALITATIVE RDTS. THE FIRST ASSAY TO BE DEVELOPED IS A  MULTIPLEX BIOMARKER TEST FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF SEPSIS AND THE POTENTIAL DIFFERENTIATION OF INFECTIOUS SEPSIS FROM SYSTEMIC IMMUNE  RESPONSE SYNDROME (SIRS).  WE  MAINTAIN AN FDA REGISTERED FACILITY IN MIRAMAR, FLORIDA AND ARE CERTIFIED UNDER BOTH ISO9001 AND ISO13485 FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT,  PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE IN-VITRO DEVICES. APPROVAL OF OUR HIV RAPID TEST HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY  FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID). ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS QUALIFIED FOR AND CARRY THE EUROPEAN UNION \u201cCE\u201d  MARK, WHICH ALLOWS US TO ENTER INTO CE MEMBER COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE TWO MALARIA  RAPID TESTS APPROVED UNDER WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) GUIDELINES. THIS PROCESS ALLOWS EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF RAPID TESTS,  REDUCING THE CURRENT 24 -30-MONTH PROCESS DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 6-9 MONTHS. WHO APPROVAL IS NECESSARY FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO BE USED  IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH RELY UPON THE EXPERTISE OF THE WHO, AS WELL AS FOR NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (\u201cNGO\u201d)  FUNDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  WE  MAINTAIN CURRENT U.S. CERTIFICATES OF EXPORTABILITY THAT ARE ISSUED BY TWO FDA DIVISIONS-CBER AND CDRH. CBER (CENTER FOR BIOLOGICALS  EVALUATION AND RESEARCH) IS THE FDA REGULATORY DIVISION THAT OVERSEES INFECTIOUS DISEASE DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES, INCLUDING OUR HIV,  HEPATITIS B AND HEPATITIS C EXPRESS AND EXPRESS II KITS. THE OTHER DIVISION, CENTER FOR DEVICES AND RADIOLOGICAL HEALTH (CDRH),  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT OF OTHER HDS DEVICES WHICH INCLUDE TUBERCULOSIS, SYPHILIS, AND THE REMAINING PRODUCT LINE. OUR  HDS FACILITY MAINTAINS FDA ESTABLISHMENT REGISTRATION STATUS AND IS IN ACCORD WITH GMP (GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICE) AS CONFIRMED  BY THE FDA.  WE  DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE FDA CLEARANCE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE INTEND TO SUBMIT SELECTED DEVICES TO THE FDA  UNDER A PRE-MARKET APPROVAL APPLICATION (PMA) OR THROUGH THE 510K PROCESS. THE 510K WOULD REQUIRE THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY ADMINISTRATIVE  SUBMISSIONS AS WELL AS A LIMITED SCIENTIFIC REVIEW BY THE FDA TO DETERMINE COMPLETENESS (ACCEPTANCE AND FILING REVIEWS); IN-DEPTH  SCIENTIFIC, REGULATORY, AND QUALITY SYSTEM REVIEW BY APPROPRIATE FDA PERSONNEL (SUBSTANTIVE REVIEW); REVIEW AND RECOMMENDATION  BY THE APPROPRIATE ADVISORY COMMITTEE (PANEL REVIEW); AND FINAL DELIBERATIONS, DOCUMENTATION, AND NOTIFICATION OF THE FDA DECISION.  THE PMA PROCESS IS MORE EXTENSIVE, REQUIRING CLINICAL TRIALS TO SUPPORT THE APPLICATION. WE EXPECT TO APPLY TO THE FDA FOR CLEARANCE  OF OUR FIRST RDT (EXPRESS II SYPHILIS TREPONEMAL ASSAY) FOR FDA 510K APPROVAL IN EARLY 2020. WE ANTICIPATE THE FDA PROCESS WILL  BE COMPLETED WITHIN 9 MONTHS AFTER SUBMISSION. DURING THIS TIMELINE, WE WILL BE PREPARING DOCUMENTATION FOR ADDITIONAL RAPID TESTS  TO UNDERGO EITHER THE FDA PMA OR 510K PROCESS.  37  GENEREX  PLANS TO USE THE NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS SUBSIDIARY TO BUILD A MULTI-FACETED DIAGNOSTICS BUSINESS FOCUSED ON PERSONALIZED MEDICINE.  TO THAT END, WE ARE EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES IN MULTIPLEX ASSAYS FOR POINT-OF-CARE INFECTIOUS DISEASE TESTING, PHARMACOGENOMIC  TESTING FOR MEDICATION MANAGEMENT, AND BIOMARKER ANALYSIS FOR PERSONALIZED CANCER TREATMENT, INCLUDING IMMUNOTHERAPY.

THOSE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH INVEST IN OUR NEW MSO MODEL WILL BE ALIGNED SOLELY WITH OUR GNBT  SHAREHOLDERS AND WILL RECEIVE DISCOUNT CODES TO PROCURE OUR PRODUCTS SUCH AS EXCELLAGEN.  DME-IQ  NUGENEREX  DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS IS PLANNING A LAUNCH DME-IQ, A NOVEL SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS) SOLUTION FOR PHYSICIANS TO MANAGE IN-OFFICE  DISTRIBUTION OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT (DME). DME-IQ SUPPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF COMPLIANT AND PROFITABLE IN-OFFICE  DME PROGRAMS. DME-IQ FOCUSES ON SEVERAL KEY AREAS WHICH INCLUDE NEGOTIATING ON BEHALF OF THE PHYSICIANS WITH KEY VENDORS TO DECREASE  THE COGS (COST OF GOODS SOLD), INCREASING INSURANCE COLLECTIONS BY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF THE CODING DURING THE BILLING PROCESS,  PROVIDING THE NECESSARY PERSONNEL TO MANAGE THE APPEALS PROCESSES, AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.  DME-IQ  WILL AUTOMATE AND PROVIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC PRACTICES WITH A PROPRIETARY, TABLET-BASED SOFTWARE PACKAGE THAT IMMEDIATELY VERIFIES  PATIENT BENEFITS AND ELIGIBILITY. THIS UNIQUE SYSTEM MANAGES DME INVENTORY, COLLECTS PATIENT COPAYS AND DEDUCTIBLES, AND LINKS  PATIENT INFORMATION WITH THE DME PRODUCTS AND NECESSARY PATIENT FORMS ALL IN ONE EASY TO USE PLATFORM.  THE  DME MARKET  THE US  MARKET FOR DME IS LARGE AND GROWING, A RESULT OF SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE RISING PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASES REQUIRING  LONG-TERM CARE, THE RAPIDLY GROWING GERIATRIC POPULATION, AND THE TREND TOWARD HOME HEALTHCARE SERVICES. CHRONIC DISORDERS SUCH  AS DIABETES, DIABETIC FOOT & PRESSURE ULCERS, CHRONIC PAIN, AND CANCER THAT REQUIRE LONG-TERM PATIENT CARE AND POSTOPERATIVE  RECOVERY ARE DRIVING DEMAND FOR DME. ACCORDING TO A 2018 MARKET REPORT BY GRAND VIEW RESEARCH, INC., THE US DME MARKET IS EXPECTED  TO REACH $70.8 BILLION BY 2025, GROWING AT A 6.0% CAGR DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD.  DME-IQ  TRACKS AND MAINTAINS DME INVENTORY TO ENSURE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY AND PRODUCT MIX FOR ORTHOPEDIC PATIENT POPULATIONS, AND THE SYSTEM  FACILITATES INSURANCE CLAIM SUBMISSIONS AND ADJUDICATION TO HELP ACHIEVE OPTIMAL REIMBURSEMENTS. WITH THE DME-IQ SYSTEM, THE PRACTICE  GAINS CONTROL OF THEIR DME PROGRAM FROM AN OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, WHILE PATIENTS GAIN ACCESS TO A WIDER VARIETY  OF DME PRODUCTS THAT ARE CUSTOM FITTED FOR THEIR NEEDS.  THE  EXPLOSION OF HIGH DEDUCTIBLE INSURANCE PLANS HAS RESULTED IN A DRAMATIC INCREASE OF PATIENT OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS FOR CARE, AND  THE SUBSEQUENT REQUIREMENT THAT PHYSICIANS SPEND MORE TIME AS COLLECTION AGENTS RATHER THAN DOCTORS. DME-IQ PROVIDES PRACTICE  WORKFLOW SOLUTIONS FOR DME WITH CUSTOM, TABLET-BASED SOFTWARE THAT REMOVES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN FROM THE PRACTICE, FACILITATING  PATIENT ELIGIBILITY REVIEW, COLLECTION OF PATIENT CO-PAY AND DEDUCTIBLES, CENTRALIZED INSURANCE ADJUDICATION, DME PRODUCT PROCUREMENT,  AND OTHER SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ALLOW PHYSICIAN PRACTICES TO INCREASE REVENUE AND SERVICE QUALITY.

SINCE ITS FORMATION IN MAY 2013 AS ASANA MEDICAL INC., REGENTYS HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A FIRST-IN-CLASS TISSUE  ENGINEERED THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) AND OTHER INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES.  ULCERATIVE  COLITIS  ACCORDING  TO AN ARTICLE THAT WAS PUBLISHED IN THE LANCET ON DECEMBER 23, 2018 NAMED  WORLDWIDE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF INFLAMMATORY  BOWEL DISEASE IN THE 21ST CENTURY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF POPULATION-BASED STUDIES.  (2018 DEC 23;390(10114):2769-2778)  ,  ULCERATIVE COLITIS AFFECTS AN ESTIMATED 3.2 MILLION PATIENTS IN EUROPE, THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN. IT IS A CHRONIC, INFLAMMATORY  DISEASE THAT CAUSES SORES OR ULCERS IN THE LINING OF THE LARGE INTESTINE (THE COLON). IMMUNOLOGICAL IN NATURE, UC IS THOUGHT TO  BE FACILITATED BY A VARIETY OF HEREDITARY, GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AND IT IS INCREASINGLY BEING DIAGNOSED IN MORE URBANIZED  AREAS. SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING URGENCY, BLEEDING, AND DIARRHEA, THAT SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECT QUALITY OF LIFE.  REGENTYSTM  EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX HYDROGEL (\u201cECMH\u201d)  REGENTYS\u2019  INITIAL PRODUCT, ECMHTM RECTAL SOLUTION, IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS, NON-PHARMACOLOGIC, NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR MILLIONS  OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD TO MODERATE ULCERATIVE COLITIS.  ITS PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS A POWDER THAT IS RECONSTITUTED  WITH SALINE AND DELIVERED AS A LIQUID VIA ENEMA. AS ECMH REACHES BODY TEMPERATURE, IT GELS AND COATS THE MUCOSAL LINING OF THE  GI TRACT.  THE  CORE TECHNOLOGY IS DERIVED FROM ECM, A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FDA-APPROVED BASE NOW EXTENSIVELY USED FOR SURGICAL APPLICATIONS  AND WOUND TREATMENT. ECMH ACTS AS A BIO-SCAFFOLD, SEPARATING THE DAMAGED TISSUE FROM WASTE FLOW, COVERING ULCERATIONS TO LIMIT  THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE, AND FACILITATING A HEALING ENVIRONMENT USING ENDOGENOUS (THE BODY\u2019S OWN) STEM CELLS.  PRE-CLINICAL  RESULTS  PUBLISHED  PRE-CLINICAL RESULTS IN THE  JOURNAL OF CROHN\u2019S AND COLITIS  HIGHLIGHT THE PROMISE OF REGENTYS TECHNOLOGY.  ANIMAL DATA SHOW THE ECMH THERAPY CAN BOTH ALLEVIATE CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND FACILITATE HEALING IN UC PATIENTS. PREVIOUS PRE-CLINICAL  ECM ANIMAL DATA FOR APPROVED PRODUCTS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A HIGH CORRELATION WITH HUMAN DATA.  COMPETITION  CURRENTLY  FOUR BIOLOGICS ARE FDA-APPROVED, INCLUDING TOP-SELLING ANTIBODY MEDICINES HUMIRA\u00ae (ADALIMUMAB), SIMPONI\u00ae (GOLIMUMAB),  REMICADE\u00ae (INFLIXIMAB) AND ENTYVIO\u00ae (VEDOLIZUMAB), ALL OF WHICH ACT TO SUPPRESS THE PRO-INFLAMMATORY PROTEIN, TNF-A (TUMOR  NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA), A LEADING CAUSE OF THE PROLIFERATION OF ULCERATIVE COLIS AND OTHER FORMS OF IDB. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH THESE  OPTIONS, MORE THAN HALF OF ALL UC PATIENTS DO NOT ACHIEVE LONG-TERM REMISSION. MOREOVER, 20-30% OF NON-RESPONSIVE PATIENTS WILL  UNDERGO COLON REMOVAL SURGERY IN AN ATTEMPT TO REMEDIATE THE DISEASE.  REGENTYS  ADVANTAGES  WE  EXPECT OUR PRODUCT TO OFFER A TRUE ALTERNATIVE TO PATIENTS NON-RESPONSIVE TO FIRST LINE THERAPIES SUCH AS 5-ASA. UNRESPONSIVE  PATIENTS WILL THEN NEED TO CHOOSE AMONG THERAPIES THAT ALTER THE BODY\u2019S IMMUNE SYSTEM OR POSE LONG TERM HEALTH RISKS OR  PERHAPS BOTH. REGENTYS\u2019 TECHNOLOGY IS EXPECTED TO ENABLE TARGETED TISSUE HEALING BUT POSE NONE OF THE HEALTH RISKS OF MORE  EXPENSIVE MARKET-LEADING BIOLOGICS THAT GENERALLY SUPPRESS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM. WE EXPECT TO PROVIDE OUR THERAPY AT A COST LESS  THAN OTHER THERAPIES.  41  MARKET  IN  2023, WHEN WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE APPROVAL, THE PROJECTED DRUG COSTS FOR UC ALONE ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED $7.5B GLOBALLY ACCORDING  TO A 2017 REPORT BY ALLIED MARKET RESEARCH; INCLUDING OTHER INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE INDICATIONS, THE GLOBAL MARKET IS EXPECTED  TO BE DOUBLE THE UC MARKET. BASED UPON THE NATURE OF IBD, AND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REGENTYS\u2019 TECHNOLOGY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES  VARIATIONS OF REGENTYS\u2019 CORE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALSO BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING IBD DISEASES SUCH AS CROHN\u2019S, RECTAL MUCOSITIS,  PROCTITIS AND ANAL FISSURES.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY  REGENTYS  IN-LICENSED PATENTS AND CO-DEVELOPED ITS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH. IT NOW HOLDS PATENT RIGHTS IN  US AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND HAS OTHER GLOBAL FILINGS PENDING; AS WELL, IT HAS PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING FOR SIMILAR INDICATIONS  PREDICATED ON ITS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY IN OTHER MAJOR GLOBAL MARKETS.  REGULATORY  PATH  THE FDA HAS  AFFIRMED OUR APPROACH TO FILE A 510(K)  DE NOVO  APPLICATION ON ITS ECM HYDROGEL. WE HAVE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL  AND HAS ENGAGED A CLINICAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO MANAGE THE CONDUCT OF ITS FIRST-IN-HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS EXPECTED TO START  IN Q2/Q3 2020 IN AUSTRALIA.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENGAGED CONSULTANTS TO ASSIST IN MANAGING THE TRIALS AND REGULATORY APPROVAL  PROCESS IN AUSTRALIA, THE US AND EUROPE, JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE INITIALLY EXPECT TO UNDERTAKE CLINICAL TRIALS AND, AMONG OTHER  MARKETS, WHERE IT WILL FIRST SEEK GOVERNMENTAL APPROVAL TO PROMOTE AND SELL MEDICAL DEVICES.  PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT  SINCE  2013, WE HAVE MAINTAINED A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH SUPPLEMENTED WITH PERSONNEL FROM  THE AFFILIATED MCGOWAN INSTITUTE OF REGENERATIVE MEDICINE. IN FEBRUARY 2018, REGENTYS ENTERED INTO A DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH  (AND HAS RECEIVED A CO-INVESTMENT BY) COOK BIOTECH, INC., A GLOBAL LEADER IN ECM MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY (COOKBIO). PRODUCT BATCHES  NOW ON HAND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING. A LARGER CLINICAL BATCH WITH FINALIZED SPECIFICATIONS  WILL BE GENERATED IN THE COMING MONTHS FOR USE IN CLINICAL TRIALS. THERE ARE ALTERNATE PROVIDERS OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WHO CAN  ASSIST WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. NOTWITHSTANDING THESE OPTIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF ONGOING  DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND THE RELIANCE UPON CERTAIN BENCH AND MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND ECM PRODUCT EXPERTISE AND TECHNOLOGY,  ANY INTERRUPTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH COOKBIO WOULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES OF TIME AND  COST TO DUPLICATE THE PRODUCT.  MANUFACTURING  REGENTYS  HAS AN EXCLUSIVE MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT WITH COOKBIO FOR THE PRODUCTION OF BIOMATERIAL AND USE OF ITS PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY  CONDITIONED UPON THE COMPLETION OF FINAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT WORK. MANAGEMENT HAS NEGOTIATED AN AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER  FOR PRODUCT COMPONENTS AND KITTING. WE BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ALTERNATE SOURCES OF THESE MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY SERVICES. HOWEVER,  BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF REGULATION IN THE MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY, AND THE RELIANCE UPON THE COLLECTION, REPORTING AND MANAGEMENT  OF MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURING DATA, A CHANGE OF MANUFACTURER WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACT THE TIME AND COST REQUIRED FOR CLINICAL  PRODUCT PRODUCTION AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.  OPERATIONS  CURRENTLY,  REGENTYS EMPLOYS FOUR FULL-TIME CONTRACT EMPLOYEE AND SEVERAL PART-TIME CONSULTANTS. WE SUPPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS BY  ENGAGING EXTERNAL LEGAL (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, CORPORATE AND HEALTH CARE), ACCOUNTING AND TAX PROFESSIONALS. WE ALSO HAVE CONTRACTED  WITH INFORMATION SERVICES, REGULATORY AND CLINICAL TRIAL COMPANIES WHO MAKE AVAILABLE PROFESSIONALS TO MANAGE THE INFORMATION  SERVICES, REGULATORY, CLINICAL, AND COMPLIANCE ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS. UPON PAYMENT OF THE INTERIM NOTE, REGENTYS WILL FORMALLY  ADD TWO CONTRACT EMPLOYEES, ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF AND A THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER TO ASSIST WITH EMPLOYEE PAYROLL AND BENEFITS  AS WELL AS UNDERTAKE CLINICAL TRIAL ACTIVITIES SUING EXTERNAL SUPPORT.  42  NUGENEREX  SURGICAL PRODUCTS  MEDISOURCE  PARTNERS & PANTHEON MEDICAL \u2013 FOOT & ANKLE  PANTHEON  MEDICAL IS A MANUFACTURER OF ORTHOPEDIC FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY KITS THAT OFFER PHYSICIAN FRIENDLY \u201cALL-IN-ONE,\u201d  INTEGRATED SURGICAL KITS THAT INCLUDE PLATES, SCREWS, AND TOOLS REQUIRED FOR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS AND PODIATRISTS CONDUCTING FOOT  AND ANKLE SURGERIES.

THE HMO INFRASTRUCTURE WILL BE MANAGED BY BEACON HEALTH SOLUTIONS, WHICH HAS  PROVIDED BACK-END SERVICES FOR HMOS SINCE 2009.  ACCOUNTING  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  OUR  MAJOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE THE REFINEMENT OF OUR PLATFORM BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, OUR BUCCAL INSULIN PROJECT  (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) AND ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES.  WE  DID NOT EXPEND ANY MATERIAL RESOURCES ON OUR BUCCAL INSULIN (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) OR OTHER ORAL DELIVERY PRODUCTS IN THE FISCAL  QUARTERS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER LATE-STAGE TRIALS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED  STATES MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FUNDS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON HAND.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2020 AND 2019, NGIO EXPENSED $142,200 AND $0, RESPECTIVELY, TO NSABP FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND  DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO NGIO\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNE THERAPEUTIC VACCINES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. ONE NGIO VACCINE IS  CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST CANCER, AND WE  HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL FOR AN NGIO VACCINE FOR H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AT THE  LEBANESE-CANADIAN HOSPITAL IN BEIRUT. ANTIGEN\u2019S PROSTATE CANCER VACCINE BASED ON AE37 HAS BEEN TESTED IN A COMPLETED  (AUGUST 2009) PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN GREECE.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, NGDX INCURRED $250,221 AND $141,067 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO ITS RAPID  DIAGNOSTIC TESTS, RESPECTIVELY.  BECAUSE  OF VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR BUCCAL INSULIN OR ANTIGEN\u2019S  PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES OR RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE THE SUCCESS OF CURRENT STUDIES NET OPERATING  LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO NGDX, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED FINANCING AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN  IF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLETED AND SUCCESSFUL, OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTIES, AND THE SUCCESS OF SUCH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS. FOR THE SAME REASONS, WE CANNOT  PREDICT WHEN ANY PRODUCTS MAY BEGIN TO PRODUCE NET CASH INFLOWS.  44  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE  ARE NO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SET FORTH IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2019 FILED WITH THE SEC ON NOVEMBER  12, 2019, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS.  WE  HAVE ADOPTED A SEQUENCING POLICY WHEREBY, IN THE EVENT THAT RECLASSIFICATION OF CONTRACTS FROM EQUITY TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  IS NECESSARY PURSUANT TO ASC 815 DUE TO OUR INABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORIZED SHARES, SHARES WILL BE ALLOCATED  ON THE BASIS OF THE EARLIEST ISSUANCE DATE OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE INSTRUMENTS, WITH THE EARLIEST GRANTS RECEIVING THE FIRST ALLOCATION  OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES, AND ALL FUTURE INSTRUMENTS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF  INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES OR DIRECTORS.  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IT REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  GOING  CONCERN.  AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROFITABLE  AND HAVE REPORTED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  TO OPERATE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  . MANAGEMENT REVIEWS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING  AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS HAS OCCURRED BASED UPON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE  CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION.  MANAGEMENT DETERMINES VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 718, COMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES  VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO NON-EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND ASC 505, EQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES.  DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITY  .  FASB  ASC 815, DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, REQUIRES ALL DERIVATIVES TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET  AT FAIR VALUE. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITIES (NAMELY THOSE WITH A PRICE PROTECTION FEATURE) ARE SEPARATELY  VALUED AND ACCOUNTED FOR ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WITH ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM  CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020 AND JULY 31, 2019, WE USED THE BINOMIAL LATTICE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR  VALUE OF THESE WARRANTS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF THE BINOMIAL LATTICE OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCLUDE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE  EXERCISE PRICE OF THE WARRANTS, APPLICABLE VOLATILITY RATES, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, EXPECTED DIVIDENDS AND THE INSTRUMENT\u2019S  REMAINING TERM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE VARIABLES  DURING A PERIOD CAN RESULT IN MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE (AND RESULTANT GAINS OR LOSSES) OF THIS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT.  AS  REPORTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS A SEQUENCING POLICY REGARDING SHARE SETTLEMENT WHEREIN INSTRUMENTS WITH THE EARLIEST ISSUANCE  DATE WOULD BE SETTLED FIRST. THE SEQUENCING POLICY ALSO CONSIDERS CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE ADDITIONAL SHARES, SUCH AS THOSE ISSUABLE  UPON A STOCK SPLIT, TO HAVE AN ISSUANCE DATE TO COINCIDE WITH THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE ADDITIONAL SHARES.  ON  JANUARY 24, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NOTE PAYABLE WITH AN UNRELATED PARTY AT A PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT (VARIABLE) EXERCISE  PRICE WHICH CAUSES THE NUMBER TO BE CONVERTED INTO A NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES THAT \u201cAPPROACH INFINITY\u201d, AS THE UNDERLYING  STOCK PRICE COULD APPROACH ZERO. ACCORDINGLY, ALL CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS ISSUED AFTER JANUARY 24, 2019 ARE CONSIDERED DERIVATIVES  ACCORDING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SEQUENCING POLICY.  45  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, WE HAD NET REVENUES OF $857,427 AND $3,442,265, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF OPERATIONS  OF VENETO WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $9,000 OF REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM PANTHEON AND OLAREGEN OF APPROXIMATELY $805,000 AND $44,000, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAD A NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019 OF $7,280,030 AND $12,524,584, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2020 WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $4,397,000 IN THE  PRIOR FISCAL PERIOD AND $0 IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. ALSO, THERE WERE OPERATING LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4,558,000 AND $5,879,000  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THE $1,852,000 DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES IN THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 VERSUS THE COMPARATIVE PREVIOUS FISCAL QUARTER IS DUE TO THE DECREASE IN OPERATIONS  OF VENETO WHICH DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $3,274,000 WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $632,000 OF EXPENSES INCURRED FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED  ENTITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $585,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020.  OUR INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS $1,431,052 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S FISCAL THREE MONTHS OF $2,097,220 WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT RELATING TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES.  SIX  MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  AND 2019, WE HAD NET REVENUES OF $1,579,088 AND $5,161,413, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF OPERATIONS  OF VENETO WHICH RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $17,000 OF REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020. THE DECREASE WAS  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES FROM PANTHEON AND OLAREGEN OF APPROXIMATELY $1,254,000 AND $309,000, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAD A NET LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 OF $16,592,577 AND A NET GAIN OF $5,397,996 IN THE CORRESPONDING SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE NET  LOSS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $9,434,000  AND OTHER EXPENSES CONSISTING OF CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $3,670,000, AND INTEREST EXPENSE  OF APPROXIMATELY $3,947,000. THE NET GAIN FOR THE SIX MONTHS OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WAS CAUSED PRIMARILY BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR  VALUE OF CONTINGENT PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY $15,148,000 WHICH DID NOT EXIST DURING THE FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THE $662,212 INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 VERSUS THE COMPARATIVE PREVIOUS SIX MONTH PERIOD IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION  EXPENSE OF $585,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020.  OUR INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY $3,947,000 COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR\u2019S FISCAL THREE MONTHS OF APPROXIMATELY $2,262,000  WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT RELATING TO THE CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES.  FINANCIAL  CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND RESOURCES  SOURCES  OF LIQUIDITY  TO  DATE WE HAVE FINANCED OUR DEVELOPMENT STAGE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK, SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE  INTO OUR COMMON STOCK, AND INVESTOR LOANS. WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANY  DEVELOPMENT OR OTHER ACTIVITIES. NGDX WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANY DEVELOPMENT  OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OR WILL NEED TO CURTAIL ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER PLANNED ACTIVITIES OR SUSPEND OPERATIONS. NGDX  WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RELY ON ITS FORMER PRIMARY OWNER FOR NECESSARY FINANCING. GOING FORWARD, NGDX WILL RELY ON GENEREX FINANCING  ACTIVITIES TO FUND NGDX OPERATIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ACTIVITIES.  AS  OF MARCH 13, 2020, THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR TWELVE MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. ANTICIPATED REVENUES  ASSOCIATED WITH MEDISOURCE AND PANTHEON ACQUISITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO ALTER THE CASH FLOW LANDSCAPE.  WHILE  WE HAVE FINANCED OUR DEVELOPMENT STAGE ACTIVITIES TO DATE PRIMARILY THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND SECURITIES  CONVERTIBLE INTO OUR COMMON STOCK, AS WELL AS INVESTOR NOTES, AND RAISED APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020 (INCLUDING PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES), OUR CASH BALANCES HAVE BEEN LOW THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2019.  46  MANAGEMENT  MAY SEEK TO MEET ALL OR SOME OF OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS THROUGH FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF  OUR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK OFFERINGS AND OFFERINGS OF DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS THROUGH MERGER OR  ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.  IN  ADDITION, MANAGEMENT IS ACTIVELY PURSUING FINANCIAL AND STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND DIVESTITURES,  INDUSTRY COLLABORATION ACTIVITIES, AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERS. MANAGEMENT HAS SOLD NON-ESSENTIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS WHICH  ARE CLASSIFIED AS ASSETS HELD FOR INVESTMENT TO AUGMENT THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION AND REDUCE ITS LONG-TERM DEBT.  WE  WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS TO CONTINUE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS  OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES, FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ORAL-LYNTM AND TO COMMENCE SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS IF THE FDA  OR OTHER REGULATORY APPROVALS ARE OBTAINED.  FINANCINGS  THE  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT WE HAVE COMPLETED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020.  CONVERTIBLE  NOTE TRANSACTIONS  FINANCING  \u2013 AUGUST 8, 2019  ON  AUGUST 8, 2019, BORROWED $1,000,000 FROM AN INVESTOR WITH A $150,000 ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT.

TABULAR  DISCLOSURE OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  GENEREX  IS A SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY AS DEFINED BY RULE 12B-2 OF THE EXCHANGE ACT AND IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED  UNDER THIS ITEM.  RECENTLY  ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04,  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  (TOPIC 350), WHICH ELIMINATES  STEP 2 FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY SHOULD PERFORM ITS ANNUAL OR INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST BY  COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT AND RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH  THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE, NOT TO EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING  UNIT. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE STANDARD EFFECTIVE AUGUST 1, 2020. THE COMPANY IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT ASU 2017-04 WILL  HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN  JULY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-11,  EARNINGS PER SHARE (TOPIC 260), DISTINGUISHING LIABILITIES FROM EQUITY (TOPIC  480) AND DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): I. ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES; II. REPLACEMENT  OF THE INDEFINITE DEFERRAL FOR MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OF CERTAIN NONPUBLIC ENTITIES AND CERTAIN MANDATORILY  REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS WITH A SCOPE EXCEPTION.  PART I OF THIS UPDATE ADDRESSES THE COMPLEXITY  OF ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES. DOWN ROUND FEATURES ARE FEATURES OF CERTAIN EQUITY-LINKED  INSTRUMENTS (OR EMBEDDED FEATURES) THAT RESULT IN THE STRIKE PRICE BEING REDUCED ON THE BASIS OF THE PRICING OF FUTURE EQUITY  OFFERINGS. CURRENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE CREATES COST AND COMPLEXITY FOR ENTITIES THAT ISSUE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (SUCH AS WARRANTS  AND CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS) WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES THAT REQUIRE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF THE ENTIRE INSTRUMENT OR CONVERSION  OPTION. PART II OF THIS UPDATE ADDRESSES THE DIFFICULTY OF NAVIGATING  TOPIC 480, DISTINGUISHING LIABILITIES FROM  EQUITY  , BECAUSE OF THE EXISTENCE OF EXTENSIVE PENDING CONTENT IN THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. THIS PENDING  CONTENT IS THE RESULT OF THE INDEFINITE DEFERRAL OF ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS ABOUT MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  OF CERTAIN NONPUBLIC ENTITIES AND CERTAIN MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. THE AMENDMENTS IN PART II  OF THIS UPDATE DO NOT HAVE AN ACCOUNTING EFFECT. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER  DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED, INCLUDING ADOPTION IN AN INTERIM PERIOD. THE COMPANY EARLY ADOPTED THE ASU  2017-11 IN THE SECOND QUARTER AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  IN  FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-02,  INCOME STATEMENT \u2013 REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).  RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  , WHICH WAS ISSUED TO ADDRESS THE INCOME  TAX ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME DUE TO THE PROHIBITION OF BACKWARD TRACING  DUE TO AN INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE THAT WAS INITIALLY RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THIS ISSUE CAME ABOUT FROM THE ENACTMENT  OF THE TCJA ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 THAT CHANGED THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY  1, 2018 AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A TERRITORIAL-STYLE SYSTEM FOR TAXING FOREIGN-SOURCE INCOME OF DOMESTIC MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE SEC ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118, INCOME TAX ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE ACT (\u201cSAB118\u201d),  WHICH ALLOWS US TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A MEASUREMENT PERIOD NOT TO EXTEND BEYOND ONE YEAR OF THE ENACTMENT. THE  COMPANY REMEASURED ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF JULY 31, 2018, APPLYING THE REDUCED CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE  AND RECORDED A PROVISIONAL DECREASE TO THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $31,876,520, WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION  ALLOWANCE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE  TAX ACT AND THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS AS OF JULY 31, 2019.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK-CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE  REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\u201d, WHICH ADDS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS TO TOPIC 820 FOR THE RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE  OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO DEVELOP LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTACHED UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S  AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCUSSION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019.  EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  THE  COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE HAS STAYED STEADY THROUGH THE THREE QUARTERS, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN SALES, MANAGING COST OF SALES  NUMBERS, AND STRONG INVESTMENT RETURNS. THIS IS DUE TO THE CONTINUATION OF OUR QUALITY USA MADE PRODUCTS WITH THE ABILITY FOR  CUSTOMIZATION, OUR NOTABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND THE PURCHASE OF THE ASSETS OF LABOR SAVING DEVICES, INC. OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE  GAINING BUSINESS FROM A COMPETITOR THAT IS GETTING OUT OF THE SECURITY SWITCH BUSINESS AND TO CONTINUE LOOKING AT BUSINESSES THAT  MIGHT BE A GOOD FIT TO PURCHASE. NEW CHALLENGES THE COMPANY HAS ENDURED OVER THE NINE MONTHS OF THIS FISCAL YEAR INCLUDE CONTINUING  TO GET PRODUCT OUT TO CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELIER MANNER AND TO FILL THE STOCKROOM WITH INVENTORY TO GET BACK TO SHIPPING OUT CORE  PRODUCTS THE SAME DAY. ALSO, THE PRICE OF RAW MATERIALS HAS INCREASED WITH THE EXECUTION OF TARIFFS BY THE US GOVERNMENT AND OTHER  FACTORS. THE COVID-19 VIRUS IS ALSO A CONCERN FOR MANAGEMENT AS AVAILABILITY TO GET RAW MATERIALS MAY BE HAMPERED BY THE PANDEMIC.  BUT MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO WORK AT KEEPING OPERATIONS FLOWING AS EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE WITH THE HOPES OF GETTING THE FACILITIES  RUNNING LEANER AND MORE PROFITABLE THAN EVER BEFORE.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  \u25cf  NET  SALES WERE $3,589,000 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020, WHICH IS A 3.88% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER LAST  YEAR. YEAR-TO-DATE NET SALES WERE $10,852,000 AT JANUARY 31, 2020, WHICH IS A 2.85% INCREASE FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE STEADY GROWTH IN SALES IS DUE TO OUR ONGOING COMMITMENT TO OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE AND OUR ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO SEEING GROWTH SINCE A MAJOR COMPETITOR CLOSED ITS DOORS AT THE END OF 2019.  \u25cf  COST  OF GOODS SOLD WAS 51.04% OF NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AND WAS 51.29% FOR THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  YEAR-TO-DATE COST OF GOODS SOLD PERCENTAGES WERE 50.33% FOR THE CURRENT NINE MONTHS AND 51.81% FOR THE CORRESPONDING NINE  MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHICH IS JUST SLIGHTLY OVER THE TARGET OF LESS THAN 50% FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE RESULTS. MANAGEMENT  HAS SEEN INCREASES IN LABOR AND MATERIALS COSTS AND INITIATED A PRICE INCREASE THAT STARTED IN JANUARY 2020.  \u25cf  OPERATING  EXPENSES INCREASED BY $72,000 FOR THE QUARTER AS THEY INCREASED BY $107,000 FOR THE NINE-MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS LAST YEAR. THESE INCREASED COSTS ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMMISSIONS AND WAGES  FOR RAISES AND THE HIRING OF MORE EMPLOYEES.  23  \u25cf  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS AT $834,000 WHICH IS A 0.24% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING QUARTER  LAST YEAR, WHICH HAD INCOME FROM OPERATIONS OF $832,000. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020  WAS AT $2,690,000, WHICH IS A 7.99% INCREASE FROM THE CORRESPONDING NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHICH HAD INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  OF $2,491,000.  \u25cf  OTHER  INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE UP $373,000 WHEN COMPARING TO THE CURRENT QUARTER TO THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR. COMPARATIVELY,  THERE IS AN INCREASE OF $808,000 IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE NUMBERS. THE MAJORITY OF ACTIVITY  IN THESE ACCOUNTS CONSISTS OF INVESTMENT INTEREST, DIVIDENDS, AND GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE OF INVESTMENTS, BUT THE BIGGEST FACTOR  IS THAT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE NOW BEING SHOWN IN THE INCOME STATEMENT STARTING THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  \u25cf  OVERALL,  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS UP $191,000, OR 16.28%, FROM THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  SIMILARLY, NET INCOME FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS UP $737,000, OR 28.80%, FROM THE  SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25cf  EARNINGS  PER COMMON SHARE FOR QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WERE $0.28 PER SHARE AND $0.67 PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE  NUMBERS. EPS FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE $0.24 PER SHARE AND $0.52 PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OPERATING  \u25cf  NET  CASH INCREASED $774,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $295,000 DURING THE CORRESPONDING  PERIOD LAST YEAR.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE DECREASED $460,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 COMPARED WITH A $514,000 DECREASE FOR THE SAME PERIOD  LAST YEAR. THE CURRENT YEAR DECREASE IS A RESULT OF IMPROVED SALES AND COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IMPROVED OVER LAST  YEAR. AN ANALYSIS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SHOWS THAT THERE WERE ONLY 0.30% THAT WERE OVER 90 DAYS AT JANUARY 31, 2020.  \u25cf  INVENTORIES  INCREASED $506,000 DURING THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $999,000 LAST YEAR. THE SMALLER INCREASE  IN THE CURRENT YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES, NOT HAVING A STOCKPILE OF FINISHED GOODS, AND SOME ISSUES WITH GETTING  SOME VITAL RAW MATERIALS IN A TIMELY MANNER.  \u25cf  PREPAID  EXPENSES SAW A $43,000 DECREASE FOR THE CURRENT NINE MONTHS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY BEING DELIVERED THAT HAD BEEN PAID  FOR IN ADVANCE. THE PRIOR NINE MONTHS SHOWED A $164,000 DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES.  \u25cf  INCOME  TAX OVERPAYMENT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 DECREASED $142,000, AS THE OVERPAYMENT SHOWED AN INCREASE OF $106,000  FOR THE SAME PERIOD THE PRIOR YEAR. THE MAIN REASON FOR THE CURRENT DECREASE IS THAT THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED ADDITIONAL  INCOME WITHOUT THE NEED TO INCREASE INCOME TAX ESTIMATES.  \u25cf  ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE SHOWS A $16,000 INCREASE FOR THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 AS COMPARED TO A $35,000 DECREASE  FOR THE PRIOR NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO PAY ALL INVOICES WITHIN TERMS, AND THE VARIANCE IN INCREASES IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECEIPT OF PRODUCTS AND PAYMENT OF INVOICES.  \u25cf  ACCRUED  EXPENSES DID NOT HAVE ANY CASH FLOW CHANGE FOR THE CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD AS COMPARED TO A $36,000 DECREASE FOR THE NINE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  24  INVESTING  \u25cf  AS  FOR OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY $468,000 ON ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE  CURRENT NINE-MONTH PERIOD, IN COMPARISON WITH THE CORRESPONDING NINE MONTHS LAST YEAR, WHERE THERE WAS ACTIVITY OF $88,000.  \u25cf  ADDITIONALLY,  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURCHASE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MUNICIPAL BONDS AND QUALITY STOCKS. DURING THE NINE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF BUY/SELL ACTIVITY IN THE INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS. NET CASH SPENT ON PURCHASES  OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020 WAS $640,000 COMPARED TO $839,000 SPENT IN THE PRIOR  NINE-MONTH PERIOD. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO USE \u201cMONEY MANAGER\u201d ACCOUNTS FOR MOST STOCK TRANSACTIONS. BY DOING  THIS, THE COMPANY GIVES AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY FIRM, WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THIS FIELD, PERMISSION TO BUY AND SELL STOCKS  AT WILL. THE COMPANY PAYS A QUARTERLY SERVICE FEE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS.  FINANCING  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURCHASE BACK COMMON STOCK WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY ARISES. FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2020,  THE COMPANY PURCHASED $71,000 WORTH OF TREASURY STOCK. THIS IS IN COMPARISON TO $62,000 SPENT IN THE SAME NINE MONTHS PERIOD  THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u25cf  THE  COMPANY PAID OUT DIVIDENDS OF $1,802,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020. THESE DIVIDENDS WERE PAID DURING  THE SECOND QUARTER. THE COMPANY DECLARED A DIVIDEND OF $0.40 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND THESE DIVIDENDS  WERE PAID BY OCTOBER 31, 2019. AS FOR THE PRIOR YEAR NUMBERS, DIVIDENDS PAID WAS $1,752,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING JANUARY  31, 2019. A DIVIDEND OF $0.38 PER COMMON SHARE WAS DECLARED AND PAID DURING THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER LAST YEAR.  THE  FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF RATIOS TO HELP ANALYZE GEORGE RISK INDUSTRIES\u2019 PERFORMANCE.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  JANUARY 31, 2019  WORKING CAPITAL  (CURRENT ASSETS \u2013 CURRENT LIABILITIES)  $39,119,000  $35,493,000  CURRENT RATIO  (CURRENT ASSETS / CURRENT LIABILITIES)  16.831  16.299  QUICK RATIO  ((CASH + INVESTMENTS + AR) / CURRENT LIABILITIES)  14.597  13.963  NEW  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  THE  COMPANY AND ITS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ENHANCEMENTS TO PRODUCT LINES, DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS WHICH COMPLEMENT  EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND LOOK FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE WELL SUITED TO OUR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES. ITEMS  CURRENTLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INCLUDE.  \u25cf  A  NEW FACE PLATE FOR OUR POOL ALARMS IS NEARING COMPLETION. THE INNOVATIVE DESIGN IS SLIM IN STYLE AND WILL ALSO ALLOW THE HOMEOWNER  TO CHANGE THE PLATE TO MATCH THEIR DE\u0301COR.  25  \u25cf  AN  UPDATED VERSION OF THE POOL ACCESS ALARM IS CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH ELECTRICAL LISTING TESTING. THIS NEXT-GENERATION MODEL  COMBINES OUR BATTERY OPERATED DPA SERIES WITH OUR HARD WIRED 289 SERIES. A VARIETY OF INSTALLATION OPTIONS WILL BE AVAILABLE  THROUGH JUMPER PIN SETTINGS.  \u25cf  WE  CONTINUE OUR WORK ON HIGH SECURITY SWITCHES. WE HAVE A TRIPLE BIASED HIGH SECURITY SWITCH DESIGN AND AN ADJUSTABLE MAGNET  DESIGN WAS COMPLETED FOR RECESSED MOUNTING APPLICATIONS. THIS IS READY TO BE SENT TO IN FOR ELECTRICAL LISTING TESTING.  \u25cf  WE  HAVE INTRODUCED THE GR1840 OVAL METAL DOOR CHANNEL MAGNET. THIS IS A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE OBSOLETE INTERLOGIX MAGNET.  THIS MAGNET FITS INTO THE TOP CHANNEL OF A METAL DOOR AND DOES NOT REQUIRE DRILLING INTO THE DOOR CORE. WE HAVE ALSO PAIRED  THIS WITH SEVERAL OF OUR 3\u20444\u201d AND 1\u201d STEEL DOOR CONTACTS.  \u25cf  WIRELESS  TECHNOLOGY IS A MAIN AREA OF FOCUS FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE CONSIDERING ADDING WIRELESS TECHNOLOGY TO SOME OF OUR CURRENT  PRODUCTS. A WIRELESS CONTACT SWITCH IS IN THE FINAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. ALSO, WE ARE WORKING ON WIRELESS VERSIONS OF OUR  POOL ACCESS ALARM AND ENVIRONMENTAL SENSORS THAT WILL BE EASY TO INSTALL IN CURRENT CONSTRUCTION. WE ARE ALSO CONCENTRATING  ON MAKING PRODUCTS COMPATIBLE WITH WI-FI, SMARTPHONE TECHNOLOGY AND THE INCREASING POPULAR Z-WAVE STANDARD FOR WIRELESS HOME  AUTOMATION.  \u25cf  WE  ARE READY TO LAUNCH A NEW LABOR SAVING DEVICE\u2019S PRODUCT. IT IS A 12\u201d ADJUSTABLE HOLE CUTTER WHICH COMPLIMENTS  THE POPULAR 10\u201d HOLE CUTTER. USING A STANDARD DRILL, THIS TOOL ALLOWS YOU TO DRILL VARIOUS SIZE HOLES IN THE CEILING  FOR SPEAKERS AND CANNED LIGHTS. THE DUST BIN, WHICH BUTS AGAINST THE CEILING, KEEPS THE CEILING MATERIAL AND DUST ENCLOSED  MAKING FOR A CLEAN, TIME SAVING INSTALLATION.  \u25cf  ANOTHER  LSDI PRODUCT IS NEW LIGHTED BULLNOSE TIP IN A VARIETY OF COLORS (RED, GREEN AND BLUE) TO GO ALONG WITH THE STANDARD CLEAR  LIGHTS. THESE COLORED LIGHTS ARE PLACED ON FIBERFUSE WIRE RUNNING RODS WHICH ALLOWS FOR EASY LOCATION OF THE ROD ENDS IN DARK  PLACES SUCH AS ATTICS AND CRAWLSPACES. THE RODS CAN BE COLOR CODED FOR WIRE PATHS RUNNING INTO DIFFERENT ROOMS. LARGER BATTERIES  ADD TO THE LONGEVITY OF THESE NEW LIGHTS.  OTHER  INFORMATION  IN  ADDITION TO RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS, MANAGEMENT IS ALWAYS OPEN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ACQUIRING A BUSINESS OR PRODUCT  LINE THAT WOULD COMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG CASH POSITION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS  COULD BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THE NEED FOR OUTSIDE FINANCING. THE INTENT IS TO UTILIZE THE EQUIPMENT, MARKETING TECHNIQUES AND ESTABLISHED  CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS AND INCREASE SALES AND PROFITS.  THERE  ARE NO KNOWN SEASONAL TRENDS WITH ANY OF GRI\u2019S PRODUCTS, SINCE WE SELL TO DISTRIBUTORS AND OEM MANUFACTURERS. OUR PRODUCTS  ARE TIED TO THE HOUSING INDUSTRY AND WILL FLUCTUATE WITH BUILDING TRENDS.  RECENTLY  ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN  FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d), WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE  FOR ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES. ASU 2016-02 REQUIRES LESSEES TO CLASSIFY LEASES AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING LEASES AND TO RECORD  A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR ALL LEASES WITH A TERM GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS REGARDLESS OF THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION.  THE LEASE CLASSIFICATION WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD OR  ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. ACCOUNTING FOR LESSORS REMAINS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM CURRENT GAAP. ASU 2016-02  IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING NOVEMBER 1, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-10  \u201cCODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 842, LEASES\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-10\u201d) AND ASU NO. 2018-11 \u201cLEASES (TOPIC  842) TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-11\u201d). ASU 2018-10 PROVIDES CERTAIN AMENDMENTS THAT AFFECT NARROW ASPECTS  OF THE GUIDANCE ISSUED IN ASU 2016-02. ASU 2018-11 ALLOWS ALL ENTITIES ADOPTING ASU 2016-02 TO CHOOSE AN ADDITIONAL (AND OPTIONAL)  TRANSITION METHOD OF ADOPTION, UNDER WHICH AN ENTITY INITIALLY APPLIES THE NEW LEASES STANDARD AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZES  A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. ASU 2018-11 ALSO ALLOWS  LESSORS TO NOT SEPARATE NON-LEASE COMPONENTS FROM THE ASSOCIATED LEASE COMPONENT IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THE COMPANY ADOPTED  THE ASUS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS WILL BE UPGRADED TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS  OF THE NEW STANDARD, HOWEVER, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02 WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  26  IN  FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-02, RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  (ASU 2018-02). UNDER EXISTING U.S. GAAP, THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND LAWS ON DEFERRED TAX BALANCES ARE RECORDED AS  A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE LAW WAS ENACTED. WHEN DEFERRED TAX BALANCES RELATED TO ITEMS ORIGINALLY  RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE ADJUSTED, CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS BECOME STRANDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2018-02 ALLOW A RECLASSIFICATION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  TO RETAINED EARNINGS (ACCUMULATED DEFICIT) FOR STRANDED INCOME TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE TAX ACT).  THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN DISCLOSURES ABOUT STRANDED INCOME TAX EFFECTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL  YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IN ANY PERIOD IS PERMITTED.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ADOPTED ASU 2018-02 AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE  ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  IN  JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-09, \u201cCODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS\u201d (\u201cASU 2018-09\u201d). ASU 2018-09 PROVIDES  AMENDMENTS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS IN THE FASB\u2019S ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION, WHICH APPLIES TO ALL REPORTING ENTITIES  WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE AFFECTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE TRANSITION AND EFFECTIVE DATE GUIDANCE ARE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  OF EACH AMENDMENT. SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU 2018-09 DO NOT REQUIRE TRANSITION GUIDANCE AND WERE EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE OF  ASU 2018-09. HOWEVER, MANY OF THE AMENDMENTS DO HAVE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITH EFFECTIVE DATES FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER  DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE APPLICABLE GUIDANCE; HOWEVER WE DO NOT BELIEVE  THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-09 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT - DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK (TOPIC 820). THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IMPROVES  THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE UPDATED GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY REMOVED OR MODIFIED DISCLOSURES.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE TIMING AND IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE UPDATED PROVISIONS.  IN  AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-14 TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURES FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS UNDER ASC 715-20.  THE ASU APPLIES TO EMPLOYERS THAT SPONSOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-14 AS  PART OF ITS DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK PROJECT, WHICH HAS AN OBJECTIVE AND PRIMARY FOCUS TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DISCLOSURES  IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS PART OF THE PROJECT, DURING AUGUST 2018, THE BOARD ALSO ISSUED A CONCEPTS STATEMENT,  WHICH THE FASB USED AS A BASIS FOR AMENDING THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBTOPIC 715-20. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL  YEARS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE TIMING AND IMPACT  OF ADOPTING THE UPDATED PROVISIONS.  27  IN  JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-13(\u201cASU 2016-13\u201d), FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\u2014CREDIT LOSSES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE  FASB ISSUED ASU 2019-05, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS- CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326): TARGETED TRANSITION RELIEF AND CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS  TO TOPIC 326 IN ASU 2019-11, ASU 2019-04 AND ASU 2018-19. THE AMENDMENTS UPDATE GUIDANCE ON REPORTING CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCIAL  ASSETS. THESE AMENDMENTS AFFECT LOANS, DEBT SECURITIES, TRADE RECEIVABLES, NET INVESTMENTS IN LEASES, OFF BALANCE SHEET CREDIT  EXPOSURES, REINSURANCE RECEIVABLES, AND ANY OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE SCOPE THAT HAVE THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHT  TO RECEIVE CASH. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, INCLUDING  INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. ALL ENTITIES MAY ADOPT THE AMENDMENTS THROUGH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED  EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE (THAT IS, A MODIFIED-RETROSPECTIVE  APPROACH). THE ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE FASB  ISSUED ASU 2019-10, \u201cFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSS (TOPIC 326), DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815), AND LEASES (TOPIC  842),\u201d WHICH DEFERS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR PUBLIC FILERS THAT ARE CONSIDERED SMALL REPORTING COMPANIES (\u201cSRC\u201d)  AS DEFINED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2022, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. SINCE THE COMPANY IS AN SRC, IMPLEMENTATION IS NOT NEEDED UNTIL MAY 1, 2023. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE  TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-13 WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSURES.  IN  JANUARY 2020, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2020-01, \u201cINVESTMENTS - EQUITY SECURITIES (TOPIC 321), INVESTMENTS - EQUITY METHOD AND  JOINT VENTURES (TOPIC 323), AND DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815) - CLARIFYING THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN TOPIC 321, TOPIC 323,  AND TOPIC 815.\u201d THE ASU IS BASED ON A CONSENSUS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE AND IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE COMPARABILITY  IN ACCOUNTING FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS. ASU 2016-01 MADE TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING  PROVIDING AN ENTITY THE ABILITY TO MEASURE CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT A READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUE AT COST, LESS ANY  IMPAIRMENT, PLUS OR MINUS CHANGES RESULTING FROM OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS FOR THE IDENTICAL OR A SIMILAR  INVESTMENT OF THE SAME ISSUER. AMONG OTHER TOPICS, THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER OBSERVABLE TRANSACTIONS  THAT REQUIRE IT TO EITHER APPLY OR DISCONTINUE THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES, THE AMENDMENTS IN  THE ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY  ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2020-01 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONDENSED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  28  GEORGE  RISK INDUSTRIES, INC.  PART  I.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A READER OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH A NARRATIVE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF OUR MANAGEMENT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, AND CERTAIN OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  OUR MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 (INCLUDING THE INFORMATION PRESENTED THEREIN UNDER RISK FACTORS), AS WELL AS OUR REPORTS ON FORMS 10-Q AND 8-K AND OTHER PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ALL AMOUNTS HEREIN ARE UNAUDITED.  OVERVIEW  WINNEBAGO INDUSTRIES, INC. IS ONE OF THE LEADING U.S. MANUFACTURERS WITH A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF RECREATION VEHICLES (\"RV\"S) AND MARINE PRODUCTS USED PRIMARILY IN LEISURE TRAVEL AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITIES. WE PRODUCE OUR MOTORHOME UNITS IN IOWA AND INDIANA; OUR TOWABLE UNITS IN INDIANA; AND OUR MARINE UNITS IN FLORIDA. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RV AND MARINE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER. WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR MARINE PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER.  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION  THIS MD&A INCLUDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (\"GAAP\"), AS WELL AS CERTAIN ADJUSTED OR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN ORDER TO PRESENT COMPARABLE RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 FOR A DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF ITEMS THAT IMPACTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECT OF NON-RECURRING TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE REPORTED PERIODS AND TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS WHEN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED FAIR-VALUE INVENTORY STEP-UP, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND NON-OPERATING INCOME.  MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (A) TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS AND PEERS; (B) TO MEASURE OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS; (C) IN PRESENTATIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ENABLE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT BASIS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS ASSESSMENTS OF PERFORMANCE AND IN FORECASTING AND BUDGETING FOR OUR COMPANY; (D) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (E) TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS AND RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  NEWMAR CORPORATION  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR CORPORATION, DUTCH REAL ESTATE CORP, NEW-WAY TRANSPORT, AND NEW-SERV (COLLECTIVELY \"NEWMAR\") FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $360.3 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF $267.7 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS STIPULATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND 2.0 MILLION SHARES OF WINNEBAGO COMMON STOCK THAT WERE VALUED AT $92.6 MILLION ($46.29 PER SHARE DISCOUNTED AT 7.0% DUE TO LACK OF MARKETABILITY BECAUSE OF ONE YEAR LOCK-UP RESTRICTIONS). THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\")  (AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 9,  LONG-TERM DEBT  ) AND CASH ON HAND.

THE FACILITY EXPANSION IN THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES DIVISION WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\"ERP\") SYSTEM TO REPLACE OUR LEGACY BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. THE NEW ERP PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR OUR CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. OUR INITIAL COST ESTIMATES HAVE GROWN FOR ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE ERP SYSTEM WITH ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, EXTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE, AND INCREASED INTERNAL STAFFING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 TO FINANCE OUR ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR.  DEBT AND CAPITAL  AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAVE A DEBT AGREEMENT THAT CONSISTS OF A $300.0 MILLION TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (\"TERM LOAN\") AND A $192.5 MILLION ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\"ABL CREDIT FACILITY\") (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"CREDIT AGREEMENTS\"). DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ISSUED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND THE NEWMAR ACQUISITION. REFER TO NOTE 9,  LONG-TERM DEBT  , OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAD NO BORROWINGS AGAINST THE ABL.  OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES  WORKING CAPITAL AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $313.5 MILLION AND $212.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT CASH ON HAND, FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND THE BORROWING AVAILABLE UNDER OUR ABL CREDIT FACILITY BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS PURSUANT TO PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY IS TO FIRST FUND OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, MAINTAIN A DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN OUR TARGETED ZONE, MAINTAIN REASONABLE LIQUIDITY, AND THEN RETURN EXCESS CASH OVER TIME TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  ON OCTOBER 18, 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $70.0 MILLION. THERE IS NO TIME RESTRICTION ON THE AUTHORIZATION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE IF SHARE REPURCHASES REFLECT A PRUDENT USE OF OUR CAPITAL AND, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES IN THE FUTURE. AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAVE $58.9 MILLION REMAINING ON OUR BOARD REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  ON MARCH 17, 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.11 PER SHARE PAYABLE ON APRIL 29, 2020, TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 15, 2020.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OTHER THAN THE ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS SINCE THE END OF FISCAL 2019.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE CAYMAN ISLANDS. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH OUR \u201cINSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u201d: AMERICAN COUNTRY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cAMERICAN COUNTRY\u201d), AMERICAN SERVICE INSURANCE COMPANY, INC. (\u201cAMERICAN SERVICE\u201d), GATEWAY INSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cGATEWAY\u201d) AND GLOBAL LIBERTY INSURANCE COMPANY OF NEW YORK (\u201cGLOBAL LIBERTY\u201d) IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, ANCHOR GROUP MANAGEMENT INC. (\u201cAGMI\u201d). THIS SECTOR INCLUDES TAXI CABS, NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT, LIMOUSINE, LIVERY, INCLUDING CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION NETWORK COMPANIES (\u201cTNCS\u201d) DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND BUSINESS AUTO. OUR GOAL IS TO ALWAYS BE THE PREFERRED SPECIALTY INSURANCE BUSINESS IN ANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE OUR VALUE PROPOSITION DELIVERS BENEFIT TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARE LICENSED TO WRITE PROPERTY AND CASUALTY (\u201cP&C\u201d) INSURANCE IN  49  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S.\u201d). THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DISTRIBUTE THEIR PRODUCTS THROUGH A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT RETAIL AGENTS, AND ACTIVELY WRITE INSURANCE IN  42  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. WE EMBRACE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT, ANALYTICS AND TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS OF BUILDING ON THE STRONG HERITAGE OUR SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES CULTIVATED IN THE NICHE MARKETS WE SERVE.  SINCE ATLAS\u2019 FORMATION IN 2010, WE HAVE DISPOSED OF NON-CORE ASSETS, CONSOLIDATED INFRASTRUCTURE AND PLACED INTO RUN-OFF CERTAIN NON-CORE LINES OF BUSINESS PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN BY OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. OUR CORE BUSINESS IS THE UNDERWRITING OF COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE POLICIES, FOCUSING ON THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR, WHICH IS CARRIED OUT THROUGH AMERICAN COUNTRY, AMERICAN SERVICE AND GATEWAY, AND GLOBAL LIBERTY, ALONG WITH OUR WHOLLY OWNED MANAGING GENERAL AGENCY, AGMI.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, CERTAIN INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN IN REHABILITATION SINCE JULY 8, 2019.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  JUNE 30, 2019.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE  OUR PRIMARY TARGET MARKET IS MADE UP OF SMALL TO MID-SIZE TAXI, LIMOUSINE, OTHER LIVERY, INCLUDING TNC DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT OPERATORS. THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR LIGHTWEIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES TYPICALLY WITH THE MINIMUM LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE, MUNICIPAL OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR POLICYHOLDERS ARE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OR SMALL FLEET OPERATORS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS LIKE ILLINOIS, LOUISIANA, NEVADA AND NEW YORK, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH LARGER OPERATORS WHO RETAIN A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN RISK OF LOSS THROUGH HIGHER RETENTIONS, SELF-INSURANCE OR SELF-FUNDED CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITY ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT IN THE AREAS OF DAY-TO-DAY POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND CLAIMS HANDLING CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE PROPOSITION WE OFFER TO ALL OF OUR INSUREDS, GENERALLY ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE EXCESS COVERAGE ABOVE THE LEVELS OF RISK RETAINED BY THE INSUREDS WHERE A BETTER THAN AVERAGE LOSS RATIO IS EXPECTED. THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE SIGNIFICANT SPECIALIZED OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAINTAIN TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE.  THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR IS A SUBSET OF THE BROADER COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SEGMENT, WHICH OVER THE LONG TERM HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY PROFITABLE. IN MORE RECENT YEARS THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN PROFITABILITY PRESSURE. DATA COMPILED BY S&P GLOBAL ALSO INDICATES THAT IN 2018 THE TOTAL MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $40.4 BILLION. THE SIZE OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET CAN BE AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA OF AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CARRIERS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF EXCESS UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND HIGHER PREMIUM RATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATORS OF \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILES MAY BE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET TO TAKE VEHICLES OUT OF SERVICE, AS THEIR BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS REPUTATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON AVAILABILITY. OUR TARGET MARKET HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF TNC AND OTHER TRENDS RELATED TO MOBILITY. THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF TNC HAS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN TAXI VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO INSURE; HOWEVER, IT HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF LIVERY OPERATORS. MARKET RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE COMBINED ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL TAXI, LIVERY AND TNC COMPANIES EXPANDED DURING 2018.  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF OUR SURETY PROGRAM, GATEWAY\u2019S TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, AMERICAN SERVICE\u2019S NON-STANDARD PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS, ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI, OTHER LIABILITY, GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS. ALL OF THE OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS ARE IN RUN-OFF EXCEPT FOR OTHER LIABILITY AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS.  OUR SURETY PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF U.S. CUSTOMS BONDS. WE ENGAGE A FORMER AFFILIATE, AVALON RISK MANAGEMENT, TO HELP COORDINATE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CLAIMS HANDLING FOR THE SURETY BONDS WRITTEN AS THIS PROGRAM RUNS-OFF. THIS NON-CORE PROGRAM IS 100% REINSURED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AND HAS BEEN TRANSITIONED TO ANOTHER CARRIER.  THE GATEWAY TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS WERE PUT INTO RUN-OFF DURING 2012. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS 100% REINSURED RETROSPECTIVELY AND PROSPECTIVELY TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED DURING 2017.  NON-STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS PRINCIPALLY PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR PAYMENT HISTORY, DRIVING RECORD, PLACE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, VEHICLE TYPE OR OTHER FACTORS. SUCH DRIVERS TYPICALLY REPRESENT HIGHER THAN NORMAL RISKS AND PAY HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR COMPARABLE COVERAGE. CONSISTENT WITH ATLAS\u2019 FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, ATLAS HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM THE NON-STANDARD AUTO LINE. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES CEASED WRITING NEW AND RENEWAL POLICIES OF THIS TYPE IN 2011, AND EARNED PREMIUM DISCONTINUED IN 2012, ALLOWING SURPLUS AND RESOURCES TO BE DEVOTED TO THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS.  GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, WAS PLACED INTO RUN-OFF PRIOR TO ATLAS\u2019 ACQUISITION.THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL BOOK OF BUSINESS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, THAT IS STILL IN RUN-OFF.  ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI AND OTHER LIABILITY ARE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED ONLY TO INSUREDS WHO PURCHASE OUR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS NON-RENEWED IN 2018 DUE TO LIMITED DEMAND.  ASSIGNED RISK POOLS ARE ESTABLISHED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO COVER HIGH-RISK INSUREDS WHO CANNOT PURCHASE INSURANCE THROUGH CONVENTIONAL MEANS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORONAVIRUS IMPACT  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) ON OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN MANY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ISSUED TRAVEL ADVISORIES, CANCELED LARGE SCALE PUBLIC EVENTS AND CLOSED SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO CANCEL CONFERENCES AND TRAVEL PLANS AND REQUIRE EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  ADVERSE EVENTS SUCH AS HEALTH-RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT WORKING IN OUR OFFICES, THE INABILITY TO TRAVEL, POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS, AND OTHER MATTERS AFFECTING THE GENERAL WORK AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE CURRENT GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE.  2019 DEVELOPMENTS  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO TIMELY FILE ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, JUNE 30, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO DELAYS IN THE YEAR END AUDIT PROCESS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DELINQUENCY NOTICES FROM NASDAQ RELATED TO THESE FILINGS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS.  NASDAQ GRANTED THE COMPANY\u2019S REQUEST TO MOVE FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND GRANTED THE COMPANY AN EXTENSION TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS LISTING OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES CONTINUE TO TRADE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S 6.625% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2022 MOVED TO THE OTC PINK SHEETS ON OCTOBER 17, 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON APRIL 29, 2019, RSM US, LLP (\"RSM\") WAS DISMISSED AS THE CORPORATION\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  AT THE TIME RSM WAS DISMISSED, THE CORPORATION HAD NOT YET ENGAGED A SUCCESSOR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BAKER TILLY VIRCHOW KRAUSE, LLP (\u201cBAKER TILLY\u201d) WAS ENGAGED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO AUDIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THROUGHOUT 2019, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FURTHER STRENGTHENING ITS PROCESSES, REVIEWING ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES, A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY OR CERTAIN ASSETS, AND BALANCE SHEET STRENGTHENING OPTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF FACILITATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE GENERATION.  ATLAS CONCLUDED THAT THE UTILIZATION OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED MGA OPERATION TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS FOCUS, EXPERIENCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS.  A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED EFFECTIVE JUNE 10, 2019 BETWEEN ATLAS AND AMERICAN FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (NYSE: AFG), UNDER WHICH ATLAS WILL ACT AS AN UNDERWRITING MANAGER FOR AFG\u2019S NATIONAL INTERSTATE (\u201cNATL\u201d) SUBSIDIARY AND TRANSITION NEW AND RENEWAL PARATRANSIT BUSINESS TO NATL PAPER FOR THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING MGA RELATIONSHIPS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS AS WELL.  THE COMPANY AGREED THAT SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO SELL ITS MGA OPERATIONS, 49% OF THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE SALE OF AGMI WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES TO FACILITATE THE REHABILITATION PROCESS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS ALLOCATED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY.  DURING 2019, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (THE \u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d) PLACED ALL THREE OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES (AFTER GATEWAY WAS REDOMESTICATED IN ILLINOIS) INTO REHABILITATION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AS THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR.  WHILE IN REHABILITATION, THE OPERATIONS OF SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR ALTHOUGH ATLAS CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S OVERRIDING STRATEGIC PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A TRANSITION OF BUSINESS FROM THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKETS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME UTILIZING THE EXISTING PLATFORM OF THE MGA TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2019, NO NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY THE ASI POOL COMPANIES, AND ONLY NEW YORK AREA NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY GLOBAL LIBERTY, WHICH IS FOCUSING ITS RESOURCES ON NEW YORK AREA BUSINESS TO LEVERAGE THE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S HERITAGE IN THIS LARGE AND SPECIFIC MARKET. THE ASI POOL COMPANIES AND GLOBAL LIBERTY CONTINUED TO WRITE RENEWAL BUSINESS THAT MET THEIR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DURING 2019.  NON-RENEWALS RELATED TO ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 INSURANCE POLICIES BEGAN TOWARDS THE END OF 2019.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 22, 2020, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT WITH BUCKLE, A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY, TO PURCHASE THE STOCK OF ATLAS\u2019 INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY GATEWAY AND ITS CORPORATE CHARTER AND FORTY-SEVEN (47) STATE INSURANCE LICENSES AS WELL AS STATE STATUTORY DEPOSITS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER NECESSARY APPROVALS, FOR $4.7 MILLION PLUS THE VALUE OF ALL PURCHASED DEPOSITS, SUCH AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE REHABILITATOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REHABILITATION ESTATE OF GATEWAY, WITH A TENTATIVE CLOSING DATE IN APRIL OF 2020.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT BUCKLE WILL ENGAGE THE MGA AND CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUCKLE AND THAT BUCKLE WILL LEASE SPACE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS AND ITS MELVILLE, NY OFFICE.

OUR UNDERWRITING APPROACH IS TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING UNDERWRITING PROFIT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE OWN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PHILOSOPHY IS TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING MARGIN OVER TOP LINE GROWTH. AS WITH ALL P&C INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE IMPACT OF PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES IS REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OVER TIME. UNDERWRITING CHANGES ON OUR IN-FORCE POLICIES OCCUR AS THEY ARE RENEWED. THIS CYCLE GENERALLY TAKES TWELVE MONTHS FOR OUR ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS TO EARN A FULL YEAR OF PREMIUM AT THE RENEWAL RATE.  WE APPROACH INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF SUPPORTING INSURANCE OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING A STABLE SOURCE OF INCOME TO SUPPLEMENT UNDERWRITING INCOME. THE GOALS OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE TO PROTECT CAPITAL WHILE OPTIMIZING INVESTMENT INCOME AND CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY. WE FOLLOW A FORMAL INVESTMENT POLICY, AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AT LEAST QUARTERLY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROVIDES INTERIM GUIDANCE AND ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO ASSET ALLOCATION, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.  AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITIES IN 2019, LIQUIDITY NEEDS RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE.

EXPENSES  NET CLAIMS INCURRED EXPENSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS WE WRITE AND OF THE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WE RECORD NET CLAIMS INCURRED BASED ON AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS WE EXPECT TO BE REPORTED ON CONTRACTS WRITTEN. WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH CASE RESERVES AT THE PROBABLE EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, AND BEGINNING IN 2016, THE USE OF CLAIM RELATED ANALYTICS. OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE NET CLAIMS INCURRED ACCURATELY AT THE TIME OF PRICING OUR CONTRACTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING OUR PROFITABILITY. THE AMOUNT REPORTED UNDER NET CLAIMS INCURRED IN ANY PERIOD INCLUDES PAYMENTS IN THE PERIOD NET OF THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE RESERVES FOR NET CLAIMS INCURRED BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS WELL AS ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE TRENDS OR CHANGES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS RELIED ON INDEPENDENT ACTUARIAL PROFESSIONALS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THIS REGARD, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA OF OUR BUSINESS.

ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PREMIUM TAXES. THE BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BY CEDING COMMISSIONS RECEIVED FROM ASSUMING REINSURERS THAT REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WRITTEN AND VARY DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT AND TYPES OF CONTRACTS WRITTEN.  OTHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL RELATED EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES, BENEFITS AND CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AWARDS UNDER OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, SUCH AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND OTHER GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR PERSONNEL EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN NATURE, CHANGES IN PREMIUM WRITINGS MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATING SCALE AND OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS.

INCOME TAXES  UPON THE TRANSACTION FORMING ATLAS ON DECEMBER 31, 2010, A YEARLY LIMITATION AS REQUIRED BY IRC SECTION 382 THAT APPLIES TO CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP ON THE FUTURE UTILIZATION OF ATLAS\u2019 NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS WAS CALCULATED. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 PRIOR PARENT RETAINED THOSE TAX ASSETS PREVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD NOT BE UTILIZED BY ATLAS AS A RESULT OF THIS LIMITATION. AS A RESULT, ATLAS\u2019 ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FUTURE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A PORTION OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERATED DURING PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT DETERMINED UNDER IRC SECTION 382. THE RESULT IS A MAXIMUM EXPECTED NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH ATLAS HAS AVAILABLE AFTER THE MERGER AND BELIEVED MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT TO BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, ATLAS CONSIDERS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  POSITIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE PROFIT WITH VEHICLES IN-FORCE AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS AND STEADY NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS;  \u2022  ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES IN CORE LINES AS THE COMMERCIAL AUTO MARKET IS FIRMING;  \u2022  OUR BELIEF THAT PREDICTIVE MODELING IN UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS SHOULD GENERATE BETTER PRICED RISKS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CREATE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OVER TIME; AND  \u2022  POSITIVE GROWTH TRENDS IN GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN EACH YEAR SINCE FORMATION.  NEGATIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  NET LOSSES GENERATED IN THE THREE MOST RECENT YEARS; AND  \u2022  YEARLY LIMITATION AS REQUIRED BY IRC SECTION 382 ON NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS GENERATED PRIOR TO 2013.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  INVESTMENTS  OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY  ATLAS ALIGNS ITS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO SUPPORT THE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING CASH NEEDS OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS. ATLAS INVESTS PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RELATIVELY SHORT DURATIONS THAT CORRELATE WITH THE PAYOUT PATTERNS OF ATLAS\u2019 CLAIMS LIABILITIES. ATLAS ALSO INVESTS OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN SELECTIVE DIRECT INVESTMENTS WITH FAVORABLE RETURN ATTRIBUTES. A THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM MANAGES ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES AS APPROVED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ATLAS MONITORS THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH ITS MANDATE AND ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT GUIDELINES STRESS THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MARKET LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT PAYMENT OF LIABILITIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF RISK. WITH RESPECT TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES SECURITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION OF HOLDING THEM TO THEIR MATURITIES; HOWEVER, THE SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE IF LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARISE. TO THE EXTENT THAT INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR DECREASE, UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES MAY RESULT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH GAINS OR LOSSES BEING REALIZED.

ACTUAL MATURITIES MAY DIFFER FROM CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES, BECAUSE CERTAIN ISSUERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL OR PREPAY OBLIGATIONS WITH OR WITHOUT CALL OR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. ATLAS HOLDS CASH AND HIGH GRADE SHORT-TERM ASSETS, WHICH, ALONG WITH FIXED INCOME SECURITY MATURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL CASH IS REQUIRED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS, ATLAS BELIEVES THAT A HIGH QUALITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PROVIDES US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY.

ATLAS IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENTS AND BALANCES RECEIVABLE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AGENTS AND REINSURERS. IT MONITORS CONCENTRATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RISK THROUGH POLICIES DESIGNED TO LIMIT AND MONITOR ITS EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS OR RELATED GROUPS (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS) AS WELL AS THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW OF THE CREDIT RATINGS OF ISSUERS IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDER IS NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURANCE POLICIES, HOWEVER, ARE DISTRIBUTED BY AGENTS WHO MAY MANAGE CASH COLLECTION ON ITS BEHALF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGENCY AGREEMENT. ATLAS HAS PROTOCOLS TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM SIMILAR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ACTIVITIES, OR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REINSURERS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURERS\u2019 INSOLVENCY.

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT  ATLAS RECOGNIZES LOSSES ON SECURITIES FOR WHICH A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE WAS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF THE SECURITIES HOLDINGS TO DETERMINE IF DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ATLAS DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHARGES FOR SECURITIES IMPAIRMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THE LENGTH OF TIME SECURITIES MAY BE HELD IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION MAY VARY BASED ON THE OPINION OF THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYSES RELATED TO VALUATION AND TO THE VARIOUS CREDIT RISKS THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM RECAPTURING THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT. IN CASES OF SECURITIES WITH A MATURITY DATE WHERE THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER DETERMINES THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RISK OF DEFAULT PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A HOLDING, ATLAS WOULD ELECT TO HOLD THE SECURITY IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION UNTIL THE PRICE RECOVERS OR THE SECURITY MATURES. IN SITUATIONS WHERE FACTS EMERGE THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RECAPTURE OF PRINCIPAL, ATLAS MAY ELECT TO SELL SECURITIES AT A LOSS.  THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $35.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $115.4 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ASSESS THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME ASSETS, IF REQUIRED, ON A REGULAR BASIS.  DUE FROM REINSURERS  ATLAS PURCHASES REINSURANCE FROM THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS LIABILITY ON INDIVIDUAL RISKS AND ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE CLAIMS. REINSURANCE IS COVERAGE PURCHASED BY ONE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM ANOTHER FOR PART OF THE RISK ORIGINALLY UNDERWRITTEN BY THE PURCHASING (CEDING) INSURANCE COMPANY. THE PRACTICE OF CEDING INSURANCE TO REINSURERS ALLOWS AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS BY SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND TYPE OF RISK OR ON A PARTICULAR POLICY. AN EFFECT OF CEDING INSURANCE IS TO PERMIT AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO WRITE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE FOR RISKS IN GREATER NUMBERS OR IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE INSURE INDEPENDENTLY, BASED ON ITS STATUTORY CAPITAL, RISK TOLERANCE AND OTHER FACTORS.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO LIMIT NET EXPOSURE TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON ANY ONE LOSS OF $500,000 WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS. ATLAS ALSO PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST AWARDS IN EXCESS OF ITS POLICY LIMITS. ATLAS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS REINSURANCE NEEDS BASED ON BUSINESS VOLUME, MIX, AND SUPPLY LEVELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR ASI POOL COMPANIES AND THE GLOBAL QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY.  REINSURANCE CEDED DOES NOT RELIEVE ATLAS OF ITS ULTIMATE LIABILITY TO ITS INSUREDS IN THE EVENT THAT ANY REINSURER IS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THEREFORE, ATLAS ENTERS INTO REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH ONLY THOSE REINSURERS DEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED COVERAGE. REINSURANCE TREATIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION BY THE REINSURERS OR ATLAS ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION ANNUALLY. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF A REINSURER. ATLAS BELIEVES THAT THE AMOUNTS IT HAS RECORDED AS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED. ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, AND THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS HAD  $84.4 MILLION  RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS (EXCLUSIVE OF AMOUNTS PREPAID) AS OF  JUNE 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $81.2 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE AMOUNT RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN CEDED CASE AND IBNR RESERVES AND THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON PAID CLAIMS.  ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. AS UNDERLYING RESERVES POTENTIALLY DEVELOP, THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS\u2019 REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS REINSURERS, AND THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE, AND AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR, IF NEEDED.  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JULY 31, 2019, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD TERMINATE ON A CUT-OFF BASIS.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 QUOTA SHARE CONTRACT WITH SWISS RE WAS TERMINATED ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.

THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE PROVISION NECESSARILY INVOLVES RISKS THAT THE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DEVIATE, PERHAPS SUBSTANTIALLY, FROM THE BEST ESTIMATES MADE. THE CHANGE TO THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CHANGES IN WRITTEN PREMIUM. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES IS AN INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN PROCESS INVOLVING ESTIMATES, CURRENT PROVISIONS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE, ARE REFLECTED QUARTERLY IN THE STATEMENT OF INCOME AS ESTIMATES ARE UPDATED.  THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS FOR ALL DATA. CLAIMS PAYMENTS AND CHANGES IN RESERVES, HOWEVER, MAY BE MADE ON ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED IN PRIOR YEARS, NOT SOLELY ON BUSINESS THAT IS CURRENTLY INSURED. CALENDAR YEAR CLAIMS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE REPORTING PERIOD, WITHOUT REGARD TO THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. CALENDAR YEAR RESULTS DO NOT CHANGE AFTER THE END OF THE APPLICABLE REPORTING PERIOD, EVEN AS NEW CLAIM INFORMATION DEVELOPS. ACCIDENT YEAR CLAIMS CONSIST OF PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES THAT ARE ASSIGNED TO THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED. ACCIDENT YEAR RESULTS WILL CHANGE OVER TIME AS THE ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS CHANGE DUE TO PAYMENTS AND RESERVE CHANGES FOR ALL ACCIDENTS THAT OCCURRED DURING THAT PERIOD.  THE CHANGE IN INCURRED RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018  PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT ON INVOLUNTARY ASSIGNED RISK POOLS AND RUN-OFF COMMERCIAL AUTO.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  THE PURPOSE OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT CASH TO MEET ALL FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS THEY BECOME DUE. THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF ATLAS\u2019 BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON SECURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, COMMISSIONS AND GENERAL EXPENSES.  AS A HOLDING COMPANY, ATLAS MAY DERIVE CASH FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CHARGE MANAGEMENT FEES TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY STATUTE OR OTHER REGULATORY APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH PREMIUMS COLLECTED, INVESTMENT INCOME AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES AND MATURITY OF INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THEIR PARENTS. REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IN THE \u2018INVESTMENTS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY\u2019 SECTION. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN THE EVENT THAT DIVIDENDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY ARE INADEQUATE TO SERVICE ITS OBLIGATIONS, THE HOLDING COMPANY WOULD NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL, SELL ASSETS OR INCUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

ON APRIL 26, 2017, ATLAS ISSUED  $25 MILLION  OF  FIVE  -YEAR  6.625%  SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES AND RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $23.9 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER ESTIMATED OFFERING EXPENSES. INTEREST ON THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY ON EACH JANUARY 26, APRIL 26, JULY 26 AND OCTOBER 26. ATLAS MAY, AT ITS OPTION, BEGINNING WITH THE INTEREST PAYMENT DATE OF APRIL 26, 2020, AND ON ANY SCHEDULED INTEREST PAYMENT DATE THEREAFTER, REDEEM THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST TO, BUT EXCLUDING, THE DATE OF REDEMPTION. THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK SENIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ANY OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS THAT IS BY ITS TERMS EXPRESSLY SUBORDINATED OR JUNIOR IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES. THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT TO ALL OF ATLAS\u2019 EXISTING AND FUTURE SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS, BUT WILL BE EFFECTIVELY SUBORDINATED TO ANY SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE EXTENT OF THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL SECURING SUCH SECURED INDEBTEDNESS.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION, THE SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WILL BE STRUCTURALLY SUBORDINATED TO THE INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF ATLAS\u2019 SUBSIDIARIES.

WE RECEIVE MOST PREMIUMS IN ADVANCE OF THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ON PAID CLAIMS.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2019  WAS  $38.1 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES. SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS  $15.6 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THE REPAYMENT OF TWO COLLATERAL LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF SHARES REPURCHASED UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON MARCH 21, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO  650,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BLOCK PURCHASES, OR OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT UNTIL MARCH 21, 2018. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS NOT EXTENDED. THE COMPANY\u2019S DECISIONS AROUND THE TIMING, VOLUME, AND NATURE OF SHARE REPURCHASES, AND THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF SHARES REPURCHASED, WERE DEPENDENT ON MARKET CONDITIONS, APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS, AND OTHER FACTORS. DURING 2018,  255,505  SHARES WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THIS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY MANAGES CAPITAL USING BOTH REGULATORY CAPITAL MEASURES AND INTERNAL METRICS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, RETAINED EARNINGS (DEFICIT) AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES MUST EACH MAINTAIN A MINIMUM STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS OF  $1.5 MILLION  ,  $2.4 MILLION  AND  $3.5 MILLION  UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE ILLINOIS INSURANCE CODE, THE MISSOURI INSURANCE CODE AND THE NEW YORK INSURANCE CODE, RESPECTIVELY. DIVIDENDS MAY ONLY BE PAID FROM STATUTORY UNASSIGNED SURPLUS, AND PAYMENTS MAY NOT BE MADE IF SUCH SURPLUS IS LESS THAN A STIPULATED AMOUNT. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES IS THE GREATER OF STATUTORY NET INCOME OR 10% OF TOTAL STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS. THE DIVIDEND RESTRICTION FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY IS THE LOWER OF 10% OF STATUTORY SURPLUS OR 100% OF ADJUSTED NET INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS.

SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE  OUR PRIMARY TARGET MARKET IS MADE UP OF SMALL TO MID-SIZE TAXI, LIMOUSINE, OTHER LIVERY, INCLUDING TNC DRIVERS/OPERATORS, AND NON-EMERGENCY PARA-TRANSIT OPERATORS. THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE POLICIES WE UNDERWRITE PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR LIGHTWEIGHT COMMERCIAL VEHICLES TYPICALLY WITH THE MINIMUM LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE, MUNICIPAL OR OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR POLICYHOLDERS ARE INDIVIDUAL OWNERS OR SMALL FLEET OPERATORS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS LIKE ILLINOIS, LOUISIANA, NEVADA AND NEW YORK, WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUCCESSFUL WORKING WITH LARGER OPERATORS WHO RETAIN A MEANINGFUL AMOUNT OF THEIR OWN RISK OF LOSS THROUGH HIGHER RETENTIONS, SELF-INSURANCE OR SELF-FUNDED CAPTIVE INSURANCE ENTITY ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES, WE PROVIDE SUPPORT IN THE AREAS OF DAY-TO-DAY POLICY ADMINISTRATION AND CLAIMS HANDLING CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUE PROPOSITION WE OFFER TO ALL OF OUR INSUREDS, GENERALLY ON A FEE FOR SERVICE BASIS. WE MAY ALSO PROVIDE EXCESS COVERAGE ABOVE THE LEVELS OF RISK RETAINED BY THE INSUREDS WHERE A BETTER THAN AVERAGE LOSS RATIO IS EXPECTED. THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY UTILIZE THE SIGNIFICANT SPECIALIZED OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE WE MAINTAIN TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM BUSINESS SEGMENTS THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE MORE PRICE SENSITIVE.  THE \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE SECTOR IS A SUBSET OF THE BROADER COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SEGMENT, WHICH OVER THE LONG TERM HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY PROFITABLE. IN MORE RECENT YEARS THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE INDUSTRY HAS SEEN PROFITABILITY PRESSURE. DATA COMPILED BY S&P GLOBAL ALSO INDICATES THAT IN 2018 THE TOTAL MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY INSURANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $40.4 BILLION. THE SIZE OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET CAN BE AFFECTED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THE UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND UNDERWRITING CRITERIA OF AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE CARRIERS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HISTORICALLY, THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET HAS BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODS OF EXCESS UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION FOLLOWED BY PERIODS OF REDUCED UNDERWRITING CAPACITY AND HIGHER PREMIUM RATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATORS OF \u201cLIGHT\u201d COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILES MAY BE LESS LIKELY THAN OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITHIN THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE MARKET TO TAKE VEHICLES OUT OF SERVICE, AS THEIR BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS REPUTATIONS RELY HEAVILY ON AVAILABILITY. OUR TARGET MARKET HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A RESULT OF TNC AND OTHER TRENDS RELATED TO MOBILITY. THE SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF TNC HAS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN TAXI VEHICLES AVAILABLE TO INSURE; HOWEVER, IT HAS INCREASED THE NUMBER OF LIVERY OPERATORS. MARKET RESEARCH ALSO SUGGESTS THAT THE COMBINED ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BETWEEN TRADITIONAL TAXI, LIVERY AND TNC COMPANIES EXPANDED DURING 2018.  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS  OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS IS COMPRISED OF OUR SURETY PROGRAM, GATEWAY\u2019S TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, AMERICAN SERVICE\u2019S NON-STANDARD PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS, ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI, OTHER LIABILITY, GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS. ALL OF THE OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS ARE IN RUN-OFF EXCEPT FOR OTHER LIABILITY AND ASSIGNED RISK POOL BUSINESS.  OUR SURETY PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF U.S. CUSTOMS BONDS. WE ENGAGE A FORMER AFFILIATE, AVALON RISK MANAGEMENT, TO HELP COORDINATE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND CLAIMS HANDLING FOR THE SURETY BONDS WRITTEN AS THIS PROGRAM RUNS-OFF. THIS NON-CORE PROGRAM IS 100% REINSURED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AND HAS BEEN TRANSITIONED TO ANOTHER CARRIER.  THE GATEWAY TRUCK AND WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAMS WERE PUT INTO RUN-OFF DURING 2012. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS 100% REINSURED RETROSPECTIVELY AND PROSPECTIVELY TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION REINSURANCE AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED DURING 2017.  NON-STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE IS PRINCIPALLY PROVIDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STANDARD AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF THEIR PAYMENT HISTORY, DRIVING RECORD, PLACE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, VEHICLE TYPE OR OTHER FACTORS. SUCH DRIVERS TYPICALLY REPRESENT HIGHER THAN NORMAL RISKS AND PAY HIGHER INSURANCE RATES FOR COMPARABLE COVERAGE. CONSISTENT WITH ATLAS\u2019 FOCUS ON COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE, ATLAS HAS TRANSITIONED AWAY FROM THE NON-STANDARD AUTO LINE. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES CEASED WRITING NEW AND RENEWAL POLICIES OF THIS TYPE IN 2011, AND EARNED PREMIUM DISCONTINUED IN 2012, ALLOWING SURPLUS AND RESOURCES TO BE DEVOTED TO THE EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE BUSINESS.  GLOBAL LIBERTY\u2019S HOMEOWNERS PROGRAM, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, WAS PLACED INTO RUN-OFF PRIOR TO ATLAS\u2019 ACQUISITION.THERE IS A RELATIVELY SMALL BOOK OF BUSINESS, WHICH IS SUBSTANTIALLY REINSURED, THAT IS STILL IN RUN-OFF.  ATLAS\u2019 WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION RELATED TO TAXI AND OTHER LIABILITY ARE ANCILLARY PRODUCTS THAT ARE OFFERED ONLY TO INSUREDS WHO PURCHASE OUR COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE INSURANCE PRODUCTS. THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION PROGRAM WAS NON-RENEWED IN 2018 DUE TO LIMITED DEMAND.  ASSIGNED RISK POOLS ARE ESTABLISHED BY STATE GOVERNMENTS TO COVER HIGH-RISK INSUREDS WHO CANNOT PURCHASE INSURANCE THROUGH CONVENTIONAL MEANS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORONAVIRUS IMPACT  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) ON OUR OPERATIONS. DUE TO THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS REPORTED IN MANY COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE ISSUED TRAVEL ADVISORIES, CANCELED LARGE SCALE PUBLIC EVENTS AND CLOSED SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, COMPANIES HAVE BEGUN TO CANCEL CONFERENCES AND TRAVEL PLANS AND REQUIRE EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME. GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTREME VOLATILITY AND DISRUPTIONS TO CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS.  ADVERSE EVENTS SUCH AS HEALTH-RELATED CONCERNS ABOUT WORKING IN OUR OFFICES, THE INABILITY TO TRAVEL, POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS, AND OTHER MATTERS AFFECTING THE GENERAL WORK AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS AND DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE CURRENT GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS AND FINANCIAL MARKET CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN THE FUTURE.  2019 DEVELOPMENTS  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY WAS UNABLE TO TIMELY FILE ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, JUNE 30, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO DELAYS IN THE YEAR END AUDIT PROCESS.  AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A NUMBER OF DELINQUENCY NOTICES FROM NASDAQ RELATED TO THESE FILINGS AS WELL AS OTHER MATTERS.  NASDAQ GRANTED THE COMPANY\u2019S REQUEST TO MOVE FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND GRANTED THE COMPANY AN EXTENSION TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS LISTING OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ORDINARY SHARES CONTINUE TO TRADE ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S 6.625% SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE 2022 MOVED TO THE OTC PINK SHEETS ON OCTOBER 17, 2019.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON APRIL 29, 2019, RSM US, LLP (\"RSM\") WAS DISMISSED AS THE CORPORATION\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  AT THE TIME RSM WAS DISMISSED, THE CORPORATION HAD NOT YET ENGAGED A SUCCESSOR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.  ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BAKER TILLY VIRCHOW KRAUSE, LLP (\u201cBAKER TILLY\u201d) WAS ENGAGED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO AUDIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THROUGHOUT 2019, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN EXPLORING STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FURTHER STRENGTHENING ITS PROCESSES, REVIEWING ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND OPPORTUNITIES, A POTENTIAL SALE OF THE COMPANY OR CERTAIN ASSETS, AND BALANCE SHEET STRENGTHENING OPTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF FACILITATING SHAREHOLDER VALUE GENERATION.  ATLAS CONCLUDED THAT THE UTILIZATION OF ITS WHOLLY OWNED MGA OPERATION TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS WILL ENABLE THE COMPANY TO LEVERAGE ITS FOCUS, EXPERIENCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO CREATE VALUE FOR STAKEHOLDERS.  A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WAS EXECUTED EFFECTIVE JUNE 10, 2019 BETWEEN ATLAS AND AMERICAN FINANCIAL GROUP, INC. (NYSE: AFG), UNDER WHICH ATLAS WILL ACT AS AN UNDERWRITING MANAGER FOR AFG\u2019S NATIONAL INTERSTATE (\u201cNATL\u201d) SUBSIDIARY AND TRANSITION NEW AND RENEWAL PARATRANSIT BUSINESS TO NATL PAPER FOR THIS BOOK OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING ON ADDITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING MGA RELATIONSHIPS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS AS WELL.  THE COMPANY AGREED THAT SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO SELL ITS MGA OPERATIONS, 49% OF THE PROCEEDS FROM ANY FUTURE SALE OF AGMI WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES TO FACILITATE THE REHABILITATION PROCESS.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY PORTION OF THE PROCEEDS ALLOCATED TO THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO THE COMPANY.  DURING 2019, THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (THE \u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d) PLACED ALL THREE OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES (AFTER GATEWAY WAS REDOMESTICATED IN ILLINOIS) INTO REHABILITATION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT AS THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR.  WHILE IN REHABILITATION, THE OPERATIONS OF SUCH INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES WILL BE OVERSEEN BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR ALTHOUGH ATLAS CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN ITS LEGAL OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK OF THE ASI POOL COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT\u2019S OVERRIDING STRATEGIC PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A TRANSITION OF BUSINESS FROM THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKETS WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME UTILIZING THE EXISTING PLATFORM OF THE MGA TO WORK WITH STRATEGIC EXTERNAL INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PARTNERS.  EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2019, NO NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY THE ASI POOL COMPANIES, AND ONLY NEW YORK AREA NEW BUSINESS WAS WRITTEN BY GLOBAL LIBERTY, WHICH IS FOCUSING ITS RESOURCES ON NEW YORK AREA BUSINESS TO LEVERAGE THE SUBSIDIARY\u2019S HERITAGE IN THIS LARGE AND SPECIFIC MARKET. THE ASI POOL COMPANIES AND GLOBAL LIBERTY CONTINUED TO WRITE RENEWAL BUSINESS THAT MET THEIR UNDERWRITING STANDARDS DURING 2019.  NON-RENEWALS RELATED TO ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 INSURANCE POLICIES BEGAN TOWARDS THE END OF 2019.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JANUARY 22, 2020, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT WITH BUCKLE, A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN FINANCIAL SERVICES COMPANY, TO PURCHASE THE STOCK OF ATLAS\u2019 INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY GATEWAY AND ITS CORPORATE CHARTER AND FORTY-SEVEN (47) STATE INSURANCE LICENSES AS WELL AS STATE STATUTORY DEPOSITS, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY AND OTHER NECESSARY APPROVALS, FOR $4.7 MILLION PLUS THE VALUE OF ALL PURCHASED DEPOSITS, SUCH AMOUNT TO BE PAID TO THE REHABILITATOR FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE REHABILITATION ESTATE OF GATEWAY, WITH A TENTATIVE CLOSING DATE IN APRIL OF 2020.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT BUCKLE WILL ENGAGE THE MGA AND CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUCKLE AND THAT BUCKLE WILL LEASE SPACE AT THE COMPANY\u2019S HEADQUARTERS AND ITS MELVILLE, NY OFFICE.  THE TRANSACTION WILL BE SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL AND A BID PROCESS ESTABLISHED BY THE STATUTORY REHABILITATOR AND APPROVED BY THE COURT, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL BE CONSUMMATED ON THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN OR AT ALL.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NUMEROUS CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K AND PRESS RELEASES SINCE DECEMBER 31, 2018 PROVIDE MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE ABOVE EVENTS.  II.

OUR UNDERWRITING APPROACH IS TO PRICE OUR PRODUCTS WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING UNDERWRITING PROFIT FOR THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WE OWN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PHILOSOPHY IS TO PRIORITIZE IMPROVEMENT IN UNDERWRITING MARGIN OVER TOP LINE GROWTH. AS WITH ALL P&C INSURANCE COMPANIES, THE IMPACT OF PRICE CHANGES AND OTHER UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES IS REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OVER TIME. UNDERWRITING CHANGES ON OUR IN-FORCE POLICIES OCCUR AS THEY ARE RENEWED. THIS CYCLE GENERALLY TAKES TWELVE MONTHS FOR OUR ENTIRE BOOK OF BUSINESS AND UP TO AN ADDITIONAL TWELVE MONTHS TO EARN A FULL YEAR OF PREMIUM AT THE RENEWAL RATE.  WE APPROACH INVESTMENT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT WITH THE INTENTION OF SUPPORTING INSURANCE OPERATIONS BY PROVIDING A STABLE SOURCE OF INCOME TO SUPPLEMENT UNDERWRITING INCOME. THE GOALS OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE TO PROTECT CAPITAL WHILE OPTIMIZING INVESTMENT INCOME AND CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE LIQUIDITY. WE FOLLOW A FORMAL INVESTMENT POLICY, AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS THE PORTFOLIO PERFORMANCE AT LEAST QUARTERLY FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES. THE INVESTMENT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS PROVIDES INTERIM GUIDANCE AND ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO ASSET ALLOCATION, AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.  AS A RESULT OF ACTIVITIES IN 2019, LIQUIDITY NEEDS RELATED TO THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE EXPECTED TO CHANGE.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART I, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  EXPENSES  NET CLAIMS INCURRED EXPENSES ARE A FUNCTION OF THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF INSURANCE CONTRACTS WE WRITE AND OF THE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE OF THE UNDERLYING RISKS. WE RECORD NET CLAIMS INCURRED BASED ON AN ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS OF THE ESTIMATED CLAIMS WE EXPECT TO BE REPORTED ON CONTRACTS WRITTEN. WE SEEK TO ESTABLISH CASE RESERVES AT THE PROBABLE EXPOSURE, BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, AND BEGINNING IN 2016, THE USE OF CLAIM RELATED ANALYTICS. OUR ABILITY TO ESTIMATE NET CLAIMS INCURRED ACCURATELY AT THE TIME OF PRICING OUR CONTRACTS IS A CRITICAL FACTOR IN DETERMINING OUR PROFITABILITY. THE AMOUNT REPORTED UNDER NET CLAIMS INCURRED IN ANY PERIOD INCLUDES PAYMENTS IN THE PERIOD NET OF THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF THE RESERVES FOR NET CLAIMS INCURRED BETWEEN THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE PERIOD, AS WELL AS ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE TRENDS OR CHANGES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ALWAYS RELIED ON INDEPENDENT ACTUARIAL PROFESSIONALS AND INTERNAL CONTROLS IN THIS REGARD, THE ESTIMATION OF RESERVES IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. WE ARE COMMITTED TO CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA OF OUR BUSINESS.  SEE \u201cEXPLANATORY NOTE\u201d AND \u201cPART 1, ITEM 2, 2019 DEVELOPMENTS\u201d  FOR CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY AND THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND SUBSEQUENT TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  ACQUISITION COSTS CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, PREMIUM TAXES. THE BROKERAGE AND AGENT COMMISSIONS ARE REDUCED BY CEDING COMMISSIONS RECEIVED FROM ASSUMING REINSURERS THAT REPRESENT A PERCENTAGE OF THE PREMIUMS ON INSURANCE POLICIES AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WRITTEN AND VARY DEPENDING UPON THE AMOUNT AND TYPES OF CONTRACTS WRITTEN.  OTHER UNDERWRITING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL RELATED EXPENSES (INCLUDING SALARIES, BENEFITS AND CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AWARDS UNDER OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS, SUCH AS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE) AND OTHER GENERAL OPERATING EXPENSES. WE BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE A PORTION OF OUR PERSONNEL EXPENSES ARE RELATIVELY FIXED IN NATURE, CHANGES IN PREMIUM WRITINGS MAY IMPACT OUR OPERATING SCALE AND OPERATING EXPENSE RATIOS.

THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 PRIOR PARENT RETAINED THOSE TAX ASSETS PREVIOUSLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES THAT COULD NOT BE UTILIZED BY ATLAS AS A RESULT OF THIS LIMITATION. AS A RESULT, ATLAS\u2019 ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE FUTURE TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH A PORTION OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS GENERATED DURING PRIOR YEARS HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT DETERMINED UNDER IRC SECTION 382. THE RESULT IS A MAXIMUM EXPECTED NET DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH ATLAS HAS AVAILABLE AFTER THE MERGER AND BELIEVED MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT TO BE UTILIZED IN THE FUTURE, AFTER CONSIDERATION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, ATLAS CONSIDERS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE RELATED TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF REALIZATION OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  POSITIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE PROFIT WITH VEHICLES IN-FORCE AT THEIR HIGHEST LEVELS AND STEADY NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS;  \u2022  ANTICIPATED ABILITY TO INCREASE PRICES IN CORE LINES AS THE COMMERCIAL AUTO MARKET IS FIRMING;  \u2022  OUR BELIEF THAT PREDICTIVE MODELING IN UNDERWRITING AND CLAIMS SHOULD GENERATE BETTER PRICED RISKS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO CREATE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OVER TIME; AND  \u2022  POSITIVE GROWTH TRENDS IN GROSS PREMIUMS WRITTEN IN EACH YEAR SINCE FORMATION.  NEGATIVE EVIDENCE EVALUATED WHEN CONSIDERING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES.  \u2022  NET LOSSES GENERATED IN THE THREE MOST RECENT YEARS; AND  \u2022  YEARLY LIMITATION AS REQUIRED BY IRC SECTION 382 ON NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS GENERATED PRIOR TO 2013.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  INVESTMENTS  OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY  ATLAS ALIGNS ITS SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO SUPPORT THE LIABILITIES AND OPERATING CASH NEEDS OF THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES, TO PRESERVE CAPITAL AND TO GENERATE INVESTMENT RETURNS. ATLAS INVESTS PREDOMINANTLY IN CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT BONDS WITH A PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO IN RELATIVELY SHORT DURATIONS THAT CORRELATE WITH THE PAYOUT PATTERNS OF ATLAS\u2019 CLAIMS LIABILITIES. ATLAS ALSO INVESTS OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN SELECTIVE DIRECT INVESTMENTS WITH FAVORABLE RETURN ATTRIBUTES. A THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT FIRM MANAGES ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PURSUANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES AS APPROVED BY ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ATLAS MONITORS THE THIRD-PARTY INVESTMENT MANAGER\u2019S PERFORMANCE AND ITS COMPLIANCE WITH BOTH ITS MANDATE AND ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT POLICIES AND GUIDELINES.  ATLAS\u2019 INVESTMENT GUIDELINES STRESS THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MARKET LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT PAYMENT OF LIABILITIES AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF RISK. WITH RESPECT TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES SECURITIES WITH THE EXPECTATION OF HOLDING THEM TO THEIR MATURITIES; HOWEVER, THE SECURITIES ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE IF LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARISE. TO THE EXTENT THAT INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR DECREASE, UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES MAY RESULT. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH GAINS OR LOSSES BEING REALIZED.

ACTUAL MATURITIES MAY DIFFER FROM CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES, BECAUSE CERTAIN ISSUERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO CALL OR PREPAY OBLIGATIONS WITH OR WITHOUT CALL OR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES. ATLAS HOLDS CASH AND HIGH GRADE SHORT-TERM ASSETS, WHICH, ALONG WITH FIXED INCOME SECURITY MATURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON A TIMELY BASIS. IN THE EVENT THAT ADDITIONAL CASH IS REQUIRED TO MEET OBLIGATIONS TO POLICYHOLDERS, ATLAS BELIEVES THAT A HIGH QUALITY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO PROVIDES US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE FIXED INCOME SECURITIES HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF 3.1 YEARS AND A DURATION OF 2.1 YEARS, COMPARED TO A WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF 4.8 YEARS AND A DURATION OF 3.8 YEARS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY HAVE A MODEST MARKET VALUE IMPACT ON THE ATLAS PORTFOLIO RELATIVE TO LONGER DURATION PORTFOLIOS. ATLAS CAN AND TYPICALLY DOES HOLD BONDS TO MATURITY BY MATCHING DURATION WITH THE ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  THE DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO IS THE SUM OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT AND INTEREST PAYABLE DIVIDED BY TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WAS  567.9%  AND  430.5%  , RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT RISK  CREDIT RISK IS DEFINED AS THE RISK OF FINANCIAL LOSS DUE TO FAILURE OF THE OTHER PARTY TO A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT TO DISCHARGE AN OBLIGATION. ATLAS IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK PRINCIPALLY THROUGH ITS INVESTMENTS AND BALANCES RECEIVABLE FROM POLICYHOLDERS, AGENTS AND REINSURERS. IT MONITORS CONCENTRATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RISK THROUGH POLICIES DESIGNED TO LIMIT AND MONITOR ITS EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR RELATED GROUPS (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BONDS) AS WELL AS THROUGH ONGOING REVIEW OF THE CREDIT RATINGS OF ISSUERS IN THE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE INDIVIDUAL POLICYHOLDER IS NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY\u2019S INSURANCE POLICIES, HOWEVER, ARE DISTRIBUTED BY AGENTS WHO MAY MANAGE CASH COLLECTION ON ITS BEHALF PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THEIR AGENCY AGREEMENT. ATLAS HAS PROTOCOLS TO EVALUATE THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK ARISING FROM SIMILAR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, ACTIVITIES, OR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE REINSURERS TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FROM REINSURERS\u2019 INSOLVENCY.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , ATLAS\u2019 ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBT WAS  $6.5 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $5.1 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBT RESULTED FROM AN ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN PAST DUE BALANCES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT  ATLAS RECOGNIZES LOSSES ON SECURITIES FOR WHICH A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE WAS DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. MANAGEMENT PERFORMS A QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF THE SECURITIES HOLDINGS TO DETERMINE IF DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ATLAS DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY CHARGES FOR SECURITIES IMPAIRMENTS THAT WERE CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.  THE LENGTH OF TIME SECURITIES MAY BE HELD IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION MAY VARY BASED ON THE OPINION OF THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYSES RELATED TO VALUATION AND TO THE VARIOUS CREDIT RISKS THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM RECAPTURING THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT. IN CASES OF SECURITIES WITH A MATURITY DATE WHERE THE APPOINTED INVESTMENT MANAGER DETERMINES THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RISK OF DEFAULT PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A HOLDING, ATLAS WOULD ELECT TO HOLD THE SECURITY IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION UNTIL THE PRICE RECOVERS OR THE SECURITY MATURES. IN SITUATIONS WHERE FACTS EMERGE THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RECAPTURE OF PRINCIPAL, ATLAS MAY ELECT TO SELL SECURITIES AT A LOSS.  THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS  $19.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $115.4 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THIS  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN THE TOTAL FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY NEEDS AND ASSESS THE SALE OF FIXED INCOME ASSETS, IF REQUIRED, ON A REGULAR BASIS.  DUE FROM REINSURERS  ATLAS PURCHASES REINSURANCE FROM THIRD PARTIES IN ORDER TO REDUCE ITS LIABILITY ON INDIVIDUAL RISKS AND ITS EXPOSURE TO LARGE CLAIMS. REINSURANCE IS COVERAGE PURCHASED BY ONE INSURANCE COMPANY FROM ANOTHER FOR PART OF THE RISK ORIGINALLY UNDERWRITTEN BY THE PURCHASING (CEDING) INSURANCE COMPANY. THE PRACTICE OF CEDING INSURANCE TO REINSURERS ALLOWS AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO CLAIMS BY SIZE, GEOGRAPHIC AREA, AND TYPE OF RISK OR ON A PARTICULAR POLICY. AN EFFECT OF CEDING INSURANCE IS TO PERMIT AN INSURANCE COMPANY TO WRITE ADDITIONAL INSURANCE FOR RISKS IN GREATER NUMBERS OR IN LARGER AMOUNTS THAN IT WOULD OTHERWISE INSURE INDEPENDENTLY, BASED ON ITS STATUTORY CAPITAL, RISK TOLERANCE AND OTHER FACTORS.  ATLAS GENERALLY PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO LIMIT NET EXPOSURE TO A MAXIMUM AMOUNT ON ANY ONE LOSS OF $500,000 WITH RESPECT TO COMMERCIAL AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS. ATLAS ALSO PURCHASES REINSURANCE TO PROTECT AGAINST AWARDS IN EXCESS OF ITS POLICY LIMITS. ATLAS CONTINUALLY EVALUATES AND ADJUSTS ITS REINSURANCE NEEDS BASED ON BUSINESS VOLUME, MIX, AND SUPPLY LEVELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO THE QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR ASI POOL COMPANIES AND THE GLOBAL QUOTA SHARE WITH SWISS RE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REINSURANCE CEDED DOES NOT RELIEVE ATLAS OF ITS ULTIMATE LIABILITY TO ITS INSUREDS IN THE EVENT THAT ANY REINSURER IS UNABLE TO MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THEREFORE, ATLAS ENTERS INTO REINSURANCE CONTRACTS WITH ONLY THOSE REINSURERS DEEMED TO HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PROVIDE THE REQUESTED COVERAGE. REINSURANCE TREATIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION BY THE REINSURERS OR ATLAS ON THE ANNIVERSARY DATE AND ARE SUBJECT TO RENEGOTIATION ANNUALLY. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ITS REINSURERS AND MONITORS THE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK TO MINIMIZE ITS EXPOSURE TO SIGNIFICANT CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF THE INSOLVENCY OF A REINSURER. ATLAS BELIEVES THAT THE AMOUNTS IT HAS RECORDED AS REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE APPROPRIATELY ESTABLISHED. ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES, HOWEVER, IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, AND THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS HAD  $88.5 MILLION  RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS (EXCLUSIVE OF AMOUNTS PREPAID) AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $81.2 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN THE AMOUNT RECOVERABLE FROM THIRD PARTY REINSURERS RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN CEDED CASE AND IBNR RESERVES AND THE TIMING OF THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE ON PAID CLAIMS.  ESTIMATING AMOUNTS OF REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES IS ALSO IMPACTED BY THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID CLAIMS AND CLAIMS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES. AS UNDERLYING RESERVES POTENTIALLY DEVELOP, THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY RECOVERABLE MAY VARY FROM AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECORDED. ATLAS\u2019 REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ARE GENERALLY UNSECURED. ATLAS REGULARLY EVALUATES ITS REINSURERS, AND THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS RECOVERABLE, AND AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE REINSURANCE IS PROVIDED FOR, IF NEEDED.  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JULY 31, 2019, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE ASI POOL COMPANIES WOULD TERMINATE ON A CUT-OFF BASIS.  ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ASI POOL COMPANIES\u2019 QUOTA SHARE CONTRACT WITH SWISS RE WAS TERMINATED ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.  DURING 2020, THE COMPANY RECEIVED NOTICE FROM GEN RE THAT EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020, THE XOL REINSURANCE COVERAGE FOR GLOBAL LIBERTY WOULD TERMINATE ON A RUN-OFF BASIS.

THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF ATLAS\u2019 BUSINESS HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ASSET MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON SECURITIES. CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR PAYMENT OF CLAIMS, COMMISSIONS AND GENERAL EXPENSES.

REFER ALSO TO THE DISCUSSION ABOVE IN THE \u2018INVESTMENTS OVERVIEW AND STRATEGY\u2019 SECTION. THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. IN THE EVENT THAT DIVIDENDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY ARE INADEQUATE TO SERVICE ITS OBLIGATIONS, THE HOLDING COMPANY WOULD NEED TO RAISE CAPITAL, SELL ASSETS OR INCUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

WE RECEIVE MOST PREMIUMS IN ADVANCE OF THE PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS DEPENDS ON THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF CLAIMS AND THE TIMING OF COLLECTION OF PREMIUMS RECEIVABLE AND REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES ON PAID CLAIMS.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS  $61.8 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PURCHASE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES. SALES OF INVESTMENTS WERE NEEDED TO FUND PAYMENTS TO POLICYHOLDERS AND CLAIMANTS. CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS  $18.6 MILLION  AND RESULTED FROM THE NET SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, THE NET SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND THE REPAYMENT OF TWO COLLATERAL LOANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF SHARES REPURCHASED UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ON MARCH 21, 2017, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO  650,000  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE REPURCHASES COULD HAVE BEEN MADE FROM TIME TO TIME IN OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, BLOCK PURCHASES, OR OTHERWISE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT UNTIL MARCH 21, 2018.

THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.03 BILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR STOCK, AS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \"  ACQUISITIONS  \" BELOW.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, WE ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $8.33 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $575.0 MILLION ($555.7 MILLION NET OF RELATED FEES) FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING. WE USED SUCH PROCEEDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION (AS DEFINED BELOW), THE REPAYMENT OF PINNACLE DEBT ACQUIRED, THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN CONAGRA BRANDS DEBT, AND THE PAYMENT OF RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE INTEGRATION OF PINNACLE IS CONTINUING AND ON-TRACK. WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES OF $305 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN THE INTEGRATION IS CONCLUDED.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REORGANIZED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE PINNACLE OPERATIONS INTO OUR LEGACY REPORTING SEGMENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS IS NOW BEING MANAGED. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REVISED SEGMENT PRESENTATION.  FISCAL 2020 THIRD QUARTER RESULTS  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, RESULTS REFLECTED A DECREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, WITH ORGANIC (EXCLUDES THE IMPACTS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DIVESTED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE ACQUISITION) DECREASES IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR REFRIGERATED & FROZEN SEGMENT, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT DECREASED DUE TO HIGHER INPUT COSTS, HIGHER BRAND BUILDING INVESTMENTS WITH RETAILERS, LOWER SALES VOLUMES, HIGHER INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, AND LOST PROFITS DUE TO DIVESTED BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SUPPLY CHAIN REALIZED PRODUCTIVITY AND COST SYNERGIES. OVERALL SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED IN EACH OPERATING SEGMENT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR REFRIGERATED & FROZEN SEGMENT. CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THERE WERE DECREASED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\"SG&A\") EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF COST SYNERGIES AND REMOVAL OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, OFFSET BY INCREASED STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE. WE RECOGNIZED LOWER EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT EARNINGS, LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE, AND HIGHER INCOME TAX EXPENSE, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. EXCLUDING ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $0.42. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $0.50.

WE HAVE APPROVED THE INCURRENCE OF UP TO $360.0 MILLION ($255.0 MILLION OF CASH CHARGES AND $105.0 MILLION OF NON-CASH CHARGES) IN CONNECTION WITH OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES UNDER THE PINNACLE INTEGRATION RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  ALTHOUGH WE REMAIN UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ENTIRE PINNACLE INTEGRATION RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE ARE REPORTING ON ACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS FOR EACH MAJOR TYPE OF COST EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED, AND THE CHARGES THAT HAVE RESULTED OR WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTFLOWS.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, WE RECOGNIZED CHARGES OF $36.9 MILLION AND $139.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE PINNACLE INTEGRATION RESTRUCTURING PLAN.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE INITIATED A NEW RESTRUCTURING PLAN FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH ACTIONS TAKEN TO IMPROVE SG&A EXPENSE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCIES AND TO OPTIMIZE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK (THE \"CONAGRA RESTRUCTURING PLAN\"). ALTHOUGH WE REMAIN UNABLE TO MAKE GOOD FAITH ESTIMATES RELATING TO THE ENTIRE CONAGRA RESTRUCTURING PLAN, WE ARE REPORTING ON ACTIONS INITIATED THROUGH THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS FOR EACH MAJOR TYPE OF COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED, AND THE CHARGES THAT HAVE RESULTED OR WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTFLOWS.

COVID \u2013 19  THE IMPACT THAT THE RECENT NOVEL CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMIC WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS UNCERTAIN. WE EXPECT A DECREASE IN CONSUMER TRAFFIC IN AWAY-FROM-HOME FOOD OUTLETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 ACROSS ALL OF OUR MAJOR  37  MARKETS  WHICH WILL  NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR NET SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN OUR FOODSERVICE SEGMENT FOR AT LEAST THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020. WE HAVE SEEN INCREASED ORDERS FROM RETAIL CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 IN RESPONSE TO INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR FOOD AT HOME.  THE INCREASED CONSUMER DEMAND MAY REVERSE IN THE COMING MONTHS AS CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR CHANGES. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE NATURE AND TIMING OF WHEN THAT IMPACT MAY OCCUR. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE IMPACT TO OUR BUSINESS, CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY.  SEGMENT REVIEW  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REORGANIZED OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS TO INCORPORATE THE PINNACLE BUSINESS INTO OUR LEGACY REPORTING SEGMENTS IN ORDER TO BETTER REFLECT HOW THE BUSINESS IS NOW BEING MANAGED. WE NOW REFLECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FOUR REPORTING SEGMENTS: GROCERY & SNACKS, REFRIGERATED & FROZEN, INTERNATIONAL, AND FOODSERVICE. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REVISED SEGMENT PRESENTATION.  GROCERY & SNACKS  THE GROCERY & SNACKS REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED, SHELF STABLE FOOD PRODUCTS SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES.  REFRIGERATED & FROZEN  THE REFRIGERATED & FROZEN REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED, TEMPERATURE-CONTROLLED FOOD PRODUCTS SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL CHANNELS IN THE UNITED STATES.  INTERNATIONAL  THE INTERNATIONAL REPORTING SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES BRANDED FOOD PRODUCTS, IN VARIOUS TEMPERATURE STATES, SOLD IN VARIOUS RETAIL AND FOODSERVICE CHANNELS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.  FOODSERVICE  THE FOODSERVICE REPORTING SEGMENT INCLUDES BRANDED AND CUSTOMIZED FOOD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MEALS, ENTREES, SAUCES AND A VARIETY OF CUSTOM-MANUFACTURED CULINARY PRODUCTS PACKAGED FOR SALE TO RESTAURANTS AND OTHER FOODSERVICE ESTABLISHMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES.  PRESENTATION OF DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) FROM ECONOMIC HEDGES OF FORECASTED CASH FLOWS IN SEGMENT RESULTS  DERIVATIVES USED TO MANAGE COMMODITY PRICE RISK AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ARE NOT DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. WE BELIEVE THESE DERIVATIVES PROVIDE ECONOMIC HEDGES OF CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. AS SUCH, THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED AT FAIR MARKET VALUE WITH REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE REPORTING SEGMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTION BEING ECONOMICALLY HEDGED IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

EARNINGS PER SHARE  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019 WERE $0.42 AND $0.50, RESPECTIVELY. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $1.31. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $1.27, INCLUDING EARNINGS OF $1.28 PER DILUTED SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND A LOSS OF $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SEE  \"ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY\"  ABOVE AS SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECTED THE COMPARABILITY OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  OUR PRIMARY FINANCING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN A PRUDENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES US FLEXIBILITY TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. IF NECESSARY, WE USE SHORT-TERM DEBT PRINCIPALLY TO FINANCE ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING OUR SEASONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, AND INVENTORIES, LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED PAYROLL, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES), AND A COMBINATION OF EQUITY AND LONG-TERM DEBT TO FINANCE BOTH OUR BASE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND OUR NON-CURRENT ASSETS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING.  AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\") WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PROVIDING FOR A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME OF $1.6 BILLION (SUBJECT TO INCREASE TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $2.1 BILLION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LENDERS). WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED A CREDIT FACILITY PRINCIPALLY AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT OUR RATIO OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION (\"EBITDA\") TO INTEREST EXPENSE BE NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1.0 AND OUR RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA NOT TO EXCEED CERTAIN DECREASING SPECIFIED LEVELS, RANGING FROM 5.25 THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021 TO 3.75 FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2023 AND THEREAFTER. EACH RATIO IS TO BE CALCULATED ON A ROLLING FOUR-QUARTER BASIS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS.  WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND  MAY 26, 2019  . THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF BORROWINGS DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $145.0 MILLION.  DURING FISCAL 2020 WE PREPAID THE REMAINING $400.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR $1.30 BILLION TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. PAYMENTS TOTALING $200.0 MILLION EACH WERE MADE IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020. THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT WAS TERMINATED AFTER THESE REPAYMENTS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ALSO REDEEMED $250.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE OCTOBER 22, 2020.  44  AS OF THE END OF THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2020  ,  OUR SENIOR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE ALL INVESTMENT GRADE. A SIGNIFICANT DOWNGRADE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW AMOUNTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT  FACILITY  , ALTHOUGH BORROWING COSTS WOULD INCREASE. A DOWNGRADE OF OUR SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS WOULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY NEGATIVELY IMPACTING BORROWING COSTS AND CAUSING SHORTER DURATIONS, AS WELL AS MAKING ACCESS TO COMMERCIAL PAPER MORE DIFFICULT  , OR IMPOSSIBLE.  WE REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME AFTER CONSIDERING MARKET CONDITIONS AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH REPURCHASE LIMITS AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD. UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION, WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR SHARES PERIODICALLY OVER SEVERAL YEARS, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS, AND MAY DO SO IN OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION HAS NO EXPIRATION DATE. WE PLAN TO REPURCHASE SHARES UNDER OUR AUTHORIZED PROGRAM ONLY AT TIMES AND IN AMOUNTS AS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIORITIZATION OF ACHIEVING OUR LEVERAGE TARGETS. THE COMPANY'S TOTAL REMAINING SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS $1.41 BILLION.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2019, THE BOARD ANNOUNCED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENT OF $0.2125 PER SHARE, TO BE PAID ON MARCH 3, 2020, TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 31, 2020. SUBJECT TO MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS AND THE APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD, WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF $0.85 PER SHARE DURING FISCAL 2020.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR  LENDER'S  \u00ae  BAGEL BUSINESS FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $33.2 MILLION, SUBJECT TO FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR DSD SNACKS BUSINESS FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $139.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WHICH HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THUS FAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR UNDRAWN REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AND THE CAPITAL MARKETS.  ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED OR NEEDED TO ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET IN RECENT WEEKS, WE ARE AWARE THAT THE IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAVE REDUCED THE AVAILABILITY AND ATTRACTIVENESS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. WE EXPECT THAT UNTIL COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET CONDITIONS IMPROVE, ACCESSING THIS SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM FINANCING COULD BE CHALLENGING OR AT ELEVATED COSTS.  WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF DEBT MATURING IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT TO PAY THIS DEBT, IN PART, FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, AND TO MAINTAIN OR HAVE ACCESS TO SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE THE REMAINDER OF THE DEBT UPON MATURITY, AS MARKET CONDITIONS WARRANT, FROM OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, PROCEEDS FROM ANY DIVESTITURES AND OTHER DISPOSITION TRANSACTIONS, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, AND OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  CASH FLOWS  DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, WE USED $137.6 MILLION OF CASH, WHICH WAS THE NET RESULT OF $906.5 MILLION GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, $59.9 MILLION USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, $984.6 MILLION USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, AND AN INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TOTALED $906.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO $745.1 MILLION GENERATED IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF THE ADDITIONAL OPERATING RESULTS FROM THE ACQUISITION OF PINNACLE. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST AND TAX PAYMENTS AND THE COMPARATIVE IMPACT OF CASH PROCEEDS OF $47.5 MILLION RECEIVED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019. INCREASED SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILDS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECT INCREMENTAL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW INNOVATION ITEMS. THIS WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS WITH CERTAIN LARGE SUPPLIERS, AND THE TIMING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CASH COLLECTIONS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $59.9 MILLION AND $5.30 BILLION IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2020 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $265.3 MILLION AND THE NET PROCEEDS FROM DIVESTITURES TOTALING $191.4 MILLION, INCLUDING THE SALES OF OUR DSD SNACKS AND  LENDER'S  \u00ae  BAGEL BUSINESSES. INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019 CONSISTED MAINLY OF THE PURCHASE OF PINNACLE FOR $5.12 BILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALING $236.1 MILLION, AND THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF OUR  DEL MONTE  \u00ae  PROCESSED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE BUSINESS IN CANADA TOTALING $32.2 MILLION.  45  CASH  USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED  $984.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $4.71 BILLION  IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2020 CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF THE REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT TOTALING $665.9  MILLION AND CASH DIVIDENDS PAID OF  $310.1 MILLION.  I  N THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL 2019  ,  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION, WE ISSUED LONG-TERM DEBT THAT GENERATED $8.31 BILLION IN GROSS PROCEEDS AND ISSUED COMMON STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $555.  7  MILLION. THIS WAS REDUCED BY DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS AND BRIDGE FINANCING FEES TOTALING $95.2  MILLION. WE REPAID $3.  52  BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, REDUCED OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM BY $27  8.  3  MILLION, AND PAID  CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $253.0 MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $99.0 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND $236.6 MILLION AT MAY 26, 2019, OF WHICH $47.3 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 AND $144.8 MILLION AT MAY 26, 2019 WAS HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES HAVE INVESTED OR WILL INVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS INDEFINITELY, OR THAT ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS WILL BE REMITTED IN A TAX-NEUTRAL TRANSACTION, AND, THEREFORE, DO NOT PROVIDE DEFERRED TAXES ON THE CUMULATIVE UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  OUR ESTIMATE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2020 IS APPROXIMATELY $370 MILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR REPAYMENT OF DEBT, INCLUDING ANY REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENT OF ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (I.E., OBLIGATIONS TO TRANSFER FUNDS IN THE FUTURE FOR FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES OF GOODS OR SERVICES AT FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICES, SUCH AS \"TAKE-OR-PAY\" CONTRACTS). THE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO IN OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF SOURCED PRODUCT ARE AVAILABLE. OF THESE ITEMS, DEBT, NOTES PAYABLE, FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AND OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS WERE RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS AS FOLLOWS.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  (IN MILLIONS)  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  TOTAL  LESS THAN 1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  AFTER 5 YEARS  LONG-TERM DEBT  $9,906.6  $901.7  $2,482.9  $1,000.1  $5,521.9  FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS  152.4  20.7  39.0  26.0  66.7  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  314.1  56.3  83.2  52.4  122.2  PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  1  AND OTHER CONTRACTS  1,393.5  1,143.9  130.8  59.6  59.2  NOTES PAYABLE  0.8  0.8  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL  $11,767.4  $2,123.4  $2,735.9  $1,138.1  $5,770.0  1  AMOUNTS INCLUDE OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS AND AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND/OR MAY BE CANCELLABLE. SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY SETTLEABLE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTRACTS, WHICH TOTALED $1.36 BILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WERE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  WE ARE ALSO CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COUPON INTEREST RATE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.7%.  THE OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE HAVE NOT BEEN REDUCED BY NON-CANCELLABLE SUBLEASE RENTALS OF $5.9 MILLION.  AS OF MAY 26, 2019, WE HAD AGGREGATE UNFUNDED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $131.7 MILLION AND $87.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SEVERAL INTERIM PENSION REMEASUREMENTS, WE HAD AGGREGATE UNFUNDED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $31.1 MILLION AND $85.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE AS THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS ARE REMEASURED EACH FISCAL YEAR, THEREBY RESULTING IN OUR INABILITY TO ACCURATELY PREDICT THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF ANY FUTURE REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO SUCH PLANS. BASED ON CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO FUND ANY AMOUNT TO OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL MAKE PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $14.2 MILLION AND $10.8 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO FUND OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY. SEE NOTE 14, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS  46  REPORT AND NOTE 19, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  \u2013  EMPLOYMENT  -  RELATED BENEFITS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY  '  S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 2  6  , 201  9  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ESTIMATES OF THIS LIABILITY.  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ONLY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUTURE EVENT (E.G., GUARANTEES OF DEBT OR LEASE PAYMENTS OF A THIRD PARTY SHOULD THE THIRD PARTY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM). IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, SUCH COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS TOTALING $1.7 MILLION, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  IN ADDITION TO THE OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, WE HAD $52.0 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF. THESE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR SELF-INSURED WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.  IN CERTAIN LIMITED SITUATIONS, WE WILL GUARANTEE AN OBLIGATION OF AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY. WE GUARANTEE CERTAIN LEASES RESULTING FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE JM SWANK BUSINESS COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THE REMAINING TERMS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT EXCEED THREE YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $0.7 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE GUARANTEE A CERTAIN LEASE RESULTING FROM AN EXITED FACILITY. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THE REMAINING TERM OF THIS ARRANGEMENT DID NOT EXCEED SEVEN YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $17.1 MILLION.  WE ALSO GUARANTEE AN OBLIGATION OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS PURSUANT TO A GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SPINOFF OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS (THE \"SPINOFF\") AND REMAINED IN PLACE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE SPINOFF UNTIL SUCH GUARANTEE OBLIGATION IS SUBSTITUTED FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED BY LAMB WESTON. PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 8, 2016 (THE \"SEPARATION AGREEMENT\"), BETWEEN US AND LAMB WESTON, THIS GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT IS DEEMED A LIABILITY OF LAMB WESTON THAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO LAMB WESTON AS PART OF THE SPINOFF. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ANY SUCH LIABILITY, REDUCED BY ANY INSURANCE PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY US, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT. LAMB WESTON IS A PARTY TO AN AGRICULTURAL SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND THROUGH 2020 (SUBJECT, AT LAMB WESTON\u2019S OPTION, TO EXTENSION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL FIVE-YEAR PERIODS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN RENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE SUBLESSOR. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE SUBLESSOR LAMB WESTON'S PERFORMANCE AND THE PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS (INCLUDING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) OWED BY LAMB WESTON UNDER THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF $75.0 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THE FARMLAND ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT IS READILY MARKETABLE FOR LEASE TO OTHER AREA FARMING OPERATORS. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTEE, WOULD BE LARGELY MITIGATED.  THE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS DISCLOSED ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RESERVES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN INCOME TAXES, AS WE ARE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF SETTLEMENT OF OUR RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES. THE LIABILITY FOR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020 WAS $46.2 MILLION. THE NET AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT FEBRUARY 23, 2020, THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS $32.4 MILLION. RECOGNITION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.
