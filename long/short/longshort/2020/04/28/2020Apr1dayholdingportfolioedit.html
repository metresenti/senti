ITEM 1A.  BUSINESS  ON  JANUARY 31, 2020 (THE \u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (THE \u201cASSET  SALE\u201d) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $7,250,000 PURSUANT TO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN US AND MITSUBISHI  CHEMICAL PERFORMANCE POLYMERS, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (\u201cMCPP\u201d). PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE DEVELOPED AND  MANUFACTURED ADVANCED POLYMER MATERIALS WHICH PROVIDE CRITICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  OUR BIOMATERIALS WERE MARKETED AND SOLD TO MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS WHO USED OUR ADVANCED POLYMERS IN DEVICES DESIGNED FOR  TREATING A BROAD RANGE OF ANATOMICAL SITES AND DISEASE STATES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE ASSET SALE, WE CEASED OPERATING AS A DEVELOPER, MANUFACTURER, MARKETER AND SELLER OF ADVANCED POLYMERS. SUBSEQUENT  TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE BECAME ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH THROUGH AN EQUITY-BASED  EXCHANGE TRANSACTION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INVESTIGATED CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES  TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADD VALUE TO US FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WE HAVE NOT YET ENTERED  INTO ANY BINDING ARRANGEMENTS.  WE  DO NOT INTEND TO RESTRICT OUR CONSIDERATION TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY SEGMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES,  THE SCOPE AND NUMBER OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO MERGE WITH IS RELATIVELY LIMITED. BECAUSE WE MAY PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY  WITH A NEWLY FORMED FIRM, A FIRM THAT IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE, OR A FIRM THAT IS ENTERING A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH, WE MAY INCUR  FURTHER RISK DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE TARGET\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO HAVE PROVEN ITS ABILITIES OR EFFECTIVENESS, OR THE LACK  OF AN ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR THE TARGET\u2019S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE INABILITY TO REACH PROFITABILITY IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS.  17  ANY  BUSINESS COMBINATION OR TRANSACTION WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUANCE OF SHARES AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR PRESENT  STOCKHOLDERS. AS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CLOSING OF SUCH A TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL, SUCH TRANSACTION IS  EXPECTED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE MERGER, WITH THE OPERATING COMPANY BEING CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIREE AND ACCOUNTING  ACQUIRER, AND WE WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIRER AND THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIREE. AS A RESULT, AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING  OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE OPERATING COMPANY WOULD BECOME OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS  PRESENTED.

HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY OUR MANAGEMENT, AND SUCH JUDGMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN APPLYING THESE POLICIES, OUR MANAGEMENT USES ITS JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS TO BE USED IN THE DETERMINATION  OF ESTIMATES.

ACTUAL RESULTS  MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATES CONTAINED IN OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ANY  BUSINESS COMBINATION OR TRANSACTION WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUANCE OF SHARES AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR PRESENT  STOCKHOLDERS. AS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CLOSING OF SUCH A TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL, SUCH TRANSACTION IS  EXPECTED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE MERGER, WITH THE OPERATING COMPANY BEING CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIREE AND ACCOUNTING  ACQUIRER, AND WE WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIRER AND THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIREE. AS A RESULT, AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING  OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE OPERATING COMPANY WOULD BECOME OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS  PRESENTED.  21  COMMITMENTS  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019.

RISK FACTORS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL 2019.  22 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT MADE BY US IN THIS REPORT OR ELSEWHERE SPEAKS ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT IS MADE. NEW RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO PREDICT THESE EVENTS OR HOW THEY MAY AFFECT US. WE HAVE NO DUTY TO, AND DO NOT INTEND TO, UPDATE OR REVISE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW. IN LIGHT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT MADE IN THIS REPORT OR ELSEWHERE, MIGHT NOT OCCUR.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) OUTBREAK TO BE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IN RESPONSE TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE RAPID SPREAD OF COVID-19 WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE IMPOSED VARYING DEGREES OF RESTRICTIONS ON SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE ILLNESS. THESE MEASURES HAVE BEGUN TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT UPON MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING NON-ESSENTIAL RETAIL COMMERCE.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE TEMPORARILY CLOSED OUR DEDICATED STORES, OUR MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS AND MANY OF OUR WAREHOUSES. IN ADDITION, MOST OF OUR OFFICE PERSONNEL ARE WORKING REMOTELY. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION ON A DAILY BASIS, BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN AND HOW QUICKLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN-PERSON RETAIL AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAD $12,189 IN CASH AND $17,677 IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ALONG WITH $22,327 OF AVAILABILITY ON OUR UNSECURED CREDIT LINE. IN ADDITION, WE OWN EIGHT UNENCUMBERED STORE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE A BOOK VALUE OF $17,812 WHICH WE COULD LEVERAGE IF NEEDED.  WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL MEASURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. SPECIFIC MEASURES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH OUR LANDLORDS TO RECEIVE TEMPORARY RENT DEFERRALS ON MANY OF OUR STORE LEASES  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH OUR VENDORS TO DEFER PAYMENTS  \u25cf  CANCELLING VARIOUS PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INVENTORY  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH CUSTOMERS TO MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF IN-COMING CASH AND TO REDUCE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE  \u25cf  FURLOUGHING HOURLY PLANT PERSONNEL UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS PRUDENT TO RESUME MANUFACTURING  \u25cf  IMPLEMENTING A 20% TO 25% SALARY AND WAGE DECREASE FOR MOST OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CERTAIN OTHER EXECUTIVES TAKING A 50% PAY REDUCTION THROUGH MAY OF 2020  \u25cf  OBTAINING A COMMITMENT FROM OUR BANK TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR LINE OF CREDIT BY AN ADDITIONAL $25,000 (SEE \u201c  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \u201d BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMENDMENT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY).  WHILE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT THAT THIS SITUATION WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS FOR OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2020 AND POSSIBLY BEYOND.  OVERVIEW  BASSETT IS A LEADING RETAILER, MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BRANDED HOME FURNISHINGS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED BRANDED STORES UNDER THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS (\u201cBHF\u201d) NAME, WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1902 AND INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF VIRGINIA IN 1930. OUR RICH 118-YEAR HISTORY HAS INSTILLED THE PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY, VALUE, AND INTEGRITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPERTISE TO RESPOND TO EVER-CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY.  WITH 103 BHF STORES AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAVE LEVERAGED OUR STRONG BRAND NAME IN FURNITURE INTO A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSED STORES THAT FOCUS ON PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR BUYING FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES. OUR STORE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE HOME FURNISHINGS RETAIL STORE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF STYLISH, QUALITY FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE. IN ORDER TO REACH MARKETS THAT CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SERVED BY OUR RETAIL STORE NETWORK, WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE USE A NETWORK OF OVER 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE STATED GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES. THESE SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPENSATED BASED ON A STANDARD COMMISSION RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS BLENDED STRATEGY PROVIDES US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  23 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE BHF STORES FEATURE CUSTOM ORDER FURNITURE, FREE IN-HOME DESIGN VISITS (\u201cHOME MAKEOVERS\u201d) AND COORDINATED DECORATING ACCESSORIES. OUR PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON BUILDING STRONG LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CUSTOMER. SALES PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cDESIGN CONSULTANTS\u201d AND ARE TRAINED TO EVALUATE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HOME DECOR. UNTIL A RIGOROUS TRAINING AND DESIGN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS COMPLETED, DESIGN CONSULTANTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM IN-HOME DESIGN SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE FACTORIES IN NEWTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS THAT MANUFACTURE CUSTOM UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE, A FACTORY IN MARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA THAT PRIMARILY ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR CUSTOM CASUAL DINING OFFERINGS AND A FACTORY IN BASSETT, VIRGINIA THAT ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR \u201cBENCH MADE\u201d LINE OF CUSTOM, SOLID HARDWOOD FURNITURE. IN LATE 2019, WE ALSO BEGAN OPERATING A FACILITY IN HALEYVILLE, ALABAMA THAT PROVIDES BASSETT WITH THE CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE CUSTOM ALUMINUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE PRIMARILY UNDER THE LANE VENTURE BRAND. OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE BREADTH OF ITS OPTIONS, THE PRECISION OF ITS CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND THE SPEED OF ITS PROCESS, WITH CUSTOM PIECES OFTEN MANUFACTURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF TAKING THE ORDER IN OUR STORES. OUR LOGISTICS TEAM THEN PROMPTLY SHIPS THE PRODUCT TO ONE OF OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS OR TO A LOCATION SPECIFIED BY OUR LICENSEES. IN ADDITION TO THE FURNITURE THAT WE MANUFACTURE DOMESTICALLY, WE SOURCE MOST OF OUR FORMAL BEDROOM AND DINING ROOM FURNITURE (CASEGOODS) AND CERTAIN LEATHER UPHOLSTERY OFFERINGS FROM SEVERAL FOREIGN PLANTS, PRIMARILY IN VIETNAM, THAILAND AND CHINA. OVER 75% OF THE PRODUCTS WE CURRENTLY SELL ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ALSO OWN ZENITH FREIGHT LINES, LLC (\u201cZENITH\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SERVICES TO BASSETT ALONG WITH OTHER FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS. ZENITH DELIVERS BEST-OF-CLASS SHIPPING AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF BASSETT AND THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ZENITH\u2019S REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-BASSETT CUSTOMERS.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF LANE VENTURE FROM HERITAGE HOME GROUP, LLC. LANE VENTURE IS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND IS NOW BEING OPERATED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THIS ACQUISITION MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE MARKET FOR OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT LANE VENTURE HAS PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR US TO BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THIS CATEGORY. OUR STRATEGY IS TO DISTRIBUTE THIS BRAND OUTSIDE OF OUR BHF STORE NETWORK ONLY.  WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE GAINED THROUGH OPERATING LANE VENTURE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW SEPARATE BRAND OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE THAT IS ONLY MARKETED THROUGH THE BHF STORE NETWORK. THIS ALLOWS BASSETT BRANDED PRODUCT TO MOVE FROM INSIDE THE HOME TO OUTSIDE THE HOME TO CAPITALIZE THE GROWING TREND OF OUTDOOR LIVING.  AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, OUR BHF STORE NETWORK INCLUDED 69 COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND 34 LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE CLOSED ONE UNDERPERFORMING COMPANY-OWNED STORE IN BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS, AND A NEW 23,000 SQUARE FOOT LICENSEE STORE WAS OPENED IN THORNTON, COLORADO. IN MARCH 2020, WE ALSO CLOSED UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN STOUGHTON, MASSACHUSETTS, NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA AND TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE COMPLETED A THREE-YEAR STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT HAS SEEN US GROW TO MORE THAN 100 STORES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMPANY-OWNED OR LICENSEE-OWNED STORE OPENINGS PLANNED. OUR STRATEGY IS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT FLEET OF STORES AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE CORPORATE RETAIL SEGMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAY CONSIDER FUTURE EXPANSION SHOULD ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE.  24 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AS WITH ANY RETAIL OPERATION, PRIOR TO OPENING A NEW STORE WE INCUR SUCH EXPENSES AS RENT, TRAINING COSTS AND OTHER PAYROLL RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN $200 TO $400 PER STORE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL RENT COSTS FOR THE LOCATION AND THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN WE TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE STORE SPACE AND THE TIME OF THE STORE OPENING. GENERALLY, RENT PAYMENTS DURING A BUILDOUT PERIOD BETWEEN DELIVERY OF POSSESSION AND OPENING OF A NEW STORE ARE DEFERRED AND THEREFORE STRAIGHT-LINE RENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING THAT TIME DOES NOT REQUIRE CASH. INHERENT IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL, WE ALSO INCUR LOSSES IN THE TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A NEW STORE OPENING. LIKE OTHER FURNITURE RETAILERS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A SALE UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMER. BECAUSE OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL DOES NOT INVOLVE MAINTAINING A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR FURNITURE OFFERINGS, DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS USUALLY OCCURS ABOUT 30 DAYS AFTER AN ORDER IS PLACED. WE GENERALLY REQUIRE A DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF ORDER AND COLLECT THE REMAINING BALANCE WHEN THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED, AT WHICH TIME THE SALE IS RECOGNIZED. COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES CAN RANGE FROM $400 TO $600 PER STORE.  TODAY\u2019S CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEIR DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND COMMUNICATIONS TO BE PERSONALIZED, HIGHLY-RELEVANT AND CATERED TO MATCH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PREFERENCES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CENTRALIZED CUSTOMER CARE CENTER THAT IS USING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM) SOFTWARE TO TRACK EACH CUSTOMER\u2019S PATH FROM INITIAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGH POINT OF SALE AND ULTIMATELY TO THEIR POST-DELIVERY EXPERIENCE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DIGITAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 JOURNEY FROM THE TIME THEY BEGIN ON OUR WEBSITE TO THE FINAL STEP OF DELIVERING THE GOODS TO THEIR HOMES. WE VIEW THE COMBINATION OF WEBSITE TRAFFIC AND STORE TRAFFIC IN A HOLISTIC FASHION WHERE OUR CUSTOMER GENERALLY EXPERIENCES OUR BRAND ON OUR WEBSITE BEFORE VISITING A STORE. WHILE STORE TRAFFIC HAS BEEN DECREASING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITE INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2019 WITH WEB VISITS UP 15% FOR THE YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WITH SIMILAR GROWTH FOR THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020. WHEN THE STORES REOPEN, WE PLAN TO INVEST MORE IN NEW DIGITAL OUTREACH STRATEGIES ON A STORE MARKET BY MARKET BASIS TO DRIVE MORE TRAFFIC TO THE WEBSITE. WE WILL CONTINUE SOME DIGITAL OUTREACH DURING THE PERIOD OUR STORES ARE CLOSED BUT AT A GREATLY REDUCED RATE TO KEEP OUR BRAND PRESENCE IN SEARCH ENGINES AND SOCIAL MEDIA.  OUR PURE E-COMMERCE SALES (ORDERING DIRECTLY FROM THE WEBSITE) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN IMMATERIAL. WE PLAN TO INVEST IN OUR WEBSITE IN 2020 TO IMPROVE THE NAVIGATION AND THE ORDERING CAPABILITIES TO INCREASE WEB SALES. MUCH OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS HIGHLIGHT THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR CUSTOM FURNITURE CAPABILITIES WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO SHOW AND SELL ONLINE. WE PLAN TO EXPAND OUR MERCHANDISING STRATEGIES TO INCLUDE MORE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE MORE EASILY PURCHASED ONLINE WITH OR WITHOUT A STORE VISIT. WHILE WE WORK TO INCREASE WEB SALES, WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON OUR IN-STORE EXPERIENCE OR THE QUALITY OF OUR IN-HOME MAKEOVER CAPABILITIES.

WHOLESALE.  THE WHOLESALE HOME FURNISHINGS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED PRINCIPALLY IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, SOURCING, SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FURNITURE PRODUCTS TO A NETWORK OF BASSETT STORES (COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED RETAIL STORES) AND INDEPENDENT FURNITURE RETAILERS. OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR WOOD AND UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE LANE VENTURE, AS WELL AS ALL CORPORATE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING THOSE CORPORATE EXPENSES RELATED TO BOTH COMPANY- AND LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. WE ELIMINATE THE SALES BETWEEN OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE IMBEDDED PROFIT IN THE RETAIL INVENTORY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT ARE OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OUR HOLDINGS OF RETAIL REAL ESTATE PREVIOUSLY LEASED AS LICENSEE STORES. THE EARNINGS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LOSS, NET, IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  RETAIL \u2013 COMPANY-OWNED  S  TORES.  OUR RETAIL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND INCLUDES THE REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE) AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE STORES AND THE COMPANY-OWNED DISTRIBUTION NETWORK UTILIZED TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS.  LOGISTICAL SERVICES.  OUR LOGISTICAL SERVICES SEGMENT REFLECTS THE OPERATIONS OF ZENITH. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SHIPPING AND WAREHOUSING SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY, ZENITH ALSO PROVIDES SIMILAR SERVICES TO OTHER CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. REVENUE FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SERVICES TO OTHER CUSTOMERS IS INCLUDED IN LOGISTICAL SERVICES REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR 13 WEEKS COMPARED TO 14 WEEKS), NET SALES DECREASED 3.8%. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 95% DECREASE IN JUVENILE FURNITURE SHIPMENTS AS WE HAVE EXITED THIS FURNITURE LINE AND A 5.2% DECREASE IN SHIPMENTS ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS TO OUR TRADITIONAL OPEN MARKET CUSTOMERS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1.2% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS TO THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK (BHF) AND A 16% INCREASE ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS OF LANE VENTURE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT CEASED SELLING ACCESSORIES TO THE BHF NETWORK BEGINNING AT THE START OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. BOTH THE CORPORATE AND LICENSEE OWNED STORES NOW PURCHASE ACCESSORIES DIRECTLY FROM THIRD-PARTY ACCESSORY PROVIDERS. WHOLESALE SALES OF ACCESSORY ITEMS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $945. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 32.5% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO 32.9% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS IN THE UPHOLSTERY AND IMPORT WOOD OPERATIONS DUE TO FIXED COST DELEVERAGE FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $390 INVENTORY CHARGE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 RELATED TO THE EXIT OF THE JUVENILE BUSINESS. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES INCREASED TO 28.3% AS COMPARED TO 27.1% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THIS INCREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REDUCED LEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUME AND INCREASED OVER-THE-ROAD FREIGHT AND WAREHOUSING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTH INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO IMPROVED CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - RETAIL  THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE 69 COMPANY-OWNED BHF STORES WAS DUE TO A $6,856 OR 10.4% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $3,073 IN NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WE OPENED 6 STORES OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS. IN ADDITION, WE CLOSED ONE UNDERPERFORMING STORE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, ANOTHER UNDERPERFORMING STORE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND CLOSED AN ADDITIONAL THREE UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN MARCH DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019), COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 3.5%.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 7.9% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS, COMPARABLE STORE WRITTEN SALES DECREASED 0.8%.  29 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  COMPARABLE STORE GROSS MARGINS IMPROVED 40 BASIS POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED SALES MIX. THE 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VARIOUS COST STRUCTURE DECREASES IMPLEMENTED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2019 AND REDUCED HEALTH INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO IMPROVED CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DELEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME.  THE $1,374 IMPROVEMENT IN THE NON-COMPARABLE OPERATING LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NO NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS IN THE QUARTER COMPARED TO $494 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND NO POST-OPENING LOSSES IN THE QUARTER COMPARED TO $828 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  RETAIL BACKLOG  THE DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR RETAIL BACKLOG, REPRESENTING ORDERS RECEIVED BUT NOT YET DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, WAS $29,775, OR AN AVERAGE OF $432 PER OPEN STORE, AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AS COMPARED WITH A RETAIL BACKLOG OF $31,295, OR AN AVERAGE OF $454 PER OPEN STORE, AT MARCH 2, 2019.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 LOGISTICAL SERVICES  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019), REVENUES INCREASED 5.5%. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OVER-THE-ROAD TRUCKING REVENUES AS SEVERAL NEW CUSTOMERS WERE ADDED DURING THE QUARTER. THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER LEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS FROM HIGHER REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.  OTHER  ITEMS  A  FFECTING  N  ET  INCOME  EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OFFERED AN EARLY RETIREMENT PACKAGE TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE RECEIVING PAY EQUAL TO ONE-HALF THEIR CURRENT SALARY PLUS BENEFITS OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE FINAL DAY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $835 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 2, 2019. THE UNPAID OBLIGATION OF $148 AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020 WILL BE PAID OUT WITHIN FISCAL 2020.  OTHER  L  OSS,  N  ET  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 WAS $362 AS COMPARED TO $123 FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 2, 2019. THE INCREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LIFE INSURANCE DEATH BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  30 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  INCOME  T  AXES  AND IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  WE CALCULATE AN ANTICIPATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR BASED ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF PRETAX INCOME AND USE THAT EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO RECORD OUR YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME TAX PROVISION.  ANY CHANGE IN ANNUAL PROJECTIONS OF PRETAX INCOME COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE RESPECTIVE QUARTER.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND MARCH 2, 2019 OF 34.5% AND 26.4%, RESPECTIVELY, DIFFER FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING A TAX BENEFIT DEFICIENCY OF $114 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 ARISING FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOWS  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS $5,243 COMPARED TO $15,734 USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN CASH USED OF $10,491. THIS DECREASED USE OF CASH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY DUE TO FEWER NEW STORE OPENINGS, OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL DUE IN PART TO THE TIMING IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND IMPROVED OPERATIONS IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT.  OUR OVERALL CASH POSITION DECREASED BY $7,498 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. IN ADDITION TO THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS, WE HAD A NET USE OF $77 OF CASH IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN CDS, LARGELY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ONE OF OUR REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $2,178, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $1,260 AND STOCK REPURCHASES OF $766 UNDER OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN, OF WHICH $9,873 REMAINS AUTHORIZED AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020.

REFERENCES TO \u201cNOTES\u201d ARE TO THE FOOTNOTES INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY RESEARCHES, DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, SELLS, AND DISTRIBUTES FURNISHINGS AND ACCESSORIES, FOR USE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING OFFICE, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATIONAL, AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS, AND PROVIDES RELATED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OWNED CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS, DIRECT CUSTOMER SALES, INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, OWNED RETAIL STUDIOS, DIRECT-MAIL CATALOGS AND THE COMPANY'S E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  .  \u2022  NET SALES WERE  $665.7 MILLION  AND ORDERS WERE  $651.7 MILLION  , REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  7.5%  AND  6.3%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ACQUISITIONS OF HAY AND NAUGHTONE, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL LIST PRICE INCREASES. ON AN ORGANIC BASIS, NET SALES WERE  $615.9 MILLION  (*)  AND ORDERS WERE  $604.1 MILLION  , REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF  0.5%  (*)  AND  1.4%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN WAS  36.5%  AS COMPARED TO  35.7%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THIS INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF SPECIAL CHARGES TOTALING  $1.4 MILLION  RELATED TO THE INITIAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN HAY. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LIST PRICE INCREASES, LOWER STEEL COSTS, AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ACQUISITIONS OF HAY AND NAUGHTONE.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $19.7 MILLION  OR  11.4%  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED SPECIAL CHARGES, TOTALING  $4.7 MILLION  , RELATED TO  TRANSACTION COSTS AND INITIAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN HAY AND NAUGHTONE.  OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE OF  $3.5 MILLION  RELATED  PRIMARILY TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROFIT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  22.4%  COMPARED TO  16.0%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  \u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED  $0.02  TO $0.64  , A  3.0%  DECREASE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES, ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $0.74  (*)  , A  15.6%  INCREASE  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  THE COMPANY DECLARED CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $0.21  PER SHARE COMPARED TO  $0.1975  PER SHARE IN THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $79 MILLION WAS MADE IN ACQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL 34% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF HAY.  (*) NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS; SEE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.  26  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S VIEW ON THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT OPERATES.  \u2022  THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE THIRD QUARTER, OUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA REFLECTED A MIXED MACRO-ECONOMIC PICTURE. JOB GROWTH AND ARCHITECTURAL BILLING ACTIVITY REFLECT POSITIVE TRENDS, WHILE INDUSTRY ORDER TRENDS AS REPORTED BY THE BUSINESS AND INSTITUTIONAL FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (\"BIFMA\") HAVE VARIED IN RECENT MONTHS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS MONITORING THE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS TRADE POLICY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND KEY TRADING PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING THE U.K. REFERENDUM TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION (\"BREXIT\"). THESE NEGOTIATIONS CREATE A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN KEY MARKETS, PARTICULARLY THE U.K., CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND CHINA, WHICH, IF UNRESOLVED IN THE NEAR TERM, WILL LIKELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMER DEMAND.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS ALSO NAVIGATING THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL TARIFFS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE, BASED UPON EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT PRICING, STRATEGIC SOURCING ACTIONS AND PROFIT OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVES HAVE FULLY OFFSET THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA.  \u2022  THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT IS FACING CONTINUING GROSS MARGIN PRESSURE FROM INCREASING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS THAT THE PRODUCTS THEY BUY SHOULD COME WITH FREE OR DISCOUNTED SHIPPING. IN RESPONSE, THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES, INCLUDING NEGOTIATING LOWER COSTS FROM THIRD PARTY FREIGHT PROVIDERS, IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF ITS LOGISTICS PROCESSES AND MORE CLOSELY REFLECTING THE COST OF DELIVERY INTO THE BASE PRICE OF ITS PRODUCTS.  THE REMAINING SECTIONS WITHIN ITEM 2 INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  COVID-19 UPDATE  THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 IN CHINA DURING OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER AND WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 AND IN FISCAL 2021. THIS OUTBREAK HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR SUPPLY BASE, INCLUDING GOODS SHIPPED FROM CHINA IN THE QUARTER AS WELL AS RESULTED IN TEMPORARY FACILITY CLOSURES IN OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. WHILE WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE PRECISE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS, WE DO KNOW THAT THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING PLANT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION. THE EXTENT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD AND DURATION OF THIS NEW VIRUS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.  EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH  WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING PLANT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA EXPERIENCED THE INITIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19, IT WAS RUNNING AT NEAR FULL CAPACITY BY LATE MARCH. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT FIRST INTERACTION WITH THE VIRUS LED TO A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE SAFETY MEASURES TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, WORK-FROM-HOME PRACTICES, EXTENSIVE CLEANING PROTOCOLS, AND ULTIMATELY THE CLOSURE OF OUR SHOWROOMS AND RETAIL OUTLETS TO THE PUBLIC.  CUSTOMER FOCUS  OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, SALES, SUPPLIER, AND DEALER TEAMS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH CUSTOMERS TO MEET CURRENT DEMAND. SALES TEAMS ARE MEETING WITH CUSTOMERS REMOTELY VIA VIDEO CALLS AND BY LEVERAGING VIRTUAL REALITY TO CONTINUE THE DESIGN AND SPECIFICATION PROCESS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE PLACE IN A SHOWROOM. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE WORKING REMOTELY TO STAY CONNECTED TO CUSTOMERS REGARDING ORDER STATUS AND PROJECTED DELIVERY DATES.  MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONS  AS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, THE COMPANY IS RESPONDING TO SHELTER-IN-PLACE AND SIMILAR GOVERNMENT ORDERS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.  IN MICHIGAN FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER\u2019S \u201cSTAY HOME, STAY SAFE\u201d EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRED ALL NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES TO CLOSE FOR THREE WEEKS UNTIL APRIL 13. HOWEVER, AS THE COMPANY SERVES THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AMONG OTHER CRITICAL SECTORS, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SUPPORT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE COVID-19 RESPONSE. IN AN EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE BATTLE AGAINST COVID-19, THIS WORK WILL ALSO INCLUDE TRANSFORMING A PORTION OF ITS MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT TO FULFILL THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR MEDICAL AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR SIMILAR EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATIONS IN OTHER AREAS.  ELSEWHERE IN THE U.S., NEMSCHOFF, WHICH ALSO SERVES THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, CONTINUES OPERATIONS AT FULL CAPACITY IN SHEBOYGAN, WI. OPERATIONS AT MAHARAM, BASED IN YAPHANK, NY AND GEIGER, IN BOTH ITS FULTON, GA AND HILDEBRAN, NC LOCATIONS, ALSO REMAIN OPEN.  27  INTERNATIONALLY, OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED NEAR BANGALORE, INDIA IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED UNDER A GOVERNMENT ORDER. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS ARE SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. IN BRAZIL AND MEXICO, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES, WHICH SERVE THE LATIN AMERICA REGION, ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED UNDER A GOVERNMENT ORDER.  RETAIL OPERATIONS  DWR AND HAY RETAIL STUDIOS AND STORES ACROSS THE US ARE CURRENTLY CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, BUT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN BATAVIA, OH IS STILL OPERATIONAL. FREIGHT CARRIERS ARE DELIVERING TO EVERY MARKET DOMESTICALLY BUT CHANGING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DAILY THAT MAY AFFECT DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME MARKETS THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OFFER WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY AT THIS TIME, BUT CAN COORDINATE WITH CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER PRODUCT TO THEIR DOOR. ITS ECOMMERCE PLATFORMS ARE OPERATING, HOWEVER, THIS WILL NOT OFFSET THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE STUDIOS AND STORES.  COST REDUCTIONS  THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED A RANGE OF ACTIONS AIMED AT TEMPORARILY REDUCING COSTS AND PRESERVING LIQUIDITY. THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE A 10% REDUCTION IN CASH COMPENSATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S SALARIED WORKFORCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDING CERTAIN EMPLOYER-PAID RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND WILL SUSPEND PREVIOUSLY PLANNED COMPENSATION INCREASES AND CASH INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAMS FOR THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR ENDING MAY 2021. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE FURTHER WAYS TO MANAGE COSTS IN LINE WITH REDUCED REVENUE LEVELS.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THIS REPORT CONTAINS REFERENCES TO ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. ORGANIC GROWTH (DECLINE) REPRESENTS THE CHANGE IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE REPRESENTS REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT FROM ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AMORTIZATION OF AN INVENTORY STEP UP ON THE HAY EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT, A GAIN ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES OR GAINS, INCLUDING RELATED TAXES. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES INCLUDE ACTIONS INVOLVING FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION AND OPTIMIZATION, TARGETED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM. SPECIAL CHARGES INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO CEO TRANSITION, THIRD PARTY CONSULTING COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PROFIT ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, AND ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES PRESENTING ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON A MORE COMPARATIVE BASIS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED ARE NOT MEASUREMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE RELATED GAAP MEASUREMENT. THESE NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OUR PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INDICATION THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY PROVIDING PROMINENCE OF OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT.  28  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NET SALES TO ORGANIC NET SALES FOR THE PERIODS ENDED AS INDICATED BELOW.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF MEDICAL, SURGICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES USED BY PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FOR VASCULAR ACCESS, FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE AND FOR USE IN ONCOLOGY AND SURGICAL SETTINGS. OUR DEVICES ARE GENERALLY USED IN MINIMALLY INVASIVE, IMAGE-GUIDED PROCEDURES. MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED ONCE AND THEN DISCARDED, OR THEY MAY BE TEMPORARILY IMPLANTED FOR SHORT- OR LONGER-TERM USE.  OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS CROSS A VARIETY OF MARKETS. OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS IMPACTED BY CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS, WHICH HAVE INCLUDED AN EMERGENCE OF VALUE-BASED PURCHASING BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, CONSOLIDATION OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, THE INCREASED ROLE OF THE CONSUMER IN HEALTH CARE DECISION-MAKING AND AN AGING POPULATION, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, OUR GROWTH IS IMPACTED BY CHANGES WITHIN OUR SECTOR, SUCH AS THE MERGING OF COMPETITORS TO GAIN SCALE AND INFLUENCE; CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR MEDICAL DEVICE; AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY GROWTH ALSO DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS. EXPANSIONS TO OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE CREATED THROUGH INTERNAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND FEEL CONFIDENT THAT OUR EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION WILL ALLOW US TO PROPERLY FUND THOSE ACTIVITIES.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH A DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF A DIRECT SALES AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS. WE EXPECT OUR BUSINESSES TO GROW IN BOTH SALES AND PROFITABILITY THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, MARKET PENETRATION, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND INCREASING OUR DIRECT PRESENCE INTERNATIONALLY.  ON DECEMBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE C3 WAVE TIP LOCATION ASSET FROM MEDICAL COMPONENTS INC. FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $10.0 MILLION WITH $5.0 MILLION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO TECHNICAL MILESTONES. THIS ACQUISITION FILLS A GAP IN THE VASCULAR ACCESS PORTFOLIO AND SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC PLAN.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS AN ASSET PURCHASE.  THE COMPANY RECORDED THE AMOUNT PAID AT CLOSING AS INVENTORY  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF $0.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF A TRADEMARK OF $0.9 MILLION AND PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY OF $8.5 MILLION.  THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER 15 YEARS.   THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION COMPRISES TECHNICAL MILESTONES AND WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN THE CONTINGENCY IS RESOLVED OR BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE UNDER ASC 450.  ON OCTOBER 2, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE EXIMO MEDICAL, LTD., A PRE-COMMERCIAL STAGE MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY AND ITS PROPRIETARY 355NM B LASER ATHERECTOMY TECHNOLOGY.  THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $60.7 MILLION INCLUDED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $45.8 MILLION AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $14.9 MILLION.  THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDS AND COMPLEMENTS THE COMPANY\u2019S VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS AND THERAPIES PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BY ADDING THE 355NM B LASER ATHERECTOMY TECHNOLOGY WHICH TREATS PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE.  ON MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE NAMIC FLUID MANAGEMENT BUSINESS (THE \u201cDIVESTITURE\u201d) AND ALL OF THE ASSETS USED PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FLUID MANAGEMENT BUSINESS TO MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. (\u201cMEDLINE\u201d) PURSUANT TO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 17, 2019 (THE \u201cASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d).  TOTAL CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DIVESTITURE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $169.2 MILLION IN CASH AND RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $46.6 MILLION AFTER WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS OF $0.6 MILLION.  A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS WERE USED ON JUNE 3, 2019 TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING FACILITY AND THE REMAINING NET PROCEEDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS.  THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC MAY POSE SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS. IT IS TOO EARLY TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT THIS SITUATION WILL HAVE ON REVENUE AND PROFITS FOR THE REMAINDER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2020 OR BEYOND, BUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS BEING UNDERTAKEN TO REDUCE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS ARE AND MAY CONTINUE TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER DEMAND, HOSPITAL OPERATING PROCEDURES AND WORKFLOW, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT IS EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY POSITION, COMMUNICATING WITH AND MONITORING THE ACTIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, AND REVIEWING OUR NEAR-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS WE MANAGE THE COMPANY THROUGH THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  1.  OUR FIELD BASED SALES PERSONNEL ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRAVELING, BOTH IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR HEALTH AS WELL AS AT THE REQUEST OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS THEY SEEK TO INCREASE CRITICAL CARE CAPACITY;  2.  OUR OFFICE-BASED EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO WORK REMOTELY, AND  3.  OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN QUEENSBURY, NEW YORK IS OPERATING UNDER OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN WITH PRECAUTIONS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CREATING SMALL \u201cWORK PODS\u201d, INCREASING DISTANCING AND REGULARLY MONITORING TEMPERATURES.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT GUIDANCE AND RESTRICTIONS FROM THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID SERVICES, HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO REDUCE \u201cELECTIVE-LIKE\u201d PROCEDURES AND PRIORITIZE CRITICAL CARE AND CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON CERTAIN PROCEDURE VOLUMES TO WHICH CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS RELATE.  AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW, WE WILL CLOSELY MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  IN EVALUATING THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. A SUMMARY OF THESE KEY FINANCIAL METRICS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  \u2022  REVENUE INCREASED BY 6.5% TO $69.8 MILLION  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED 40 BPS TO 57.8%  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS INCREASED BY $2.6 MILLION TO $6.2 MILLION  \u2022  LOSS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED BY $0.03 TO A LOSS OF $0.15  NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  \u2022  REVENUE INCREASED BY 3.2% TO $205.8 MILLION  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN INCREASED 80 BPS TO 58.3%  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS DECREASED BY $1.8 MILLION TO $10.5 MILLION  \u2022  LOSS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IMPROVED BY $0.11 TO A LOSS OF $0.26  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR FORM 10-K. WHILE ALL THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE VIEW CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES AS CRITICAL. POLICIES DETERMINED TO BE CRITICAL ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE US TO USE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND/OR ESTIMATES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  AS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, THE FOLLOWING UPDATES WERE MADE AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL, INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IN PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IP R&D\") ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE BETWEEN TWO TO EIGHTEEN YEARS, ON EITHER A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF BENEFIT OR AS REVENUES ARE EARNED FROM THE SALES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND REVIEW SUCH ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WILL EQUAL THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT RATHER, ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARISE. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT EITHER INCURRED OR ALLOCATED COST. ALLOCATED COSTS WERE BASED ON RESPECTIVE FAIR MARKET VALUES AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  FOR GOODWILL, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO WHICH THE GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THAT REPORTING UNIT. THE DETERMINATION OF REPORTING UNITS ALSO REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS WHETHER A REPORTING UNIT EXISTS WITHIN A REPORTABLE SEGMENT BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL IS REDUCED TO ITS FAIR VALUE THROUGH AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE GOODWILL BALANCE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.  WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE WE TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED UPON THE ULTIMATE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC, THERE MAY BE MATERIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF SUCH ASSETS.  THE COMPANY OPERATES AS A SINGLE OPERATING SEGMENT WITH ONE REPORTING UNIT AND CONSEQUENTLY EVALUATES GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNIT WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  INFORMATION REGARDING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 18 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK CLOSELY, AS WELL AS ANY EFFECTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE CARES ACT.  HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  THROUGHOUT THIS QUARTERLY REPORT, WE PRESENT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE WAY WE BELIEVE WILL BE MOST MEANINGFUL, USEFUL AND TRANSPARENT TO ANYONE USING THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE.  OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"U.S. GAAP\") FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. GAAP PRESENTATION OF NET LOSS, WE PRESENT SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AS A NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS VALUABLE IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS AND DRAWING COMPARISONS TO OUR PEERS.  BELOW IS A DEFINITION OF OUR NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO U.S. GAAP.  SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME REPRESENTS ONE MEASURE OF THE PRETAX PROFITABILITY OF OUR SEGMENTS AND IS DERIVED BY SUBTRACTING DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES FROM DIRECT SEGMENT REVENUES.  REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE PRESENTED IN THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT ARE NOT SUBTOTALED BY SEGMENT; HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN TOTAL AND BY SEGMENT IN NOTE  20  , \"  SEGMENTED INFORMATION  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REGARDING REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION.  THE NEAREST COMPARABLE U.S. GAAP MEASURE IS INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE THAT, IN ADDITION TO SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDES NET INVESTMENT INCOME, NET REALIZED GAINS, GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE, NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAIN ON PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS, INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT AND EQUITY IN NET (LOSS) INCOME OF INVESTEE.  A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  IS PRESENTED IN TABLE 1 OF THE \"RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\" SECTION OF MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  51  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  THE PREPARATION OF UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  ESTIMATES AND THEIR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS.  CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED.  THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES; VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS; IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS; VALUATION OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE; VALUATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS; VALUATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES; VALUATION OF MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK; VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS; GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY; DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS; FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SUBORDINATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS; AND REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE INCREASE IN SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME RESULTS FROM THE INCLUSION OF GEMINUS IN 2019 FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES AT TRINITY.

GEMINUS OPERATING INCOME WAS A LOSS OF $0.1 MILLION AND ZERO FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF SERVICES SOLD DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH TRINITY\u2019S MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES, THE DECREASE IN SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME THAT RESULTED FROM LOWER MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES AT TRINITY HAD A MUCH LESS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME.  LEASED REAL ESTATE  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , LEASED REAL ESTATE RENTAL INCOME WAS  $3.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $3.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .

THE INCREASE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GENERALLY HIGHER LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED INTEREST RATES FOR THREE-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR DEPOSITS (\"LIBOR\") DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .

THE  UNFAVORABLE  DEVELOPMENT REPORTED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  WAS RELATED TO A DECREASE IN LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES DUE TO THE CONTINUING VOLUNTARY RUN-OFF OF AMIGO.  SEE THE \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\" SECTION OF MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES.  DEBT  BANK LOANS  ON OCTOBER 12, 2017, THE COMPANY BORROWED A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $5.0 MILLION  FROM A BANK TO PARTIALLY FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION OF PWSC (THE \"PWSC LOAN\").  THE PWSC LOAN HAS A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  5.0%  AND IS CARRIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE.  THE PWSC LOAN WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 12, 2022; HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL TOTALING $0.3 MILLION WAS FULLY REPAID ON JANUARY 30, 2020.  ON MARCH 1, 2019, THE COMPANY BORROWED A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $10.0 MILLION  FROM A BANK TO FINANCE ITS ACQUISITION OF GEMINUS (THE \"KWH LOAN\").  THE KWH LOAN MATURES ON MARCH 1, 2024 AND HAS AN ANNUAL INTEREST RATE EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS  9.25%  .  THE KWH LOAN IS CARRIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS AMORTIZED COST, WHICH REFLECTS THE QUARTERLY PAY-DOWN OF PRINCIPAL AS WELL AS THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DISCOUNT USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD.   SEE NOTE  13  , \"  DEBT  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.  NOTES PAYABLE  AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF CMC IN JULY 2016, THE COMPANY ASSUMED THE MORTGAGE AND RECORDED THE MORTGAGE AT ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF  $191.7 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDED THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $180.0 MILLION  AS OF THE DATE OF ACQUISITION PLUS A PREMIUM OF  $11.7 MILLION  .  THE MORTGAGE MATURES ON MAY 15, 2034 AND HAS A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  4.07%  .  THE MORTGAGE IS CARRIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS AMORTIZED COST, WHICH REFLECTS THE MONTHLY PAY-DOWN OF PRINCIPAL AS WELL AS THE AMORTIZATION OF THE PREMIUM USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD.  ON JANUARY 5, 2015, FLOWER PORTFOLIO 001, LLC ASSUMED A $9.2 MILLION MORTGAGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES (\"THE FLOWER NOTE\").

ON OCTOBER 15, 2015, NET LEASE INVESTMENT GRADE PORTFOLIO LLC ASSUMED A $9.0 MILLION MEZZANINE DEBT IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES (\"THE NET LEASE NOTE\").

THE NET LEASE NOTE IS CARRIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT ITS UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE.  58  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  SUBORDINATED DEBT  BETWEEN DECEMBER 4, 2002 AND DECEMBER 16, 2003, SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF THE COMPANY ISSUED $90.5 MILLION OF 30-YEAR CAPITAL SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES IN SEPARATE PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.  IN EACH INSTANCE, A CORRESPONDING FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURE WAS THEN ISSUED BY KINGSWAY AMERICA INC. TO THE TRUST IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE SALE.  THE FLOATING RATE DEBENTURES BEAR INTEREST AT THE RATE OF LIBOR, PLUS SPREADS RANGING FROM 3.85% TO 4.20%.  THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL EACH OF THESE SECURITIES AT PAR VALUE ANY TIME AFTER FIVE YEARS FROM THEIR ISSUANCE UNTIL THEIR MATURITY.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY GAVE NOTICE TO ITS TRUST PREFERRED TRUSTEES OF ITS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS VOLUNTARY RIGHT TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR UP TO 20 QUARTERS, PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF ITS OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED INDENTURES, WHICH PERMIT INTEREST DEFERRAL. THIS ACTION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DEFAULT UNDER THE COMPANY'S TRUST PREFERRED INDENTURES OR ANY OF ITS OTHER DEBT INDENTURES.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , DEFERRED INTEREST PAYABLE OF  $4.1 MILLION  IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT IS MEASURED AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT IS  $50.4 MILLION  .  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT IS CALCULATED USING A MODEL BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND INPUTS DEVELOPED BY A THIRD PARTY.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND INPUTS DEVELOPED BY A THIRD PARTY USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, SEE NOTE  21  , \"  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES CHANGED, AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION DEVELOPED BY THE THIRD PARTY.  CHANGES IN THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE MODEL IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  AN INCREASE IN THE LIBOR SWAP RATES HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE RISK-FREE SWAP RATES HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FAIR VALUE.  THE INCREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT WHILE A DECREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE.  THE OTHER PRIMARY VARIABLE AFFECTING THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT CALCULATION IS THE PASSAGE OF TIME, WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT.   THE CHANGES TO THE CREDIT SPREAD AND SWAP RATE VARIABLES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , ALONG WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, CONTRIBUTED TO THE  $0.4 MILLION  INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT BETWEEN  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2019.  OF THE  $0.4 MILLION  INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT BETWEEN  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  $0.9 MILLION  IS REPORTED AS INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK IN THE COMPANY'S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AND  $0.6 MILLION  IS REPORTED AS GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, A CUMULATIVE  $40.5 MILLION  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF SUBORDINATED DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED DEFICIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018.  AS LONG AS THE COMPANY REPAYS ITS SUBORDINATED DEBT AT MATURITY, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT THIS  $40.5 MILLION  RECLASSIFICATION WILL REVERSE WITHOUT BEING REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THOUGH CHANGES IN THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES WILL CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE SOME VOLATILITY EACH QUARTER TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTED GAIN OR LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, CHANGES IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION DEVELOPED BY THE THIRD PARTY WILL NO LONGER INTRODUCE VOLATILITY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT WILL EVENTUALLY EQUAL THE PRINCIPAL VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT BY THE TIME OF THE STATED REDEMPTION DATE OF EACH TRUST, BEGINNING WITH THE TRUST MATURING ON DECEMBER 4, 2032 AND CONTINUING THROUGH JANUARY 8, 2034, THE REDEMPTION DATE OF THE LAST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING TRUSTS.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE COMPANY'S SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, SEE NOTE  13  , \"  DEBT  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE  4  , \"  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND FUTURE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE PURPOSE OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT CASH TO MEET ALL FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS THEY FALL DUE.  THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CAPITAL RAISING, DISPOSAL OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS OR FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR MAKING INVESTMENTS AND FOR WARRANTY EXPENSES AND LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS, DEBT SERVICING AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  THE TIMING AND  59  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, WHICH MAY CREATE INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  $2.9 MILLION  OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S REPORTED NET INCOME OF  $3.2 MILLION  AND THE  $2.9 MILLION  OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED PRIMARILY BY THE  $4.3 MILLION  GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS  $5.9 MILLION  .  THIS USE OF CASH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PURCHASES OF FIXED MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SALES OF OTHER INVESTMENTS AND FROM ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS  $7.8 MILLION  .  THIS SOURCE OF CASH IS ATTRIBUTED TO  $9.0 MILLION  OF NET BANK LOAN PROCEEDS OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ON BANK LOANS OF  $0.3 MILLION  AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $0.9 MILLION  ON THE NOTES PAYABLE.  IN SUMMARY, AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, THE COMPANY'S NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $1.0 MILLION.  RECEIPT OF DIVIDENDS FROM THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAS NOT GENERALLY BEEN CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE HOLDING COMPANY.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PRIOR TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY WERE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY WITHOUT REGULATORY APPROVAL PURSUANT TO THE DOMICILIARY INSURANCE REGULATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME.  THE COMPANY'S LEASED REAL ESTATE SUBSIDIARY FUNDS ITS OBLIGATIONS THROUGH RENTAL INCOME.  THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH INVESTMENT INCOME AND MATURITIES IN THE INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIOS.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY IS MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  ACTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY IN ORDER TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SALE OF PASSIVE INVESTMENTS; SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES; ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES; DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW; AND GIVING NOTICE TO ITS TRUST PREFERRED TRUSTEES OF ITS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS VOLUNTARY RIGHT TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR UP TO 20 QUARTERS ON THE SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT, WHICH RIGHT THE COMPANY EXERCISED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  ON MARCH 1, 2019, THE COMPANY CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF GEMINUS, A SPECIALTY, FULL-SERVICE PROVIDER OF VEHICLE SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCE AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE PENN WARRANTY CORPORATION (\"PENN\") AND PRIME AUTO CARE, INC. (\"PRIME\").  GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE INCLUDED IN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  RELATED TO THE GEMINUS ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY SECURED THE KWH LOAN.  IWS, TRINITY, GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE BORROWERS UNDER THE KWH LOAN.  PURSUANT TO SATISFYING THE COVENANTS UNDER THE KWH LOAN, IWS, TRINITY, GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE PERMITTED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $1.5 MILLION IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD.  SEPARATELY, PURSUANT TO COVENANTS UNDER THE PWSC LOAN SECURED TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF PWSC ON OCTOBER 12, 2017, PWSC IS NOT PERMITTED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LENDER.  THE PWSC LOAN WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 12, 2022; HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL TOTALING $0.3 MILLION WAS FULLY REPAID ON JANUARY 30, 2020.  DIVIDENDS FROM THE LEASED REAL ESTATE SEGMENT ARE NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE HOLDING COMPANY.   BECAUSE OF THE LEASE AMENDMENT, CMC MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE COMPANY SOME OF THE CASH RECEIVED FROM THE ADDITIONAL RENTAL INCOME.  ANY MATERIAL CASH FLOW TO THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, TO HELP THE COMPANY MEET ITS HOLDING COMPANY OBLIGATIONS REMAINS LIKELY TO OCCUR ONLY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OF THE THREE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THAT WOULD TRIGGER PAYMENT OF SERVICE FEES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE TIMING OF THE OCCURRENCE, OR THE RESULTING OUTCOME, FROM ONE OF THESE EVENTS.  PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO AT THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION OF CMC, AN AFFILIATE OF THE SELLER (THE \"SERVICE PROVIDER\") WILL PROVIDE CERTAIN SERVICES TO CMC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICE FEES.  SUCH SERVICES (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"SERVICES\") WILL INCLUDE (I) CAUSING AN AFFILIATE OF THE SERVICE PROVIDER TO GUARANTY CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS OF THE PROPERTY OWNER (PURSUANT TO AN INDEMNITY AND GUARANTY AGREEMENT BETWEEN SUCH AFFILIATE AND THE HOLDER OF THE MORTGAGE (THE \"MORTGAGOR\")), (II) PROVIDING CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO SERVE AS MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND/OR CERTAIN EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF CMC AND/OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND (III) PROVIDING ASSET MANAGEMENT SERVICES WITH RESPECT TO THE REAL PROPERTY.  IN EXCHANGE FOR  60  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  THE SERVICES, THE PROPERTY OWNER WILL PAY CERTAIN FEES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER.  THE PAYMENT OF SUCH SERVICE FEES MAY BE TRIGGERED BY (I) A SALE OF THE REAL PROPERTY, (II) A RESTRUCTURING OF THE LEASE TO WHICH THE REAL PROPERTY IS SUBJECT OR (III) A REFINANCING OR RESTRUCTURING OF THE MORTGAGE.  THE AMOUNT OF THE SERVICE FEES WILL RANGE FROM 40%-80% OF THE NET PROCEEDS GENERATED BY THE EVENT TRIGGERING THE PAYMENT OF THE SERVICE FEES (DEPENDING ON THE NATURE AND TIMING OF THE TRIGGERING EVENT).  THE LEASE AMENDMENT HAS NOT TRIGGERED THE PAYMENT OF SERVICE FEES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDER.  THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY, DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT OF CASH IN THE BANK ACCOUNTS OF KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC. AND KINGSWAY AMERICA INC., WAS  $4.2 MILLION  AND  $1.9 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THESE AMOUNTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $13.4 MILLION  AND  $14.6 MILLION  REPORTED AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH OTHER THAN THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY REPRESENT RESTRICTED AND UNRESTRICTED CASH HELD BY AMIGO, KINGSWAY RE AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EXTENDED WARRANTY AND LEASED REAL ESTATE SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AVAILABLE TO MEET HOLDING COMPANY OBLIGATIONS, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES, WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF HOLDING COMPANY OPERATING EXPENSES; TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES; INVESTMENTS; AND ANY OTHER EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS ON THE HOLDING COMPANY.  THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY OF  $4.2 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY NINE MONTHS OF REGULARLY RECURRING OPERATING EXPENSES BEFORE ANY TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, ANY NEW HOLDING COMPANY INVESTMENTS OR ANY OTHER EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS ON THE HOLDING COMPANY.  AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY OF  $3.7 MILLION  REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS OF REGULARLY RECURRING OPERATING EXPENSES BEFORE ANY TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES, ANY NEW HOLDING COMPANY INVESTMENTS OR ANY OTHER EXTRAORDINARY DEMANDS ON THE HOLDING COMPANY.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY GAVE NOTICE TO ITS TRUST PREFERRED TRUSTEES OF ITS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS VOLUNTARY RIGHT TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR UP TO 20 QUARTERS, PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF ITS OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED INDENTURES, WHICH PERMIT INTEREST DEFERRAL.  THE HOLDING COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY OF  $4.2 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $3.7 MILLION  AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  REPRESENTS ONLY ACTUAL CASH ON HAND AND DOES NOT INCLUDE CASH THAT WOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY INVESTMENTS IN PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES, OWNED BY THE HOLDING COMPANY.  IN ADDITION, THE HOLDING COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO SOME OF THE OPERATING CASH GENERATED BY THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE THESE SOURCES DO NOT REPRESENT CASH OF THE HOLDING COMPANY AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THEY DO REPRESENT FUTURE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, THERE ARE 182,876 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CLASS A PREFERRED STOCK (THE \"PREFERRED SHARES\"), ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING. ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED SHARES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE REDEEMED BY THE COMPANY ON APRIL 1, 2021 (\"REDEMPTION DATE\") AT A REDEMPTION VALUE OF $6.7 MILLION (ASSUMING ALL CURRENT OUTSTANDING PREFERRED SHARES WOULD BE REDEEMED), IF THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT LEGALLY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO DO SO. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO DEFER PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON ITS OUTSTANDING SUBORDINATED DEBT (\"TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES\") AND, BECAUSE OF THE DEFERRAL WHICH TOTALED $10.5 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANY IS PROHIBITED FROM REDEEMING ANY SHARES OF ITS CAPITAL STOCK WHILE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES IS BEING DEFERRED.  IF, AS OF APRIL 1, 2021, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO PAY BOTH THE DEFERRED INTEREST ON THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND REDEEM ALL THE PREFERRED SHARES CURRENTLY OUTSTANDING, THEN THE COMPANY CURRENTLY PROJECTS THAT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT LEGALLY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO DO SO.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO UNDER DELAWARE LAW AND, AS SUCH, (A) THE INTEREST ESTIMATED TO BE $14.9 MILLION ON MARCH 31, 2021 ON THE TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES WOULD REMAIN ON DEFERRAL AS PERMITTED UNDER THE INDENTURES AND (B) IN ACCORDANCE WITH DELAWARE LAW THE PREFERRED SHARES WOULD NOT BE REDEEMED ON THE REDEMPTION DATE (WITH A REDEMPTION VALUE OF $6.7 MILLION) AND WOULD INSTEAD REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND CONTINUE TO ACCRUE DIVIDENDS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT LEGALLY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO REDEEM THE PREFERRED SHARES AND IS NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED FROM DOING SO.  IN SUCH A SITUATION, THE COMPANY WOULD CONTINUE TO OPERATE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE.  THE COMPANY NOTES THERE ARE SEVERAL VARIABLES TO CONSIDER IN SUCH A SITUATION, AND MANAGEMENT IS CURRENTLY EXPLORING THE FOLLOWING OPPORTUNITIES: NEGOTIATING WITH THE HOLDERS OF THE PREFERRED SHARES WITH RESPECT TO THE REDEMPTION DATE AND/OR OTHER KEY PROVISIONS, RAISING ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH CAPITAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUED STRATEGY OF WORKING TO MONETIZE ITS NON-CORE INVESTMENTS WHILE ATTEMPTING TO MAXIMIZE THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN LIQUIDITY AND VALUE RECEIVED. THE COMPANY ALSO NOTES THAT THE CONVERSION OF ANY PREFERRED SHARES THAT MIGHT OCCUR PRIOR TO APRIL 1, 2021 WOULD IMPACT ITS ANALYSIS AS OF APRIL 1, 2021.  BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT BUSINESS PLAN AND REVENUE PROSPECTS, EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENT BALANCES AND ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, EXCLUDING THE CASH THAT MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDEEM THE PREFERRED SHARES AND DEFERRED INTEREST ON ITS TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSESSMENT COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  61  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  REGULATORY CAPITAL  IN THE UNITED STATES, A RISK-BASED CAPITAL (\"RBC\") FORMULA IS USED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (\"NAIC\") TO IDENTIFY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT MAY NOT BE ADEQUATELY CAPITALIZED.  IN GENERAL, INSURERS REPORTING SURPLUS AS REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS BELOW 200% OF THE AUTHORIZED CONTROL LEVEL, AS DEFINED BY THE NAIC, AT DECEMBER 31 ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING LEVELS OF REGULATORY ACTION, INCLUDING DISCONTINUATION OF OPERATIONS.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , SURPLUS AS REGARDS POLICYHOLDERS REPORTED BY AMIGO EXCEEDED THE 200% THRESHOLD.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012, THE COMPANY BEGAN TAKING STEPS TO PLACE ALL OF AMIGO INTO VOLUNTARY RUN-OFF.  IN APRIL 2013, KINGSWAY FILED A COMPREHENSIVE RUN-OFF PLAN WITH THE FLORIDA OFFICE OF INSURANCE REGULATION, WHICH OUTLINES PLANS FOR AMIGO'S RUN-OFF.  AMIGO REMAINS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT PLAN.  KINGSWAY RE, OUR REINSURANCE SUBSIDIARY DOMICILED IN BARBADOS, IS REQUIRED BY THE REGULATOR IN BARBADOS TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM STATUTORY CAPITAL OF $125,000.

WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH HAS COST THE COMPANY $0 IN ADVERTISING  FEES, WILL AFFORD US OPPORTUNITIES UNLIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS (DURING WHICH TIME THE COMPANY AVERAGED $400K- $800K  PER YEAR IN ADVERTISING COSTS FOR ITS SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS). MANAGEMENT IS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND IF SUBSCRIPTION  REVENUES CONTINUE AS THEY HAVE IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2020, THE COMPANY HOPES TO BECOME CASH FLOW POSITIVE WITH RECORD REVENUES  OVER NEXT TWELVE (12) MONTHS.  MOREOVER, AS PART OF ITS COST-CUTTING MEASURES  MANAGEMENT HAS CLOSED TWO OFFICE LOCATIONS, ONE IN SAN GABRIEL, CA AND ONE IN NEW YORK CITY, NY, WITH PLANS TO CLOSE THE OFFICE  IN FLUSHING, NY AND ONE LOCATION IN SHANGHAI. IN ADDITION MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO CUT OVERALL ADVERTISING COSTS TO LESS THAN $10K  PER MONTH OVER THE NEXT TWELVE (12) MONTHS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT IS EXPLORING JOINT  VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES WITH PARTNERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO REACH OUR UNIQUE NETWORK OF CONSUMERS. WITH REGARD TO ITS INDUSTRIAL HEMP/CBD  BUSINESS IN CHINA, THE COMPANY HAS TWO NEW HEMP-INFUSED, SKIN-FRIENDLY, ANTIMICROBIAL SANITIZER PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO  RECRUIT AND WILL SEEK TO RETAIN A TALENTED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE WORKFORCE AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN ITS  EXISTING SALES FORCE THROUGH ENHANCED TRAINING, ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND PROVIDING CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES. AS SUCH,  THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE ANY FURTHER LAYOFFS OF ITS SALES FORCE OTHER THAN IN THE NORMAL COURSE.  36  BUDGETARY CONTROL  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL  BE CONTROLLED AND WERE REDUCED IN BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS  LAST YEAR. AS NOTED ABOVE, CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WERE  $5,237,878 AND $8,398,744, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASED CASH USED IN OPERATIONS WAS DUE TO A REDUCTION IN GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES USED IN OPERATIONS. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, HAS RELINQUISHED ONE OF ITS COMMERCIAL LEASES IN  SAN GABRIEL, CA AND ITS COMMERCIAL LEASE IN NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FORCED TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES  IN BOTH THE NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA OFFICES WHOSE PRIMARY DUTIES RELATED TO CRYPTOCURRENCY PRODUCTS, MARKETING, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THE MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY TRANSFERRED TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES IN CHINA.  THE MANAGEMENT HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED BUDGETARY  CONTROL ON CERTAIN EXPENDITURES SUCH AS OFFICE UTILITIES, OTHER GENERAL OFFICE EXPENSES, AND COMPANY TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT IN  AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO APPROXIMATELY $300,000 USD EACH MONTH FROM THE CURRENT  EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $400,000, EXCLUDING CURRENT DEBT DUE AND OWING.  FINANCING  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTINUING TO RELY  ON SALES OF ITS SECURITIES TO FUND A PORTION OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, PLANS TO MEET ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS,  AND WILL CONFORM TO ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO REMAINING A FULLY REPORTING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WHILE INCREASING ITS MARKET PRESENCE  AS WELL AS SERVICES OFFERING SPECTRUM.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.", "CIK": 1459482, "Date": "2020-04-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CIIX", "Name": "Chineseinvestorscom Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 8200.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "IN", "IRS": null, "key": "20200414CIIX", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -11.111111111111107, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.59347636, "prof1": 0.40652362, "return1&2": 1.1111111111111112, "return1&2&3": 1.1111111111111112, "return1&2&3&4": 1.1111111111111112, "return2": 1.1111111111111112, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.03152020264506174, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3830, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0, "cumreturn1b": 1.2286540459090343, "cumreturn1c": 1.1220154577640362, "cumreturndow": 1.126638375632463, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1222736719686452}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3832, "level_0": 3940, "index": 36641, "text": "ITEM 2.

ESCALADE\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD DIFFER  MATERIALLY FROM THE EXPECTATIONS OF MANAGEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN. ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE CURRENTLY  ELEVATED BY AND MAY OR WILL CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH  RISKS, BUT MAY BECOME MATERIAL IN THE FUTURE. ESCALADE UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO RELEASE REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  ESCALADE, INCORPORATED (ESCALADE, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR)  IS FOCUSED ON GROWING ITS SPORTING GOODS BUSINESS THROUGH ORGANIC GROWTH OF EXISTING CATEGORIES, STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, AND NEW  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE SPORTING GOODS BUSINESS COMPETES IN A VARIETY OF CATEGORIES INCLUDING BASKETBALL GOALS, ARCHERY, INDOOR  AND OUTDOOR GAME RECREATION AND FITNESS PRODUCTS. STRONG BRANDS AND ON-GOING INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROVIDE A SOLID  FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND CONTINUED GROWTH.  WITHIN THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY  BUILT A ROBUST MARKET PRESENCE IN SEVERAL NICHE MARKETS. THIS STRATEGY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE, BARRIERS  TO ENTRY, STRONG BRANDS, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION. A KEY STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS THE COMPANY\u2019S  ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR CUSTOMERS THAT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER  WHILE MAINTAINING A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION TO STRATEGIC CUSTOMER RELATIONS,  THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL MANUFACTURING AND IMPORT EXPERIENCE THAT ENABLE IT TO BE A LOW COST SUPPLIER.  TO ENHANCE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY HAS FOCUSED ON  PROMOTING NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND BRAND MARKETING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS EMBARKED ON A STRATEGY OF ACQUIRING  COMPANIES OR PRODUCT LINES THAT COMPLEMENT OR EXPAND THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCT LINES OR PROVIDE EXPANSION INTO NEW OR EMERGING  CATEGORIES IN SPORTING GOODS. A KEY OBJECTIVE IS THE ACQUISITION OF PRODUCT LINES WITH BARRIERS TO ENTRY THAT THE COMPANY CAN TAKE  TO MARKET THROUGH ITS ESTABLISHED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OR THROUGH NEW MARKET CHANNELS. SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH  ASSIMILATION OF ACQUIRED PRODUCT LINES INTO THE EXISTING COMPANY STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY ALSO SOMETIMES DIVESTS OR DISCONTINUES  CERTAIN OPERATIONS, ASSETS, BRANDS, AND PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT PERFORM TO THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS OR NO LONGER FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT KEY INDICATORS IN MEASURING THE SUCCESS  OF THESE STRATEGIES ARE REVENUE GROWTH, EARNINGS GROWTH, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND THE EXPANSION OF CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.  13  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  THE EMERGENCE OF THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AROUND THE WORLD,  AND PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO THE COMPANY, NOT ALL OF WHICH THE COMPANY IS ABLE  TO FULLY EVALUATE OR EVEN TO FORESEE AT THE CURRENT TIME. WHILE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL RESULTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 21, 2020, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH  CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS MOST OF THE GLOBE HAVE CHANGED RAPIDLY SINCE THE END OF THE QUARTER. IN THE SHORT-TERM,  DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED, NOTABLY IN OUR FITNESS PRODUCTS, BASKETBALL, PLAYGROUND, INDOOR/OUTDOOR  GAMES, AND TRAMPOLINES. SOME OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IS LIKELY DUE TO CONSUMERS BEING REQUIRED OR ENCOURAGED BY GOVERNMENTAL  AUTHORITIES TO STAY AT HOME, SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED, AND EMPLOYERS REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK REMOTELY AND/OR IMPLEMENTING FURLOUGHS  AND LAYOFFS. SUCH INCREASED DEMAND MAY NOT CONTINUE AND/OR DEMAND MAY DECREASE FROM HISTORICAL LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE DURATION  AND SEVERITY OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR NORMAL ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS TO RESUME, ADDITIONAL  GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN AND/OR EXTENSIONS OF TIME FOR RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED TO DATE, AND NUMEROUS  OTHER UNCERTAINTIES.  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS AFFECTING THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS  IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY THEREAFTER. ALL OF THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE FAR REACHING IMPACTS ON  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITIONS, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION  IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES, MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING AND SALES OPERATIONS,  CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS, AND ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY. THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THESE IMPACTS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND THE OUTCOMES ARE UNCERTAIN.  DUE TO THE ABOVE CIRCUMSTANCES AND AS DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN  THIS FORM 10-Q, THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE  OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE FULL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE  COMPANY\u2019S SALES CHANNELS, SUPPLY CHAIN, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION NOR TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, INCLUDING THE  EFFECTS ON CONSUMER SPENDING. THE ULTIMATE EXTENT OF THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE COMPANY IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND  WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, AND SUCH EFFECTS COULD EXIST FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC MIGHT END.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE SETS FORTH CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT  OF OPERATIONS DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  MARCH 23, 2019  NET REVENUE  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD  72.6%  73.6%  GROSS MARGIN  27.4%  26.4%  SELLING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND GENERAL EXPENSES  20.0%  24.1%  AMORTIZATION  0.9%  1.1%  OPERATING INCOME  6.5%  1.2%  REVENUE AND GROSS  MARGIN  SALES INCREASED BY 16.2% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED  WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SALES IN OUR OUTDOOR CATEGORIES OF BASKETBALL, PICKLEBALL AND  VICTORY TAILGATE.  THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 27.4% FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED TO 26.4% FOR 2019 DUE TO PRODUCT MIX AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED OVER  THE LAST YEAR.  SELLING, GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) WERE  $7.5 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO $7.7 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, A DECREASE OF $0.2 MILLION  OR 3.7%. THE REDUCTION IN SG&A WAS A RESULT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES PUT IN PLACE DURING 2019.  SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES IS 20.0% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED WITH 24.1% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 WAS  FLAT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AT 19.6%.  14  FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND LIQUIDITY  TOTAL DEBT AT THE END OF THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 WAS  ZERO, A DECREASE OF $135 THOUSAND FROM DECEMBER 28, 2019. THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL DEBT.  IN THOUSANDS  MARCH 21,  2020  DECEMBER 28,  2019  MARCH 23,  2019  NOTE PAYABLE  $--  $135  $--  LONG TERM DEBT  --  --  3,662  TOTAL  $--  $135  $3,662  AS A PERCENTAGE OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, TOTAL DEBT WAS  ZERO, 0.1% AND 2.9 AT MARCH 21, 2020, DECEMBER 28, 2019, AND MARCH 23, 2019 RESPECTIVELY.  ON MARCH 24, 2020, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT  TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201c2019 RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH ITS ISSUING BANK, JP MORGAN CHASE  BANK, N.A. (\u201cCHASE\u201d), AND THE OTHER LENDERS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cLENDER\u201d).  THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS TO PERMIT AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED STOCK REPURCHASES, INCREASING THE LIMIT FROM $5,000,000  TO $15,000,000.  THE COMPANY FUNDS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THROUGH OPERATING  CASH FLOWS AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH ITS BANK. BASED ON WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO HAVE ACCESS  TO ADEQUATE LEVELS OF REVOLVING CREDIT TO MEET GROWTH NEEDS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ESCALADE INC", "CIK": 33488, "Date": "2020-04-16T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ESCA", "Name": "Escalade Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3949.0, "Business": "IN", "Incorporated": "IN", "IRS": 132739290.0, "key": "20200416ESCA", "labelr1": 5.755395683453228, "labelr2": 5.1700680272108945, "labelr3": -1.2936610608020769, "labelr4": -0.9174311926605542, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5630183000000001, "prof1": 0.43698170000000003, "return1&2": 0.8937209416140557, "return1&2&3": 0.9052826614279504, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9135880069456379, "return2": 0.9482993197278909, "return1": 0.9424460431654678, "return3": 1.0129366106080209, "return4": 1.0091743119266054, "1_day_return": 5.755395683453224, "cumulative_return1": 0.03222185099161277, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3832, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0168640597516392, "cumreturn1b": 1.2493741411533374, "cumreturn1c": 1.141000407529575, "cumreturndow": 1.1635539603319165, "cumreturnsp500": 1.157518033264683}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3833, "level_0": 3941, "index": 72688, "text": "ITEM 2.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATING TO ENABLE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF AND ACCESS TO MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE. WE BELIEVE THAT MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE IS LIFE-ENHANCING CARE. INTUITIVE BRINGS MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF LEADERSHIP IN ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS TO ITS OFFERINGS. WHILE SURGERY AND ACUTE INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST DECADES, THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND DECREASED VARIABILITY OF THESE OUTCOMES ACROSS CARE TEAMS. THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT IS EXERTING A LARGE AND INCREASING BURDEN ON CRITICAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING THE PROFESSIONALS WHO STAFF CARE TEAMS: SURGEONS, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS, NURSES, AND OTHER STAFF. AT THE SAME TIME, GOVERNMENTS ARE STRAINING TO COVER THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THEIR POPULATIONS AND ARE DEMANDING LOWER TOTAL COST PER PATIENT TO TREAT DISEASE. IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES, WE BELIEVE SCIENTIFIC, PROCESS, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BIOLOGY, COMPUTING, IMAGING, ALGORITHMS, AND ROBOTICS OFFER THE PROMISE OF NEW METHODS TO SOLVE OLD AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  WE ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY FOCUSING ON THE QUADRUPLE AIM. FIRST, WE FOCUS ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DECREASE VARIABILITY IN THE HANDS OF CARE TEAMS. SECOND, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE BY MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO LIVES AND CREATING GREATER PREDICTABILITY FOR THE TREATMENT EXPERIENCE. THIRD, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE CARE TEAM SATISFACTION BY CREATING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DEPENDABLE, SMART, AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CARE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY ARE USED. FINALLY, WE SEEK TO LOWER THE TOTAL COST TO TREAT PER PATIENT EPISODE WHEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES, PROVIDING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND VALUE FOR PAYERS.  OPEN SURGERY REMAINS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF SURGERY AND IS USED IN ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE BODY. HOWEVER, THE LARGE INCISIONS REQUIRED FOR OPEN SURGERY CREATE TRAUMA TO PATIENTS, TYPICALLY RESULTING IN LONGER HOSPITALIZATION AND RECOVERY TIMES, INCREASED HOSPITALIZATION COSTS, AND ADDITIONAL PAIN AND SUFFERING RELATIVE TO MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY (\u201cMIS\u201d), WHERE MIS IS AVAILABLE. FOR OVER THREE DECADES, MIS HAS REDUCED TRAUMA TO PATIENTS BY ALLOWING SELECTED SURGERIES TO BE PERFORMED THROUGH SMALL PORTS RATHER THAN LARGE INCISIONS. MIS HAS BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED FOR CERTAIN SURGICAL PROCEDURES.  DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ENABLE SURGEONS TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF MIS TO MANY PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO A MORE INVASIVE SURGERY BY USING COMPUTATIONAL, ROBOTIC, AND IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO OVERCOME MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL OPEN SURGERY OR CONVENTIONAL MIS. SURGEONS USING A DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM OPERATE WHILE SEATED COMFORTABLY AT A CONSOLE VIEWING A 3D, HIGH-DEFINITION IMAGE OF THE SURGICAL FIELD. THIS IMMERSIVE CONSOLE CONNECTS SURGEONS TO THE SURGICAL FIELD AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHILE SEATED AT THE CONSOLE, THE SURGEON MANIPULATES INSTRUMENT CONTROLS IN A NATURAL MANNER, SIMILAR TO OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH A RANGE OF ARTICULATION OF THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE SURGICAL FIELD ANALOGOUS TO THE MOTIONS OF A HUMAN WRIST, WHILE FILTERING OUT THE TREMOR INHERENT IN A SURGEON\u2019S HAND. IN DESIGNING OUR PRODUCTS, WE FOCUS ON MAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY EASY AND SAFE TO USE.  OUR DA VINCI PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BROAD CATEGORIES: DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES, DA VINCI STAPLING, DA VINCI ENERGY, AND DA VINCI VISION, INCLUDING FIREFLY FLUORESCENCE IMAGING SYSTEMS (\u201cFIREFLY\u201d) AND DA VINCI ENDOSCOPES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF SERVICES, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WITHIN OUR INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM, OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO DECREASE VARIABILITY IN SURGERY BY OFFERING DEPENDABLE, CONSISTENT FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCES FOR SURGEONS SEEKING BETTER OUTCOMES. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH, OFFERING INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE MIS INTERVENTION MORE AVAILABLE AND APPLICABLE.  WE HAVE COMMERCIALIZED THE FOLLOWING DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS: THE DA VINCI STANDARD SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 1999, THE DA VINCI S SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2006, THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2009, AND THE FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2014. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM BY ADDING THE DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH OF OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND WE HAVE AN INSTALLED BASE OF 47 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020. OUR PLANS FOR THE ROLLOUT OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN THE HANDS OF EXPERIENCED DA VINCI USERS FIRST WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGICAL AND CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE USED FOR A BROAD SET OF PROCEDURES. WE PLAN TO SEEK FDA CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS FOR DA VINCI SP OVER TIME. THE SUCCESS OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PROCEDURES FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN CLEARED AS WELL AS SECURING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL CLEARANCES. ALL DA VINCI SYSTEMS INCLUDE A SURGEON\u2019S CONSOLE (OR CONSOLES), IMAGING ELECTRONICS, A PATIENT-SIDE CART, AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  WE OFFER OVER 80 DIFFERENT MULTI-PORT DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH FLEXIBILITY IN CHOOSING THE TYPES OF TOOLS NEEDED TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR SURGERY. THESE MULTI-PORT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY ROBOTICALLY CONTROLLED AND PROVIDE END EFFECTORS (TIPS) THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN EITHER OPEN OR LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY. WE OFFER ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND AND DA VINCI STAPLER PRODUCTS, TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH SOPHISTICATED, COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS TO PRECISELY AND EFFICIENTLY INTERACT WITH TISSUE. DA VINCI X AND DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS SHARE THE SAME INSTRUMENTS WHEREAS THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM USES INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITH X OR XI SYSTEMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NINE CORE INSTRUMENTS ON OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM. WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SP INSTRUMENT OFFERING OVER TIME.  TRAINING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE OUR INTUITIVE SIMULATION PRODUCTS, OUR INTUITIVE TELEPRESENCE REMOTE CASE OBSERVATION AND TELEMENTORING TOOLS, AND OUR DUAL CONSOLE FOR USE IN SURGEON PROCTORING AND COLLABORATIVE SURGERY.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE FDA CLEARED OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM TO ENABLE MINIMALLY INVASIVE BIOPSIES IN THE LUNG. OUR ION SYSTEM EXTENDS OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING BEYOND SURGERY INTO DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES WITH THIS FIRST APPLICATION. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH AND HAVE PLACED 18 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020. ION SYSTEMS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED BASE. WE ALSO HAVE 4 ION SYSTEMS PLACED WITH HOSPITALS FOR GATHERING CLINICAL DATA.  THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING, COMPETITION, MARKET AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, THE EFFECTIVE FORECASTING AND MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCT DEMAND, INVENTORY LEVELS, THE MANAGEMENT OF MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY COSTS, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION.  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  PRIOR TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, WE EXPERIENCED PROCEDURE GROWTH TRENDS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, INCLUDING STRENGTH IN GENERAL SURGERY, GROWTH IN MATURE PROCEDURES IN THE U.S., AND GROWTH IN OUS UROLOGY. WE ALSO SAW EARLY STRENGTH IN CAPITAL PLACEMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., WITH OVER HALF THE SYSTEMS PLACED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 RELATED TO ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE SALES CYCLE WAS MOSTLY COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020, WE SAW A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN CHINA AND, BY EARLY FEBRUARY 2020, PROCEDURES PER WEEK IN CHINA HAD DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 90% COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATES EXPERIENCED IN EARLY JANUARY 2020. AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SUBSIDED IN CHINA IN MARCH 2020, DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME BEGAN TO RECOVER AND, BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, CHINA PROCEDURES PER WEEK WERE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE EARLY JANUARY 2020 WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE. WE SAW VARIED IMPACTS ON DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN SOME OF THE OTHER EARLY COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY COVID-19. COVID-19 HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THE PROCEDURE VOLUME IN KOREA AND JAPAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WHILE IT HAD A SEVERE IMPACT ON THE PROCEDURE VOLUME IN ITALY. OVERALL, THE DISRUPTION TO WORLDWIDE DA VINCI PROCEDURES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF MARCH 2020. AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SPREAD TO WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S., WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN THE LAST HALF OF MARCH 2020. PROCEDURES PER WEEK IN THE U.S., WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 72% OF OUR PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2019, DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 65% COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. PROCEDURES IN FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE UK ALSO DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN THE U.S.  MOST OF THE SALES CYCLE FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WERE COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. AS WE PROGRESSED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROGRESSED, CUSTOMERS BEGAN TO DEFER DECISIONS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE SYSTEMS INTO FUTURE QUARTERS AND, IN SOME CASES, INDEFINITELY. THE DEPTH AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WILL VARY BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTING CAPABILITIES, PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, INTENSIVE CARE UNITS AND OPERATING ROOMS, AND MEDICAL STAFF AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS. AS COVID-19 CONTINUES TO SPREAD, IT IS LIKELY THAT DA VINCI PROCEDURES WILL DECLINE FROM THOSE RATES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. IN ADDITION, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT SYSTEM PLACEMENTS WILL FOLLOW THE DECLINE IN PROCEDURES. WHILE SOME MARKETS, E.G., CHINA, APPEAR TO BE RECOVERING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A RECURRENCE OF COVID-19 WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT DA VINCI PROCEDURES. MOREOVER, WE DO NOT EXPECT ALL MARKETS TO RECOVER AT THE SAME PACE. WHILE WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT OR LENGTH OF THE IMPACT, WE EXPECT PROCEDURE VOLUME AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE OR BE DELAYED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND BEYOND AS COVID-19 INFECTIONS SPREAD, CAUSING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON HOSPITAL RESOURCES, COUPLED WITH THE RECOMMENDED DEFERRALS OF ELECTIVE PROCEDURES BY GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES.  CAPITAL MARKETS AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES HAVE ALSO BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD CAUSE A LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. SUCH ECONOMIC RECESSION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS AS HOSPITALS CURTAIL AND REDUCE CAPITAL AND OVERALL SPENDING. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND LOCAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS \u201cSHELTER-IN-PLACE\u201d ORDERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL AND ACCESS OUR CUSTOMERS OR TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF OUR FACILITIES OR THE FACILITIES OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEIR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, COULD FURTHER SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR SALES AND OUR ABILITY TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS AND SUPPLY OUR CUSTOMERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE NUMBER OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED OR THE NUMBER OF SYSTEM PLACEMENTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE SET OUR PRIORITIES AND ACTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PHASED FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED IN THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE\u2019S PAPER ENTITLED \u201cNATIONAL CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u2013 A ROAD MAP TO REOPENING.\u201d IN PHASE 1, WHICH IS THE \u2018SLOW THE SPREAD\u2019 PHASE OF CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, OUR PRIORITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS. FIRST, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL THOSE WE SERVE \u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR EMPLOYEES, AND OUR SUPPLIERS \u2013 IMPLEMENTING EARLY AND CONTINUOUS UPDATES TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCESSES. SECOND, WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS ACCORDING TO THEIR PRIORITIES \u2013 CLINICAL, OPERATIONAL, AND ECONOMIC. THIRD, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY BY WORKING WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTORS. FOURTH, WE ARE SECURING OUR WORKFORCE ECONOMICALLY. WE HAVE BUILT A VALUABLE TEAM OVER THE YEARS, AND WE BELIEVE THEY WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE RECOVERY THAT FOLLOWS THE PANDEMIC. FIFTH, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR INTUITIVE FOUNDATION, WE ARE CONTRIBUTING MATERIAL, PRODUCT, AND VOLUNTEERS TO THE FRONT LINES OF COVID-19 SUPPORT \u2013 WE HAVE DESIGNED, PRODUCED, AND DELIVERED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO LOCAL HOSPITALS, AND OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE VOLUNTEERED IN SEVERAL COMMUNITIES. FINALLY, WE ARE ELIMINATING AVOIDABLE SPEND DURING THE \u2018SLOW THE SPREAD\u2019 PHASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  BUSINESS MODEL  OVERVIEW  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, IN SALES OR SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UP-FRONT OR IN OPERATING LEASE TRANSACTIONS AND USAGE-BASED MODELS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASES. THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM GENERALLY SELLS FOR BETWEEN $0.5 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, DEPENDING UPON THE MODEL, CONFIGURATION, AND GEOGRAPHY, AND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN PURCHASED. OUR INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES HAVE LIMITED LIVES AND WILL EITHER EXPIRE OR WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE USED IN SURGERY, AT WHICH POINT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE GENERALLY EARN BETWEEN $700 AND $3,500 OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE PER SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES PERFORMED AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS USED. WE TYPICALLY ENTER INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS AT THE TIME SYSTEMS ARE SOLD OR LEASED AT AN ANNUAL FEE BETWEEN $80,000 AND $190,000, DEPENDING UPON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM AND COMPOSITION OF THE SERVICES OFFERED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THESE SERVICE CONTRACTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL CONTRACTUAL SERVICE PERIODS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTENT WITH THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF THE ION SYSTEM, AND WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES USED IN BIOPSIES AND ONGOING SYSTEM SERVICE. ION SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED BASE. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT TO REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  RECURRING REVENUE  RECURRING REVENUE CONSISTS OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE, SERVICE REVENUE, AND OPERATING LEASE REVENUE. RECURRING REVENUE INCREASED TO $3.2 BILLION, OR 72% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $2.6 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2018, AND $2.2 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2017.  INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN SYSTEMS REVENUE OVER TIME. INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.4 BILLION IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN 2018 AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2017. THE GROWTH OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE LARGELY REFLECTS CONTINUED PROCEDURE ADOPTION.  SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED TO $724 MILLION IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $635 MILLION IN 2018 AND $573 MILLION IN 2017. SERVICE REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW 12% TO APPROXIMATELY 5,582 AT DECEMBER 31, 2019; 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,986 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018; AND 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,409 AT DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE USE THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS METRICS FOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PERFORMANCE, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE AN INDICATOR OF THE RATE OF ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY AS WELL AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE RECURRING REVENUE (PARTICULARLY SERVICE REVENUE). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BOTH IT AND INVESTORS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND WHEN PLANNING, FORECASTING, AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ALSO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTERNAL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS METRICS, BECAUSE (1) THEY ALLOW FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, AND (2) THEY ARE USED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND THE ANALYST COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED ARE CONNECTED VIA THE INTERNET. SYSTEM LOGS CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED BY FIELD ENGINEERS FOR SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. WE UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION FROM AGREEMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  JUDGMENTS, WHICH ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS MAY BE IMPACTED OVER TIME BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING SYSTEM INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, HOSPITAL AND DISTRIBUTOR REPORTING BEHAVIOR, AND INHERENT COMPLEXITIES IN NEW AGREEMENTS. SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO TECHNICAL ERRORS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AND GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE AND IN THE NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN REVENUE. THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, REVENUE OR OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC REDUCED OUR EXPECTED NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. AS THE PANDEMIC SPREADS TO OTHER GEOGRAPHIES, SUCH AS EUROPE AND THE U.S., WHICH REPRESENT A LARGER PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS, IT WILL HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROLONGED LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. THIS COULD PRESSURE HOSPITAL SPENDING, IMPACTING SYSTEM SHIPMENTS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS, THE ABILITY TO FORECAST FUTURE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS HAS BEEN DISRUPTED. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT HISTORICAL SYSTEM SHIPMENT TRENDS MAY NOT BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF FUTURE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS.  INTUITIVE SYSTEM LEASING  SINCE 2013, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SALES-TYPE AND OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH CERTAIN QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS AS A WAY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ACQUIRE SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THEIR ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY PROGRAMS WHILE LEVERAGING OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE LEASES GENERALLY HAVE COMMERCIALLY COMPETITIVE TERMS AS COMPARED WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES THAT OFFER EQUIPMENT LEASING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH LARGER CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE COMMITTED DA VINCI PROGRAMS WHERE WE CHARGE FOR THE SYSTEM AND SERVICE AS THE SYSTEMS ARE UTILIZED. WE INCLUDE OPERATING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES, AND SYSTEMS PLACED UNDER USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, IN OUR SYSTEM SHIPMENT AND INSTALLED BASE DISCLOSURES. WE EXCLUDE OPERATING LEASE-RELATED REVENUE, USAGE-BASED REVENUE, AND ION SYSTEM REVENUE FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (\u201cASP\u201d) COMPUTATIONS.  IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, WE SHIPPED 425, 272, AND 139 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 384, 229, AND 108 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. FOR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, SYSTEMS REVENUE AND SERVICE REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SYSTEMS ARE USED. WE SET OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PRICING AT A MODEST PREMIUM RELATIVE TO PURCHASED SYSTEMS REFLECTING THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND, IN THE CASE OF USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, THE RISK THAT SYSTEM UTILIZATION MAY FALL SHORT OF ANTICIPATED LEVELS. THE PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND IS INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING LEASE METRICS HEREIN. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN OVERALL SYSTEMS REVENUE AND WAS $106.9 MILLION, $51.4 MILLION, $25.9 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. GENERALLY, LEASE TRANSACTIONS GENERATE SIMILAR GROSS MARGINS AS OUR SALE TRANSACTIONS.  OUR SYSTEM LEASING AND USAGE-BASED MODELS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH FLEXIBILITY REGARDING HOW THEY ACQUIRE OR OBTAIN ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-RECEIVED, AND WE ARE WILLING TO EXPAND THE PROPORTION OF THESE STRUCTURES BASED ON CUSTOMER DEMAND. AS REVENUE FOR OPERATING LEASES AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, TOTAL SYSTEMS REVENUE GROWTH IS REDUCED IN A PERIOD WHEN THE NUMBER OF OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PLACEMENTS INCREASES AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  OUR EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCREASE IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LAWS, COVERAGE, AND REIMBURSEMENT, ECONOMIC PRESSURES OR UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING DISRUPTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, OR OTHER CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC FACTORS. IN ADDITION, AS CUSTOMERS DIVERT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO THE TREATMENT OF OR THE PREPARATION TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH THE COVID-19 VIRUS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO DEFAULTS UNDER OUR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. MOREOVER, USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY CONTAIN NO MINIMUM PAYMENTS; THEREFORE, CUSTOMERS MAY EXIT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT PAYING A FINANCIAL PENALTY TO US. AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME CUSTOMERS WILL EXIT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS OR SEEK TO AMEND THE TERMS OF OUR OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH THEM.  FOR SOME OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE LEASED SYSTEM AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING AND/OR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. REVENUE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cLEASE BUYOUTS\u201d) WAS $92.8 MILLION, $48.8 MILLION, AND $39.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CUSTOMER EXERCISES OF THE BUYOUT OPTIONS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR BUYOUT OPTIONS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE  SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST MARKETS. IN GEOGRAPHIES WHERE DA VINCI PROCEDURE ADOPTION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE, SYSTEM SALES WILL PRECEDE PROCEDURE GROWTH. SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ALSO VARY DUE TO SEASONALITY LARGELY ALIGNED WITH HOSPITAL BUDGETING CYCLES. WE TYPICALLY PLACE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF ANNUAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A LOWER PROPORTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS CUSTOMER BUDGETS ARE RESET. SYSTEM REVENUE GREW 19% TO $1,346 MILLION IN 2019; 21% TO $1,127 MILLION IN 2018; AND 16% TO $928 MILLION IN 2017. SYSTEMS REVENUE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SYSTEM PLACEMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, RECURRING OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED REVENUE, OPERATING LEASE BUYOUTS, PRODUCT MIX, ASPS, TRADE-IN ACTIVITIES, AND CUSTOMER MIX.  PROCEDURE MIX / PRODUCTS  OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR SOFT TISSUE SURGERY FOR AREAS OF THE BODY BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE NECK, PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES, PROCEDURES RANGE IN COMPLEXITY FROM CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TO LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TEND TO BE REIMBURSED AT HIGHER RATES THAN LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. THUS, HOSPITALS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING LESS COMPLEX, BENIGN CONDITIONS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE HOSPITALS WITH ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PROCEDURE COMPLEXITY. OUR FULLY FEATURED DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM WITH ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER AND ENDOWRIST STAPLER PRODUCTS, AND OUR INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION PRODUCT TARGETS THE MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURE SEGMENT. OUR DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM IS TARGETED TOWARDS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKETS AND PROCEDURES. OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM COMPLEMENTS THE DA VINCI XI AND X SURGICAL SYSTEMS BY ENABLING SURGEONS TO ACCESS NARROW WORKSPACES.  PROCEDURE SEASONALITY  MORE THAN HALF OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED ARE FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIRS, HYSTERECTOMIES, AND CHOLECYSTECTOMIES. THESE BENIGN PROCEDURES AND OTHER SHORT-TERM ELECTIVE PROCEDURES TEND TO BE MORE SEASONAL THAN CANCER OPERATIONS AND SURGERIES FOR OTHER LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. SEASONALITY IN THE U.S. FOR THESE PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER FOURTH QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN MORE PATIENTS HAVE MET ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER FIRST QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN DEDUCTIBLES ARE RESET. SEASONALITY OUTSIDE THE U.S. VARIES AND IS MORE PRONOUNCED AROUND LOCAL HOLIDAYS AND VACATION PERIODS. AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS TO DEFER ELECTIVE PROCEDURES, WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES TO BE DEFERRED.  DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATIONS IN THE U.S., EUROPE (EXCLUDING SPAIN, PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE, AND MOST EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), CHINA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, INDIA, AND TAIWAN. IN 2018, WE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS IN INDIA AND TAIWAN. IN JANUARY 2019, OUR INTUITIVE-FOSUN JOINT VENTURE BEGAN DIRECT SALES FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. IN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OUS MARKETS, WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  REGULATORY ACTIVITIES  OVERVIEW  OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A LARGE AND GROWING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THAT GOVERN THE PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, ADVERTISING, LABELING, SAFETY REPORTING DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MATERIALS CONTENT AND SOURCING, TESTING, CERTIFICATION, PACKAGING, INSTALLATION, USE, AND DISPOSAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STANDARDS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL SAFETY STANDARDS, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION, AND COMPOSITION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVES. FAILURE TO MEET THESE STANDARDS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE REGIONS THAT REQUIRE COMPLIANCE TO SUCH STANDARDS.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEDICAL DEVICE, PRIVACY, AND OTHER REGULATIONS BY REGIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT TIMELINES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND/OR INDICATIONS MAY BE EXTENDED RELATIVE TO PAST EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATIONS.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CLEARANCES AND APPROVALS  WE HAVE GENERALLY OBTAINED THE CLEARANCES REQUIRED TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL MULTIPORT SYSTEMS (STANDARD, S, SI, XI, AND X SYSTEMS) FOR OUR TARGETED SURGICAL SPECIALTIES WITHIN THE U.S., SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND THE EUROPEAN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SINCE 2018, WE OBTAINED REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS.  \u2022  IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SYNCHROSEAL INSTRUMENT AND E-100 GENERATOR.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD, WHICH ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS FOR THE DA VINCI X/XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM, DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE PLACED 18 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT. IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  \u2022  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. THE XI CLEARANCE DOES NOT INCLUDE ADVANCED ENERGY OR STAPLING PRODUCTS THAT ATTACH TO THE XI SYSTEM. SEPARATE CLEARANCES ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS BY CHINA NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION (\u201cNMPA\u201d).  \u2022  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION PUBLISHED ON ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE THE QUOTA FOR MAJOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO BE IMPORTED AND SOLD IN CHINA THROUGH 2020. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SURGICAL SYSTEMS INTRODUCED BY OTHERS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAVE SOLD 65 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THIS QUOTA. FUTURE SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS.  \u2022  IN JULY 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 60, OUR DA VINCI ENDOWRIST 60MM STAPLER. IN JANUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 45. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN TAIWAN, SOUTH KOREA, AND JAPAN TO MARKET BOTH SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45.  \u2022  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A SINGLE PORT APPROACH. IN MARCH 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA IN MAY 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE AN INSTALLED BASE OF 47 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020.  \u2022  IN APRIL 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND.  REFER TO THE DESCRIPTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCES IN 2020, 2019, AND 2018 IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW.  THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE (\u201cMHLW\u201d) CONSIDERS REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES IN APRIL OF EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS. THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRES JAPANESE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS AND SURGICAL SOCIETIES, WITH OUR SUPPORT, TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT REQUIRE IN-COUNTRY CLINICAL DATA/ECONOMIC DATA. IN APRIL 2012 AND APRIL 2016, THE MHLW GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS FOR DA VINCI PROSTATECTOMY (\u201cDVP\u201d) AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, RESPECTIVELY. MOST PROSTATECTOMIES AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMIES WERE OPEN PROCEDURES PRIOR TO DA VINCI REIMBURSEMENT. DA VINCI PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY PROCEDURES ARE HIGHER THAN OPEN PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS. AN ADDITIONAL 12 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. AN ADDITIONAL 7 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2020. THESE ADDITIONAL 19 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND WILL BE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE 19 PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURES. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECALLS AND CORRECTIONS  MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES HAVE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS TO CORRECT OR REMOVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE FIELD THAT COULD POSE A RISK TO HEALTH. THE DEFINITION OF \u201cRECALLS AND CORRECTIONS\u201d IS EXPANSIVE AND INCLUDES REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, INSPECTIONS, RELABELING, AND ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OR REINFORCEMENT OF EXISTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND TRAINING WHEN SUCH ACTIONS ARE TAKEN FOR SPECIFIC REASONS OF SAFETY OR COMPLIANCE. THESE FIELD ACTIONS REQUIRE STRINGENT DOCUMENTATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING WORLDWIDE. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIONS THAT A MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER MAY TAKE IN THE FIELD WITHOUT REPORTING INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ROUTINE SERVICING AND STOCK ROTATIONS.  AS WE DETERMINE WHETHER A FIELD ACTION IS REPORTABLE IN ANY REGULATORY JURISDICTION, WE PREPARE AND SUBMIT NOTIFICATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCY FOR THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. REGULATORS CAN REQUIRE THE EXPANSION, RECLASSIFICATION, OR CHANGE IN SCOPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE FIELD ACTION. IN GENERAL, UPON SUBMITTING REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS TO REGULATORS REGARDING A FIELD ACTION THAT IS A RECALL OR CORRECTION, WE WILL NOTIFY CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE FIELD ACTION, PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED IN THEIR NATIONAL LANGUAGE, AND ARRANGE, AS REQUIRED, RETURN OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT OR A FIELD SERVICE VISIT TO PERFORM THE CORRECTION.  FIELD ACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN OUTCOMES FROM REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, DELAYS BY CUSTOMERS OF PURCHASE DECISIONS, REDUCTION OR STOPPAGE OF THE USE OF INSTALLED SYSTEMS, AND REDUCED REVENUE AS WELL AS INCREASED EXPENSES.  PROCEDURES  WE MODEL PATIENT VALUE AS EQUAL TO  PROCEDURE EFFICACY / INVASIVENESS  . IN THIS EQUATION,  PROCEDURE EFFICACY  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE SURGERY IN RESOLVING THE UNDERLYING DISEASE, AND  INVASIVENESS  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF PATIENT PAIN AND DISRUPTION OF REGULAR ACTIVITIES. WHEN THE PATIENT VALUE OF A DA VINCI PROCEDURE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM SEEKING OUT SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS THAT OFFER DA VINCI SURGERY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A LOCAL MARKET SHARE SHIFT. ADOPTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES OCCURS PROCEDURE BY PROCEDURE AND MARKET BY MARKET AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PATIENT VALUE AND TOTAL TREATMENT COSTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE SAME DISEASE STATE OR CONDITION.  WE USE THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS METRICS FOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PERFORMANCE, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES PROCEDURE VOLUME IS AN INDICATOR OF THE RATE OF ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY AS WELL AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE REVENUE (INCLUDING REVENUE FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BOTH IT AND INVESTORS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND WHEN PLANNING, FORECASTING, AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ALSO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTERNAL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS METRICS, BECAUSE (1) THEY ALLOW FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, AND (2) THEY ARE USED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND THE ANALYST COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED ARE CONNECTED VIA THE INTERNET. SYSTEM LOGS CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED BY FIELD ENGINEERS FOR SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. WE UTILIZE CERTAIN METHODS THAT RELY ON INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THE SYSTEMS INSTALLED FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED THAT INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, WHICH ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES MAY BE IMPACTED OVER TIME BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN TREATMENT MODALITIES, HOSPITAL AND DISTRIBUTOR REPORTING BEHAVIOR, AND SYSTEM INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALGORITHMIC OR OTHER TECHNICAL ERRORS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AND OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AND DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME GROWTH MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN REVENUE. THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, REVENUE OR OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC REDUCED OUR EXPECTED NUMBER OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. AS THE PANDEMIC INTENSIFIED GLOBALLY, WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN PROCEDURE VOLUME IN THE U.S. AND WESTERN EUROPE, AS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN THOSE AREAS DIVERTED RESOURCES TO MEET THE INCREASING DEMANDS OF MANAGING COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROLONGED LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. THIS COULD PRESSURE HOSPITAL SPENDING, IMPACTING PROCEDURES, PROCEDURE GROWTH, AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS, THE ABILITY TO FORECAST FUTURE PROCEDURES BASED ON HISTORICAL PROCEDURE PATTERNS HAS BEEN DISRUPTED. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT HISTORICAL PROCEDURE TRENDS MAY NOT BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF FUTURE PROCEDURE VOLUMES. IN GEOGRAPHIES SUCH AS THE U.S. AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHERE COVID-19 CASES CONTINUE TO INCREASE, DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME COULD DECLINE BELOW THE LEVELS EXPERIENCED AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORLDWIDE PROCEDURES  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEMS AND INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULATED INDEPENDENTLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THE DISCUSSION OF INDICATIONS FOR USE AND REPRESENTATIVE OR TARGET PROCEDURES IS INTENDED SOLELY TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARKET FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE SALE OR USE OF ANY INTUITIVE PRODUCT OUTSIDE OF ITS LICENSED OR CLEARED LABELING AND INDICATIONS FOR USE.  THE ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY USING THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW FOR THOSE PROCEDURES THAT OFFER GREATER PATIENT VALUE AS COMPARED TO NON-DA VINCI ALTERNATIVES AND TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE TOTAL ECONOMICS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USED PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GENERAL SURGERY INCLUDE HERNIA REPAIR (BOTH VENTRAL AND INGUINAL) AND COLORECTAL PROCEDURES. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GYNECOLOGY INCLUDE DA VINCI HYSTERECTOMY (\u201cDVH\u201d), FOR BOTH CANCER AND BENIGN CONDITIONS, AND SACROCOLPOPEXY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN UROLOGY INCLUDE DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY. IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE DA VINCI LOBECTOMY AND DA VINCI  MITRAL VALVE REPAIR. IN HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE CERTAIN PROCEDURES RESECTING BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMORS CLASSIFIED AS T1 AND T2. NOT ALL OF THE INDICATIONS, PROCEDURES, OR PRODUCTS DESCRIBED MAY BE AVAILABLE IN A GIVEN COUNTRY OR REGION OR ON ALL GENERATIONS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. SURGEONS AND THEIR PATIENTS NEED TO CONSULT THE PRODUCT LABELING IN THEIR SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND FOR EACH PRODUCT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CLEARED USES, AS WELL AS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS, RESTRICTIONS, OR CONTRAINDICATIONS.  IN 2019, APPROXIMATELY 1,229,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,038,000 AND 877,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH IN OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2018 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES AND WORLDWIDE UROLOGY PROCEDURES.  U.S. PROCEDURES  OVERALL U.S. PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 883,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 753,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 644,000 IN 2017. GENERAL SURGERY WAS OUR LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING U.S. SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 421,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 325,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 246,000 IN 2017. GYNECOLOGY WAS OUR SECOND LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 282,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 265,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 252,000 IN 2017. UROLOGY WAS OUR THIRD LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 138,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 128,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 118,000 IN 2017.  PROCEDURES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.  OVERALL OUS PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 346,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 285,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 233,000 IN 2017. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST OUS MARKETS WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME, WHICH GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 206,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 175,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 149,000 IN 2017. GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH.  RECENT BUSINESS EVENTS AND TRENDS  PROCEDURES  OVERALL.  TOTAL DA VINCI PROCEDURES GREW APPROXIMATELY 10% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THORACIC PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS LOWER GROWTH IN THE MORE MATURE UROLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORY.  PROCEDURE VOLUME OUS GREW APPROXIMATELY 11% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. THE DISRUPTION WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN CHINA, ITALY, FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE REST OF EUROPE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY (PARTICULARLY COLORECTAL), GYNECOLOGY, KIDNEY CANCER, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  U.S. GENERAL SURGERY.  GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE MAJORITY OF INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. INGUINAL AND VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIRS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS THEY DID IN 2019 AND 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT GROWTH IN DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR REFLECTS IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES WITHIN CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL COST BENEFITS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS. WE BELIEVE HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE GROWTH IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OF VARIOUS HERNIA PATIENT POPULATIONS AND VARYING SURGEON OPINION REGARDING OPTIMAL SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF AND TO WHAT EXTENT DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURE VOLUME WILL GROW IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT A LARGE PORTION OF HERNIA REPAIRS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED VIA DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF SURGERY.  ADOPTION OF DA VINCI FOR COLORECTAL PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL UNDERLYING PROCEDURES INCLUDING LOW ANTERIOR RESECTIONS FOR RECTAL CANCERS AND CERTAIN COLON PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN AND CANCEROUS CONDITIONS, HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IS SUPPORTED BY OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE ENDOWRIST STAPLERS, ENERGY DEVICES, AND INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION.  IN RECENT QUARTERS, WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH FROM OTHER U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CHOLECYSTECTOMY AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. OUR INTRODUCTION OF THE SUREFORM 60MM STAPLER PRODUCT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 HAS PROVIDED SURGEONS A BETTER OPTIMIZED ROBOTIC TOOL FOR BARIATRIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. GYNECOLOGY  . U.S. GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES DECLINED MODESTLY DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED TO 2019. THE DECLINE REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. COMBINING ROBOTIC, LAPAROSCOPIC, AND VAGINAL APPROACHES, MIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 80% OF THE U.S. HYSTERECTOMY MARKET FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS.  GLOBAL UROLOGY.  GLOBAL UROLOGY PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE GROWTH. IN THE U.S., DVP IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER, AND WE BELIEVE GROWTH IS LARGELY ALIGNED WITH SURGICAL VOLUMES OF PROSTATE CANCER. FOR OUS, DVP IS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD BUT IS THE LARGEST OVERALL DA VINCI PROCEDURE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 GROWTH IN OUS DVP WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THE GROWTH IN 2019, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE.  KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR RECENT GLOBAL UROLOGY GROWTH. CLINICAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USE OF A DA VINCI SYSTEM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PATIENT WILL RECEIVE NEPHRON-SPARING SURGERY THROUGH A PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE SURGICAL SOCIETY GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED THERAPY.  OUS PROCEDURES.  THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH RATE REFLECTS CONTINUED DA VINCI ADOPTION IN EUROPEAN AND ASIAN MARKETS. IN 2018 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA MODERATED, AS THE PREVIOUS SYSTEMS QUOTA EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2015 AND SYSTEMS INSTALLED IN CHINA WERE HIGHLY UTILIZED. IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A NEW QUOTA TO ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA THROUGH 2020, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THIS QUOTA APPLIES TO THE DA VINCI SI AND RECENTLY APPROVED XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (REFER TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN THE \u201cCLEARANCES AND APPROVALS\u201d SECTION), AS WELL AS COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS WHEN AND IF CLEARED BY NMPA. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON PROVINCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESSES AND HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS. IN THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA ACCELERATED, AS INITIAL SYSTEMS PLACED DURING THESE QUARTERS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE FIELD. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE, THE PROCEDURE VOLUME DECREASED BY 23% AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. IN JAPAN, WE EXPERIENCED STRONG PROCEDURE GROWTH AFTER RECEIVING THE NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY IN 2012 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, AS ADOPTION FOR THESE PROCEDURES HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS HIGHER LEVELS OF PENETRATION, GROWTH IN THESE TWO UROLOGIC PROCEDURES HAS MODERATED. A TOTAL OF 12 ADDITIONAL DA VINCI  PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT STATUS EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN JAPAN HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE NEW PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS. HOWEVER, THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND ARE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURE. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PROCEDURE VOLUME IN JAPAN WAS LIMITED. IN ITALY, FRANCE, GERMANY, AND WESTERN EUROPE, WHILE PROCEDURE VOLUME CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE GROWTH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEM DEMAND  FUTURE DEMAND FOR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE, HOSPITAL RESPONSE TO THE EVOLVING HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION, PROCEDURE GROWTH RATES, HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION TRENDS, EVOLVING SYSTEM UTILIZATION AND POINT OF CARE DYNAMICS, CAPITAL REPLACEMENT TRENDS, ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS IN VARIOUS GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING JAPAN, THE TIMING AROUND GOVERNMENTAL TENDERS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, INCLUDING CHINA, THE TIMING OF WHEN WE RECEIVE REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN OUR OTHER OUS MARKETS FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM, DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS, AND MARKET RESPONSE.  MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE NATURE AND TIMING OF ADDITIONAL DA VINCI SP REGULATORY INDICATIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT FUTURE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY COMPETITION, INCLUDING FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE INTRODUCED PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY OR HAVE MADE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTER THE FIELD INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AVATERA MEDICAL GMBH; CMR SURGICAL LIMITED; JOHNSON & JOHNSON (INCLUDING THEIR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AURIS HEALTH, INC. AND VERB SURGICAL INC.); MEDICAROID INC.; MEDROBOTICS CORP.; MEDTRONIC PLC; MEERECOMPANY INC.; OLYMPUS CORP.; SAMSUNG CORPORATION; SMART ROBOT TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO. LTD.; TITAN MEDICAL, INC.; TRANSENTERIX, INC.; AND WEGO HOLDING CO., LTD.  MANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WILL ALSO IMPACT FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR RECENTLY CLEARED ION SYSTEM, AS WE EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING INTO DIAGNOSTICS, ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPETITION, CLINICAL DATA TO DEMONSTRATE VALUE, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE.  NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS  SYNCHROSEAL AND E100 GENERATOR.  IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SYNCHROSEAL INSTRUMENT AND E-100 GENERATOR. SYNCHROSEAL IS A SINGLE-USE, BIPOLAR, ELECTROSURGICAL INSTRUMENT INTENDED FOR GRASPING, DISSECTION, SEALING, AND TRANSECTION OF TISSUE. WITH ITS WRISTED ARTICULATION, RAPID SEALING CYCLE, AND REFINED CURVED JAW, SYNCHROSEAL OFFERS ENHANCED VERSATILITY TO THE DA VINCI ENERGY PORTFOLIO.

THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND GRAY RELOAD HAVE PARTICULAR UTILITY IN THORACIC PROCEDURES AND ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO. NOT ALL RELOADS OR STAPLERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE ON ALL SYSTEMS OR IN ALL COUNTRIES.  DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS.  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE IN EUROPE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS, AN ENHANCED 3D ENDOSCOPE FOR USE WITH OUR DA VINCI X AND XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS. THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS LEVERAGES NEW SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED SHARPNESS AND COLOR ACCURACY.  DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA.  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA, A LIGHTWEIGHT, 2D CAMERA HEAD, WHICH CAN BE CONNECTED TO THIRD-PARTY LAPAROSCOPES. THIS ALLOWS THE LAPAROSCOPIC IMAGE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DA VINCI X/XI VISION CART TO ADDRESS ASPECTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES THAT MAY REQUIRE USE OF A LAPAROSCOPE, THUS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR REDUNDANT EQUIPMENT IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND INCREASING PROCEDURE EFFICIENCY. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA IN A MEASURED FASHION WITH A BROAD LAUNCH EXPECTED IN MID-2020.  ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES. THE ION SYSTEM USES AN ULTRA-THIN ARTICULATING ROBOTIC CATHETER THAT CAN ARTICULATE 180 DEGREES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE OUTER DIAMETER OF THE CATHETER IS 3.5MM, WHICH ALLOWS PHYSICIANS TO NAVIGATE THROUGH SMALL AND TORTUOUS AIRWAYS TO REACH NODULES IN MOST AIRWAY SEGMENTS WITHIN THE LUNG. THE ION SYSTEM\u2019S FLEXIBLE BIOPSY NEEDLE CAN ALSO PASS THROUGH VERY TIGHT BENDS VIA ION\u2019S CATHETER TO COLLECT TISSUE IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG. THE CATHETER\u2019S 2MM WORKING CHANNEL CAN ALSO ACCOMMODATE OTHER BIOPSY TOOLS, SUCH AS BIOPSY FORCEPS OR CYTOLOGY BRUSHES, IF NECESSARY. WE ARE INTRODUCING ION IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE PLACED 18 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IRIS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT.

AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SUBSIDED IN CHINA IN MARCH 2020, DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME BEGAN TO RECOVER AND, BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, CHINA PROCEDURES PER WEEK WERE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE EARLY JANUARY 2020 WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE.  \u2022  WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN THE LAST HALF OF MARCH 2020. PROCEDURES PER WEEK IN THE U.S. DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 65% COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. PROCEDURES IN FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE UK ALSO DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN THE U.S.  \u2022  INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE INCREASED BY 12% TO $618 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $552 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  SYSTEMS REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $283 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $248 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  A TOTAL OF 237 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AN INCREASE OF 1% COMPARED WITH 235 SYSTEMS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD A DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED BASE OF APPROXIMATELY 5,669 SYSTEMS, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 11% COMPARED WITH THE INSTALLED BASE OF APPROXIMATELY 5,114 SYSTEMS AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WE PLACED 8 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE.  \u2022  GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 67.1% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH 68.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY 12% TO $283 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $252 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED $91.2 MILLION AND $76.9 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS AND $13.3 MILLION AND $30.2 MILLION OF INTANGIBLE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  \u2022  AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD $5.9 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $0.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2019, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SHARE REPURCHASES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME INFORMATION (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES).

REVENUE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 19% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE GENERALLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES WHERE WE HAVE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  REVENUE GENERATED IN THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR BOTH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019. WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. REVENUE HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF TOTAL REVENUE DUE TO U.S. PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO CHOOSE THEIR PROVIDER AND METHOD OF TREATMENT, REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES SUPPORTIVE OF INNOVATION AND MIS, AND OUR INITIAL INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS IN THE OUS MARKETS, AND OUR OUS PROCEDURES HAVE GROWN FASTER IN PROPORTION TO U.S. PROCEDURES. WE EXPECT THAT OUR OUS PROCEDURES AND REVENUE WILL MAKE UP A GREATER PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE LONG TERM.  AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AND CAUSES STRAIN ON HOSPITAL RESOURCES, COUPLED WITH RECOMMENDED DEFERRALS OF ELECTIVE PROCEDURES, WE EXPECT PROCEDURES AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT PROCEDURES AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND BEYOND.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR REVENUE AND SYSTEM UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND UNIT SHIPMENTS).

INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE INCREASED BY 12% TO $618 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $552 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PROCEDURE GROWTH OF 10%, INCREMENTAL SALES OF OUR ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, AND CUSTOMER BUYING PATTERNS. FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH OF 9% WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES AS WELL AS SLOWER GROWTH IN THE MORE MATURE UROLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORY. OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS 11% AND WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN UROLOGIC PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES. GEOGRAPHICALLY, FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE EXPANSION IN JAPAN, KOREA, AND GERMANY WITH VARYING RESULTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING A 23% DECLINE IN PROCEDURES IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $283 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $248 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 SYSTEMS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SYSTEM SHIPMENTS, HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 ASPS, AND HIGHER OPERATING LEASE REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LEASE BUYOUTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, A TOTAL O  F 237 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED COMPARED WITH 235 SYSTEMS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. BY GEOGRAPHY, 182 SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 25 INTO EUROPE, 27 INTO ASIA, AND 3 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2020  , COMPARED WITH 154 SYSTEMS SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 49 INTO EUROPE, 21 INTO ASIA, AND 11 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN SYSTEMS SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH, THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH CAPACITY, AND MORE CUSTOMERS TRADING IN OLDER DA VINCI MODELS FOR FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X SYSTEMS.  WE SHIPPED 121 AND 81 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 77 AND 78 SYSTEMS WERE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE WAS $39.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $20.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. SYSTEMS PLACED AS OPERATING LEASES REPRESENTED 32% OF TOTAL SHIPMENTS DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED WITH 33% DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. A TOTAL 721 OF DA VINCI  SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED AT CUSTOMERS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH 423 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS WAS $12.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $12.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS TO FLUCTUATE PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THE BUYOUT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THEIR LEASES.  THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM ASP, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMS SHIPPED UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AND ION SYSTEMS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.44 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.31 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 ASP WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRADE-IN VOLUME. ASP FLUCTUATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCT PRICING, SYSTEMS SHIPPED INVOLVING TRADE-INS, AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  SERVICE REVENUE  SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $199 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $174 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS PRODUCING SERVICE REVENUE.  GROSS PROFIT  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED 9% TO $604 MILLION, REPRESENTING 67.1% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $553 MILLION, REPRESENTING 69.2% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE LOWER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DA VINCI SI PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $12.8 MILLION AND $11.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $8.8 MILLION AND $7.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $134 MILLION, REPRESENTING 67.5% OF SERVICE REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $116 MILLION, REPRESENTING 66.8% OF SERVICE REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE, REFLECTING A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER REPAIR COSTS.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $5.5 MILLION AND $4.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $0.9 MILLION AND $0.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  AS A RESULT OF AN EXPECTED DECREASE IN OVERALL DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020, WE EXPECT THAT OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES WILL RUN AT LESS THAN NORMAL CAPACITY. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN LABOR AND FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEAD COSTS WILL BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR OVERALL DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND BEYOND.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS FOR SALES, MARKETING, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRADESHOW EXPENSES, LEGAL EXPENSES, REGULATORY FEES, AND GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED BY 13% TO $308 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $273 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING EXPANSION OF OUR ASIAN AND EUROPEAN TEAMS, AND INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $45.7 MILLION AND $38.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $1.7 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR SPENDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 REFLECTED NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES INTO MARCH AND THEN A CURTAILMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WHILE CERTAIN SPENDING WILL DECREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN REVENUE AND ACTIVITIES LIMITED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MUCH OF OUR SPENDING WILL CONTINUE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS, INVEST IN INNOVATION FOCUSED ON THE QUADRUPLE AIM, AND INVEST IN MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO ENSURE SUPPLY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. CERTAIN COSTS WILL DECLINE AS THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITIES ARE RESTRICTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, INCLUDING TRAVEL AND RELATED EXPENSES, CLINICAL TRIALS, SURGEON TRAINING, AND CUSTOMER DATA COLLECTION. WE WILL ELIMINATE SPENDING THAT IS INEFFECTIVE DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, SUCH AS SURGEON AND HOSPITAL EVENTS, AND WE ARE PAUSING THE HIRING OF VOLUME-RELATED ROLES, SUCH AS SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED BY 2% TO $147 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $144 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES AND OTHER PROJECT COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT A BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ION AND SP PLATFORM INVESTMENTS, INFORMATICS, ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROBOTICS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTANGIBLE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $27.2 MILLION AND $22.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES OF $1.9 MILLION AND $20.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FLUCTUATE WITH PROJECT TIMING. BASED UPON OUR BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND THE STAGE OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATE THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $25.1 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $27.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REALIZED FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME EARNED DUE TO HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. HOWEVER, AVERAGE INTEREST RATES DECLINED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT  INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $8.1 MILLION, OR 2.6% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $24.3 MILLION, OR 8.7% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS MAINLY DUE TO LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS OF $65.4 MILLION AND $72.7 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 21.2 AND 26.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OR DEFICIENCIES WILL FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE VOLUME OF SHARE-BASED INSTRUMENTS SETTLED OR VESTED, AND THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS UNDER U.S. GAAP, WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED INCOME TAX EXPENSE VOLATILITY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE FILE FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN INCOME TAX RETURNS IN MANY U.S. AND OUS JURISDICTIONS. YEARS BEFORE 2016 ARE CLOSED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT JURISDICTIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE TO ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING EVOLVING INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS IN THE JURISDICTIONS WE OPERATE, POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT OF ADDITIONAL TAX, POSSIBLE SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS, OR THROUGH NORMAL EXPIRATION OF VARIOUS STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY CHANGE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE TIMING AND POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF AUDITS, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN OUR TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  IN JULY 2015, A U.S. TAX COURT OPINION (THE \u201c2015 OPINION\u201d) WAS ISSUED INVOLVING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY CHARGES FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE U.S. TAX COURT, WE WERE REQUIRED TO, AND DID, REFUND TO OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ELEMENT OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY CHARGES MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. STARTING IN 2015, DIRECT SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM INTERCOMPANY CHARGES. IN JUNE 2019, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT\u201d) REVERSED THE 2015 OPINION (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT OPINION\u201d). SUBSEQUENTLY, A RE-HEARING OF THE CASE WAS REQUESTED BUT WAS DENIED IN NOVEMBER 2019. IN FEBRUARY 2020, A PETITION WAS FILED TO APPEAL THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION POTENTIALLY IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER JUDICIAL REVIEW, WE CONTINUE TO TREAT OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2015 OPINION AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION OF THE POSITION IN LIGHT OF THE PRESENT FACTS. IN THE EVENT OF A FINAL OPINION WHICH REVERSES THE 2015 OPINION, THERE MAY BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  THE COMPANY\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE (THE \u201cJOINT VENTURE\u201d) WITH SHANGHAI FOSUN PHARMACEUTICAL (GROUP) CO., LTD. (\u201cFOSUN PHARMA\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, WAS ESTABLISHED TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THE JOINT VENTURE IS OWNED 60% BY US AND 40% BY FOSUN PHARMA AND IS LOCATED IN CHINA. THE CATHETER-BASED TECHNOLOGY WILL INITIALLY TARGET EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED FORMS OF CANCER IN THE WORLD. DISTRIBUTION OF CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES IN CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT VENTURE, WHILE DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE OF CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY US.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE JOINT VENTURE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND CERTAIN PERSONNEL, FROM CHINDEX AND ITS AFFILIATES, A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN PHARMA, AND BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED $55 MILLION OF UP TO $100 MILLION REQUIRED BY THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THE JOINT VENTURE TO GENERATE REVENUE IN 2020 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE SUCH PRODUCTS. THERE CAN ALSO BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND ITS BUSINESS, THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROFITABLE, OR THAT THE ACQUIRED CHINDEX ASSETS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS WILL BE REALIZED.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $2.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $(2.5) MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE AND A RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND BY THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PLUS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $0.1 BILLION TO $5.9 BILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, FROM $5.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, PRIMARILY FROM CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAXES PAID RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF EQUITY AWARDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE RESOURCES WE DEVOTE TO DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING OUR PRODUCTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND PROCEDURE ADOPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, FACILITIES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BASED UPON OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH INCOME TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE REDUCED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUES AND EXTENDING PAYMENT TERMS ON SALES AND OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. MOREOVER, WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES ON HAND GIVEN THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE INVENTORY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND BEYOND.

THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2020  2019  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $352.8  $333.2  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (117.1)  (308.9)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (178.7)  (41.8)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (0.8)  (1.2)  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $56.2  $(18.7)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $353 MILLION EXCEEDED OUR NET INCOME OF $316 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  1.  OUR NET INCOME INCLUDED NON-CASH CHARGES OF $223 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF $91 MILLION; DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $65 MILLION; DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND LOSSES ON THE DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $51 MILLION; AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $12 MILLION.  2.  THE NON-CASH CHARGES OUTLINED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT RESULTED IN $186 MILLION OF CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED BY $132 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LEASING AND AN INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DECREASED BY $95 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENTS OF 2019 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. INVENTORY, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT FROM INVENTORY TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, INCREASED BY $65 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AND BUILD-UP TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS TO MITIGATE RISKS OF DISRUPTION THAT COULD ARISE FROM TRADE, SUPPLY, OR OTHER MATTERS, SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $118 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $105 MILLION, THE ORPHEUS MEDICAL ACQUISITION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF $38 MILLION, AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS (NET OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS) OF $26 MILLION. WE INVEST PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGH QUALITY, FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY, AT ANY TIME, CONTAIN INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL NOTES, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CASH DEPOSITS, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES OF $149 MILLION AND CASH USED IN THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $100 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES OF $91 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INTENSIVE. HOWEVER, WITH THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY AND FACILITIES AND IN MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS HAVE INCREASED. WE EXPECT THESE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO EXCEED $400 MILLION IN BOTH 2020 AND 2021. WE INTEND TO FUND THESE NEEDS WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW OR MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE, OR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE, TO THE COMPANY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC", "CIK": 1035267, "Date": "2020-04-17T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ISRG", "Name": "Intuitive Surgical Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3842.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 770416458.0, "key": "20200417ISRG", "labelr1": -1.51995896110805, "labelr2": -4.1865220998205865, "labelr3": 3.1210357811650526, "labelr4": 0.2128365844609829, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5583751, "prof1": 0.4416249, "return1&2": 1.0577011447874365, "return1&2&3": 1.024689913600828, "return1&2&3&4": 1.022508998587404, "return2": 1.0418652209982058, "return1": 1.0151995896110806, "return3": 0.9687896421883496, "return4": 0.9978716341553902, "1_day_return": -1.5199589611080475, "cumulative_return1": 0.030367355970512763, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3833, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9848004103889195, "cumreturn1b": 1.2303841669371105, "cumreturn1c": 1.0980847031743044, "cumreturndow": 1.142748395871281, "cumreturnsp500": 1.129249095172886}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3835, "level_0": 3943, "index": 87310, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKET LIGHTWEIGHT, HIGH-PERFORMANCE STRUCTURAL MATERIALS, INCLUDING CARBON FIBERS, SPECIALTY REINFORCEMENTS, PREPREGS AND OTHER FIBER-REINFORCED MATRIX MATERIALS, HONEYCOMB, ADHESIVES,  RADIO FREQUENCY / ELECTROMAGNETIC INTERFERENCE (\u201cRF/EMI\u201d)  AND MICROWAVE ABSORBING MATERIALS, ENGINEERED HONEYCOMB AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, FOR USE IN COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE, SPACE & DEFENSE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF END APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT, SPACE LAUNCH VEHICLES AND SATELLITES, WIND TURBINE BLADES, AUTOMOTIVE, RECREATIONAL PRODUCTS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS.  WE SERVE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THROUGH MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, SALES OFFICES AND REPRESENTATIVES LOCATED IN THE AMERICAS, ASIA PACIFIC, EUROPE, RUSSIA, INDIA AND AFRICA. WE ARE ALSO A PARTNER IN A JOINT VENTURE IN MALAYSIA, WHICH MANUFACTURES COMPOSITE STRUCTURES FOR COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE APPLICATIONS.  WE HAVE TWO SEGMENTS, COMPOSITE MATERIALS AND ENGINEERED PRODUCTS. THE COMPOSITE MATERIALS SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF OUR CARBON FIBER, SPECIALTY REINFORCEMENTS, RESINS, PREPREGS AND OTHER FIBER-REINFORCED MATRIX MATERIALS, HONEYCOMB CORE PRODUCT LINES AND PULTRUDED PROFILES.  THE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF LIGHTWEIGHT HIGH STRENGTH COMPOSITE STRUCTURES, RF/EMI AND MICROWAVE ABSORBING MATERIALS, ENGINEERED CORE AND SPECIALTY MACHINED HONEYCOMB PRODUCTS WITH ADDED FUNCTIONALITY.  ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (\u201cWHO\u201d) DECLARED THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK A PANDEMIC. THE OUTBREAK HAS RESULTED IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD IMPLEMENTING INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEASURES TO HELP CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, INCLUDING QUARANTINES, \u201cSHELTER IN PLACE\u201d AND \u201cSTAY AT HOME\u201d ORDERS, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, BUSINESS CURTAILMENTS, SCHOOL CLOSURES, AND OTHER MEASURES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE ENACTED FISCAL AND MONETARY STIMULUS MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19.  OUR COMPANY IS A SOLE PROVIDER FOR MANY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CRITICAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS. CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES AND WITH STATE AND LOCAL ORDERS TO DATE, WE CURRENTLY CONTINUE TO OPERATE ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS, COVID-19 HAS BEGUN TO HAVE AND MAY HAVE FURTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN, TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS AND CUSTOMERS ALL OF WHICH MAY COMPRESS OUR MARGINS, EVEN AFTER THE PREVENTATIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES THAT WE, OTHER BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING. THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMIES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS OF MANY COUNTRIES. THE RESULTING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS, AND COULD FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO VOLATILE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PRICES AND VOLUMES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS. THE PROGRESSION OF THE PANDEMIC COULD ALSO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR OPERATING LOCATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE BEGAN TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON OUR MARKETS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN AIR TRAFFIC, TEMPORARY SHUTDOWNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 AND SUPPLIERS\u2019 FACILITIES AND DECREASED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. IN RESPONSE, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING CERTAIN MITIGATING ACTIONS INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN WORKFORCE, COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND THE SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  THE EXTENT TO WHICH COVID-19 WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE, INCLUDING NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SEVERITY OF THE OUTBREAK AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTIONS GLOBALLY TO CONTAIN OR MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS. WHILE WE EXPECT THE PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, THE CURRENT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 MEANS THE RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT TO US CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.  ON JANUARY 12, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WOODWARD, INC. (\u201cWOODWARD\u201d), WHICH PROVIDED FOR THE COMBINATION OF HEXCEL AND WOODWARD IN AN ALL STOCK MERGER OF EQUALS (THE \u201cMERGER\u201d).  IN RESPONSE TO THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ON APRIL 5, 2020, HEXCEL AND WOODWARD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE MERGER AGREEMENT.  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER WERE $541.0 MILLION, 11.3% LOWER (11.0% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY) THAN THE $609.9 MILLION REPORTED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

WIND ENERGY SALES WERE DOWN 23.2% (21.5% IN CONSTANT CURRENCY) COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO TEMPORARY PLANT CLOSURES IN CHINA AND AUSTRIA ARISING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.7 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.8 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

THESE RISKS INCLUDE THE EVOLVING IMPACT AND DURATION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

IN ADDITION, INVESTORS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d) PRESCRIBE WHEN A COMPANY SHOULD RESERVE FOR PARTICULAR RISKS, INCLUDING LITIGATION EXPOSURES.

REPORTED RESULTS, THEREFORE, MAY APPEAR TO BE VOLATILE IN CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PERIODS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  NON-GAAP MEASURES  REFERENCES IN THIS REPORT TO \u201cORGANIC SALES\u201d REFER TO SALES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, EXCLUDING ACQUISITION-RELATED SALES AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. SNAP-ON HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT WITH FOREIGN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION FLUCTUATIONS.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES PERFORMANCE BASED ON ORGANIC SALES GROWTH, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTS GROWTH FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OUTPUT, CUSTOMER BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND/OR PRICING, AND EXCLUDES SALES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACQUIRED OPERATIONS THE COMPANY DID NOT OWN AS OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES ALSO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  RECENT ACQUISITIONS  ON JANUARY 31, 2020, SNAP-ON ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE TREADREADER PRODUCT LINE FROM SIGMAVISION LIMITED (\u201cSIGMAVISION\u201d) FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $5.9  MILLION.

THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE FIRST QUARTER PROGRESSED, IMPACTING SNAP-ON\u2019S SALES VOLUMES IN MOST GEOGRAPHIES AND ACROSS A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR.  IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY COVID-19 LED TO AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT RESERVE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO.  COVID-19 HAS CAUSED DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, AND HAS AUTHORED AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN.  IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19, NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE INSTITUTED CERTAIN MEASURES, INCLUDING TRAVEL BANS, PROHIBITIONS ON GROUP EVENTS AND GATHERINGS, SHUTDOWNS OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES, CURFEWS, SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING.  ALTHOUGH OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DEEMED ESSENTIAL AND WE FOLLOW THE COVID-19 GUIDELINES FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (\u201cCDC\u201d) CONCERNING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR PERSONNEL, THESE MEASURES HAVE RESULTED IN ATTENUATING ACTIVITY AND, IN SOME CASES, REQUIRED TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FACILITIES, AMONG OTHER IMPACTS.  THE DURATION OF THESE MEASURES IS UNKNOWN, MAY BE EXTENDED AND ADDITIONAL MEASURES MAY BE IMPOSED.  THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS IS DEPENDENT ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE RELATED LENGTH OF ITS IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME.

THESE DECREASES IN GROSS MARGIN WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S \u201cRAPID CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT\u201d OR \u201cRCI\u201d INITIATIVES.  SNAP-ON\u2019S RCI INITIATIVES EMPLOY A STRUCTURED SET OF TOOLS AND PROCESSES ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES INTENDED TO ELIMINATE WASTE AND IMPROVE OPERATIONS. SAVINGS FROM SNAP-ON\u2019S RCI INITIATIVES REFLECT BENEFITS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF ONGOING EFFICIENCY, PRODUCTIVITY AND PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING SAVINGS GENERATED FROM PRODUCT DESIGN COST REDUCTIONS, IMPROVED MANUFACTURING LINE SET-UP AND CHANGE-OVER PRACTICES, LOWER-COST SOURCING INITIATIVES AND FACILITY OPTIMIZATION.

THESE INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY: (I) THE FUNDING OF $212.8 MILLION OF NEW FINANCE RECEIVABLES; (II) DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $59.0 MILLION; (III) THE REPURCHASE OF 349,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK FOR $50.5 MILLION; (IV) $41.9 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS FROM OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS; (V) THE FUNDING OF $17.2 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; AND (VI) THE FUNDING OF $6.1 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS.  OF THE $185.8 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, $154.3 MILLION WAS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. SNAP-ON MAINTAINS NON-U.S. FUNDS IN ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO: (I) PROVIDE ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL; (II) SATISFY VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND/OR (III) TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  ALTHOUGH THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d) GENERALLY ELIMINATED U.S. FEDERAL TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH DIVIDENDS MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO STATE INCOME TAXATION AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. SNAP-ON PERIODICALLY EVALUATES ITS CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPATRIATE CERTAIN FOREIGN CASH AMOUNTS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DOES NOT INCUR UNFAVORABLE NET TAX CONSEQUENCES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  TRADE AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \u2013 NET OF $635.2 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $59.4 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COLLECTIONS, THE IMPACT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME AND $21.9 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (TRADE AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \u2013 NET AS OF THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD END, DIVIDED BY THE RESPECTIVE TRAILING 12 MONTHS SALES, TIMES 360 DAYS) WAS 62 DAYS AT MARCH 28, 2020, AND 67 DAYS AT DECEMBER 28, 2019.  THE CURRENT PORTIONS OF NET FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $606.5 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, COMPARED TO $630.8 MILLION AT 2019 YEAR END. THE LONG-TERM PORTIONS OF NET FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $1,457.3 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, COMPARED TO $1,463.6 MILLION AT 2019 YEAR END. THE COMBINED $30.6 MILLION DECREASE IN NET CURRENT AND LONG-TERM FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OVER 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $25.7 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, $8.1 MILLION OF PROVISION CHARGES RESULTING FROM THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326  ) AND $2.6 MILLION OF HIGHER CREDIT RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO.  INVENTORIES \u2013 NET OF $757.4 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $3.0 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS, REFLECTING $25.1 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $22.1 MILLION PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT CONTINUED CUSTOMER DEMAND AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.  INVENTORY TURNS (TRAILING 12 MONTHS OF COST OF GOODS SOLD, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING INVENTORY BALANCE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS) WERE 2.5 TURNS AND 2.6 TURNS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. INVENTORIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cFIFO\u201d) METHOD APPROXIMATED 57% AND 58% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER INVENTORIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cLIFO\u201d) METHOD. THE COMPANY\u2019S LIFO RESERVE WAS $84.5 MILLION AS OF BOTH MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NOTES PAYABLE OF $160.1 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, INCLUDED $150 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITY BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR A MATURITY DATE WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE BORROWING DATE, AND $10.1 MILLION OF OTHER NOTES. THERE WERE NO COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AS OF MARCH 28, 2020 DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS OF 2019 YEAR END, NOTES PAYABLE OF $202.9 MILLION INCLUDED $193.6 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND $9.3 MILLION OF OTHER NOTES.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $193.7 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $4.8 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND $3.3 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $397.0 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, INCREASED $26.2 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME TAX ACCRUALS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8.0 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  LONG-TERM DEBT OF $948.2 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, CONSISTED OF: (I) $250 MILLION OF UNSECURED 6.125% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2021 (THE \u201c2021 NOTES\u201d); (II) $300 MILLION OF UNSECURED 3.25% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2027 (THE \u201c2027 NOTES\u201d); AND (III) $400 MILLION OF UNSECURED 4.10% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2048 (THE \u201c2048 NOTES\u201d), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION FROM THE NET EFFECTS OF DEBT AMORTIZATION COSTS AND FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS. LONG-TERM DEBT OF $946.9 MILLION AS OF 2019 YEAR END CONSISTED OF: (I) $250 MILLION OF THE 2021 NOTES; (II) $300 MILLION OF THE 2027 NOTES; AND (III) $400 MILLION OF THE 2048 NOTES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.1 MILLION FROM THE NET EFFECTS OF DEBT AMORTIZATION COSTS AND FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS.  SNAP-ON HAS AN $800 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d); $150 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF MARCH 28, 2020.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARYING RATES BASED ON EITHER: (I) SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT, LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS; OR (II) SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT NET OF CERTAIN CASH ADJUSTMENTS (\u201cCONSOLIDATED NET DEBT\u201d) TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS THEN ENDED (THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO\u201d). THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES THAT SNAP-ON MAINTAIN, AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, EITHER (I) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO THE SUM OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL EQUITY AND LESS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS (THE \u201cLEVERAGE RATIO\u201d); OR (II) A CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO NOT GREATER THAN 3.50 TO 1.00. SNAP-ON MAY, UP TO TWO TIMES DURING ANY FIVE-YEAR PERIOD DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (INCLUDING ANY EXTENSIONS THEREOF), ELECT TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO TO 0.65 TO 1.00 AND/OR INCREASE THE MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO TO 4.00 TO 1.00 FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE RELATED CREDIT AGREEMENT). AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL RATIOS OF 0.20 AND 0.93 RESPECTIVELY, WERE BOTH WITHIN THE PERMITTED RANGES SET FORTH IN THIS FINANCIAL COVENANT. SNAP-ON GENERALLY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ITS FINANCING NEEDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND USES THE CREDIT FACILITY AS BACK-UP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT SUCH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  SNAP-ON BELIEVES IT HAS SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE CASH AND ACCESS TO BOTH COMMITTED AND UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO COVER ITS EXPECTED FUNDING NEEDS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS, HOWEVER, IT IS CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON ITS BUSINESS AND THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS. SNAP-ON MANAGES ITS AGGREGATE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS SO AS NOT TO EXCEED ITS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT IT CAN ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, TO FUND ITS SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENSURE NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY. SNAP-ON REGULARLY MONITORS THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND, IF IT BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE, IT MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH CONDITIONS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SNAP-ON INCLUDE SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEW RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, THE FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS, AND FUNDING FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS, IF AND AS THEY ARISE. SNAP-ON INTENDS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $8.7 MILLION TO ITS FOREIGN PENSION PLANS AND $2.9 MILLION TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS IN 2020, AS REQUIRED BY LAW. DEPENDING ON MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, SNAP-ON MAY MAKE DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN 2020.  SNAP-ON\u2019S LONG-TERM FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE DEBT MARKETS TO ACCOMMODATE ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, ADDITIONAL FIXED-TERM DEBT AND/OR SECURITIZATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $213.4 MILLION AND $201.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE $12.1 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF $62.6 MILLION FROM NET CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40.1 MILLION DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $49.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO FINANCE RECEIVABLES OF $212.8 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COLLECTIONS OF $190.7 MILLION. NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $38.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO FINANCE RECEIVABLES OF $210.5 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COLLECTIONS OF $191.9 MILLION. FINANCE RECEIVABLES ARE COMPRISED OF EXTENDED-TERM INSTALLMENT PAYMENT CONTRACTS TO BOTH TECHNICIANS AND INDEPENDENT SHOP OWNERS (I.E., FRANCHISEES\u2019 CUSTOMERS) TO ENABLE THEM TO PURCHASE TOOLS AND DIAGNOSTIC AND EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS ON AN EXTENDED-TERM PAYMENT PLAN, GENERALLY WITH AVERAGE PAYMENT TERMS OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE RESPECTIVE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019 ALSO INCLUDED $6.1 MILLION AND $1.3 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS. SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ACQUISITIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $17.2 MILLION AND $20.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN BOTH YEARS INCLUDED CONTINUED INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTION OF ITS STRATEGIC VALUE CREATION PROCESSES AROUND SAFETY, QUALITY, CUSTOMER CONNECTION, INNOVATION AND RCI.  THE LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS A RESULT OF DECREASED EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO COVID-19.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $157.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 INCLUDED REPAYMENTS OF NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $41.9 MILLION. NET CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $147.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDED REPAYMENTS OF NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $43.8 MILLION.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  PROCEEDS FROM STOCK PURCHASE AND OPTION PLAN EXERCISES TOTALED $1.5 MILLION AND $4.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. SNAP-ON HAS UNDERTAKEN STOCK REPURCHASES FROM TIME TO TIME TO OFFSET DILUTION CREATED BY SHARES ISSUED FOR EMPLOYEE AND FRANCHISEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, AS WELL AS STOCK OPTIONS, AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020, SNAP-ON REPURCHASED 349,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $50.5 MILLION UNDER ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, SNAP-ON REPURCHASED 295,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $47.4 MILLION UNDER ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, SNAP-ON HAD REMAINING AVAILABILITY TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $313.3 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO ITS BOARD\u2019S AUTHORIZATIONS. THE PURCHASE OF SNAP-ON COMMON STOCK IS AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO PREVAILING FINANCIAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS.   SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY.  SNAP-ON HAS PAID CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR REDUCTION, SINCE 1939. CASH DIVIDENDS TOTALED $59.0 MILLION AND $52.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, THE BOARD INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND BY 13.7% TO $1.08 PER SHARE ($4.32 PER SHARE ANNUALIZED). SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  SNAP-ON\u2019S DISCLOSURES OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019, HAVE NOT MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE THAT REPORT WAS FILED, WITH THE EXCEPTION TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  . AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN SNAP-ON\u2019S FINANCE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN UPDATED TO BE BASED ON ONGOING ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE EXPECTED CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO CONSIDERING COLLECTABILITY, HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ALLOWANCE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION NUMEROUS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT INCLUDE RECEIVABLE TYPE, HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, DELINQUENCY TRENDS, COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, CURRENT AND FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CREDIT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE INFLUENCED BY ITEMS SUCH AS THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST PAYMENT EXPERIENCE, CREDIT BUREAU AND PROPRIETARY SNAP-ON CREDIT MODEL INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.  MANAGEMENT UTILIZES ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE WELL CONTROLLED, REVIEWED AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED.  AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, THE RATIO OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES WAS 4.11%.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THE ALLOWANCE RATIO WAS 3.65%.  WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT EXERCISES PRUDENT JUDGEMENT AND APPLIES REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTABLISHING ITS ESTIMATE FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS WOULD NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATES USED IN THE ALLOWANCE CALCULATION.  FOR REFERENCE, A 100 BPS INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE RATIO FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, WOULD INCREASE SNAP-ON\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE RELATED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES BY APPROXIMATELY $16.9 MILLION.  SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 4 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON SNAP-ON\u2019S ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  OUTLOOK  THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE FIRST QUARTER PROGRESSED, IMPACTING SNAP-ON\u2019S SALES VOLUMES IN MOST GEOGRAPHIES AND ACROSS A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR.  COVID-19 HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE DURING 2020 AND IS IMPACTING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WORLDWIDE.  IN THE NEAR TERM, SNAP-ON ANTICIPATES NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, AS A RESULT, EXPECTS SALES AND CREDIT ORIGINATIONS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 TO BE DOWN YEAR OVER YEAR.  SNAP-ON DOES NOT, AS A GENERAL PRACTICE, FURNISH QUARTERLY SALES OR EARNINGS PROJECTIONS.  HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF ACTIONS IMPOSED BY NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS SECOND QUARTER 2020 SALES AND EARNINGS WILL BE LOWER THAN REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2019 AMOUNTS.  SNAP-ON IS RESPONDING TO THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES BY DEEPENING ITS RCI, SOURCING AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES.  SNAP-ON RECORDED $7.5 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  SNAP-ON WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE ITS CASH FLOWS AND BALANCE ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER COST REDUCTION ACTIONS; THE CURRENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PRESENTLY PREDICT THIS BALANCE AS THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY ADJUSTS TO THE CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.  SNAP-ON EXPECTS THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2020 WILL BE IN A RANGE OF $70 MILLION TO $80 MILLION, OF WHICH $17.2 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  DESPITE NEAR TERM UNCERTAINTY, SNAP-ON EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON ITS DEFINED RUNWAYS FOR COHERENT GROWTH, LEVERAGING CAPABILITIES ALREADY DEMONSTRATED IN THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ARENA AND DEVELOPING AND EXPANDING ITS PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER BASE, NOT ONLY IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR, BUT IN ADJACENT MARKETS, ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AND OTHER AREAS, INCLUDING EXTENDING IN CRITICAL INDUSTRIES, WHERE THE COST AND PENALTIES FOR FAILURE CAN BE HIGH.  SNAP-ON CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS FULL YEAR 2020 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF 23% TO 25%.  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Snap-on Inc", "CIK": 91440, "Date": "2020-04-21T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SNA", "Name": "Snap-on Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3420.0, "Business": "WI", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 390622040.0, "key": "20200421SNA", "labelr1": 2.9129726795730035, "labelr2": -0.0791139240506359, "labelr3": 2.1113750329902268, "labelr4": 7.728095115016812, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.54349124, "prof1": 0.45650876, "return1&2": 0.971638366774843, "return1&2&3": 0.951123436887805, "return1&2&3&4": 0.8776197130238985, "return2": 1.0007911392405064, "return1": 0.97087027320427, "return3": 0.9788862496700976, "return4": 0.922719048849832, "1_day_return": 2.9129726795730004, "cumulative_return1": 0.029168663976307508, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3837, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0324767425330774, "cumreturn1b": 1.22388711118543, "cumreturn1c": 1.0906925101149636, "cumreturndow": 1.1330945391621128, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1209114697246683}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3843, "level_0": 3951, "index": 76071, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL SECURITY AND AEROSPACE COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, INTEGRATION AND SUSTAINMENT OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING, TECHNICAL, SCIENTIFIC, LOGISTICS, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND CYBERSECURITY SERVICES. WE SERVE BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT HAVE DEFENSE, CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, WITH OUR PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS BEING AGENCIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  72%  OF OUR  $15.7 BILLION  IN NET SALES WERE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, EITHER AS A PRIME CONTRACTOR OR AS A SUBCONTRACTOR (INCLUDING  61%  FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)),  27%  WERE FROM INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CONTRACTED THROUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT) AND  1%  WERE FROM U.S. COMMERCIAL AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. OUR MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS ARE IN DEFENSE, SPACE, INTELLIGENCE, HOMELAND SECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ON JULY 1, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE FINAL STEP OF THE PLANNED FREEZE OF OUR QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020; THE PLANS ARE NOW FULLY FROZEN. WITH THE FREEZE COMPLETE, THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALARIED EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN AN ENHANCED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN.  COVID-19  THE GLOBAL OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) WAS DECLARED A PANDEMIC BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND A NATIONAL EMERGENCY BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN MARCH 2020 AND HAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMY, DISRUPTED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING MANDATED CLOSURES AND ORDERS TO \u201cSHELTER-IN-PLACE,\u201d AND CREATED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.  LOCKHEED MARTIN HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR PROGRAMS IN THE EXPECTED TIMEFRAME, WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT DISEASE SPREAD, ALL OF WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED. THE OUTBREAK DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. HOWEVER, WE ARE BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE SOME ISSUES IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS AREAS RELATED TO COVID-19, PRIMARILY IN ACCESS TO SOME LOCATIONS AND DELAYS OF SUPPLIER DELIVERIES. WE HAVE UPDATED OUR 2020 SALES OUTLOOK, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, AND THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 IS UNCERTAIN.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOD GUIDANCE ISSUED IN MARCH 2020 DESIGNATING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKFORCE, OUR U.S. PRODUCTION FACILITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITMENTS TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S. MILITARY, HOWEVER, FACILITY CLOSURES OR WORK SLOWDOWNS OR TEMPORARY STOPPAGES COULD OCCUR. IN ADDITION, OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND POLICIES THAT CAN AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD A BRIEF PAUSE IN OPERATIONS AT THE F-35 FINAL ASSEMBLY AND CHECK OUT (FACO) FACILITIES IN JAPAN AND ITALY IN MARCH IN OBSERVANCE OF SUCH COUNTRIES\u2019 COVID-19 POLICIES AND ADDITIONAL CLOSURES COULD OCCUR, AND WE ARE SEEING IMPACTS FROM BASE CLOSURES AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN MANY CASES FACILITIES ARE NOT OPERATING UNDER FULL STAFFING AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, WHICH COULD HAVE A LONGER-TERM IMPACT. FLIGHT TEST OPERATIONS AND TRAINING ARE BEING IMPACTED BY TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, WHICH COULD DELAY OUR DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO HAVE SOME LIMITED OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MANDATED TO CLOSE OR OPERATE AT ONLY MINIMUM BASIC OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE CLOSURES TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 TO INCREASE PROGRESS PAYMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING CONTRACTS AND ACCELERATE CONTRACT AWARDS THROUGH INCREASED USE OF UNDEFINITIZED CONTRACTING ACTIONS (UCAS) TO PROVIDE CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY FOR COMPANIES IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE, INCLUDING LARGE PRIME CONTRACTORS LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN AND SMALLER SUPPLIERS. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLE ACTIONS TO HELP SUPPORT CERTAIN SUPPLIERS AFFECTED BY COVID-19, INCLUDING ACCELERATING PAYMENTS OF OVER $150 MILLION TO OUR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS, AND PAYING THE FIRST $50 MILLION OF AN ADDITIONAL $450 MILLION IN ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO OUR GLOBAL SUPPLY BASE AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DOD IN CHANGING THE PROGRESS PAYMENT POLICY. AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE RELY ON OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE MATERIALS, MAJOR COMPONENTS  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND PRODUCTS, AND TO PERFORM A PORTION OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER THE TERMS OF MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE RESPONSE TO COVID-19 COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM ON OUR CONTRACTS. TO DATE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE POTENTIAL DELIVERY IMPACTS DUE TO COVID-19 AND, IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ALTERNATIVES OR OTHER MITIGATIONS, DELIVERIES AND OTHER MILESTONES ON AFFECTED PROGRAMS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS AND COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND CUSTOMERS, AND TO TAKE ACTIONS IN AN EFFORT TO MITIGATE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.  2020 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS. THE PROJECTED GROWTH IN NET SALES FROM 2019 IS DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUME AT ALL FOUR BUSINESS AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, THE INCREASED GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY THE F-35 PROGRAM AT AERONAUTICS, INCREASED VOLUME IN THE TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILES AND AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE BUSINESSES AT MFC, SIKORSKY VOLUME AT RMS, AND HYPERSONICS VOLUME AT SPACE. TOTAL BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN IN 2020 IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10.9%; AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT CASH FROM OPERATIONS TO BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO $7.6 BILLION.  WE ARE SEEING SOME IMPACT FROM COVID-19 ON OUR EXPECTED 2020 SALES GROWTH. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR 2020 OUTLOOK FOR SALES, SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. OUR 2020 OUTLOOK ASSUMES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND WE DO NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT WORK STOPPAGES OR CLOSURES, WE ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE ANY SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AND THESE DO NOT WORSEN, AND WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR COSTS UNDER CONTRACTS AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRIORITIES DO NOT CHANGE. IN ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ASSUMES ACTUAL RETURNS ON OUR PENSION ASSETS DURING 2020 WILL BE 7.0%, AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO RE-MEASURE OUR PENSION LIABILITIES AT YEAR-END 2020 WILL BE 3.25%.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ASSUMED VALUES AND ACTUAL VALUES WILL AFFECT OUR PLAN\u2019S FUNDED STATUS AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS MEASURED AT YEAR-END 2020. WE ARE ALSO MONITORING THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, FUTURE CHANGES IN EXPECTATIONS FOR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL BELOW OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS COULD CAUSE THESE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED. WHILE THESE ARE OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, THIS IS AN EMERGING SITUATION AND THESE COULD CHANGE, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR OUTLOOK. RISK RELATED TO THESE ITEMS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW AND UNDER ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.  OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2020 ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN THE ADVANCED MILITARY MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL CENTER LLC (AMMROC) JOINT VENTURE THAT COULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS THE SECOND QUARTER (SEE \u201cOTHER INCOME, NET\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR MORE DETAIL). OUR OUTLOOK ALSO ASSUMES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT AND FUND OUR KEY PROGRAMS AND DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM, RESULTING FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS RELATED TO TURKEY (SEE \u201cOTHER MATTERS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF 2020 NET SALES, OPERATING MARGIN AND CASH FLOWS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS A SUPPLEMENT TO AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  (  2019  FORM 10-K).  INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS  U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING  ON FEBRUARY 10, 2020, THE ADMINISTRATION SUBMITTED THE FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2021 PRESIDENT\u2019S BUDGET, REQUESTING $1.34 TRILLION IN TOTAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING (A U.S. GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEAR STARTS ON OCTOBER 1 AND ENDS ON SEPTEMBER 30). THE FY 2021 BUDGET REQUESTS $672 BILLION FOR BASE DISCRETIONARY NATIONAL DEFENSE SPENDING, THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED UNDER THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2019 (BBA-19). THE TOTAL NATIONAL DEFENSE REQUEST IS $741 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDES $69 BILLION REQUESTED FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO). OCO FUNDING DOES NOT COUNT TOWARD DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAPS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FY 2021 BUDGET REQUESTS $705 BILLION FOR THE DOD, INCLUDING $636 BILLION FOR THE BASE BUDGET AND $69 BILLION FOR OCO.  THE DOD REQUEST IS ONLY $800 MILLION ABOVE THE FY 2020 ENACTED LEVEL FOR BOTH BASE NATIONAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND OCO.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (THE CARES ACT), THE BIPARTISAN $2 TRILLION ECONOMIC RELIEF PACKAGE AIMED AT HELPING AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE BILL INCLUDES $10.4 BILLION FOR DOD TO FUND DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAMS, NATIONAL GUARD AND HOSPITAL SHIP DEPLOYMENTS, AND THE DEFENSE PROCUREMENT ACT FUND. THE FUNDING IS IDENTIFIED AS EMERGENCY AND IS EXEMPT FROM THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS OF THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011 (BCA).  SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING RISKS WITHIN \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10\u2010K.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR OPERATING CYCLE IS PRIMARILY LONG-TERM AND INVOLVES MANY TYPES OF CONTRACTS FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES WITH VARYING DELIVERY SCHEDULES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF A PARTICULAR PERIOD, OR PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF SALES AND PROFITS, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF COMPARATIVE RESULTS AMONG PERIODS SHOULD BE REVIEWED IN THIS CONTEXT. ALL PER SHARE AMOUNTS CITED IN THESE DISCUSSIONS ARE PRESENTED ON A \u201cPER DILUTED SHARE\u201d BASIS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED. OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

ACCORDINGLY, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  NET SALES  WE GENERATE SALES FROM THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

UNDER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD, WE RECORD NET SALES ON CONTRACTS OVER TIME BASED UPON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT, AS WELL AS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE PROFIT TO BE EARNED AT COMPLETION. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES SHOULD BE READ IN TANDEM WITH THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES AND OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE CHANGES IN OUR SALES ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OUR COST OF SALES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD.  PRODUCT SALES  PRODUCT SALES  INCREASED  $1.2 BILLION  , OR  10%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT SALES OF APPROXIMATELY  $660 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS,  $360 MILLION  AT MFC AND  $250 MILLION  AT SPACE. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT AERONAUTICS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUME FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM AND HIGHER VOLUME ON CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HIGH-MOBILITY ARTILLERY ROCKET SYSTEM (HIMARS), GUIDED MULTIPLE LAUNCH ROCKET SYSTEM (GMLRS) AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND INCREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY TERMINAL HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE (THAAD) AND PATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY-3 (PAC-3)). THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT SPACE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY NEXT GENERATION OVERHEAD PERSISTENT INFRARED (NEXT GEN OPIR)).  SERVICE SALES  SERVICE SALES  INCREASED  $119 MILLION  , OR  5%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES OF ABOUT  $125 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS AND  $55 MILLION  AT RMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF ABOUT  $90 MILLION  AT MFC. HIGHER SERVICE SALES AT AERONAUTICS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUSTAINMENT VOLUME FOR THE F-35, F-22 AND F-16 PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES AT RMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED WARFARE SYSTEMS AND SENSORS (IWSS) PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY AEGIS COMBAT SYSTEM (AEGIS)) AND SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAM. THE DECREASE IN SERVICE SALES AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019; AND DECREASED VOLUME FOR SENSORS AND GLOBAL SUSTAINMENT PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY APACHE) AND INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY PAC-3).  COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES, FOR BOTH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CONSIST OF MATERIALS, LABOR, SUBCONTRACTING COSTS, AN ALLOCATION OF INDIRECT COSTS (OVERHEAD AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE), AS WELL AS THE COSTS TO FULFILL OUR INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS OFFSET AGREEMENTS, REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. FOR EACH OF OUR CONTRACTS, WE MONITOR THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF COSTS AT THE CONTRACT LEVEL, WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR ESTIMATING OUR TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. OUR CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  COST OF SALES \u2013 PRODUCTS  $(11,742  )  $(10,625  )% OF PRODUCT SALES  89.2%  88.8%  COST OF SALES \u2013 SERVICES  (2,213  )  (2,047  )% OF SERVICE SALES  89.1%  86.5%  OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET  395  524  TOTAL COST OF SALES  $(13,560  )  $(12,148  )  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SHOULD BE READ IN TANDEM WITH THE PRECEDING DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES AND OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. EXCEPT FOR IMPACTS OF COVID-19; POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM, RESULTING FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS RELATED TO TURKEY; AND PROJECTED FAS PENSION INCOME IN 2020 AS A RESULT OF COMPLETING THE PLANNED FREEZE OF OUR SALARIED PENSION PLANS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPING  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRENDS IN COST OF SALES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS (SEE \u201cOTHER MATTERS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  PRODUCT COSTS  PRODUCT COSTS  INCREASED  $1.1 BILLION  , OR  11%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $575 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS,  $360 MILLION  AT MFC AND  $265 MILLION  AT SPACE. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT AERONAUTICS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUME FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY THAAD AND PAC-3) AND INCREASED VOLUME FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HIMARS, GMLRS AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS). THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT SPACE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY NEXT GEN OPIR).  SERVICE COSTS  SERVICE COSTS  INCREASED  $166 MILLION  , OR  8%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN SERVICE COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SERVICE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $125 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS AND  $75 MILLION  AT RMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SERVICE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $65 MILLION  AT MFC. HIGHER SERVICE COSTS AT AERONAUTICS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUSTAINMENT VOLUME FOR THE F-35, F-22 AND F-16 PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE COSTS AT RMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS AND IWSS PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY AEGIS). THE DECREASE IN SERVICE COSTS AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019 AND DECREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO DECREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY PAC-3).  OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET  OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES THE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT (WHICH REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CAS) PENSION COST RECORDED IN OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE)), STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OTHER CORPORATE COSTS. THESE ITEMS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND, THEREFORE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM COST OF SALES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET REDUCED COST OF SALES BY  $395 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO  $524 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET DECLINES THAT REDUCED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT ASSETS, AND A DECREASE IN OUR FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT (SEE \u201cBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR MORE DETAIL).  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES. DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , OTHER INCOME, NET WAS  $31 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $95 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . OTHER INCOME, NET DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCLUDED LOWER EARNINGS GENERATED BY EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES. OTHER INCOME, NET DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCLUDED A PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED NON-CASH GAIN OF $51 MILLION ($38 MILLION, OR $0.13 PER SHARE, AFTER TAX) RELATED TO PROPERTIES SOLD IN 2015 AS A RESULT OF COMPLETING OUR REMAINING OBLIGATIONS.  AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, WE HAD AN INVESTMENT IN THE ADVANCED MILITARY MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL CENTER LLC (AMMROC) JOINT VENTURE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $435 MILLION. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN AMMROC USING THE EQUITY METHOD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF AMMROC\u2019S CURRENT BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER CONTRACT TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL (MRO) SERVICES FOR FIXED AND ROTARY WING MILITARY AIRCRAFT THAT WAS UP FOR RE-COMPETITION. IN APRIL 2020, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF OUR FIRST QUARTER, THE CUSTOMER ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO AWARD THE CONTRACT TO A COMPETITOR. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER HAS NOT YET EXECUTED THE NEW CONTRACT NOR DEFINED WHEN OR HOW THE MRO SERVICES WILL TRANSITION TO THE COMPETITOR. WE ARE WORKING WITH AMMROC\u2019S MANAGEMENT AND OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER THERE IS A BASIS TO CHALLENGE THE AWARD AND RETAIN THE MRO SERVICES, EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF AMMROC CONTINUING TO PROVIDE MRO SERVICES AS A SUBCONTRACTOR TO THE COMPETITOR, AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE THE CONTRACT WITH OTHER CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, OR WINDING DOWN THE BUSINESS. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, IF ANY, RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT UNTIL WE FULLY EVALUATE THE OPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PLAN TO TRANSITION THE MRO SERVICES TO THE COMPETITOR, WHAT MAY OCCUR WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF AMMROC\u2019S BUSINESS, THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDATION OF AMMROC\u2019S ASSETS AND A FINAL  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DISTRIBUTION TO THE OWNERS, AND OUR RIGHTS UNDER JURISDICTIONAL LAW AND THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. HOWEVER, IF THE CUSTOMER MOVES FORWARD WITH TRANSITIONING THE MRO SERVICES TO THE COMPETITOR AND AMMROC IS NOT A SUBCONTRACTOR (OR HAS ONLY A LIMITED ROLE), WE EXPECT THERE WOULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO AMMROC\u2019S BUSINESS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND AN IMPAIRMENT COULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. OTHER THAN THE IMPACT TO EARNINGS FOR A POTENTIAL NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, CURRENTLY WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO OUR 2020 OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES THE NON-SERVICE COST COMPONENTS OF FAS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN INCOME (EXPENSE) (I.E., INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, NET ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES, AND AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR SERVICE COST OR CREDITS). DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET WAS  $56 MILLION  COMPARED TO OTHER NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET OF  $167 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NON-SERVICE FAS PENSION EXPENSE FOR OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  15.4%  FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , AND  12.4%  FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE RATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  BENEFITED FROM ADDITIONAL TAX DEDUCTIONS OF $65 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER SHARE, RECORDED DISCRETELY FOR 2018, BASED ON PROPOSED TAX REGULATIONS RELEASED ON MARCH 4, 2019, WHICH CLARIFIED THAT FOREIGN MILITARY SALES QUALIFY FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME TREATMENT.  THE RATES FOR BOTH PERIODS BENEFITED FROM TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS, THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT, TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME, AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE CORPORATION'S DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WITH AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN FEATURE.  CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THEIR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION, INCLUDING THOSE WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION FOR RESEARCH OR EXPERIMENTAL EXPENDITURES, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE, OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES, AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE AMOUNT OF NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL CHANGE PERIODICALLY BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS, ACTUAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, AND FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REGULARLY UNDER AUDIT OR EXAMINATION BY TAX AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD SIMILARLY RESULT IN UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR TAX EXPENSE AND AFFECT PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW THE CARES ACT, WHICH, ALONG WITH EARLIER ISSUED IRS GUIDANCE, PROVIDES FOR DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN TAXES. THE CARES ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALSO CONTAINS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH MAY BENEFIT LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE CARES ACT AND ONGOING GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE RELATED TO COVID-19 THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NET EARNINGS  WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF  $1.7 BILLION  (  $6.08  PER SHARE) DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  (  $5.99  PER SHARE) DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . BOTH NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE AFFECTED BY THE FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE. EARNINGS PER SHARE ALSO BENEFITED FROM A NET DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING FROM  MARCH 31, 2019  TO  MARCH 29, 2020  AS A RESULT OF SHARE REPURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SHARE ISSUANCE UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  WE OPERATE IN  FOUR  BUSINESS SEGMENTS: AERONAUTICS,  MFC, RMS  AND SPACE. WE ORGANIZE OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED ON THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED.  NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS EXCLUDE INTERSEGMENT SALES, COST OF SALES, AND PROFIT AS THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT INCLUDES OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES AS THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF THE EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT ALSO EXCLUDES THE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT DESCRIBED BELOW, A PORTION OF CORPORATE COSTS NOT CONSIDERED ALLOWABLE OR ALLOCABLE TO CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT UNDER THE APPLICABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CAS) OR FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR), AND OTHER ITEMS NOT CONSIDERED PART OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S EVALUATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS, LEGAL FEES AND SETTLEMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RETIREE BENEFITS, SIGNIFICANT SEVERANCE ACTIONS, SIGNIFICANT ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SIGNIFICANT DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE ACTIVITIES.  EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE RECONCILING ITEM \u201cUNALLOCATED ITEMS\u201d BETWEEN OPERATING PROFIT FROM OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT. SEE \u201c  NOTE 10 \u2013 OTHER  \u201d INCLUDED IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR A DISCUSSION RELATED TO CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST PRESENT FAS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS REQUIREMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP. THE OPERATING PORTION OF THE NET FAS/CAS PENSION ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) AND TOTAL CAS PENSION COST. THE NON-SERVICE FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) COMPONENT IS INCLUDED IN OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. AS A RESULT, TO THE EXTENT THAT CAS PENSION COST EXCEEDS THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE), WE HAVE A FAVORABLE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES PERFORMANCE ON OUR CONTRACTS BY FOCUSING ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT AND NOT BY TYPE OR AMOUNT OF OPERATING EXPENSE. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE FOCUSES ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE BUSINESS. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR CONTRACTS, AS MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE BIDDING OF EACH CONTRACT BY FOCUSING ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT AND MONITORS PERFORMANCE ON OUR CONTRACTS IN A SIMILAR MANNER THROUGH THEIR COMPLETION.  WE REGULARLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH REPORTS OF OUR COSTS AS THE CONTRACT PROGRESSES. THE COST INFORMATION IN THE REPORTS IS ACCUMULATED IN A MANNER SPECIFIED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH CONTRACT. FOR EXAMPLE, COST DATA PROVIDED TO A CUSTOMER FOR A PRODUCT WOULD TYPICALLY ALIGN TO THE SUBCOMPONENTS OF THAT PRODUCT (SUCH AS A WING-BOX ON AN AIRCRAFT) AND FOR SERVICES WOULD ALIGN TO THE TYPE OF WORK BEING PERFORMED (SUCH AS AIRCRAFT SUSTAINMENT). OUR CONTRACTS GENERALLY ALLOW FOR THE RECOVERY OF COSTS IN THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE BID AND NEGOTIATED WITH OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO PROVIDE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. THIS APPROACH FOR NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS WITH OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS GENERALLY ALLOWS FOR RECOVERY OF OUR ACTUAL COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN. WE ALSO MAY ENTER INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS FOR CERTAIN MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS TO COINCIDE WITH THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND TO ENSURE THEIR AVAILABILITY AT KNOWN UNIT PRICES.  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS SPAN SEVERAL YEARS AND INCLUDE HIGHLY COMPLEX TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. AT THE OUTSET OF A CONTRACT, WE IDENTIFY AND MONITOR RISKS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF THE CONTRACT AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF THOSE RISKS ON OUR ESTIMATES OF TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. THE ESTIMATES CONSIDER THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (E.G., A NEWLY-DEVELOPED PRODUCT VERSUS A MATURE PRODUCT), THE SCHEDULE AND ASSOCIATED TASKS (E.G., THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF MILESTONE EVENTS) AND COSTS (E.G., MATERIAL, LABOR, SUBCONTRACTOR, OVERHEAD AND THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL OUR INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS OFFSET AGREEMENTS, REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS). THE INITIAL PROFIT BOOKING RATE OF EACH CONTRACT CONSIDERS RISKS SURROUNDING THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS, SCHEDULE AND COSTS IN THE INITIAL ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. PROFIT BOOKING RATES MAY INCREASE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT IF WE SUCCESSFULLY RETIRE RISKS SURROUNDING THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF THE CONTRACT, WHICH DECREASES THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, OUR PROFIT BOOKING RATES MAY DECREASE IF THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACT INCREASE. ALL OF THE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT AND MAY AFFECT THE PROFIT BOOKING RATE.  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CLASSIFIED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH CANNOT BE SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS AS OUR OTHER PROGRAMS.  OUR NET SALES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS FMS CONTRACTED THROUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED AND THE CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS WITH CONTINUOUS TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, GENERALLY USING THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST MEASURE OF PROGRESS FOR OUR CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER AS WE INCUR COSTS ON OUR CONTRACTS. FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN WHICH CONTROL DOES NOT CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFER TO THE CUSTOMER, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE POINT IN TIME IN WHICH EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULLY SATISFIED.  CHANGES IN NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT GENERALLY ARE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF VOLUME. CHANGES IN VOLUME REFER TO INCREASES OR DECREASES IN SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT RESULTING FROM VARYING PRODUCTION ACTIVITY LEVELS, DELIVERIES OR SERVICE LEVELS ON INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. VOLUME CHANGES IN SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE CURRENT PROFIT BOOKING RATE FOR A PARTICULAR CONTRACT.  IN ADDITION, COMPARABILITY OF OUR SEGMENT SALES, OPERATING PROFIT AND OPERATING MARGIN MAY BE IMPACTED FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY BY CHANGES IN PROFIT BOOKING RATES ON OUR CONTRACTS FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME USING THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION. INCREASES IN THE PROFIT BOOKING RATES, TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS RISK RETIREMENTS, USUALLY RELATE TO REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO FULFILL THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT REFLECT IMPROVED CONDITIONS ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, CONDITIONS ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT MAY DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO FULFILL THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND A REDUCTION IN THE PROFIT BOOKING RATE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN PROFIT BOOKING RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND REFLECT THE INCEPTION-TO-DATE EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES. SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT AND MARGIN MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY BY OTHER ITEMS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT IMPACT SALES. FAVORABLE ITEMS MAY INCLUDE THE POSITIVE RESOLUTION OF CONTRACTUAL MATTERS, COST RECOVERIES ON SEVERANCE AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS. UNFAVORABLE ITEMS MAY INCLUDE THE ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF CONTRACTUAL MATTERS; RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, EXCEPT FOR SIGNIFICANT SEVERANCE ACTIONS, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS; RESERVES FOR DISPUTES; CERTAIN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS; AND LOSSES ON SALES OF CERTAIN ASSETS.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PROGRAM TO DESIGN, DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT A GROUND-BASED RADAR AT OUR ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS (RMS) BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE PROGRAM HAS EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES FOR WHICH WE HAVE PERIODICALLY ACCRUED RESERVES. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , CUMULATIVE LOSSES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $225 MILLION  ON THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES RELATED TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS CONTRACT AND HAVE TO RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE LOSSES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE SALES AND COSTS TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE HAVE A PROGRAM, EADGE-T, TO DESIGN, INTEGRATE, AND INSTALL AN AIR MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS - INTELLIGENCE (C4I) SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER THAT HAS EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE PERIODICALLY ACCRUED RESERVES AT OUR RMS BUSINESS SEGMENT. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE. AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL CHARGES THAT WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE HAVE TWO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS AT OUR SPACE BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF A MODERNIZED LM 2100 SATELLITE PLATFORM. THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR THE DELIVERY OF THREE SATELLITES IN TOTAL, INCLUDING TWO THAT LAUNCHED IN 2019 AND ONE THAT LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY 2020. WE HAVE PERIODICALLY REVISED OUR ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY  $410 MILLION  FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING, DEVELOPING AND INSTALLING AN UPGRADED TURRET FOR THE WARRIOR CAPABILITY SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM. IN 2018, WE REVISED OUR ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROGRAM AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES, AND RECORDED CHARGES AT OUR MFC BUSINESS SEGMENT. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION ON THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES RELATED TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS CONTRACT AND MAY HAVE TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE LOSSES ALREADY RECORDED AND OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE SALES AND COSTS TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS, INCREASED SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT BY APPROXIMATELY  $465 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  $565 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  AERONAUTICS  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR AERONAUTICS BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS,  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WERE COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT AERONAUTICS\u2019 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUME ON THE F-35 PROGRAM. OPERATING PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-TO-HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS. OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2019 LEVELS.  MISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR MFC BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY HIMARS, GMLRS AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS); AND ABOUT $125 MILLION FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY THAAD AND PAC-3). THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $40 MILLION AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUME ON ENERGY PROGRAMS AND THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019.  MFC\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  DECREASED  $21 MILLION  , OR  5%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS ON INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS (PRIMARILY PAC-3 AND THAAD).

ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $30 MILLION LOWER  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  WE CURRENTLY  EXPECT MFC\u2019S 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT TO LOW-DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE IN 2020 AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUME IN THE TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILES AND AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES AS A RESULT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS. OPERATING PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-TO-HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE IN 2020 AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME. OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN 2019 LEVELS.  ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR RMS BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  $3,746  $3,762  OPERATING PROFIT  376  379  OPERATING MARGIN  10.0%  10.1%  RMS\u2019 NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WERE COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER VOLUME (PRIMARILY COMBAT RESCUE HELICOPTER AND BLACK HAWK PRODUCTION PROGRAMS). THIS DECREASE WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $85 MILLION FOR C6ISR (COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, CYBER, COMBAT SYSTEMS, INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE) PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY UNDERSEA COMBAT SYSTEMS PROGRAMS).  RMS\u2019 OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS DUE TO BETTER COST PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER RISK RETIREMENTS ON INTERNATIONAL MILITARY AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY A $20 MILLION DECREASE FOR IWSS PROGRAMS AS LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES THAT WERE $30 MILLION LOWER ON A GROUND-BASED RADAR PROGRAM. ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $35 MILLION LOWER DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD DURING  2019.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT RMS\u2019 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SIKORSKY. OPERATING PROFIT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND FLEET BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS); AND ABOUT $100 MILLION FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY NEXT GEN OPIR).  SP  ACE\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  DECREASED  $53 MILLION  , OR  16%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS (PRIMARILY ADVANCED EXTREMELY HIGH FREQUENCY (AEHF)); AND ABOUT $35 MILLION DUE TO LOWER EQUITY EARNINGS FROM THE CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT IN UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE (ULA). THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCREASE OF $20 MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS FOR CHARGES RECORDED FOR PERFORMANCE MATTERS IN 2019 NOT REPEATED IN 2020. ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $40 MILLION LOWER  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  TOTAL EQUITY EARNINGS RECOGNIZED BY SPACE (PRIMARILY ULA) REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  $30 MILLION  , OR  11%  OF SPACE\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $65 MILLION  , OR  19%  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT SPACE\u2019S 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS LARGELY DRIVEN BY HYPERSONICS AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITES (NEXT GEN OPIR). OPERATING PROFIT IN 2020 IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY LOWER PROFIT RATE ADJUSTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT SATELLITES AND LOWER EQUITY EARNINGS IN 2020 COMPARED TO 2019. AS A RESULT, OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN IN 2020 IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE FROM 2019 LEVELS.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS  TO DATE, COVID-19 HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE CONTINUED SPREAD OF COVID-19 HAS LED TO DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, COULD IMPACT OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY IN THE FUTURE. FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE USED COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKED BY OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO MANAGE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WAS TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED IN MARCH 2020 AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, AND WHILE THESE MARKETS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN A NORMAL MANNER, DEPENDING ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY, COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, OR IN THE CAPACITY DESIRED. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, WE HAD A CASH BALANCE OF  $2.0 BILLION  AND NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR BORROWINGS IN THE EVENT OF A LACK OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AVAILABILITY. COVID-19 HAS ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR RETURNS ON OUR PENSION ASSETS. AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, CHANGES IN RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS MAY AFFECT OUR PLAN FUNDING, CASH FLOWS AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PLAN ASSET RETURN AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS (7.00% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019) IMPACT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR\u2019S FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) PENSION EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW THE CARES ACT, WHICH, ALONG WITH EARLIER ISSUED IRS GUIDANCE, PROVIDES FOR DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN TAXES. THE CARES ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALSO CONTAINS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH MAY BENEFIT LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE CARES ACT AND ONGOING GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE RELATED TO COVID-19 THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  WE HAVE A BALANCED CASH DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY TO ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE AND POSITION OURSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARISE. CONSISTENT WITH THAT STRATEGY, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SELECTIVE BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS; RETURNED CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES; AND ACTIVELY MANAGED OUR DEBT LEVELS AND MATURITIES, INTEREST RATES, AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS.  WE HAVE GENERATED STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WHICH HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE AND REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS. THE TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS  $2.0 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020.  CURRENTLY, WE EXPECT OUR CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS, IF NEEDED, FOR LIQUIDITY OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT CUSTOMER ADVANCE PAYMENTS AND FOR OTHER TRADE FINANCE PURPOSES SUCH AS GUARANTEEING OUR PERFORMANCE ON PARTICULAR CONTRACTS. SEE OUR \u201cCAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d SECTION BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE KEY ELEMENTS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT BEGINNING OF YEAR  $1,514  $772  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET EARNINGS  1,717  1,704  NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS  343  263  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL  475  (653  )  OTHER, NET  (221  )  349  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  2,314  1,663  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (295  )  (257  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,545  )  (1,187  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  474  219  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  $1,988  $991  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $651 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN CASH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH RELATED TO OTHER OPERATING ASSETS DUE TO MARKET DECLINES THAT REDUCED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT ASSETS. THE  $1.1 BILLION  IMPROVEMENT IN CASH FLOWS RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND INVENTORIES LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES) WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (PRIMARILY AERONAUTICS).  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED  $293 MILLION  AND  $284 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE FOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GENERALLY ARE INCURRED TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. WE ALSO INCUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND GENERAL ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUSIVE OF COSTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OR PURCHASE OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.5 BILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1.2 BILLION  DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WE ALSO MADE NET REPAYMENTS OF $200 MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER.  DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $693 MILLION  (  $2.40  PER SHARE) AND  $638 MILLION  (  $2.20  PER SHARE). IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED  1.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  FOR  $756 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDES $500 MILLION PAID PURSUANT TO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT (ASR); COMPARED TO  1.0 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $284 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED UNDER THE ASR IS BASED ON AN AVERAGE VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OVER THE PLAN PERIOD AND, BASED ON THE AVERAGE VWAP AS OF APRIL 20, 2020, WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES UPON FINAL SETTLEMENT.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.0 BILLION  THAT WAS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO FUND ORDINARY BUSINESS OPERATIONS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE ALSO HAD A $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE CREDIT FACILITY) WITH VARIOUS BANKS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF AUGUST 24, 2024. THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO SERVES AS A BACKUP FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY POINT IN TIME UNDER THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE CREDIT FACILITY CANNOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. WE MAY REQUEST AND THE BANKS MAY GRANT, AT THEIR DISCRETION, AN INCREASE IN THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT  MARCH 29, 2020.  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER CAN FLUCTUATE DAILY AND THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD MAY BE GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT REPORTED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THERE WERE NO COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . WE MAY, AS CONDITIONS WARRANT, CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO MANAGE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, AS DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT, NET OF UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND ISSUANCE COSTS, WAS  $12.7 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  AND MAINLY IS IN THE FORM OF PUBLICLY-ISSUED NOTES THAT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  WE HAD  $1.3 BILLION  OF BORROWINGS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN NOVEMBER 2020 WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR DEBT DUE FROM 2021 TO 2052. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  TO OUR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AS PRESENTED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR  2019  FORM 10\u2010K THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.  ON OCCASION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY SEEK DEFERRED PAYMENT TERMS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY, AT OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S REQUEST, ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NON-RECOURSE SALE OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED AND ARE TREATED AS A SALE OF RECEIVABLES AS WE HAVE NO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT. THE SALE PROCEEDS FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. WE SOLD CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES OF  $146 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  $104 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THERE WERE NO GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES.  OUR TOTAL EQUITY WAS  $3.5 BILLION  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $316 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET EARNINGS OF  $1.7 BILLION  AND AMORTIZATION OF  $110 MILLION  IN PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF  $677 MILLION  AND THE REPURCHASE OF  1.7 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $764 MILLION  , SOME OF WHICH WERE SETTLED SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.  OTHER MATTERS  STATUS OF THE F-35 PROGRAM  THE F-35 PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, SUSTAINMENT ACTIVITIES, AND NEW DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. PRODUCTION OF THE AIRCRAFT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR MANY YEARS GIVEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\u2019S CURRENT INVENTORY OBJECTIVE OF 2,456 AIRCRAFT FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE, U.S. MARINE CORPS, AND U.S. NAVY; COMMITMENTS FROM OUR SEVEN INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES AND FIVE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS; AS WELL AS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  DURING 2019, THE F-35 PROGRAM COMPLETED SEVERAL MILESTONES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TESTING THE AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING SHIP TRIALS, MISSION AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS EVALUATIONS, AND THE F-35 FLEET RECENTLY SURPASSED 250,000 FLIGHT HOURS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, POLAND SIGNED A LETTER OF AGREEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE FOR 32 F-35S. SINCE PROGRAM INCEPTION, WE HAVE DELIVERED 513 PRODUCTION F-35 AIRCRAFT, DEMONSTRATING THE F-35 PROGRAM\u2019S CONTINUED PROGRESS AND LONGEVITY. THE FIRST 513 F-35 AIRCRAFT DELIVERED TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS INCLUDE 364 F-35A VARIANTS, 111 F-35B VARIANTS, AND 38 F-35C VARIANTS. THE FULL-RATE PRODUCTION DECISION, ALSO KNOWN FORMALLY AS MILESTONE C, IS EXPECTED TO BE DELAYED BY THE DOD UNTIL INITIAL OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION (IOT&E) ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLETE IN THE NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR)-LED JOINT SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT (JSE). THE JSE IS USED TO CONDUCT SIMULATED EVALUATIONS OF THE F-35 IN A RANGE OF HIGH-THREAT SCENARIOS. TESTING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020. THE DATA WILL BE UTILIZED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS PART OF THEIR EVALUATION TO TRANSITION THE F-35 PROGRAM FROM LOW RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION (LRIP) INTO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE DELIVERED 22 PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TO OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES, AND WE HAVE 352 PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT IN BACKLOG, INCLUDING ORDERS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES. WE ARE  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MONITORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM. DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL. SEE THE DISCUSSION IN BUSINESS OVERVIEW - COVID-19 AND ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.  ON JULY 17, 2019, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED TURKEY\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE F-35 PROGRAM AND INITIATED THE PROCESS TO FORMALLY REMOVE TURKEY FROM THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF TURKEY ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THE RUSSIAN S-400 AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. TO DATE, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON TURKISH ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE S-400 PROCUREMENT, ALTHOUGH SANCTIONS UNDER THE COUNTERING AMERICA\u2019S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT (CAATSA) REMAIN A RISK.  ADDITIONALLY, SANCTIONS COULD BE IMPOSED AGAINST TURKEY AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING THE \u201cPROMOTING AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND PREVENTING THE RESURGENCE OF ISIS ACT OF 2019\u201d THAT WAS PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE ON DECEMBER 11, 2019.  THE BILL INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT NEW SANCTION PROVISIONS TARGETED AT TURKEY THAT, IF ENACTED, WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT LOCKHEED MARTIN PROGRAMS IN TURKEY. TURKEY COULD IMPLEMENT RETALIATORY SANCTIONS IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IN CONGRESS IN 2020. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ANY SANCTIONS AND OTHER ACTIONS REGARDING TURKEY ON THE F-35 PROGRAM AND ON OUR OTHER PROGRAMS INVOLVING TURKEY. DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF ANY SANCTIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS, THE IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS, OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. TURKEY PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASE UP TO 100 F-35 AIRCRAFT, OF WHICH SIX HAVE COMPLETED PRODUCTION.  TURKISH SUPPLIERS ALSO PRODUCE COMPONENT PARTS FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM, MANY OF WHICH ARE SINGLE-SOURCED. TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS OF DISRUPTION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND ENSURE CONTINUITY OF F-35 PRODUCTION, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DOD AND SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES TO IDENTIFY AND ENGAGE ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS FOR THE COMPONENT PARTS PRODUCED BY TURKISH SUPPLIERS. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD THIS END BUT DUE TO THE PROCEDURE TO QUALIFY NEW PARTS AND SUPPLIERS, THIS COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BETWEEN DOD AND LOCKHEED MARTIN IS ONGOING. WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMELINE FOR THE TRANSITION OF TURKISH SOURCES. WHILE THE TRANSITION TIMELINE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP, IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR REPLACEMENT CAPACITY IS RE-ESTABLISHED SO THAT PRODUCTION IS NOT IMPACTED. EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR RISK BUT FINAL RESOLUTION ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF REMAINING COMPONENTS COULD AFFECT F-35 DELIVERIES, INCLUDING IN 2020, AND ANY ACCELERATED WORK STOPPAGE WOULD IMPACT COST. INTERNATIONAL SALES OF THE F-35 ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PROCESS THAT FORMALLY REMOVED TURKEY FROM THE F-35 PROGRAM IS A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT MATTER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AS IT RELATES TO DELIVERY OF F-35 AIRCRAFT TO TURKEY AND THE EXPORT AND IMPORT OF COMPONENT PARTS FROM THE TURKISH SUPPLY CHAIN.  THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT SANCTIONS ON TURKEY, AND TURKEY\u2019S REMOVAL FROM THE F-35 PROGRAM DO NOT APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, UNFORESEEN ACTIONS COULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF ORDERS, DISRUPT THE PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT, DELAY DELIVERY OF AIRCRAFT, DISRUPT DELIVERY OF SUSTAINMENT COMPONENTS PRODUCED IN TURKEY AND IMPACT FUNDING ON THE F-35 PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE RESULT OF ANY REPROGRAMMING OF FUNDS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF ALTERNATE SOURCES FOR COMPONENT PARTS MADE IN TURKEY. WHILE, IN THE CASE OF THE F-35 PROGRAM, WE EXPECT THAT THESE COSTS ULTIMATELY WOULD BE RECOVERED FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE AVAILABILITY OR TIMING OF ANY RECOVERY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION, INCLUDING THE RISK OF SANCTIONS ON OTHER PROGRAMS INVOLVING SALES TO TURKEY OR WORK WITH TURKISH INDUSTRY, SEE ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS OF OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  GIVEN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE F-35 PROGRAM, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUAL REVIEWS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE, PROGRAM SCHEDULE, COST, AND REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THE DOD, CONGRESSIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES\u2019 OVERSIGHT AND BUDGETING PROCESSES. CURRENT PROGRAM CHALLENGES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SUPPLIER AND PARTNER PERFORMANCE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, LEVEL OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE CYCLE OPERATIONS AND SUSTAINMENT AND WARRANTIES, RECEIVING FUNDING FOR PRODUCTION CONTRACTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, EXECUTING FUTURE FLIGHT TESTS, AND FINDINGS RESULTING FROM TESTING AND OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCLOSED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  2019  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR SIKORSKY REPORTING UNIT INCLUDED GOODWILL OF $2.7 BILLION, AN INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $887 MILLION, AND FINITE-LIVED CUSTOMER PROGRAM INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $2.2 BILLION AS OF MARCH 29, 2020. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET. WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO TEST THE FINITE-LIVED PROGRAM INTANGIBLE ASSET BECAUSE THERE WERE NO INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. AS OF THE DATE OF OUR 2019 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE ESTIMATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SIKORSKY REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE FOR GOODWILL BY A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY 40% AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY 10%.  THE FAIR VALUES AND CARRYING VALUES OF OUR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELY-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET AT OUR SIKORSKY BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED. THEREFORE, ANY BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR TERMINATIONS, OR CHANGES IN EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS COULD CAUSE OUR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS TO DECLINE BELOW CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND COULD CAUSE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED. SIMILARLY, MARKET FACTORS UTILIZED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, INCLUDING LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELY-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT OUR SIKORSKY BUSINESS ARE AT RISK FOR IMPAIRMENT SHOULD THERE BE DETERIORATION OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, ANY BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR TERMINATIONS, OR MARKET PRESSURES COULD CAUSE OUR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS TO DECLINE BELOW OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND COULD CAUSE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO BE IMPAIRED. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS.

THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

OVERVIEW  NEUROMETRIX DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS THAT UTILIZE NON-INVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION AND DIGITAL MEDICINE. OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING HAS BEEN REFINED OVER TWO DECADES OF DESIGNING, BUILDING AND MARKETING MEDICAL DEVICES THAT STIMULATE NERVES AND ANALYZE NERVE RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. WE CREATED THE MARKET FOR POINT-OF-CARE NERVE TESTING AND WERE FIRST TO MARKET WITH SOPHISTICATED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF OF CHRONIC PAIN. OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH IN-HOUSE CAPABILITIES SPANNING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND COMPLIANCE, SALES AND MARKETING, PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE DERIVE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND AFTER-MARKET CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT OVERSEAS MARKETS. THEY ARE CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND REGULATORS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE TWO PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES.  \u2022  POINT-OF-CARE NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  \u2022  WEARABLE NEUROSTIMULATION DEVICES  DIABETES IS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC WITH AN ESTIMATED AFFECTED POPULATION OF OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND ANOTHER 80 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. THE ANNUAL DIRECT COST OF TREATING DIABETES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DANGEROUS ACUTE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES, THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THE DISEASE IS IN ITS LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, NERVE DISEASE AND RESULTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE AMPUTATION, EYE DISEASE LEADING TO BLINDNESS, AND KIDNEY FAILURE. THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM COMPLICATION OF DIABETES, AFFECTING OVER 50% OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION, IS NERVE DISEASE OR NEUROPATHY. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (DPN) IS THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING AMPUTATION. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES HAVE A 15-25% LIFETIME RISK OF FOOT ULCERS AND APPROXIMATELY 15% OF FOOT ULCERS LEAD TO AMPUTATION. FOOT ULCERS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES WITH A TYPICAL COST OF $5,000 TO $50,000 PER EPISODE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 16% AND 26% OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN IN THE FEET AND LOWER LEGS.  EARLY DETECTION OF DPN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS ONCE THE NERVES HAVE DEGENERATED. TODAY\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DPN RANGE FROM A SIMPLE MONOFILAMENT TEST FOR LACK OF SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE FEET TO A NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY PERFORMED BY A SPECIALIST. OUR DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A RAPID, LOW COST, QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE DISEASE, INCLUDING DPN. IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEED AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN SCREENING LARGE POPULATIONS. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES.  12  CHRONIC PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. IT IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AS PAIN LASTING MORE THAN 12 WEEKS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH ACUTE PAIN WHICH IS A NORMAL BODILY RESPONSE TO INJURY OR TRAUMA. CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDE LOW BACK PAIN, ARTHRITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, NEUROPATHIC PAIN, CANCER PAIN AND MANY OTHERS. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BE TRIGGERED BY AN INJURY OR THERE MAY BE AN ONGOING CAUSE SUCH AS DISEASE OR ILLNESS. THERE MAY ALSO BE NO CLEAR CAUSE. PAIN SIGNALS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THESE CAN INCLUDE FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, DECREASED APPETITE, AND MOOD CHANGES WHICH CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY AND DESPAIR. IN GENERAL, CHRONIC PAIN CANNOT BE CURED. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING FUNCTION. THE GOAL IS EFFECTIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT.  CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS OVER 100 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN ON HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVER $250 BILLION PER YEAR AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $300 BILLION PER YEAR. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IS PAIN MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANALGESICS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS, BOTH NON-OPIOID AND OPIOID. THE APPROACH TO TREATMENT IS INDIVIDUALIZED, DRUG COMBINATIONS MAY BE EMPLOYED, AND THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN INADEQUATE. SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION, ARE SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASINGLY, RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. REFLECTING THE COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND THE DIFFICULTY IN TREATING IT, WE BELIEVE THAT INADEQUATE RELIEF LEADS 25% TO 50% OF PAIN SUFFERERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE NUTRACEUTICALS, ACUPUNCTURE, CHIROPRACTIC CARE, NON-PRESCRIPTION ANALGESICS, ELECTRICAL STIMULATORS, BRACES, SLEEVES, PADS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN TOTAL THESE PAIN RELIEF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.  NERVE STIMULATION IS A LONG-ESTABLISHED CATEGORY OF TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC PAIN. THIS TREATMENT APPROACH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION REQUIRING SURGERY WITH ITS ATTENDANT RISKS. NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES INVOLVING TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) HAVE ACHIEVED LIMITED EFFICACY IN PRACTICE DUE TO DEVICE LIMITATIONS, INEFFECTIVE DOSING AND LOW PATIENT ADHERENCE. OUR APP-ENABLED QUELL WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL TENS.  OUR LEADING COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, AND THE FOCUS OF OUR STRATEGIC ATTENTION, ARE DPNCHECK AND QUELL.  DPNCHECK IS OUR WELL-ESTABLISHED TESTING TECHNOLOGY FOR DPN. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN MULTIPLE CLINICAL TRIALS. IT CONTRIBUTES ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND HAS POSTED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES EXCEEDING 25% OVER THE FIVE YEARS THROUGH 2018. GROWTH IN 2019, WHICH IS BELOW TREND, REFLECTS THE OFFSETTING EFFECTS OF STRONG U.S. MARKET DEMAND AND A DOWNTURN IN DEMAND IN MEXICO. WE ENTERED 2020 PREPARED TO SUPPORT A GROWTH REBOUND WITH INCREASED PRODUCT SUPPLY AND USER TRAINING RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON 2020 DPNCHECK REVENUES ARE NOT YET CAPABLE OF A CLEAR ASSESSMENT. WE ARE INVESTING R&D RESOURCES IN THE NEXT GENERATION DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE, IMPROVE MANUFACTURING, AND RESTRICT THE POTENTIAL USE OF NON-COMPLIANT BIOSENSORS. RELEASE OF THE NEW DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY, FORECAST FOR LATE 2020, MAY ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR CUSTOMER UPGRADES, NEW PRICING AND MARGIN-EXPANSION.  QUELL IS OUR APP-ENABLED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE WORKED TO RESTRUCTURE THE QUELL COMMERCIAL MODEL TO ACHIEVE A POSITIVE NET OPERATING CONTRIBUTION AFTER DIRECT COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS WILL POSITION US TO CROSSOVER TO A NET POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION DURING 2020. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER VIA OUR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM,  WWW.QUELLRELIEF.COM.  WHEN WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE SECURED THIS CORE COMMERCIAL MODEL, INCLUDING EFFICIENT AD SPENDING, OUR OBJECTIVE WILL TURN TO GROWTH. THIS COULD ENCOMPASS GREATER AD PROMOTION IN ORDER TO MORE RAPIDLY EXPAND THE QUELL USER POPULATION, AND IT COULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND, POTENTIALLY, OTHER MARKETS.  OUR GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK) COLLABORATION ON QUELL CONTINUES TO BE PRODUCTIVE AS WE SUPPORT GSK\u2019S PROGRESS TOWARD LAUNCH IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS COLLABORATION WAS INITIATED IN EARLY 2018 AND HAS DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY $20.5 MILLION TO US IN DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES PLUS ADDITIONAL CO-FUNDED R&D.  BOTH DPNCHECK AND QUELL ARE SOPHISTICATED NEUROTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS THAT ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR MARKETS. OUR GOAL FOR BOTH PRODUCTS IS THE SAME: TO OPTIMIZE MARKET POSITIONING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT AT A POINT IN THE FUTURE EITHER OF THE PRODUCT LINES COULD BE MONETIZED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY CONSIDER FOLLOWING THE MODEL WE EMPLOYED IN SELLING TO GSK RIGHTS TO THE QUELL TECHNOLOGY FOR MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S.  13  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  AND  2019  REVENUES  QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31  2020  2019  CHANGE% CHANGE  (IN THOUSANDS)  REVENUES  $2,172.0  $3,122.9  $(950.9  )  (30.4  )%  REVENUES INCLUDE SALES FROM QUELL, DPNCHECK AND ADVANCE, OUR LEGACY NEURODIAGNOSTIC PRODUCT.

QUELL REVENUES OF  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECLINED FROM  $1.6 MILLION  , IN THE COMPARABLE  2019  PERIOD REFLECTING REDUCED ADVERTISING SPENDING AND AN EMPHASIS ON THE PROFITABILITY OF QUELL SALES. DPNCHECK REVENUES WERE  $1.3 MILLION  AND  $1.2 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. ADVANCE CONTRIBUTED  $0.3 MILLION  OF REVENUE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2020  AND  2019.

THE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS DUE TO IMPROVED PROFITABILITY OF QUELL SALES AND INCREASED WEIGHTING OF OUR HIGHER MARGIN DPNCHECK BUSINESS WITHIN TOTAL REVENUE.  THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IN 2019 IS DUE IN PART TO A CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN QUELL CLASSIC INVENTORY TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2020  . FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS LARGELY DEPENDS ON REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. A LOW LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST IN QUELL OR DPNCHECK, A DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLES SALES, UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, AND THE CONTINUING EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

DSO WAS REDUCED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 DUE TO INCREASED COLLECTION AND LOWER RECEIVABLES WITH TERMS. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, RECEIVABLES INCLUDED EXTENDED TERMS FOR A LARGE DPNCHECK CUSTOMER THAT HAS SINCE BEEN COLLECTED.  THE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE OF  2.1  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 REFLECTED LOWER QUELL SALES. THE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OF 3.5 INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF A $0.7 MILLION INVENTORY PROVISION RECORDED IN THAT QUARTER. EXCLUDING THIS PROVISION, THE TURNOVER RATE WAS 2.2 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR SOURCES AND USES OF OUR CASH.

WE HAVE REPORTED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  . WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES AND THE CASH TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE PRODUCT SALES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021 AND BEYOND. WE CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY BE CONSUMED MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO (A) DECREASES IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC; (B) THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN PARTS AND MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS WHILE CONTINUING TO STAFF CRITICAL PRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT FUNCTIONS, (C) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE TO THE BUSINESS THAT AFFECT ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES; (D) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY; (E) REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS; (F) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING PLANS; AND (G) OTHER ITEMS AFFECTING OUR FORECASTED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES AND USE OF CASH RESOURCES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCING, COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC COVERING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES FOR SALE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDING WHEN NEEDED OR OTHERWISE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AT PRICES AND ON TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERINGS. PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM S-3, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL SHARES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD, IN AN AMOUNT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, EITHER THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR BY OTHER MEANS, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION, AND THE NEW EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE  16  TO US. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY DELAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION GOALS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  (\u201cASU 2016-02\u201d).

GENERAL  INTRODUCTORY MATTERS  WE PROVIDE OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) IN ADDITION TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO ASSIST READERS IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ORGANIZE THE MD&A AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  OVERVIEW.  DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK, OPERATING RESULTS, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY, FINANCING ACTIVITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE REMAINDER OF MD&A.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPARING THE  2020  QUARTER TO THE  2019  QUARTER.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CASH FLOWS.  24  \u2022  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  . CALCULATION OF NAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cNAREIT FFO\u201d), A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  DESCRIPTIONS OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WHEN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS.  \u2022  NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d)  , CALCULATED AS SET FORTH BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NET OPERATING INCOME.\" NOI IS A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cNAREIT FFO\u201d)  , CALCULATED AS SET FORTH BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS.\u201d NAREIT FFO IS A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  ENDING OCCUPANCY  , CALCULATED AS OCCUPIED SQUARE FOOTAGE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THAT PERIOD, EXCEPT MULTIFAMILY, ON WHICH ENDING OCCUPANCY IS CALCULATED AS OCCUPIED UNITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL AVAILABLE UNITS AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THAT PERIOD.  \u2022  LEASED PERCENTAGE  , CALCULATED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF AVAILABLE PHYSICAL NET RENTABLE AREA LEASED FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND PERCENTAGE OF APARTMENTS LEASED FOR OUR MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES.  \u2022  LEASING ACTIVITY  , INCLUDING NEW LEASES, RENEWALS AND EXPIRATIONS.  FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE CATEGORIZE OUR PROPERTIES AS \u201cSAME-STORE\u201d, \u201cNON-SAME-STORE\u201d OR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SAME-STORE PROPERTIES INCLUDE PROPERTIES THAT WERE OWNED FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE YEARS BEING COMPARED, AND EXCLUDE PROPERTIES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTIES ACQUIRED, SOLD OR CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE DURING THE YEARS BEING COMPARED. WE DEFINE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AS THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PLANNED OR ONGOING MAJOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ON EXISTING OR ACQUIRED LAND PURSUANT TO AN AUTHORIZED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. WE CONSIDER A PROPERTY'S DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE COMPLETE WHEN THE PROPERTY IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE. THE PROPERTY IS CATEGORIZED AS SAME-STORE WHEN IT HAS BEEN READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE YEARS BEING COMPARED. WE DEFINE REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AS THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PLANNED OR ONGOING SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ON EXISTING OR ACQUIRED BUILDINGS PURSUANT TO AN AUTHORIZED PLAN, WHICH HAS AN IMPACT ON CURRENT OPERATING RESULTS, OCCUPANCY AND THE ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE WITH THE INTENDED RESULT OF A HIGHER ECONOMIC RETURN ON THE PROPERTY. WE CATEGORIZE A REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY AS SAME-STORE WHEN REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETE FOR THE MAJORITY OF EACH YEAR BEING COMPARED.  OVERVIEW  OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN THE GREATER WASHINGTON METRO REGION. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE OWNED A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF  46  PROPERTIES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  3.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE AND  6,861  MULTIFAMILY UNITS, AND LAND HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. THESE  46  PROPERTIES CONSISTED OF  16  OFFICE PROPERTIES,  8  RETAIL CENTERS AND  22  MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES.  OUTLOOK  ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED COVID-19, A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS CAUSED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, A PANDEMIC, AND ON MARCH 13, 2020, THE UNITED STATES DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE WASHINGTON METRO REGION TO INSTITUTE QUARANTINES, \"SHELTER IN PLACE\" RULES AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL, THE TYPES OF BUSINESS THAT MAY CONTINUE TO OPERATE, AND/OR THE TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT MAY CONTINUE. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR NORMAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REQUIRING OUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK REMOTELY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESSENTIAL BUILDING PERSONNEL.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (\u201cCARES ACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TO PROVIDE WIDESPREAD EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR THE ECONOMY AND TO PROVIDE AID TO CORPORATIONS. THE CARES ACT INCLUDES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS RELATED TO TAXES, REFUNDABLE PAYROLL TAX CREDITS AND DEFERMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE ELIMINATION OF THE TAXABLE INCOME LIMIT FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES (\u201cNOLS\u201d) FOR ALL TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2021, THEREBY PERMITTING CORPORATE TAXPAYERS TO USE NOLS TO FULLY OFFSET TAXABLE INCOME (ALTHOUGH AS A REIT, WASHREIT WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY BE ABLE TO USE NOLS AGAINST TAXABLE INCOME REMAINING AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY DIVIDENDS-PAID DEDUCTION);  \u2022  THE ABILITY FOR OUR TRSS TO CARRY BACK NOLS ARISING IN 2018, 2019, AND 2020 TO THE FIVE TAXABLE YEARS PRECEDING THE TAXABLE YEAR OF THE LOSS;  25  \u2022  AN INCREASE OF THE BUSINESS INTEREST LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 163(J) OF THE CODE FROM 30 PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT OF ADJUSTABLE TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING IN 2019 AND 2020 AND ADDITION OF AN ELECTION BY TAXPAYERS TO USE THEIR 2019 ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME AS THEIR ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME IN 2020 FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE LIMITATION; AND  \u2022  A \u201cTECHNICAL CORRECTION\u201d AMENDING SECTION 168(E)(3)(E) OF THE CODE TO ADD \u201cQUALIFIED IMPROVEMENT PROPERTY\u201d TO \u201c15-YEAR PROPERTY\u201d AND ASSIGNING A CLASS LIFE OF 20 YEARS UNDER SECTION 168(G)(3)(B) OF THE CODE TO QUALIFIED IMPROVEMENT PROPERTY UNDER SECTION 168(E)(3)(E)(VII) OF THE CODE.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE RELIEF OPTIONS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CARES ACT, AS WELL AS OTHER EMERGENCY RELIEF INITIATIVES AND STIMULUS PACKAGES INSTITUTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A NUMBER OF THE RELIEF OPTIONS CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ABILITY TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND PAY DIVIDENDS, THAT REQUIRE CAREFUL EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THESE OPTIONS, AND ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION OR OTHER RELIEF PACKAGES, INCLUDING THE ACCOMPANYING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.  THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE 2020 QUARTER. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUES, CREDIT LOSSES, AND LEASING ACTIVITY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS AND ABILITY TO PAY RENT. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT RENT DEFERRALS, ABATEMENTS AND CREDIT LOSSES FROM OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2020 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO LEASE UP AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL SPACE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 300,000 SQUARE FEET OF VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACE AND APPROXIMATELY 200,000 SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL LEASE EXPIRATIONS SCHEDULED FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020. A NUMBER OF OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE ANNOUNCED TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF THEIR OFFICES OR STORES AND REQUESTED RENT DEFERRAL OR RENT ABATEMENT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOR OUR MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES, WE EXPECT THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL CAUSE ELEVATED CREDIT LOSSES AND IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE RENTAL RATES. WE ARE TEMPORARILY FREEZING RENTS ON LEASE RENEWALS, WAIVING LATE FEES, HALTING EVICTIONS, AND OFFERING A PAYMENT DEFERRAL PLAN TO RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY FINANCIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19. TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE HAVE INITIATED VARIOUS OPERATIONAL COST SAVING INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO. GIVEN OUR CONCENTRATION IN A SINGLE REGION, THE WASHINGTON METRO REGION, OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO COULD REMAIN SUBJECT TO QUARANTINES, \"SHELTER IN PLACE\" RULES, AND VARIOUS OTHER RESTRICTIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE PART II - ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OPERATING RESULTS  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS, NOI AND NAREIT FFO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS  $1,719  $(4,405  )  $6,124  (139.0  )%  NOI  (1)  48,153  45,291  2,862  6.3%  NAREIT FFO  (2)  $31,439  $33,516  $(2,077  )  (6.2  )%  ______________________________  (1)  SEE PAGE  28  OF THE MD&A FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NOI TO NET INCOME.  (2)  SEE PAGE  35  OF THE MD&A FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NAREIT FFO TO NET INCOME.  THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT (  $8.4 MILLION  ),  HIGHER NOI (  $2.9 MILLION  ), LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE (  $1.7 MILLION  ), LOWER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (  $1.5 MILLION  ) AND A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (  $0.5 MILLION  ) DURING THE 2020 QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (  $6.0 MILLION  ) AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (  $2.7 MILLION  ).  THE HIGHER NOI IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF SEVEN SUBURBAN CLASS B APARTMENT COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND (\u201cASSEMBLY PORTFOLIO\u201d), AND CASCADE AT LANDMARK (  $6.9 MILLION  ) DURING 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF QUANTICO CORPORATE CENTER AND 1776 G STREET ($3.1 MILLION) DURING 2019 AND LOWER NOI FROM SAME-STORE PROPERTIES (  $0.6 MILLION  ). THE LOWER SAME-STORE NOI IS EXPLAINED IN FURTHER DETAIL BEGINNING ON PAGE 28 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2020 QUARTER COMPARED TO 2019 QUARTER). SAME-STORE ENDING OCCUPANCY DECREASED TO  91.6%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  FROM  92.7%  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OCCUPANCY IN THE OFFICE SEGMENT.  26  THE LOWER NAREIT FFO IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NET OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ($8.5 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NOI (  $2.9 MILLION  ), LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE (  $1.7 MILLION  ), LOWER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (  $1.5 MILLION  ), AND GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (  $0.5 MILLION  ) DURING THE 2020 QUARTER.  INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITY  SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS DURING THE 2020 QUARTER INCLUDED THE PREPAYMENT OF THE $45.6 MILLION MORTGAGE NOTE SECURED BY YALE WEST, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN 2052. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF AN UNAMORTIZED MORTGAGE PREMIUM OF $1.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PREPAYMENT PENALTY OF $0.9 MILLION.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , THE INTEREST RATE ON THE $700.0 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) WAS ONE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.00% AND THE FACILITY FEE WAS 0.20%. AS OF  APRIL 23, 2020  , OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS A BORROWING CAPACITY OF  $302.0 MILLION.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING SECTION, WE PREPAID THE MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE SECURED BY YALE WEST. FOLLOWING THIS PREPAYMENT, WE HAVE NO MORTGAGE NOTES.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE 2020 QUARTER, IN APRIL 2020, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY THE $250.0 MILLION 4.95% SENIOR NOTES SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN OCTOBER 2020 USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE HAVE NO REMAINING DEBT MATURITIES IN 2020 AND $150 MILLION OF DEBT MATURITIES IN 2021. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH ON PAGE 31 (LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS).  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  2020  QUARTER AND  2019  QUARTER. THE ABILITY TO COMPARE ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED AND DISPOSITIONS MADE DURING 2019 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE 2020 QUARTER, WE EXPECT THAT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUES, CREDIT LOSSES, AND LEASING ACTIVITY, IN WAYS THAT MAY VARY WIDELY DEPENDING ON THE DURATION AND MAGNITUDE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ENSUING ECONOMIC TURMOIL, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  NET OPERATING INCOME  NOI, DEFINED AS REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUE LESS REAL ESTATE EXPENSES, IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. NOI IS CALCULATED AS NET INCOME, LESS NON-REAL ESTATE REVENUE AND THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (INCLUDING THE GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE, IF ANY), PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, LEASE ORIGINATION EXPENSES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT AND GAIN OR LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT. WE BELIEVE THAT NOI IS USEFUL AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE, WHEN COMPARED ACROSS PERIODS, NOI REFLECTS THE IMPACT ON OPERATIONS OF TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS ON AN UNLEVERAGED BASIS, PROVIDING PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME. NOI EXCLUDES CERTAIN COMPONENTS FROM NET INCOME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RESULTS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO A PROPERTY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INTEREST EXPENSE IS NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A REAL ESTATE ASSET. IN ADDITION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, MAY DISTORT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AT THE PROPERTY LEVEL. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, WE PROVIDE NOI AS A SUPPLEMENT TO NET INCOME, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. NOI DOES NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, IN EITHER CASE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AS SUCH, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO THESE MEASURES AS AN INDICATION OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. A RECONCILIATION OF NOI TO NET INCOME FOLLOWS.  27  2020  QUARTER COMPARED TO  2019  QUARTER  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NOI TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOI IN THE  2020  QUARTER COMPARED TO THE  2019  QUARTER.

DECREASE  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE PROPERTIES CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  30  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL ECONOMIES HAVE WEAKENED AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, ENSURING ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY IS CRITICAL. WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, MANDATORY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND WORKING CAPITAL, TO THE EXTENT NOT FUNDED BY CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF SOME OF OUR TENANTS TO PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME OR AT ALL.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE 2020 QUARTER, ON APRIL 2, 2020, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY OUR $250.0 MILLION OF 4.95% UNSECURED NOTES USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. FOLLOWING THAT PREPAYMENT, WE HAVE NO REMAINING DEBT MATURITIES IN 2020 AND $150 MILLION OF DEBT MATURITIES IN 2021.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE 2020 QUARTER, WE EXECUTED AN AMENDMENT TO JOHN MARSHALL II PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT DECREASING THE CONTRACT SALE PRICE TO  $57.0 MILLION  AND CLOSED ON THE SALE ON APRIL 21, 2020.  AS OF APRIL 23, 2020, WE HAVE $398.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, LEAVING $302.0 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY. IN APRIL, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO COMMITMENT LETTERS WITH MEMBERS OF OUR BANK GROUP TO PROVIDE AN UNSECURED TERM LOAN IN A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $150.0 MILLION. THE TERM LOAN, SUBJECT TO EXECUTION OF FINAL DOCUMENTATION, WOULD INCREASE OUR OVERALL BORROWING CAPACITY TO $452.0 MILLION.  DUE TO OUR REMAINING BORROWING CAPACITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY DEBT MATURITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MAJOR CAPITAL NEEDS AND COMMITMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE EQUITY, DEBT AND CREDIT MARKETS. WE WOULD ONLY ACCESS THOSE MARKETS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CONDITIONS MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO SO. HOWEVER, DISRUPTIONS IN THESE MARKETS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. THESE EVENTS MAY ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SECURITIES OR THROUGH PRIVATE FINANCINGS, AND MAY REQUIRE US TO ADJUST OUR PLANNED EXPENDITURES FOR THE YEAR ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AGENCY DEBT, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC SECURED LOANS, USING A PART OF OUR UNENCUMBERED MULTIFAMILY PORTFOLIO, IF NECESSARY. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT SUCH LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR THAT THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR ESTIMATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES WE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. WE HAVE REDUCED 2020 ASSUMED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION, INCLUDING BY DEFERRING NON-ESSENTIAL BUILDING RESTORATIONS, SOME TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS FOR SPECULATIVE LEASING, AND LOWER MULTIFAMILY RENOVATION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AS WELL DECREASING OUR ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENT SPENDING AS WE NO LONGER EXPECT TO BREAK GROUND ON THE NEW RIVERSIDE DEVELOPMENT THIS YEAR. AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  , OUR FULL-YEAR  2020  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  FUNDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS;  \u2022  APPROXIMATELY $55.0 - $60.0 MILLION TO INVEST IN OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF OPERATING ASSETS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $20.0 - $25.0 MILLION TO FUND TENANT-RELATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS;  \u2022  APPROXIMATELY $30.0 - $35.0 MILLION TO INVEST IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; AND  \u2022  FUNDING FOR POTENTIAL PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS DURING 2020, OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM POTENTIAL PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEBT FINANCING  WE GENERALLY USE SECURED OR UNSECURED, CORPORATE-LEVEL DEBT, INCLUDING UNSECURED NOTES, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BANK TERM LOANS AND MORTGAGES, TO MEET OUR BORROWING NEEDS. LONG-TERM, WE GENERALLY USE FIXED RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN ORDER TO MATCH THE RETURNS FROM OUR REAL ESTATE ASSETS. IF WE ISSUE UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD SEEK TO \u201cLADDER\u201d THE MATURITIES OF OUR DEBT TO MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE YEAR. WE ALSO UTILIZE VARIABLE RATE DEBT FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCING PURPOSES. AT TIMES, OUR MIX OF VARIABLE AND FIXED RATE DEBT MAY NOT SUIT OUR NEEDS. AT THOSE TIMES, WE MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAPS, FORWARD INTEREST RATE OPTIONS OR INTEREST RATE OPTIONS IN ORDER TO ASSIST US IN MANAGING OUR DEBT MIX. WE MAY HEDGE OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT TO GIVE IT AN EFFECTIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE AND HEDGE FIXED RATE DEBT TO GIVE IT AN EFFECTIVE VARIABLE INTEREST RATE.  31  IN JANUARY 2020, WE PREPAID THE $45.6 MILLION MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE SECURED BY YALE WEST, RECOGNIZING A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.5 MILLION USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

(4)  MATURITY DATE FOR CREDIT FACILITY IN MARCH 2023 ASSUMES ELECTION OF OPTION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL 6-MONTH PERIODS.  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY FOR OUR DEBT IS  2.3  YEARS. IF PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS DUE AT MATURITY CANNOT BE REFINANCED, EXTENDED OR PAID WITH PROCEEDS OF OTHER CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS NEW EQUITY CAPITAL, OUR CASH FLOW MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPAY ALL MATURING DEBT. PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF A REFINANCING, SUCH AS POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE OF LENDERS TO MAKE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, MAY RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE OR INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR OBLIGATIONS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY SEEK TO REPURCHASE AND CANCEL OUR OUTSTANDING UNSECURED NOTES AND TERM LOANS THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED MAY BE MATERIAL.  32  DEBT COVENANTS  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS WITH WHICH WE MUST COMPLY. SOME OF THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL ASSET VALUE OF NOT MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 (SUBJECT TO A HIGHER LEVEL FOLLOWING MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS);  \u2022  RATIO OF ADJUSTED EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, ACQUISITION COSTS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES) TO FIXED CHARGES OF NOT LESS THAN 1.50 TO 1.00;  \u2022  RATIO OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSET VALUE OF NOT MORE THAN 0.40 TO 1.00;  \u2022  RATIO OF ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FROM UNENCUMBERED PROPERTIES SATISFYING CERTAIN CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF NOT LESS THAN 1.75 TO 1.00; AND  \u2022  RATIO OF UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE UNENCUMBERED POOL VALUE OF PROPERTIES SATISFYING CERTAIN CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN, AND VALUED PER THE TERMS OF, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OF NOT MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 (SUBJECT TO A HIGHER LEVEL FOLLOWING MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS).  OUR UNSECURED NOTES CONTAIN COVENANTS WITH WHICH WE MUST COMPLY, INCLUDING.  \u2022  A MAXIMUM RATIO OF 65.0% OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSETS;  \u2022  A MAXIMUM RATIO OF 40.0% OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSETS;  \u2022  A MINIMUM RATIO OF 1.50 OF OUR INCOME AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS TO REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS; AND  \u2022  A MINIMUM RATIO OF 1.50 OF TOTAL UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TO TOTAL UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE COVENANTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, UNSECURED NOTES OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS. THIS COULD CAUSE OUR LENDERS TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND COULD THEREFORE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR INCUR OTHER UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FUTURE COULD BE RESTRICTED BY THE DEBT COVENANTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS RELATED TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND UNSECURED NOTES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RATIOS AND COVENANTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, BUT NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RATIOS AND OTHER DEBT COVENANTS, PARTICULARLY IF CONDITIONS WORSEN.  COMMON EQUITY  WE HAVE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE  100.0 MILLION  COMMON SHARES, OF WHICH  82.3 MILLION  SHARES WERE OUTSTANDING AT  MARCH 31, 2020.  ON MAY 4, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO EIGHT SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cEQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS\u201d) WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, BNY MELLON CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., GOLDMAN SACHS & CO.

ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON SHARES ARE MADE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF ISSUANCE. WE MAY USE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES UNDER THIS PROGRAM FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WORKING CAPITAL, THE ACQUISITION, RENOVATION, EXPANSION, IMPROVEMENT, DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT OF INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES OR THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. DURING THE  2020 QUARTER  , WE ISSUED  46,500  COMMON SHARES AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF  $31.07  FOR NET PROCEEDS OF  $1.2 MILLION  . WE DID NOT ISSUE SHARES UNDER THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS DURING THE 2019 QUARTER.  WE HAVE A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PROGRAM, WHEREBY SHAREHOLDERS MAY USE THEIR DIVIDENDS AND OPTIONAL CASH PAYMENTS TO PURCHASE COMMON SHARES. THE COMMON SHARES SOLD UNDER THIS PROGRAM MAY EITHER BE COMMON SHARES ISSUED BY US OR COMMON SHARES PURCHASED IN THE OPEN MARKET.  33  OUR ISSUANCES AND NET PROCEEDS ON THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR THE 2020 QUARTER AND 2019 QUARTER WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , NO PREFERRED SHARES WERE ISSUED OR OUTSTANDING.  HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR DIVIDEND AT ITS CURRENT RATE.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.  34  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  NAREIT FFO IS A WIDELY USED MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. WE PROVIDE NAREIT FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ALTHOUGH NAREIT FFO IS A WIDELY USED MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REITS, NAREIT FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AS SUCH, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME AS AN INDICATION OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, NAREIT FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT CASH AVAILABLE TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  NAREIT FFO IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, INC. (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) IN ITS NAREIT FFO WHITE PAPER - 2018 RESTATEMENT AS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF PROPERTIES; IMPAIRMENTS OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE, AND REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. WE CONSIDER NAREIT FFO TO BE A STANDARD SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE FOR EQUITY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS) BECAUSE IT FACILITATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH HISTORICALLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE INSTEAD HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT NAREIT FFO MORE ACCURATELY PROVIDES INVESTORS AN INDICATION OF OUR ABILITY TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FUND OTHER NEEDS. OUR NAREIT FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER REITS. THESE OTHER REITS MAY NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION OR MAY INTERPRET THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CALCULATION OF OUR NAREIT FFO AND A RECONCILIATION OF NAREIT FFO TO NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2020  AND  2019  (IN THOUSANDS).

PERCENTAGE CHANGES ARE BASED ON UNROUNDED AMOUNTS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE OUTLINED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K.  TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING  WE OFFER SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING INCLUDES SALES INCENTIVES, DISCOUNTS, ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE. A NUMBER OF OUR SALES INCENTIVES, SUCH AS BOTTLER FUNDING TO INDEPENDENT BOTTLERS AND CUSTOMER VOLUME REBATES, ARE BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ESTABLISHED DURING THE YEAR, AS PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, FOR THE EXPECTED PAYOUT, WHICH MAY OCCUR AFTER YEAR-END ONCE RECONCILED AND SETTLED.  THESE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS AND OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESTIMATED EXPENSE AND ACTUAL INCENTIVE COSTS ARE NORMALLY INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS ARE ALSO BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS AND RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR AS INCURRED.  FOR INTERIM REPORTING, OUR POLICY IS TO ALLOCATE OUR FORECASTED FULL-YEAR SALES INCENTIVES FOR MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS TO EACH OF OUR INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS IN THE SAME YEAR THAT BENEFITS FROM THE PROGRAMS. THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED SALES INCENTIVES FOR THE FULL YEAR AND THE PROPORTION OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD\u2019S ACTUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE, TO OUR FORECASTED ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE FORECASTS AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND THE RELATED ALLOCATION OF SALES INCENTIVES ARE RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, WE APPLY A SIMILAR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR INTERIM REPORTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  INCOME TAXES  IN DETERMINING OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, WE USE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTED ANNUAL INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENTS, AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS. SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION, DERECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN IN A PREVIOUS PERIOD ARE SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  COVID-19  OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. COVID-19 HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE TO ALMOST ALL OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. AUTHORITIES IN MANY OF THESE MARKETS HAVE IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS MEASURES TO STALL THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, INCLUDING TRAVEL BANS AND RESTRICTIONS, QUARANTINES, CURFEWS, SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS, AND BUSINESS SHUTDOWNS. THESE MEASURES HAVE IMPACTED AND WILL FURTHER IMPACT US, OUR CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING OUR FOODSERVICE CUSTOMERS), CONSUMERS, EMPLOYEES, BOTTLERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW THESE MEASURES AND FUTURE MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING WHETHER THEY WILL RESULT IN FURTHER CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, FURTHER INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS (WHETHER AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OR INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE COSTS OR OTHERWISE), HOW THEY WILL FURTHER IMPACT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND WHETHER THEY WILL RESULT IN FURTHER REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF AIR OR OTHER COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT, PORT CLOSURES OR BORDER RESTRICTIONS, EACH OR ALL OF WHICH CAN IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MEASURES THAT IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OUR OFFICES, PLANTS, WAREHOUSES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR OTHER FACILITIES, OR THAT IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING OUR FOODSERVICE CUSTOMERS),  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSUMERS, EMPLOYEES, BOTTLERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DO THE SAME, MAY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR AND THEIR EMPLOYEES, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR JOB FUNCTIONS REMOTELY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SAFETY PROTOCOLS AT OUR FACILITIES AND HAVE BEEN WORKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS ON CONTINGENCY PLANNING IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS OR SUPPLY CHAIN, ALTHOUGH WE CAN REASONABLY ENVISION THAT POSSIBILITY.  PUBLIC CONCERN REGARDING THE RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID-19 IMPACTS DEMAND FROM CONSUMERS, INCLUDING DUE TO CONSUMERS NOT LEAVING THEIR HOMES OR OTHERWISE SHOPPING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE OR BECAUSE SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS HAVE LOWER DISCRETIONARY INCOME DUE TO UNEMPLOYMENT OR REDUCED OR LIMITED WORK AS A RESULT OF MEASURES TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AS WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS VARIES BY JURISDICTION AND CHANGES IN DEMAND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 WILL VARY IN SCOPE AND TIMING ACROSS THESE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PURCHASING AND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY INCREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN ONE QUARTER, RESULTING IN DECREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS, OR IN ONE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY REDUCED PROFIT FROM SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO DATE, WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN PRODUCT AND CHANNEL PREFERENCES, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN AT-HOME CONSUMPTION AND A DECREASE IN IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION AND AWAY-FROM-HOME CHANNELS, SUCH AS CONVENIENCE AND GAS AND FOODSERVICE, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESSES. ANY REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR CHANGE IN CONSUMER PURCHASING AND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, AS WELL AS CONTINUED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 AND BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTING IN AN INABILITY TO PAY FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED OR CANCELED ORDERS OF OUR PRODUCTS, CLOSING OF RESTAURANTS, STORES, ENTERTAINMENT OR SPORTS COMPLEXES OR OTHER VENUES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, OR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 INABILITY TO SUPPLY US WITH INGREDIENTS OR OTHER ITEMS NECESSARY FOR US TO MAKE, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE OR SELL OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 OR BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY ALSO RESULT IN OUR RECORDING ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR OUR INABILITY TO RECOVER OR COLLECT ANY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OWNED OR LEASED ASSETS, INCLUDING CERTAIN FOODSERVICE AND VENDING AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, OR PREPAID EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WHICH CAN IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  WHILE WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS, BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON NUMEROUS EVOLVING FACTORS THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND WHICH ALL WILL VARY BY MARKET, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND SCOPE OF THE PANDEMIC, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN, OR MAY BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE, IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE MORE THAN JUST TEMPORARY.  CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF OUR FIRST QUARTER,  THE CARES ACT  WAS ENACTED ON MARCH 27, 2020 IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CARES ACT AND RELATED NOTICES INCLUDE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING DELAYING CERTAIN PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS, MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE TCJ ACT, AND ESTIMATED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS THAT WE EXPECT TO DEFER TO FUTURE PERIODS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE CARES ACT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, OR ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE CARES ACT AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  REFER TO THE COVID-19 DISCUSSION ABOVE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  IN THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY AND FEBRUARY  . IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES GENERATED  35%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, WITH MEXICO, CANADA, RUSSIA, CHINA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND BRAZIL COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE HAD A NET NOMINAL IMPACT ON NET REVENUE GROWTH PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE BRAZILIAN REAL AND EURO, OFFSET BY APPRECIATION IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY AND CURRENCY CONTROLS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE EUROPE SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.

IMPOSITION OF TAXES AND REGULATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING, ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES OR FACILITATE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROCESS OR RESTRICT THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN PACKAGING.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RELATED PROVISIONAL MEASUREMENT PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE  SEC ENDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT  WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE, ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND \u201cOUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K.  OTHER TAX MATTERS  ON MAY 19, 2019, A PUBLIC REFERENDUM HELD IN SWITZERLAND PASSED THE  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020.  THERE WERE NO INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 RELATED TO THE TRAF.  ENACTMENT OF ADDITIONAL TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO MARCH 21, 2020 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THE TRAF CANNOT CURRENTLY BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED; WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE TRAF MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  RETAIL LANDSCAPE  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND SEEK TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE AND DIGITAL CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CONSOLIDATED REVIEW  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  VOLUME  VOLUME IS ONE OF THE KEY METRICS MANAGEMENT USES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN AND THE EVALUATION OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE VOLUME PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND UNDERLYING TRENDS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT MEASURES DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AT THE CONSUMER LEVEL.

OUR DIVISIONS\u2019 PHYSICAL VOLUME MEASURES ARE CONVERTED INTO SERVINGS BASED ON U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-SERVING SIZES OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTS. THE FDA REVISED THE GUIDELINES ON RECOMMENDED SERVING SIZE FOR BEVERAGE PRODUCTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. PREVIOUSLY, FDA GUIDELINES RECOMMENDED A SERVING SIZE OF 8 FLUID OUNCES FOR ALL BEVERAGES. THE REVISED GUIDELINES RECOMMEND A SERVING SIZE OF 8 FLUID OUNCES FOR BEVERAGES THAT CONSIST OF MILK, FRUIT JUICES, NECTARS AND FRUIT DRINKS AND 12 FLUID OUNCES FOR OTHER BEVERAGES. NO CHANGES WERE RECOMMENDED TO THE SERVING SIZE OF FOOD PRODUCTS.

THIS ESTIMATE OF THE COVID-19 IMPACT TO REPORTED NET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR INTERNAL ANALYSIS OF EXPECTED REVENUE PERFORMANCE AS REFLECTED IN OUR INTERNAL RECORDS BEFORE AND AFTER WHEN WE BELIEVE, BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US, THE PRIMARY MARKETS IN EACH SEGMENT APPEAR TO HAVE EXPERIENCED CHANGES IN CONSUMER PATTERNS IN RESPONSE TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED  4%  AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED  1.7  PERCENTAGE POINTS. OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 10-PERCENTAGE-POINT IMPACT OF AN UNFAVORABLE MARK-TO-MARKET NET IMPACT ON COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FUEL-RELATED DERIVATIVES, INCLUDED IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d). NET REVENUE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CERTAIN OPERATING COST INCREASES AND HIGHER ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CHARGES TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH COVID-19 NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE BY 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PLANS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.

IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.

FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USED BY US PRIMARILY FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES SINCE WE HAVE CERTAIN NON-DISCRETIONARY OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTED FROM THE MEASURE.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT ARE MARKED TO MARKET EACH PERIOD WITH THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES AS EITHER COST OF SALES OR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, DEPENDING ON THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY. THESE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REFLECTED IN DIVISION RESULTS WHEN THE DIVISIONS RECOGNIZE THE COST OF THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY IN OPERATING PROFIT.  THEREFORE, THE DIVISIONS REALIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY RESULTING MARK-TO-MARKET VOLATILITY, WHICH REMAINS IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  2019 MULTI-YEAR PRODUCTIVITY PLAN  IN CONNECTION WITH OUR 2019 PRODUCTIVITY PLAN, WE EXPECT TO INCUR PRE-TAX CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION, OF WHICH WE HAVE INCURRED  $546 MILLION  PLAN TO DATE THROUGH  MARCH 21, 2020  AND CASH EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION, OF WHICH WE HAVE INCURRED APPROXIMATELY  $321 MILLION  PLAN TO DATE THROUGH  MARCH 21, 2020  . WE EXPECT TO INCUR PRE-TAX CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION AND CASH EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2020  , WITH THE BALANCE TO BE REFLECTED IN OUR 2021 THROUGH 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE CHARGES WILL BE FUNDED PRIMARILY THROUGH CASH FROM OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR THE MAJORITY OF THE REMAINING PRE-TAX CHARGES AND CASH EXPENDITURES IN OUR 2020 AND 2021 RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 3 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO OUR 2019 PRODUCTIVITY PLAN.  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES BEYOND THE PRODUCTIVITY PLAN AND OTHER INITIATIVES DISCUSSED ABOVE AND IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES  IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  ,  WE RECORDED MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES OF  $25 MILLION  ($22 MILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.02  PER SHARE), INCLUDING  $23 MILLION  IN OUR FLNA SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF BFY BRANDS AND  $2 MILLION  IN OUR AMESA SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF PIONEER FOODS. THESE CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATE TO CONTRACT TERMINATION AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS.  IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 23, 2019, WE RECORDED INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES OF  $15 MILLION  (  $0.01  PER SHARE) IN OUR EUROPE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACQUIRED INVENTORY INCLUDED IN SODASTREAM\u2019S BALANCE SHEET AT ACQUISITION DATE.  NET TAX RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE RECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $29 MILLION ($0.02 PER SHARE) IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 23, 2019  RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH GENERATING CAPABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, TOGETHER WITH OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, BRIDGE LOAN FACILITIES, WORKING CAPITAL LINES AND OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS OF DEBT FINANCING, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT FINANCING, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING NEEDS. OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS OUR ANTICIPATED SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS AND THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY UNDER THE TCJ ACT, INCLUDE CASH FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS OBTAINED FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BRIDGE LOAN FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OUR SOURCES AND USES OF CASH WERE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 AND, TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY MATERIAL LIQUIDITY DEFICIENCIES AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT COVID-19 MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. SEE \u201cITEM 1A.

THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS. AS OF  MARCH 21, 2020  , OUR MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY WAS $3.3 BILLION, WHICH MUST BE PAID THROUGH 2026 UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJ ACT. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TCJ ACT.  THE CARES ACT WAS ENACTED DURING OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND INCLUDES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING DELAYING CERTAIN PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS, MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE TCJ ACT, AND ESTIMATED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS THAT WE EXPECT TO DEFER TO FUTURE PERIODS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THIS LEGISLATION TO HAVE A MATERIAL DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE CARES ACT AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.7 BILLION  , COMPARED TO NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $0.3 BILLION  IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE OPERATING CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS UNFAVORABLE WORKING CAPITAL COMPARISONS TO 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.9 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING NET CAPITAL SPENDING OF $0.5 BILLION AND ACQUISITIONS OF $0.5 BILLION.  IN LIGHT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING OUR PLANS WITH RESPECT TO NET CAPITAL SPENDING.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.5 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $6.4 BILLION AND NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $3.0 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RETURN OF OPERATING CASH FLOW TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $1.9 BILLION.  WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE 2018 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM PROVIDING FOR THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $15.0 BILLION OF PEPSICO COMMON STOCK WHICH COMMENCED ON JULY 1, 2018 AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE 30, 2021. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED A 7% INCREASE IN OUR ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND TO $4.09 PER SHARE FROM $3.82 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN JUNE  2020  . WE EXPECT TO RETURN A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN  2020  THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION AND DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION.

ANY DOWNGRADE OF OUR CREDIT RATINGS BY A CREDIT RATING AGENCY, ESPECIALLY ANY DOWNGRADE TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, WHETHER OR NOT AS A RESULT OF OUR ACTIONS OR FACTORS WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, COULD INCREASE OUR FUTURE BORROWING COSTS AND IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. IN ADDITION, ANY DOWNGRADE OF OUR CURRENT SHORT-TERM CREDIT RATINGS COULD IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WITH THE SAME FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY, AND THEREFORE REQUIRE US TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ON MORE EXPENSIVE TYPES OF DEBT FINANCING.

RESULTS OF REVIEW OF INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION  WE HAVE REVIEWED THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF PEPSICO, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF  MARCH 21, 2020  , THE RELATED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CASH FLOWS AND EQUITY FOR THE 12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  AND  MARCH 23, 2019  , AND THE RELATED NOTES (COLLECTIVELY, THE CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION). BASED ON OUR REVIEWS, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY MATERIAL MODIFICATIONS THAT SHOULD BE MADE TO THE CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR IT TO BE IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES) (PCAOB), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE COMPANY AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CASH FLOWS AND EQUITY FOR THE YEAR THEN ENDED (NOT PRESENTED HEREIN); AND IN OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 13, 2020, WE EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN OUR OPINION, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FROM WHICH IT HAS BEEN DERIVED.  BASIS FOR REVIEW RESULTS  THIS CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT. WE ARE A PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM REGISTERED WITH THE PCAOB AND ARE REQUIRED TO BE INDEPENDENT WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS AND THE APPLICABLE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE PCAOB.  WE CONDUCTED OUR REVIEWS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PCAOB. A REVIEW OF CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION CONSISTS PRINCIPALLY OF APPLYING ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES AND MAKING INQUIRIES OF PERSONS RESPONSIBLE FOR FINANCIAL AND ACCOUNTING MATTERS. IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY LESS IN SCOPE THAN AN AUDIT CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PCAOB, THE OBJECTIVE OF WHICH IS THE EXPRESSION OF AN OPINION REGARDING THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE. ACCORDINGLY, WE DO NOT EXPRESS SUCH AN OPINION.  /S/ KPMG LLP  NEW YORK, NEW YORK  APRIL 28, 2020  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "PEPSICO INC", "CIK": 77476, "Date": "2020-04-28T00:00:00", "Ticker": "PEP", "Name": "Pepsico Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 2080.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "NC", "IRS": 131584302.0, "key": "20200428PEP", "labelr1": -2.1713615023474033, "labelr2": -0.8023395320935975, "labelr3": -1.62521732557261, "labelr4": 0.5993545412632558, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.4918159000000001, "prof1": 0.5081840999999999, "return1&2": 0.97043720657277, "return1&2&3": 0.9546654929577464, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9603873239436618, "return2": 0.9919766046790641, "return1": 0.9782863849765259, "return3": 0.983747826744274, "return4": 1.0059935454126323, "1_day_return": -2.171361502347402, "cumulative_return1": 0.01497886976739759, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3880, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0297834910867103, "cumreturn1b": 1.336759375719515, "cumreturn1c": 1.2164198068859986, "cumreturndow": 1.1898441651487552, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1762049269789048}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3905, "level_0": 4015, "index": 80834, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, AND THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A PROVIDER OF RADIO-FREQUENCY, OR RF, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG, AND MIXED-SIGNAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS-ON-CHIP SOLUTIONS FOR THE CONNECTED HOME, WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET APPLICATIONS. WE ARE A FABLESS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS INTEGRATE ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF A BROADBAND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.  IN MOST CASES, THESE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED ON A SINGLE SILICON-DIE, USING STANDARD DIGITAL CMOS PROCESSES AND CONVENTIONAL PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES. WE BELIEVE THIS ENABLES OUR SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE SUPERIOR POWER, PERFORMANCE, AND COST ADVANTAGES RELATIVE TO OUR INDUSTRY COMPETITION.  OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE ELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTORS, MODULE MAKERS, ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS (ODMS), WHO INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES.  EXAMPLES OF SUCH END MARKET ELECTRONIC DEVICES INCORPORATING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CABLE DOCSIS BROADBAND MODEMS AND GATEWAYS; WIRELINE CONNECTIVITY DEVICES FOR IN-HOME NETWORKING APPLICATIONS; RF TRANSCEIVERS AND MODEMS FOR WIRELESS CARRIER ACCESS AND BACKHAUL INFRASTRUCTURE; FIBER-OPTIC MODULES FOR DATA CENTER, METRO, AND LONG-HAUL TRANSPORT NETWORKS; VIDEO SET-TOP BOXES AND GATEWAYS; HYBRID ANALOG AND DIGITAL TELEVISIONS, DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE OUTDOOR AND INDOOR UNITS; AND POWER MANAGEMENT AND INTERFACE PRODUCTS USED IN THESE AND A RANGE OF OTHER MARKETS.  WE COMBINE OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE RF AND MIXED-SIGNAL SEMICONDUCTOR DESIGN SKILLS WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG, AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE HIGHLY INTEGRATED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PLATFORM-LEVEL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED USING A RANGE OF SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, INCLUDING LOW-COST COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR, OR CMOS, PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, SILICON GERMANIUM, GALLIUM ARSENIDE, BICMOS AND INDIUM PHOSPHIDE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DESIGN ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUITS IN CMOS ALLOWS US TO EFFICIENTLY COMBINE ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SAME INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. AS A RESULT, OUR SOLUTIONS HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION AND PERFORMANCE, SMALL SILICON DIE SIZE, AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION. MOREOVER, WE ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO OFFER CUSTOMERS A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY CMOS-BASED RADIO SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES THAT PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF SUPERIOR RF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, ALONG WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG INTERFACE AND POWER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE SHORTER DESIGN CYCLES, SIGNIFICANT DESIGN FLEXIBILITY, AND LOW SYSTEM COST ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS, WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND MULTIMARKET APPLICATIONS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, REVENUES WERE $62.0 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2019 AND IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, OUR NET REVENUE WAS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF RF RECEIVERS AND RF RECEIVER SYSTEMS-ON-CHIP AND CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS INTO BROADBAND OPERATOR VOICE AND DATA MODEMS AND GATEWAYS AND CONNECTIVITY ADAPTERS, GLOBAL ANALOG AND DIGITAL RF RECEIVER PRODUCTS, RADIO AND MODEM SOLUTIONS INTO WIRELESS CARRIER ACCESS AND BACKHAUL INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS, HIGH-SPEED OPTICAL INTERCONNECT SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO OPTICAL MODULES FOR DATA-CENTER, METRO AND LONG-HAUL NETWORKS, AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE INTERFACE AND POWER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INTO A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNICATIONS, INDUSTRIAL, AUTOMOTIVE AND MULTI-MARKET APPLICATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ON OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER PENETRATE EXISTING MARKETS; OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR TARGET ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BY DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT TRADE POLICIES; AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DESIGN WINS WITH DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, IN PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS OF SET-TOP BOXES, DATA MODEMS, AND GATEWAYS FOR THE BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER, STORAGE NETWORKING MARKET, CABLE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET, INDUSTRIAL AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, AND OPTICAL MODULE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS.  PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO ASIA ACCOUNTED FOR 84% AND 85% OF NET REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING 50% FROM PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO HONG KONG DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 45% FROM PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO HONG KONG AND 22% TO MAINLAND CHINA DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS SHIPPED TO ASIA, WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE SYSTEMS DESIGNED BY THESE CUSTOMERS AND INCORPORATING OUR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS ARE THEN SOLD OUTSIDE ASIA. FOR EXAMPLE, REVENUE GENERATED FROM SALES OF OUR CABLE MODEM PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019 RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO SALES TO ASIAN ODMS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS DELIVERING PRODUCTS INTO EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS. TO DATE, ALL OF OUR SALES HAVE BEEN DENOMINATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET REVENUE HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN GENERATED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. SALES TO CUSTOMERS COMPRISE BOTH DIRECT SALES TO CUSTOMERS AND INDIRECT SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 18% OF OUR NET REVENUE AND ONE OF OUR DIRECT CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OF OUR NET REVENUE, AND OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR 68% OF OUR NET REVENUE, OF WHICH DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 48% OF OUR NET REVENUE. FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, WE SELL MULTIPLE PRODUCTS INTO DISPARATE END USER APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CABLE MODEMS, SATELLITE SET-TOP BOXES AND BROADBAND GATEWAYS.  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON WINNING COMPETITIVE BID SELECTION PROCESSES, KNOWN AS DESIGN WINS, TO DEVELOP SEMICONDUCTORS FOR USE IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS. THESE SELECTION PROCESSES ARE TYPICALLY LENGTHY, AND AS A RESULT, OUR SALES CYCLES WILL VARY BASED ON THE SPECIFIC MARKET SERVED, WHETHER THE DESIGN WIN IS WITH AN EXISTING OR A NEW CUSTOMER AND WHETHER OUR PRODUCT BEING DESIGNED IN OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S DEVICE IS A FIRST GENERATION OR SUBSEQUENT GENERATION PRODUCT. OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS CAN BE COMPLEX AND, IF OUR ENGAGEMENT RESULTS IN A DESIGN WIN, CAN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME TO DEFINE, DESIGN AND RESULT IN VOLUME PRODUCTION. BECAUSE THE SALES CYCLE FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS LONG, WE CAN INCUR SIGNIFICANT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE DO NOT ULTIMATELY RECOGNIZE ANY REVENUE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ALL OF WHOM PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS ON A PURCHASE ORDER BASIS. ONCE ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\u2019S DESIGN, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRODUCT IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING THE PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE CHIP. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES IN OUR TARGET MARKETS WILL VARY BY APPLICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CABLE OPERATOR MODEM AND GATEWAY SECTORS, A DESIGN-IN CAN HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 24 TO 48 MONTHS. IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS, A DESIGN-IN CAN HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 24 TO 60 MONTHS AND BEYOND.  IMPACT OF COVID-19  IN LATE JANUARY 2020 AND EARLY FEBRUARY 2020, IN RESPONSE TO A SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, OR COVID-19, THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA INSTITUTED MANDATORY QUARANTINES IN WUHAN, CHINA, EXTENDED LUNAR NEW YEAR HOLIDAY CLOSURES, AND RESTRICTED SHIPMENTS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THIS RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY DELAY IN OUR PRODUCT SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC REGARDING COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS REACHED ALL OF THE COUNTRIES AND STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS AND CENTRAL ENGINEERING TEAM ARE LOCATED, AS WELL AS SPAIN, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, CANADA, FRANCE, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA, WHERE ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING, SALES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL ARE LOCATED.  IN MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO INSTITUTED STAY-AT-HOME OR SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDERS. TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WE ADOPTED SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICIES INCLUDING SUSPENDING EMPLOYEE TRAVEL AND IMPLEMENTING REMOTE WORK ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE WORLDWIDE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME IMPACT TO OUR NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFITS IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 DUE TO SEVERAL INDUSTRY-WIDE DYNAMICS RELATED TO COVID-19, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMER PUSH-OUT REQUESTS.  FURTHER, GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE REACTED NEGATIVELY TO THE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COVID-19 PANDEMIC\u2019S IMPACTS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF MANY COMPANIES ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED SINCE MARCH 31, 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR SALES OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE REST OF OUR BUSINESS TO SOME DEGREE.  HOWEVER, THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND ITS DURATION IS UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.  AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ON APRIL 6, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUME CERTAIN LIABILITIES FROM INTEL CORPORATION RELATED TO ITS HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION.  THIS BUSINESS ALSO OPERATES IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  IN PARTICULAR, THE INTEL DIVISION HAS MAJOR ENGINEERING, DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL WHOM WE EXPECT TO BECOME OUR EMPLOYEES IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, ISRAEL, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, AND CHINA.  ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE AND INTEGRATE AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND NEW PERSONNEL AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLICATED BY CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL AND SOCIAL DISTANCING.  IN ADDITION, ENGAGEMENT WITH AND MAKING OFFERS TO INTEL EMPLOYEES THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFER TO THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WILL BE SIMILARLY COMPLICATED AND PRESENTS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION RISKS.  WE ARE TAKING VARIOUS STEPS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE PANDEMIC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OR OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS POSED TO MAXLINEAR\u2019S CURRENT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN REVENUES, SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, AND OTHER FACTORS GENERALLY AFFECTING BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL RISKS ARISING FROM THE ACQUISITION, PLEASE SEE THE DISCUSSION IN PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q CAPTIONED \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  ACQUISITION OF HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION OF INTEL CORPORATION  ON APRIL 5, 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH INTEL CORPORATION, OR INTEL, UNDER WHICH WE AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SINGAPORE SUBSIDIARY AGREED TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUME CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF THE HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION OF INTEL, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $150.0 MILLION IN CASH PAYABLE UPON CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION.  THE TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020. WE INTEND TO FUND THE TRANSACTION PRIMARILY WITH APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION OF NEW TRANSACTION DEBT AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN CASH FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER EFFECTIVE APRIL 5, 2020 WITH CERTAIN INITIAL LENDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $140.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS.

THE COMMITMENT LETTER PROVIDES THAT THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WILL HAVE A THREE-YEAR TERM AND THAT TERM LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER AN ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS A FIXED APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.25% PER ANNUM OR AN ADJUSTED BASE RATE PLUS A FIXED APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 3.25% PER ANNUM, AT OUR OPTION. THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN FACILITY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A FINANCIAL COVENANT OF AN INITIAL MAXIMUM TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.5 TO 1 WHICH DECREASES TO 3.0 TO 1 BEGINNING WITH THE SIXTH FULL FISCAL QUARTER ENDING AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 14 OF OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, THE MOST CRITICAL OF WHICH ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS VALUATION, INCOME TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL INVOLVE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY THAN OUR OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ARE THE POLICIES WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, REFER TO MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHICH WE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR SEC, ON FEBRUARY 5, 2020, OR OUR ANNUAL REPORT.

THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING WITH FISCAL YEAR 2021, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. MOST AMENDMENTS WITHIN THE STANDARD ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS, WHILE CERTAIN AMENDMENTS MUST BE APPLIED ON A RETROSPECTIVE OR MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE LINE ITEMS SET FORTH IN OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SALES OF RADIO-FREQUENCY, ANALOG AND MIXED SIGNAL INTEGRATED CIRCUITS FOR THE CONNECTED HOME, WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET APPLICATIONS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SALES ARE TO DISTRIBUTORS, WHO THEN RESELL OUR PRODUCTS.  COST OF NET REVENUE.  COST OF NET REVENUE INCLUDES THE COST OF FINISHED SILICON WAFERS PROCESSED BY THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OUTSOURCED PACKAGING AND ASSEMBLY, TEST AND SHIPPING; COSTS OF PERSONNEL, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING SUPPORT, LOGISTICS AND QUALITY ASSURANCE; AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AMORTIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTION MASK COSTS; COST OF PRODUCTION LOAD BOARDS AND SOCKETS; AND AN ALLOCATED PORTION OF OUR OCCUPANCY COSTS.

ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCLUDES PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION OF CERTAIN ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THIRD-PARTY SALES COMMISSIONS, FIELD APPLICATION ENGINEERING SUPPORT, TRAVEL COSTS, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSULTING FEES, LEGAL FEES, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND ALLOCATED OCCUPANCY COSTS.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES CONSIST OF SEVERANCE, LEASE AND LEASEHOLD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND OTHER CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PLANS.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET INCLUDES INTEREST INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). INTEREST INCOME CONSISTS OF INTEREST EARNED ON OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH BALANCES. INTEREST EXPENSE CONSISTS OF INTEREST ACCRUED ON DEBT. OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) GENERALLY CONSISTS OF INCOME (EXPENSE) GENERATED FROM NON-OPERATING TRANSACTIONS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  WE MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAXES FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES AND THE REALIZABILITY OF ASSETS IN FUTURE YEARS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

THE DECREASE IN CONNECTED HOME NET REVENUE OF $11.2 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLOWDOWN IN THE SATELLITE AND CABLE MARKETS, OWING TO REDUCED OPERATOR SPENDING, THE MARKET TRANSITION FROM DOCSIS 3.0 TO DOCSIS 3.1 AND RELATED CUSTOMER INVENTORY REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL INDUSTRY-WIDE DYNAMICS RELATED TO CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS EARLY IN THE QUARTER, AND CERTAIN CUSTOMER PUSH-OUT REQUESTS. OUR MOCA SHIPMENTS ALSO DECLINED OWING TO A PAUSE IN A RAMP UP, OR EXPECTED INCREASE IN REVENUE, RELATED TO A NEW PROGRAM AT A LARGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMER. THE DECREASE IN INFRASTRUCTURE REVENUES OF $4.6 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASED HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG, WIRELESS BACKHAUL, AND HIGH-SPEED INTERCONNECT SHIPMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY. THE DECREASE IN INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET REVENUE OF $6.9 MILLION WAS RELATED TO DECREASED SHIPMENTS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN THIS CATEGORY, WHICH WE ATTRIBUTE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF COVID-19.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT REVENUE WILL FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD, BASED ON EVOLVING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE PACE OF ADOPTION OF NEWER PRODUCTS, AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FURTHER, DUE TO HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES.  WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR SALES OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  COST OF NET REVENUE  $31,265  $39,558  $(8,293)  (21)%% OF NET REVENUE  50%  47%  GROSS PROFIT  30,762  45,077  (14,315)  (32)%% OF NET REVENUE  50%  53%  COST OF NET REVENUE DECREASED $8.3 MILLION TO $31.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED TO $39.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES. GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECLINED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, DUE TO PRODUCT MIX.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE WILL FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD, BASED ON CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND AVERAGE MANUFACTURING COSTS. FURTHER, DUE TO HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED COST OF NET REVENUES RESULTING FROM DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES.  WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR COSTS OF SALES ON HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN PROTOTYPE EXPENSES OF $2.0 MILLION DUE TO TIMING OF PROJECTS, PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES OF $0.3 MILLION DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OF $0.2 MILLION AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT REACHING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES, AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES OF $0.2 MILLION FROM TERMINATED LEASES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSES OF $1.1 MILLION MAINLY RELATED TO CONSULTING AND DESIGN TOOLS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES OF $2.5 MILLION MAINLY RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES OF $0.6 MILLION DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT, OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSES OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO COMPLETION OF CERTAIN VENDOR SERVICES, TRAVEL EXPENSES OF $0.3 MILLION, AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES OF $0.2 MILLION MAINLY DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENT ASSETS.  WE EXPECT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OTHER THAN ACQUISITION TRANSACTION COSTS TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT IN THE NEAR-TERM; HOWEVER, OUR EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS WE GROW OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO EXPAND INTO EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES  $86  $\u2014  $86  100%% OF NET REVENUE  \u2014%  \u2014%  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES INCREASED $0.1 MILLION TO $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.

THE CHANGE IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE OF $0.9 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION PERTAINING TO A LOWER AVERAGE BALANCE OF DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING THE PERIOD.

THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019 EACH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG JURISDICTIONS, EXCESS TAX DEFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND RELEASE OF CERTAIN RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER ASC 740-10. ALSO INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 WAS A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT, OR CARES ACT, ENACTED EFFECTIVE MARCH 27, 2020.  SUCH TAX BENEFIT RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO CARRY BACK OUR 2019 NET OPERATING LOSS, ORIGINALLY VALUED AT A 21% FEDERAL TAX RATE, TO OFFSET INCOME TAXES PAID IN PRIOR PERIODS AT THE 35% FEDERAL TAX RATE IN EFFECT AT THAT TIME.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO OFFSET STATE AND CERTAIN FEDERAL AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS REALIZATION OF SUCH ASSETS DOES NOT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD REQUIRED UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES. IN MAKING SUCH DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE QUARTERLY, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON STATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, CERTAIN FEDERAL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND CERTAIN FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE HAVE CUMULATIVE LOSSES OR OTHERWISE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO UTILIZE CERTAIN TAX ATTRIBUTES. WE DO NOT INCUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN CERTAIN TAX-FREE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  OUR SUBSIDIARY IN SINGAPORE OPERATES UNDER CERTAIN TAX INCENTIVES IN SINGAPORE, WHICH ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE THROUGH MARCH 2022 AND MAY BE EXTENDED THROUGH MARCH 2027. UNDER THESE INCENTIVES, QUALIFYING INCOME DERIVED FROM CERTAIN SALES OF OUR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS TAXED AT A CONCESSIONARY RATE OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD. WE ALSO RECEIVE A REDUCED WITHHOLDING TAX RATE ON CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS MADE BY OUR SINGAPORE SUBSIDIARY DURING THE INCENTIVE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVES ARE CONDITIONAL UPON OUR MEETING CERTAIN MINIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND INVESTMENT THRESHOLDS WITHIN SINGAPORE OVER TIME, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RETURN CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS IN THE EVENT WE DO NOT ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THAT INCENTIVE PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY THESE CONDITIONS WITHOUT MATERIAL RISK. PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF OUR SINGAPORE NET OPERATING LOSSES AND OUR FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN SINGAPORE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INCENTIVES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX POSITION IN THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $98.4 MILLION, RESTRICTED CASH OF $0.1 MILLION AND NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $44.8 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $118.2 MILLION.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES, PURCHASES OF INVENTORY, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME, THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES. WE ALSO USE CASH TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING DEBT. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS WITH APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION OF NEW TRANSACTION DEBT AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN CASH FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET. SUCH TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY IN GENERAL CONTINUES TO IMPACT BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT FROM COVID-19 COULD RESULT IN A NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FUND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IF WE PURSUE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS AND OUR EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE THAT BUSINESS, CHANGES IN REVENUE, THE EXPANSION OF OUR ENGINEERING, SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR EXPANSION INTO NEW TERRITORIES, THE TIMING OF INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL MATERIAL INVESTMENTS IN, OR ACQUISITIONS OF, COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES. ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS OR EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC PLANS.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF WHEN WE PAY EXPENSES AS REFLECTED IN THE CHANGE IN OUR OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. CASH USED TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LEASED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LEASED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS. CASH USED TO FUND CAPITAL PURCHASES IS INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. CASH USED TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING DEBT IS INCLUDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH ARE CASH RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM OUR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS TO DISTRIBUTORS AND DIRECT CUSTOMERS. ASIDE FROM THE AMOUNTS BILLED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, NET CASH COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CASH COLLECTIONS PROCESS, WHICH CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE PAYMENT CYCLES OF OUR MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS, AND RELATIVE LINEARITY OF SHIPMENTS PERIOD-TO-PERIOD.

WE HAVE NO DUTY TO, AND DO NOT INTEND TO, UPDATE OR REVISE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IN THIS DISCUSSION AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, EXCEPT AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY LAW. IN LIGHT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, YOU SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT THE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT MADE IN THIS REPORT OR ELSEWHERE, MIGHT NOT OCCUR.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) OUTBREAK TO BE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC. IN RESPONSE TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE RAPID SPREAD OF COVID-19 WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE IMPOSED VARYING DEGREES OF RESTRICTIONS ON SOCIAL AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL DISTANCING IN AN EFFORT TO SLOW THE SPREAD OF THE ILLNESS. THESE MEASURES HAVE BEGUN TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT UPON MANY SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, INCLUDING NON-ESSENTIAL RETAIL COMMERCE.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE MEASURES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS, WE HAVE TEMPORARILY CLOSED OUR DEDICATED STORES, OUR MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS AND MANY OF OUR WAREHOUSES. IN ADDITION, MOST OF OUR OFFICE PERSONNEL ARE WORKING REMOTELY. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE SITUATION ON A DAILY BASIS, BUT WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHEN AND HOW QUICKLY WE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME IN-PERSON RETAIL AND MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS.  AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAD $12,189 IN CASH AND $17,677 IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ALONG WITH $22,327 OF AVAILABILITY ON OUR UNSECURED CREDIT LINE. IN ADDITION, WE OWN EIGHT UNENCUMBERED STORE PROPERTIES THAT HAVE A BOOK VALUE OF $17,812 WHICH WE COULD LEVERAGE IF NEEDED.  WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL MEASURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENSURE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS. SPECIFIC MEASURES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH OUR LANDLORDS TO RECEIVE TEMPORARY RENT DEFERRALS ON MANY OF OUR STORE LEASES  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH OUR VENDORS TO DEFER PAYMENTS  \u25cf  CANCELLING VARIOUS PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INVENTORY  \u25cf  NEGOTIATING WITH CUSTOMERS TO MAINTAIN SOME LEVEL OF IN-COMING CASH AND TO REDUCE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE  \u25cf  FURLOUGHING HOURLY PLANT PERSONNEL UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS PRUDENT TO RESUME MANUFACTURING  \u25cf  IMPLEMENTING A 20% TO 25% SALARY AND WAGE DECREASE FOR MOST OTHER EMPLOYEES WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CERTAIN OTHER EXECUTIVES TAKING A 50% PAY REDUCTION THROUGH MAY OF 2020  \u25cf  OBTAINING A COMMITMENT FROM OUR BANK TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR LINE OF CREDIT BY AN ADDITIONAL $25,000 (SEE \u201c  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  \u201d BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE AMENDMENT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY).  WHILE WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FULL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE EXPECT THAT THIS SITUATION WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS FOR OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2020 AND POSSIBLY BEYOND.

IN ORDER TO REACH MARKETS THAT CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SERVED BY OUR RETAIL STORE NETWORK, WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE USE A NETWORK OF OVER 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE STATED GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES. THESE SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPENSATED BASED ON A STANDARD COMMISSION RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS BLENDED STRATEGY PROVIDES US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  23 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE BHF STORES FEATURE CUSTOM ORDER FURNITURE, FREE IN-HOME DESIGN VISITS (\u201cHOME MAKEOVERS\u201d) AND COORDINATED DECORATING ACCESSORIES. OUR PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON BUILDING STRONG LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CUSTOMER. SALES PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cDESIGN CONSULTANTS\u201d AND ARE TRAINED TO EVALUATE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HOME DECOR. UNTIL A RIGOROUS TRAINING AND DESIGN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS COMPLETED, DESIGN CONSULTANTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM IN-HOME DESIGN SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE FACTORIES IN NEWTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS THAT MANUFACTURE CUSTOM UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE, A FACTORY IN MARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA THAT PRIMARILY ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR CUSTOM CASUAL DINING OFFERINGS AND A FACTORY IN BASSETT, VIRGINIA THAT ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR \u201cBENCH MADE\u201d LINE OF CUSTOM, SOLID HARDWOOD FURNITURE. IN LATE 2019, WE ALSO BEGAN OPERATING A FACILITY IN HALEYVILLE, ALABAMA THAT PROVIDES BASSETT WITH THE CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE CUSTOM ALUMINUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE PRIMARILY UNDER THE LANE VENTURE BRAND. OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE BREADTH OF ITS OPTIONS, THE PRECISION OF ITS CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND THE SPEED OF ITS PROCESS, WITH CUSTOM PIECES OFTEN MANUFACTURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF TAKING THE ORDER IN OUR STORES. OUR LOGISTICS TEAM THEN PROMPTLY SHIPS THE PRODUCT TO ONE OF OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS OR TO A LOCATION SPECIFIED BY OUR LICENSEES. IN ADDITION TO THE FURNITURE THAT WE MANUFACTURE DOMESTICALLY, WE SOURCE MOST OF OUR FORMAL BEDROOM AND DINING ROOM FURNITURE (CASEGOODS) AND CERTAIN LEATHER UPHOLSTERY OFFERINGS FROM SEVERAL FOREIGN PLANTS, PRIMARILY IN VIETNAM, THAILAND AND CHINA. OVER 75% OF THE PRODUCTS WE CURRENTLY SELL ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ALSO OWN ZENITH FREIGHT LINES, LLC (\u201cZENITH\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SERVICES TO BASSETT ALONG WITH OTHER FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS. ZENITH DELIVERS BEST-OF-CLASS SHIPPING AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF BASSETT AND THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ZENITH\u2019S REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-BASSETT CUSTOMERS.  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF LANE VENTURE FROM HERITAGE HOME GROUP, LLC. LANE VENTURE IS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND IS NOW BEING OPERATED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THIS ACQUISITION MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE MARKET FOR OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT LANE VENTURE HAS PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR US TO BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THIS CATEGORY. OUR STRATEGY IS TO DISTRIBUTE THIS BRAND OUTSIDE OF OUR BHF STORE NETWORK ONLY.  WITH THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE GAINED THROUGH OPERATING LANE VENTURE, WE HAVE DEVELOPED A NEW SEPARATE BRAND OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE THAT IS ONLY MARKETED THROUGH THE BHF STORE NETWORK. THIS ALLOWS BASSETT BRANDED PRODUCT TO MOVE FROM INSIDE THE HOME TO OUTSIDE THE HOME TO CAPITALIZE THE GROWING TREND OF OUTDOOR LIVING.  AT FEBRUARY 29, 2020, OUR BHF STORE NETWORK INCLUDED 69 COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND 34 LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE CLOSED ONE UNDERPERFORMING COMPANY-OWNED STORE IN BURLINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS, AND A NEW 23,000 SQUARE FOOT LICENSEE STORE WAS OPENED IN THORNTON, COLORADO. IN MARCH 2020, WE ALSO CLOSED UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN STOUGHTON, MASSACHUSETTS, NEWPORT NEWS, VIRGINIA AND TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA.  DURING FISCAL 2019, WE COMPLETED A THREE-YEAR STORE EXPANSION PROGRAM THAT HAS SEEN US GROW TO MORE THAN 100 STORES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO COMPANY-OWNED OR LICENSEE-OWNED STORE OPENINGS PLANNED. OUR STRATEGY IS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT FLEET OF STORES AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL OPERATIONS AND PROFITABILITY OF THE CORPORATE RETAIL SEGMENT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN VARIOUS MARKETS AND MAY CONSIDER FUTURE EXPANSION SHOULD ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE.  24 OF 35  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AS WITH ANY RETAIL OPERATION, PRIOR TO OPENING A NEW STORE WE INCUR SUCH EXPENSES AS RENT, TRAINING COSTS AND OTHER PAYROLL RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN $200 TO $400 PER STORE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL RENT COSTS FOR THE LOCATION AND THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN WE TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE STORE SPACE AND THE TIME OF THE STORE OPENING. GENERALLY, RENT PAYMENTS DURING A BUILDOUT PERIOD BETWEEN DELIVERY OF POSSESSION AND OPENING OF A NEW STORE ARE DEFERRED AND THEREFORE STRAIGHT-LINE RENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING THAT TIME DOES NOT REQUIRE CASH. INHERENT IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL, WE ALSO INCUR LOSSES IN THE TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A NEW STORE OPENING. LIKE OTHER FURNITURE RETAILERS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A SALE UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMER. BECAUSE OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL DOES NOT INVOLVE MAINTAINING A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR FURNITURE OFFERINGS, DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS USUALLY OCCURS ABOUT 30 DAYS AFTER AN ORDER IS PLACED. WE GENERALLY REQUIRE A DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF ORDER AND COLLECT THE REMAINING BALANCE WHEN THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED, AT WHICH TIME THE SALE IS RECOGNIZED. COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES CAN RANGE FROM $400 TO $600 PER STORE.  TODAY\u2019S CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEIR DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND COMMUNICATIONS TO BE PERSONALIZED, HIGHLY-RELEVANT AND CATERED TO MATCH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PREFERENCES. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CENTRALIZED CUSTOMER CARE CENTER THAT IS USING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM) SOFTWARE TO TRACK EACH CUSTOMER\u2019S PATH FROM INITIAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGH POINT OF SALE AND ULTIMATELY TO THEIR POST-DELIVERY EXPERIENCE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DIGITAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 JOURNEY FROM THE TIME THEY BEGIN ON OUR WEBSITE TO THE FINAL STEP OF DELIVERING THE GOODS TO THEIR HOMES. WE VIEW THE COMBINATION OF WEBSITE TRAFFIC AND STORE TRAFFIC IN A HOLISTIC FASHION WHERE OUR CUSTOMER GENERALLY EXPERIENCES OUR BRAND ON OUR WEBSITE BEFORE VISITING A STORE. WHILE STORE TRAFFIC HAS BEEN DECREASING OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITE INCREASED DURING FISCAL 2019 WITH WEB VISITS UP 15% FOR THE YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WITH SIMILAR GROWTH FOR THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020. WHEN THE STORES REOPEN, WE PLAN TO INVEST MORE IN NEW DIGITAL OUTREACH STRATEGIES ON A STORE MARKET BY MARKET BASIS TO DRIVE MORE TRAFFIC TO THE WEBSITE. WE WILL CONTINUE SOME DIGITAL OUTREACH DURING THE PERIOD OUR STORES ARE CLOSED BUT AT A GREATLY REDUCED RATE TO KEEP OUR BRAND PRESENCE IN SEARCH ENGINES AND SOCIAL MEDIA.  OUR PURE E-COMMERCE SALES (ORDERING DIRECTLY FROM THE WEBSITE) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN IMMATERIAL. WE PLAN TO INVEST IN OUR WEBSITE IN 2020 TO IMPROVE THE NAVIGATION AND THE ORDERING CAPABILITIES TO INCREASE WEB SALES. MUCH OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS HIGHLIGHT THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR CUSTOM FURNITURE CAPABILITIES WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO SHOW AND SELL ONLINE. WE PLAN TO EXPAND OUR MERCHANDISING STRATEGIES TO INCLUDE MORE PRODUCT THAT CAN BE MORE EASILY PURCHASED ONLINE WITH OR WITHOUT A STORE VISIT. WHILE WE WORK TO INCREASE WEB SALES, WE WILL NOT COMPROMISE ON OUR IN-STORE EXPERIENCE OR THE QUALITY OF OUR IN-HOME MAKEOVER CAPABILITIES.

WHOLESALE.  THE WHOLESALE HOME FURNISHINGS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED PRINCIPALLY IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, SOURCING, SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FURNITURE PRODUCTS TO A NETWORK OF BASSETT STORES (COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED RETAIL STORES) AND INDEPENDENT FURNITURE RETAILERS. OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR WOOD AND UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE LANE VENTURE, AS WELL AS ALL CORPORATE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING THOSE CORPORATE EXPENSES RELATED TO BOTH COMPANY- AND LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. WE ELIMINATE THE SALES BETWEEN OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE IMBEDDED PROFIT IN THE RETAIL INVENTORY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT ARE OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OUR HOLDINGS OF RETAIL REAL ESTATE PREVIOUSLY LEASED AS LICENSEE STORES. THE EARNINGS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LOSS, NET, IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  RETAIL \u2013 COMPANY-OWNED  S  TORES.  OUR RETAIL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND INCLUDES THE REVENUES, EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE) AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DIRECTLY RELATED TO THESE STORES AND THE COMPANY-OWNED DISTRIBUTION NETWORK UTILIZED TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO OUR RETAIL CUSTOMERS.  LOGISTICAL SERVICES.  OUR LOGISTICAL SERVICES SEGMENT REFLECTS THE OPERATIONS OF ZENITH. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING SHIPPING AND WAREHOUSING SERVICES FOR THE COMPANY, ZENITH ALSO PROVIDES SIMILAR SERVICES TO OTHER CUSTOMERS, PRIMARILY IN THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. REVENUE FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF THESE SERVICES TO OTHER CUSTOMERS IS INCLUDED IN LOGISTICAL SERVICES REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR 13 WEEKS COMPARED TO 14 WEEKS), NET SALES DECREASED 3.8%. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 95% DECREASE IN JUVENILE FURNITURE SHIPMENTS AS WE HAVE EXITED THIS FURNITURE LINE AND A 5.2% DECREASE IN SHIPMENTS ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS TO OUR TRADITIONAL OPEN MARKET CUSTOMERS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1.2% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS TO THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS NETWORK (BHF) AND A 16% INCREASE ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS OF LANE VENTURE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT CEASED SELLING ACCESSORIES TO THE BHF NETWORK BEGINNING AT THE START OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. BOTH THE CORPORATE AND LICENSEE OWNED STORES NOW PURCHASE ACCESSORIES DIRECTLY FROM THIRD-PARTY ACCESSORY PROVIDERS. WHOLESALE SALES OF ACCESSORY ITEMS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $945. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 32.5% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO 32.9% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS IN THE UPHOLSTERY AND IMPORT WOOD OPERATIONS DUE TO FIXED COST DELEVERAGE FROM LOWER SALES VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $390 INVENTORY CHARGE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 RELATED TO THE EXIT OF THE JUVENILE BUSINESS. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES INCREASED TO 28.3% AS COMPARED TO 27.1% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THIS INCREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REDUCED LEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS FROM LOWER SALES VOLUME AND INCREASED OVER-THE-ROAD FREIGHT AND WAREHOUSING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTH INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO IMPROVED CLAIMS EXPERIENCE.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - RETAIL  THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE 69 COMPANY-OWNED BHF STORES WAS DUE TO A $6,856 OR 10.4% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $3,073 IN NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS WE OPENED 6 STORES OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS. IN ADDITION, WE CLOSED ONE UNDERPERFORMING STORE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, ANOTHER UNDERPERFORMING STORE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND CLOSED AN ADDITIONAL THREE UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN MARCH DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019), COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 3.5%.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 7.9% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

THE 10 BASIS POINT IMPROVEMENT IN SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VARIOUS COST STRUCTURE DECREASES IMPLEMENTED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2019 AND REDUCED HEALTH INSURANCE AND WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS DUE TO IMPROVED CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DELEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME.  THE $1,374 IMPROVEMENT IN THE NON-COMPARABLE OPERATING LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NO NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS IN THE QUARTER COMPARED TO $494 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AND NO POST-OPENING LOSSES IN THE QUARTER COMPARED TO $828 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OVER-THE-ROAD TRUCKING REVENUES AS SEVERAL NEW CUSTOMERS WERE ADDED DURING THE QUARTER.

ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (\u201cWHO\u201d) DECLARED THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK A PANDEMIC. THE OUTBREAK HAS RESULTED IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD IMPLEMENTING INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEASURES TO HELP CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, INCLUDING QUARANTINES, \u201cSHELTER IN PLACE\u201d AND \u201cSTAY AT HOME\u201d ORDERS, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, BUSINESS CURTAILMENTS, SCHOOL CLOSURES, AND OTHER MEASURES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE ENACTED FISCAL AND MONETARY STIMULUS MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19.  OUR COMPANY IS A SOLE PROVIDER FOR MANY PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CRITICAL DEFENSE PROGRAMS. CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL GUIDELINES AND WITH STATE AND LOCAL ORDERS TO DATE, WE CURRENTLY CONTINUE TO OPERATE ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS, COVID-19 HAS BEGUN TO HAVE AND MAY HAVE FURTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN, TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS AND CUSTOMERS ALL OF WHICH MAY COMPRESS OUR MARGINS, EVEN AFTER THE PREVENTATIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES THAT WE, OTHER BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING. THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMIES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS OF MANY COUNTRIES. THE RESULTING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS, AND COULD FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO VOLATILE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PRICES AND VOLUMES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS. THE PROGRESSION OF THE PANDEMIC COULD ALSO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR OPERATING LOCATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE BEGAN TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON OUR MARKETS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN AIR TRAFFIC, TEMPORARY SHUTDOWNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 AND SUPPLIERS\u2019 FACILITIES AND DECREASED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. IN RESPONSE, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TAKING CERTAIN MITIGATING ACTIONS INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN WORKFORCE, COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND THE SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  THE EXTENT TO WHICH COVID-19 WILL ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE, INCLUDING NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SEVERITY OF THE OUTBREAK AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTIONS GLOBALLY TO CONTAIN OR MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS. WHILE WE EXPECT THE PANDEMIC TO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL POSITION, THE CURRENT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 MEANS THE RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT TO US CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.  ON JANUARY 12, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WOODWARD, INC.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT REQUIRED DEBT REPAYMENTS UNTIL JUNE 2024 WHEN THE FACILITY EXPIRES.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $8.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND $45.9 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE 2019 PERIOD ON LOWER EARNINGS AND HIGHER WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED RESULTING IN A CASH USE OF $94.8 MILLION IN 2020 AS COMPARED TO $78.4 MILLION IN 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $27.2 MILLION AND $219.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2019 PERIOD INCLUDED $158.4 MILLION FOR THE ARC TECHNOLOGIES, INC. ACQUISITION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $27.2 MILLION AND $61.1 MILLION IN 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $284.8 MILLION OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND PROVIDED $184.9 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019.  BORROWINGS UNDER OUR FACILITY WERE HIGHER IN 2020 AS WE CHOSE TO DRAW DOWN AN ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION IN LATE MARCH AS WE FOCUS ON GENERATING AND PRESERVING CASH DURING THIS UNSETTLED PERIOD. IN JANUARY 2020, THE COMPANY USED $49.9 MILLION TO REPAY AND TERMINATE ITS EURO TERM LOAN. WE ALSO RETURNED $38.8 MILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS FROM STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO $23.9 MILLION IN 2019.  IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAVE SUSPENDED OUR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS.  THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITY WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL 2024, WHEN THE FACILITY MATURES.  CERTAIN SALES AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE LEASED UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS, AND APPLY JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  22  TO ENSURE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.7 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.8 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN MEDIA, PRODUCTION AND LOCAL MARKETING, THE ADDITION OF DOGFISH HEAD BRAND-RELATED EXPENSES BEGINNING JULY 3, 2019, HIGHER SALARIES AND BENEFITS COSTS AND INCREASED FREIGHT TO DISTRIBUTORS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES.

WHILE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REFLECT OUR GOOD FAITH BELIEFS, THEY ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

GENERAL  INTRODUCTORY MATTERS  WE PROVIDE OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) IN ADDITION TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO ASSIST READERS IN UNDERSTANDING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE ORGANIZE THE MD&A AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  OVERVIEW.  DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS OUTLOOK, OPERATING RESULTS, INVESTMENT ACTIVITY, FINANCING ACTIVITY AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE REMAINDER OF MD&A.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPARING THE  2020  QUARTER TO THE  2019  QUARTER.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CASH FLOWS.  24  \u2022  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  . CALCULATION OF NAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cNAREIT FFO\u201d), A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  DESCRIPTIONS OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WHEN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS.  \u2022  NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d)  , CALCULATED AS SET FORTH BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION \"RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - NET OPERATING INCOME.\" NOI IS A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cNAREIT FFO\u201d)  , CALCULATED AS SET FORTH BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION \u201cFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS.\u201d NAREIT FFO IS A NON-GAAP SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME.  \u2022  ENDING OCCUPANCY  , CALCULATED AS OCCUPIED SQUARE FOOTAGE AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THAT PERIOD, EXCEPT MULTIFAMILY, ON WHICH ENDING OCCUPANCY IS CALCULATED AS OCCUPIED UNITS AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL AVAILABLE UNITS AS OF THE LAST DAY OF THAT PERIOD.  \u2022  LEASED PERCENTAGE  , CALCULATED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF AVAILABLE PHYSICAL NET RENTABLE AREA LEASED FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES AND PERCENTAGE OF APARTMENTS LEASED FOR OUR MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES.  \u2022  LEASING ACTIVITY  , INCLUDING NEW LEASES, RENEWALS AND EXPIRATIONS.  FOR PURPOSES OF EVALUATING COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WE CATEGORIZE OUR PROPERTIES AS \u201cSAME-STORE\u201d, \u201cNON-SAME-STORE\u201d OR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SAME-STORE PROPERTIES INCLUDE PROPERTIES THAT WERE OWNED FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE YEARS BEING COMPARED, AND EXCLUDE PROPERTIES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT OR DEVELOPMENT AND PROPERTIES ACQUIRED, SOLD OR CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR SALE DURING THE YEARS BEING COMPARED. WE DEFINE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AS THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PLANNED OR ONGOING MAJOR CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ON EXISTING OR ACQUIRED LAND PURSUANT TO AN AUTHORIZED DEVELOPMENT PLAN. WE CONSIDER A PROPERTY'S DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE COMPLETE WHEN THE PROPERTY IS READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE. THE PROPERTY IS CATEGORIZED AS SAME-STORE WHEN IT HAS BEEN READY FOR ITS INTENDED USE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THE YEARS BEING COMPARED. WE DEFINE REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES AS THOSE FOR WHICH WE HAVE PLANNED OR ONGOING SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES ON EXISTING OR ACQUIRED BUILDINGS PURSUANT TO AN AUTHORIZED PLAN, WHICH HAS AN IMPACT ON CURRENT OPERATING RESULTS, OCCUPANCY AND THE ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE WITH THE INTENDED RESULT OF A HIGHER ECONOMIC RETURN ON THE PROPERTY. WE CATEGORIZE A REDEVELOPMENT PROPERTY AS SAME-STORE WHEN REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN COMPLETE FOR THE MAJORITY OF EACH YEAR BEING COMPARED.  OVERVIEW  OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM THE OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES IN THE GREATER WASHINGTON METRO REGION. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE OWNED A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF  46  PROPERTIES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  3.9 MILLION  SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL SPACE AND  6,861  MULTIFAMILY UNITS, AND LAND HELD FOR DEVELOPMENT. THESE  46  PROPERTIES CONSISTED OF  16  OFFICE PROPERTIES,  8  RETAIL CENTERS AND  22  MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES.  OUTLOOK  ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED COVID-19, A RESPIRATORY ILLNESS CAUSED BY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS, A PANDEMIC, AND ON MARCH 13, 2020, THE UNITED STATES DECLARED A NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THE WASHINGTON METRO REGION TO INSTITUTE QUARANTINES, \"SHELTER IN PLACE\" RULES AND RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL, THE TYPES OF BUSINESS THAT MAY CONTINUE TO OPERATE, AND/OR THE TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS THAT MAY CONTINUE. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR OPERATIONS AND GOVERNMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS TO OUR NORMAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING REQUIRING OUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK REMOTELY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ESSENTIAL BUILDING PERSONNEL.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (\u201cCARES ACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW TO PROVIDE WIDESPREAD EMERGENCY RELIEF FOR THE ECONOMY AND TO PROVIDE AID TO CORPORATIONS. THE CARES ACT INCLUDES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS RELATED TO TAXES, REFUNDABLE PAYROLL TAX CREDITS AND DEFERMENT OF SOCIAL SECURITY PAYMENTS. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE ELIMINATION OF THE TAXABLE INCOME LIMIT FOR NET OPERATING LOSSES (\u201cNOLS\u201d) FOR ALL TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2021, THEREBY PERMITTING CORPORATE TAXPAYERS TO USE NOLS TO FULLY OFFSET TAXABLE INCOME (ALTHOUGH AS A REIT, WASHREIT WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY BE ABLE TO USE NOLS AGAINST TAXABLE INCOME REMAINING AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY DIVIDENDS-PAID DEDUCTION);  \u2022  THE ABILITY FOR OUR TRSS TO CARRY BACK NOLS ARISING IN 2018, 2019, AND 2020 TO THE FIVE TAXABLE YEARS PRECEDING THE TAXABLE YEAR OF THE LOSS;  25  \u2022  AN INCREASE OF THE BUSINESS INTEREST LIMITATION UNDER SECTION 163(J) OF THE CODE FROM 30 PERCENT TO 50 PERCENT OF ADJUSTABLE TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXABLE YEARS BEGINNING IN 2019 AND 2020 AND ADDITION OF AN ELECTION BY TAXPAYERS TO USE THEIR 2019 ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME AS THEIR ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME IN 2020 FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE LIMITATION; AND  \u2022  A \u201cTECHNICAL CORRECTION\u201d AMENDING SECTION 168(E)(3)(E) OF THE CODE TO ADD \u201cQUALIFIED IMPROVEMENT PROPERTY\u201d TO \u201c15-YEAR PROPERTY\u201d AND ASSIGNING A CLASS LIFE OF 20 YEARS UNDER SECTION 168(G)(3)(B) OF THE CODE TO QUALIFIED IMPROVEMENT PROPERTY UNDER SECTION 168(E)(3)(E)(VII) OF THE CODE.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE RELIEF OPTIONS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CARES ACT, AS WELL AS OTHER EMERGENCY RELIEF INITIATIVES AND STIMULUS PACKAGES INSTITUTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. A NUMBER OF THE RELIEF OPTIONS CONTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ABILITY TO REPURCHASE SHARES AND PAY DIVIDENDS, THAT REQUIRE CAREFUL EVALUATION AND CONSIDERATION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THESE OPTIONS, AND ANY SUBSEQUENT LEGISLATION OR OTHER RELIEF PACKAGES, INCLUDING THE ACCOMPANYING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, AS THE PANDEMIC CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.  THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE 2020 QUARTER. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUES, CREDIT LOSSES, AND LEASING ACTIVITY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND COMMUNICATE WITH OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS TO ASSESS THEIR NEEDS AND ABILITY TO PAY RENT. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT RENT DEFERRALS, ABATEMENTS AND CREDIT LOSSES FROM OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2020 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO LEASE UP AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL SPACE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY 300,000 SQUARE FEET OF VACANT COMMERCIAL SPACE AND APPROXIMATELY 200,000 SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL LEASE EXPIRATIONS SCHEDULED FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020. A NUMBER OF OUR COMMERCIAL TENANTS HAVE ANNOUNCED TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF THEIR OFFICES OR STORES AND REQUESTED RENT DEFERRAL OR RENT ABATEMENT DURING THIS PANDEMIC. FOR OUR MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES, WE EXPECT THE ECONOMIC DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL CAUSE ELEVATED CREDIT LOSSES AND IMPEDE OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE RENTAL RATES. WE ARE TEMPORARILY FREEZING RENTS ON LEASE RENEWALS, WAIVING LATE FEES, HALTING EVICTIONS, AND OFFERING A PAYMENT DEFERRAL PLAN TO RESIDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY FINANCIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19. TO HELP MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE HAVE INITIATED VARIOUS OPERATIONAL COST SAVING INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO. GIVEN OUR CONCENTRATION IN A SINGLE REGION, THE WASHINGTON METRO REGION, OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO COULD REMAIN SUBJECT TO QUARANTINES, \"SHELTER IN PLACE\" RULES, AND VARIOUS OTHER RESTRICTIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE FUTURE IMPACTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE EXTENT OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME. FOR MORE INFORMATION, SEE PART II - ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OPERATING RESULTS  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS, NOI AND NAREIT FFO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  AND  2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS  $1,719  $(4,405  )  $6,124  (139.0  )%  NOI  (1)  48,153  45,291  2,862  6.3%  NAREIT FFO  (2)  $31,439  $33,516  $(2,077  )  (6.2  )%  ______________________________  (1)  SEE PAGE  28  OF THE MD&A FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NOI TO NET INCOME.  (2)  SEE PAGE  35  OF THE MD&A FOR A RECONCILIATION OF NAREIT FFO TO NET INCOME.  THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT (  $8.4 MILLION  ),  HIGHER NOI (  $2.9 MILLION  ), LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE (  $1.7 MILLION  ), LOWER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (  $1.5 MILLION  ) AND A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (  $0.5 MILLION  ) DURING THE 2020 QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (  $6.0 MILLION  ) AND HIGHER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (  $2.7 MILLION  ).  THE HIGHER NOI IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF SEVEN SUBURBAN CLASS B APARTMENT COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND (\u201cASSEMBLY PORTFOLIO\u201d), AND CASCADE AT LANDMARK (  $6.9 MILLION  ) DURING 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES OF QUANTICO CORPORATE CENTER AND 1776 G STREET ($3.1 MILLION) DURING 2019 AND LOWER NOI FROM SAME-STORE PROPERTIES (  $0.6 MILLION  ). THE LOWER SAME-STORE NOI IS EXPLAINED IN FURTHER DETAIL BEGINNING ON PAGE 28 (RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - 2020 QUARTER COMPARED TO 2019 QUARTER). SAME-STORE ENDING OCCUPANCY DECREASED TO  91.6%  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  FROM  92.7%  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OCCUPANCY IN THE OFFICE SEGMENT.  26  THE LOWER NAREIT FFO IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS NET OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ($8.5 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NOI (  $2.9 MILLION  ), LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE (  $1.7 MILLION  ), LOWER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (  $1.5 MILLION  ), AND GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT (  $0.5 MILLION  ) DURING THE 2020 QUARTER.  INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITY  SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS DURING THE 2020 QUARTER INCLUDED THE PREPAYMENT OF THE $45.6 MILLION MORTGAGE NOTE SECURED BY YALE WEST, WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN 2052. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE RECOGNIZED A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF AN UNAMORTIZED MORTGAGE PREMIUM OF $1.4 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PREPAYMENT PENALTY OF $0.9 MILLION.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , THE INTEREST RATE ON THE $700.0 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) WAS ONE MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.00% AND THE FACILITY FEE WAS 0.20%. AS OF  APRIL 23, 2020  , OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS A BORROWING CAPACITY OF  $302.0 MILLION.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN THE PRECEDING SECTION, WE PREPAID THE MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE SECURED BY YALE WEST. FOLLOWING THIS PREPAYMENT, WE HAVE NO MORTGAGE NOTES.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE 2020 QUARTER, IN APRIL 2020, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY THE $250.0 MILLION 4.95% SENIOR NOTES SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN OCTOBER 2020 USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE HAVE NO REMAINING DEBT MATURITIES IN 2020 AND $150 MILLION OF DEBT MATURITIES IN 2021. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS SET FORTH ON PAGE 31 (LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS).  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  2020  QUARTER AND  2019  QUARTER. THE ABILITY TO COMPARE ONE PERIOD TO ANOTHER IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED AND DISPOSITIONS MADE DURING 2019 (SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE 2020 QUARTER, WE EXPECT THAT THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS GOING FORWARD, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUES, CREDIT LOSSES, AND LEASING ACTIVITY, IN WAYS THAT MAY VARY WIDELY DEPENDING ON THE DURATION AND MAGNITUDE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ENSUING ECONOMIC TURMOIL, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL, AS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  NET OPERATING INCOME  NOI, DEFINED AS REAL ESTATE RENTAL REVENUE LESS REAL ESTATE EXPENSES, IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE. NOI IS CALCULATED AS NET INCOME, LESS NON-REAL ESTATE REVENUE AND THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS (INCLUDING THE GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE, IF ANY), PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, LEASE ORIGINATION EXPENSES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, REAL ESTATE IMPAIRMENT AND GAIN OR LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT. WE BELIEVE THAT NOI IS USEFUL AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE, WHEN COMPARED ACROSS PERIODS, NOI REFLECTS THE IMPACT ON OPERATIONS OF TRENDS IN OCCUPANCY RATES, RENTAL RATES AND OPERATING COSTS ON AN UNLEVERAGED BASIS, PROVIDING PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME. NOI EXCLUDES CERTAIN COMPONENTS FROM NET INCOME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RESULTS MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO A PROPERTY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, INTEREST EXPENSE IS NOT NECESSARILY LINKED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A REAL ESTATE ASSET. IN ADDITION, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, BECAUSE OF HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, MAY DISTORT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AT THE PROPERTY LEVEL. AS A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, WE PROVIDE NOI AS A SUPPLEMENT TO NET INCOME, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. NOI DOES NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, IN EITHER CASE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AS SUCH, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO THESE MEASURES AS AN INDICATION OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. A RECONCILIATION OF NOI TO NET INCOME FOLLOWS.  27  2020  QUARTER COMPARED TO  2019  QUARTER  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NOI TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CONTROLLING INTERESTS AND PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR OUR DISCUSSION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOI IN THE  2020  QUARTER COMPARED TO THE  2019  QUARTER.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS, MANDATORY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND WORKING CAPITAL, TO THE EXTENT NOT FUNDED BY CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, WE EXPECT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO THE INABILITY OF SOME OF OUR TENANTS TO PAY THEIR RENT ON TIME OR AT ALL.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE 2020 QUARTER, ON APRIL 2, 2020, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY OUR $250.0 MILLION OF 4.95% UNSECURED NOTES USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. FOLLOWING THAT PREPAYMENT, WE HAVE NO REMAINING DEBT MATURITIES IN 2020 AND $150 MILLION OF DEBT MATURITIES IN 2021.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE 2020 QUARTER, WE EXECUTED AN AMENDMENT TO JOHN MARSHALL II PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT DECREASING THE CONTRACT SALE PRICE TO  $57.0 MILLION  AND CLOSED ON THE SALE ON APRIL 21, 2020.  AS OF APRIL 23, 2020, WE HAVE $398.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, LEAVING $302.0 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY. IN APRIL, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO COMMITMENT LETTERS WITH MEMBERS OF OUR BANK GROUP TO PROVIDE AN UNSECURED TERM LOAN IN A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $150.0 MILLION. THE TERM LOAN, SUBJECT TO EXECUTION OF FINAL DOCUMENTATION, WOULD INCREASE OUR OVERALL BORROWING CAPACITY TO $452.0 MILLION.  DUE TO OUR REMAINING BORROWING CAPACITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ANY DEBT MATURITIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MAJOR CAPITAL NEEDS AND COMMITMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE EQUITY, DEBT AND CREDIT MARKETS. WE WOULD ONLY ACCESS THOSE MARKETS WHEN WE BELIEVE THAT CONDITIONS MAKE SENSE FOR US TO DO SO. HOWEVER, DISRUPTIONS IN THESE MARKETS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL. THESE EVENTS MAY ALSO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SECURITIES OR THROUGH PRIVATE FINANCINGS, AND MAY REQUIRE US TO ADJUST OUR PLANNED EXPENDITURES FOR THE YEAR ACCORDINGLY.  IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS AGENCY DEBT, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC SECURED LOANS, USING A PART OF OUR UNENCUMBERED MULTIFAMILY PORTFOLIO, IF NECESSARY. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT SUCH LOANS WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR THAT THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE TERMS.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR ESTIMATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE ESTIMATES WE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. WE HAVE REDUCED 2020 ASSUMED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE BALANCE OF THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION, INCLUDING BY DEFERRING NON-ESSENTIAL BUILDING RESTORATIONS, SOME TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND LEASING COSTS FOR SPECULATIVE LEASING, AND LOWER MULTIFAMILY RENOVATION CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AS WELL DECREASING OUR ANTICIPATED DEVELOPMENT SPENDING AS WE NO LONGER EXPECT TO BREAK GROUND ON THE NEW RIVERSIDE DEVELOPMENT THIS YEAR. AS OF THE END OF THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  , OUR FULL-YEAR  2020  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CONSIST OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  FUNDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS;  \u2022  APPROXIMATELY $55.0 - $60.0 MILLION TO INVEST IN OUR EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF OPERATING ASSETS, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $20.0 - $25.0 MILLION TO FUND TENANT-RELATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND LEASING COMMISSIONS;  \u2022  APPROXIMATELY $30.0 - $35.0 MILLION TO INVEST IN OUR DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS; AND  \u2022  FUNDING FOR POTENTIAL PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS DURING 2020, OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM POTENTIAL PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEBT FINANCING  WE GENERALLY USE SECURED OR UNSECURED, CORPORATE-LEVEL DEBT, INCLUDING UNSECURED NOTES, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BANK TERM LOANS AND MORTGAGES, TO MEET OUR BORROWING NEEDS. LONG-TERM, WE GENERALLY USE FIXED RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN ORDER TO MATCH THE RETURNS FROM OUR REAL ESTATE ASSETS. IF WE ISSUE UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FUTURE, WE WOULD SEEK TO \u201cLADDER\u201d THE MATURITIES OF OUR DEBT TO MITIGATE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE YEAR. WE ALSO UTILIZE VARIABLE RATE DEBT FOR SHORT-TERM FINANCING PURPOSES. AT TIMES, OUR MIX OF VARIABLE AND FIXED RATE DEBT MAY NOT SUIT OUR NEEDS. AT THOSE TIMES, WE MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CAPS, FORWARD INTEREST RATE OPTIONS OR INTEREST RATE OPTIONS IN ORDER TO ASSIST US IN MANAGING OUR DEBT MIX. WE MAY HEDGE OUR VARIABLE RATE DEBT TO GIVE IT AN EFFECTIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE AND HEDGE FIXED RATE DEBT TO GIVE IT AN EFFECTIVE VARIABLE INTEREST RATE.  31  IN JANUARY 2020, WE PREPAID THE $45.6 MILLION MORTGAGE NOTE PAYABLE SECURED BY YALE WEST, RECOGNIZING A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF $0.5 MILLION USING BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

(4)  MATURITY DATE FOR CREDIT FACILITY IN MARCH 2023 ASSUMES ELECTION OF OPTION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL 6-MONTH PERIODS.  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE MATURITY FOR OUR DEBT IS  2.3  YEARS. IF PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS DUE AT MATURITY CANNOT BE REFINANCED, EXTENDED OR PAID WITH PROCEEDS OF OTHER CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS NEW EQUITY CAPITAL, OUR CASH FLOW MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO REPAY ALL MATURING DEBT. PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR OTHER FACTORS AT THE TIME OF A REFINANCING, SUCH AS POSSIBLE RELUCTANCE OF LENDERS TO MAKE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS, MAY RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE OR INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO FINANCE OUR OBLIGATIONS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY SEEK TO REPURCHASE AND CANCEL OUR OUTSTANDING UNSECURED NOTES AND TERM LOANS THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS OR OTHERWISE. SUCH REPURCHASES, IF ANY, WILL DEPEND ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE AMOUNTS INVOLVED MAY BE MATERIAL.  32  DEBT COVENANTS  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS WITH WHICH WE MUST COMPLY. SOME OF THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL ASSET VALUE OF NOT MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 (SUBJECT TO A HIGHER LEVEL FOLLOWING MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS);  \u2022  RATIO OF ADJUSTED EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, ACQUISITION COSTS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL OR NONRECURRING GAINS AND LOSSES) TO FIXED CHARGES OF NOT LESS THAN 1.50 TO 1.00;  \u2022  RATIO OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSET VALUE OF NOT MORE THAN 0.40 TO 1.00;  \u2022  RATIO OF ADJUSTED NET OPERATING INCOME FROM UNENCUMBERED PROPERTIES SATISFYING CERTAIN CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF NOT LESS THAN 1.75 TO 1.00; AND  \u2022  RATIO OF UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO THE UNENCUMBERED POOL VALUE OF PROPERTIES SATISFYING CERTAIN CRITERIA SPECIFIED IN, AND VALUED PER THE TERMS OF, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OF NOT MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 (SUBJECT TO A HIGHER LEVEL FOLLOWING MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS).  OUR UNSECURED NOTES CONTAIN COVENANTS WITH WHICH WE MUST COMPLY, INCLUDING.  \u2022  A MAXIMUM RATIO OF 65.0% OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSETS;  \u2022  A MAXIMUM RATIO OF 40.0% OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS TO TOTAL ASSETS;  \u2022  A MINIMUM RATIO OF 1.50 OF OUR INCOME AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS TO REQUIRED DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS; AND  \u2022  A MINIMUM RATIO OF 1.50 OF TOTAL UNENCUMBERED ASSETS TO TOTAL UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS.  FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANY OF THE COVENANTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, UNSECURED NOTES OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS. THIS COULD CAUSE OUR LENDERS TO ACCELERATE THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND COULD THEREFORE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY. IN ADDITION, OUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OR INCUR OTHER UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FUTURE COULD BE RESTRICTED BY THE DEBT COVENANTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS RELATED TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND UNSECURED NOTES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RATIOS AND COVENANTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2020, BUT NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RATIOS AND OTHER DEBT COVENANTS, PARTICULARLY IF CONDITIONS WORSEN.  COMMON EQUITY  WE HAVE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE  100.0 MILLION  COMMON SHARES, OF WHICH  82.3 MILLION  SHARES WERE OUTSTANDING AT  MARCH 31, 2020.  ON MAY 4, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO EIGHT SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cEQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS\u201d) WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, BNY MELLON CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC., GOLDMAN SACHS & CO.

ISSUANCES OF OUR COMMON SHARES ARE MADE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF ISSUANCE. WE MAY USE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON SHARES UNDER THIS PROGRAM FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WORKING CAPITAL, THE ACQUISITION, RENOVATION, EXPANSION, IMPROVEMENT, DEVELOPMENT OR REDEVELOPMENT OF INCOME PRODUCING PROPERTIES OR THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. DURING THE  2020 QUARTER  , WE ISSUED  46,500  COMMON SHARES AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF  $31.07  FOR NET PROCEEDS OF  $1.2 MILLION  . WE DID NOT ISSUE SHARES UNDER THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS DURING THE 2019 QUARTER.  WE HAVE A DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PROGRAM, WHEREBY SHAREHOLDERS MAY USE THEIR DIVIDENDS AND OPTIONAL CASH PAYMENTS TO PURCHASE COMMON SHARES. THE COMMON SHARES SOLD UNDER THIS PROGRAM MAY EITHER BE COMMON SHARES ISSUED BY US OR COMMON SHARES PURCHASED IN THE OPEN MARKET.  33  OUR ISSUANCES AND NET PROCEEDS ON THE DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PROGRAM FOR THE 2020 QUARTER AND 2019 QUARTER WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , NO PREFERRED SHARES WERE ISSUED OR OUTSTANDING.  HISTORICAL CASH FLOWS  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN OUR DIVIDEND AT ITS CURRENT RATE.

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER SPENDING ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT DURING THE 2020 QUARTER.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER NET BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN THE 2020 QUARTER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PREPAYMENT OF THE MORTGAGE NOTE SECURED BY YALE WEST DURING THE 2020 QUARTER.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.  34  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS  NAREIT FFO IS A WIDELY USED MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. WE PROVIDE NAREIT FFO AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE TO NET INCOME CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ALTHOUGH NAREIT FFO IS A WIDELY USED MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOR REITS, NAREIT FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AS SUCH, IT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME AS AN INDICATION OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, NAREIT FFO DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, NOR DOES IT REPRESENT CASH AVAILABLE TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AS A MEASURE OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  NAREIT FFO IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, INC. (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) IN ITS NAREIT FFO WHITE PAPER - 2018 RESTATEMENT AS NET INCOME (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP) EXCLUDING GAINS (OR LOSSES) ASSOCIATED WITH SALES OF PROPERTIES; IMPAIRMENTS OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE, AND REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. WE CONSIDER NAREIT FFO TO BE A STANDARD SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE FOR EQUITY REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS) BECAUSE IT FACILITATES AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR PROPERTIES WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH HISTORICALLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE INSTEAD HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT NAREIT FFO MORE ACCURATELY PROVIDES INVESTORS AN INDICATION OF OUR ABILITY TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FUND OTHER NEEDS. OUR NAREIT FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FFO REPORTED BY OTHER REITS. THESE OTHER REITS MAY NOT DEFINE THE TERM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION OR MAY INTERPRET THE CURRENT NAREIT DEFINITION DIFFERENTLY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES THE CALCULATION OF OUR NAREIT FFO AND A RECONCILIATION OF NAREIT FFO TO NET INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2020  AND  2019  (IN THOUSANDS).

ALSO REFER TO NOTE 1 OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, TABULAR DOLLARS ARE PRESENTED IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS. ALL PER SHARE AMOUNTS REFLECT COMMON STOCK PER SHARE AMOUNTS, ASSUME DILUTION UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, AND ARE BASED ON UNROUNDED AMOUNTS. PERCENTAGE CHANGES ARE BASED ON UNROUNDED AMOUNTS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES BELOW SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE OUTLINED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K.  TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING  WE OFFER SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO CUSTOMERS AND CONSUMERS. TOTAL MARKETPLACE SPENDING INCLUDES SALES INCENTIVES, DISCOUNTS, ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES. SALES INCENTIVES AND DISCOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE. A NUMBER OF OUR SALES INCENTIVES, SUCH AS BOTTLER FUNDING TO INDEPENDENT BOTTLERS AND CUSTOMER VOLUME REBATES, ARE BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS, AND ACCRUALS ARE ESTABLISHED DURING THE YEAR, AS PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED, FOR THE EXPECTED PAYOUT, WHICH MAY OCCUR AFTER YEAR-END ONCE RECONCILED AND SETTLED.  THESE ACCRUALS ARE BASED ON CONTRACT TERMS AND OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR PROGRAMS AND REQUIRE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER PARTICIPATION AND PERFORMANCE LEVELS. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ESTIMATED EXPENSE AND ACTUAL INCENTIVE COSTS ARE NORMALLY INSIGNIFICANT AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS ARE ALSO BASED ON ANNUAL TARGETS AND RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR AS INCURRED.  FOR INTERIM REPORTING, OUR POLICY IS TO ALLOCATE OUR FORECASTED FULL-YEAR SALES INCENTIVES FOR MOST OF OUR PROGRAMS TO EACH OF OUR INTERIM REPORTING PERIODS IN THE SAME YEAR THAT BENEFITS FROM THE PROGRAMS. THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED SALES INCENTIVES FOR THE FULL YEAR AND THE PROPORTION OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD\u2019S ACTUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE, TO OUR FORECASTED ANNUAL GROSS REVENUE OR VOLUME, AS APPLICABLE. BASED ON OUR REVIEW OF THE FORECASTS AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, ANY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND THE RELATED ALLOCATION OF SALES INCENTIVES ARE RECOGNIZED BEGINNING IN THE INTERIM PERIOD THAT THEY ARE IDENTIFIED. IN ADDITION, WE APPLY A SIMILAR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY FOR INTERIM REPORTING PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING ACTIVITIES.  INCOME TAXES  IN DETERMINING OUR QUARTERLY PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, WE USE AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WHICH IS BASED ON OUR EXPECTED ANNUAL INCOME, STATUTORY TAX RATES AND TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES AND TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENTS, AVAILABLE TO US IN THE VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR ANNUAL TAX RATE AND IN EVALUATING OUR TAX POSITIONS. SUBSEQUENT RECOGNITION, DERECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN IN A PREVIOUS PERIOD ARE SEPARATELY RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

INVESTORS ARE CAUTIONED NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHICH SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  COVID-19  OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS. COVID-19 HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE TO ALMOST ALL OF THE COUNTRIES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. AUTHORITIES IN MANY OF THESE MARKETS HAVE IMPLEMENTED NUMEROUS MEASURES TO STALL THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, INCLUDING TRAVEL BANS AND RESTRICTIONS, QUARANTINES, CURFEWS, SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS, AND BUSINESS SHUTDOWNS. THESE MEASURES HAVE IMPACTED AND WILL FURTHER IMPACT US, OUR CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING OUR FOODSERVICE CUSTOMERS), CONSUMERS, EMPLOYEES, BOTTLERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW THESE MEASURES AND FUTURE MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING WHETHER THEY WILL RESULT IN FURTHER CHANGES IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, FURTHER INCREASES IN OPERATING COSTS (WHETHER AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO OUR SUPPLY CHAIN OR INCREASES IN EMPLOYEE COSTS OR OTHERWISE), HOW THEY WILL FURTHER IMPACT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND WHETHER THEY WILL RESULT IN FURTHER REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF AIR OR OTHER COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT, PORT CLOSURES OR BORDER RESTRICTIONS, EACH OR ALL OF WHICH CAN IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, MEASURES THAT IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OUR OFFICES, PLANTS, WAREHOUSES, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS OR OTHER FACILITIES, OR THAT IMPACT THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING OUR FOODSERVICE CUSTOMERS),  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSUMERS, EMPLOYEES, BOTTLERS, CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS, JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES TO DO THE SAME, MAY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR AND THEIR EMPLOYEES, MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT ABLE TO PERFORM THEIR JOB FUNCTIONS REMOTELY. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED SAFETY PROTOCOLS AT OUR FACILITIES AND HAVE BEEN WORKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS ON CONTINGENCY PLANNING IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN SUPPLY. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS OR SUPPLY CHAIN, ALTHOUGH WE CAN REASONABLY ENVISION THAT POSSIBILITY.  PUBLIC CONCERN REGARDING THE RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID-19 IMPACTS DEMAND FROM CONSUMERS, INCLUDING DUE TO CONSUMERS NOT LEAVING THEIR HOMES OR OTHERWISE SHOPPING IN A DIFFERENT MANNER THAN THEY HISTORICALLY HAVE OR BECAUSE SOME OF OUR CONSUMERS HAVE LOWER DISCRETIONARY INCOME DUE TO UNEMPLOYMENT OR REDUCED OR LIMITED WORK AS A RESULT OF MEASURES TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC. AS WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES, THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL AND THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS VARIES BY JURISDICTION AND CHANGES IN DEMAND AS A RESULT OF COVID-19 WILL VARY IN SCOPE AND TIMING ACROSS THESE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN CONSUMER PURCHASING AND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY INCREASE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN ONE QUARTER, RESULTING IN DECREASED CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS, OR IN ONE SALES CHANNEL RESULTING IN POTENTIALLY REDUCED PROFIT FROM SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE, TO DATE, WE HAVE SEEN A SHIFT IN PRODUCT AND CHANNEL PREFERENCES, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN AT-HOME CONSUMPTION AND A DECREASE IN IMMEDIATE CONSUMPTION AND AWAY-FROM-HOME CHANNELS, SUCH AS CONVENIENCE AND GAS AND FOODSERVICE, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS OUR BEVERAGE BUSINESSES. ANY REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR CHANGE IN CONSUMER PURCHASING AND CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, AS WELL AS CONTINUED ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 AND BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTING IN AN INABILITY TO PAY FOR OUR PRODUCTS, REDUCED OR CANCELED ORDERS OF OUR PRODUCTS, CLOSING OF RESTAURANTS, STORES, ENTERTAINMENT OR SPORTS COMPLEXES OR OTHER VENUES IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, OR OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 INABILITY TO SUPPLY US WITH INGREDIENTS OR OTHER ITEMS NECESSARY FOR US TO MAKE, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE OR SELL OUR PRODUCTS. SUCH ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 OR BUSINESS PARTNERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY ALSO RESULT IN OUR RECORDING ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR OUR INABILITY TO RECOVER OR COLLECT ANY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, OWNED OR LEASED ASSETS, INCLUDING CERTAIN FOODSERVICE AND VENDING AND OTHER EQUIPMENT, OR PREPAID EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS RESULTED IN VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WHICH CAN IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL.  WHILE WE HAVE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTOCOLS, BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT PROTOCOLS IN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR BUSINESS, THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL DEPEND ON NUMEROUS EVOLVING FACTORS THAT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT AND WHICH ALL WILL VARY BY MARKET, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND SCOPE OF THE PANDEMIC, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DURING AND AFTER THE PANDEMIC, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN, OR MAY BE TAKEN IN THE FUTURE, IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC, SOME OF WHICH MAY BE MORE THAN JUST TEMPORARY.  CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT  SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF OUR FIRST QUARTER,  THE CARES ACT  WAS ENACTED ON MARCH 27, 2020 IN THE UNITED STATES. THE CARES ACT AND RELATED NOTICES INCLUDE SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING DELAYING CERTAIN PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS, MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE TCJ ACT, AND ESTIMATED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS THAT WE EXPECT TO DEFER TO FUTURE PERIODS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THE CARES ACT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, INCLUDING ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, OR ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE CARES ACT AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  REFER TO THE COVID-19 DISCUSSION ABOVE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  IN THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA REFLECT THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY AND FEBRUARY  . IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES GENERATED  35%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, WITH MEXICO, CANADA, RUSSIA, CHINA, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND BRAZIL COMPRISING APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD. IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE HAD A NET NOMINAL IMPACT ON NET REVENUE GROWTH PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN THE BRAZILIAN REAL AND EURO, OFFSET BY APPRECIATION IN THE RUSSIAN RUBLE. CURRENCY DECLINES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR WHICH ARE NOT OFFSET COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, VOLATILE ECONOMIC, POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS AND CIVIL UNREST IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD, INCLUDING IN ARGENTINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, THE MIDDLE EAST, RUSSIA AND TURKEY AND CURRENCY CONTROLS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN CERTAIN OF THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO, AND THE THREAT OR IMPOSITION OF TARIFFS IN OR RELATED TO THESE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS MAY, RESULT IN CHALLENGING OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS RELATED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EUROPEAN UNION, INCLUDING HOW THE UNITED KINGDOM WILL INTERACT WITH OTHER EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES FOLLOWING ITS DEPARTURE, AS WELL AS THE ECONOMIC, OPERATING AND POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN RUSSIA AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT FOR THE EUROPE SEGMENT AND OUR OTHER BUSINESSES.  SEE NOTE 9 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q FOR THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF  MARCH 21, 2020  AND  DECEMBER 28, 2019  AND NOTE 9 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE ITEMS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 OUR BUSINESS RISKS\u201d IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN EVALUATING OUR TRENDS AND FUTURE RESULTS.  IMPOSITION OF TAXES AND REGULATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS  CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED OR SOLD HAVE EITHER IMPOSED, OR ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING, NEW OR INCREASED TAXES OR REGULATIONS ON THE MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION OR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, INGREDIENTS OR SUBSTANCES CONTAINED IN, OR ATTRIBUTES OF, OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING, COMMODITIES USED IN THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING OR THE RECYCLABILITY OR RECOVERABILITY OF OUR PACKAGING. THESE TAXES AND REGULATIONS VARY IN SCOPE AND FORM. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME TAXES APPLY TO ALL BEVERAGES, INCLUDING NON-CALORIC BEVERAGES, WHILE OTHERS APPLY ONLY TO BEVERAGES WITH A CALORIC SWEETENER (E.G., SUGAR). IN ADDITION, SOME REGULATIONS APPLY TO ALL PRODUCTS USING CERTAIN TYPES OF PACKAGING (E.G., PLASTIC), WHILE OTHERS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF PACKAGING, ENCOURAGE WASTE REDUCTION AND INCREASED RECYCLING RATES OR FACILITATE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PROCESS OR RESTRICT THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN PACKAGING.  WE SELL A WIDE VARIETY OF BEVERAGES, FOODS AND SNACKS IN MORE THAN  200  COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND THE PROFILE OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL, THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SUCH PRODUCTS AND THE TYPE OF PACKAGING USED VARIES BY JURISDICTION. BECAUSE OF THIS, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE SCOPE OR FORM POTENTIAL TAXES, REGULATIONS OR OTHER LIMITATIONS ON OUR PRODUCTS OR THEIR PACKAGING MAY TAKE, AND THEREFORE CANNOT PREDICT THE IMPACT OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. IN ADDITION, TAXES, REGULATIONS AND LIMITATIONS MAY IMPACT US AND OUR COMPETITORS DIFFERENTLY. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED TAXES AND REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE MADE, MANUFACTURED, DISTRIBUTED AND SOLD AND TO CONSIDER ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO POTENTIALLY MITIGATE THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING ADVOCATING ALTERNATIVE MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPOSITION, FORM AND SCOPE OF ANY SUCH TAXES, REGULATIONS OR LIMITATIONS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE RELATED PROVISIONAL MEASUREMENT PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE  SEC ENDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  WHILE OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE RECORDED IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT  WAS DEEMED TO BE COMPLETE, ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE  IRS  IMPACTED OUR RECORDED AMOUNTS AFTER DECEMBER 29, 2018.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE TCJ ACT, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND \u201cOUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d IN THIS FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K.  OTHER TAX MATTERS  ON MAY 19, 2019, A PUBLIC REFERENDUM HELD IN SWITZERLAND PASSED THE  TRAF  , EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020.  THERE WERE NO INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 RELATED TO THE TRAF.  ENACTMENT OF ADDITIONAL TRAF PROVISIONS SUBSEQUENT TO MARCH 21, 2020 IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE FUTURE IMPACT OF THE TRAF CANNOT CURRENTLY BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED; WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE TRAF MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  RETAIL LANDSCAPE  ADDITIONALLY, OUR INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE AFFECTED BY DISRUPTION OF THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING THE RAPID GROWTH IN SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE WEBSITES AND MOBILE COMMERCE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL AND DIGITAL OPERATIONS AMONG RETAILERS AND THE INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF HARD DISCOUNTERS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR CHANGES IN THE RETAIL LANDSCAPE, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND SEEK TO IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE MAY TAKE TO BUILD OUR GLOBAL E-COMMERCE AND DIGITAL CAPABILITIES, DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS EFFECTIVELY THROUGH ALL EXISTING AND EMERGING CHANNELS OF TRADE AND POTENTIALLY MITIGATE ANY UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CONSOLIDATED REVIEW  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS  VOLUME  VOLUME IS ONE OF THE KEY METRICS MANAGEMENT USES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN AND THE EVALUATION OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE VOLUME PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE THE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND UNDERLYING TRENDS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT MEASURES DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AT THE CONSUMER LEVEL. REFER TO \u201cITEM 7. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS \u2013 VOLUME\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON VOLUME.  WE REPORT SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BEVERAGE VOLUME ON A MONTHLY CALENDAR BASIS. THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  INCLUDE BEVERAGE VOLUME OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA FOR THE MONTHS OF  JANUARY AND FEBRUARY.  OUR DIVISIONS\u2019 PHYSICAL VOLUME MEASURES ARE CONVERTED INTO SERVINGS BASED ON U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-SERVING SIZES OF FOOD AND BEVERAGE PRODUCTS. THE FDA REVISED THE GUIDELINES ON RECOMMENDED SERVING SIZE FOR BEVERAGE PRODUCTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. PREVIOUSLY, FDA GUIDELINES RECOMMENDED A SERVING SIZE OF 8 FLUID OUNCES FOR ALL BEVERAGES. THE REVISED GUIDELINES RECOMMEND A SERVING SIZE OF 8 FLUID OUNCES FOR BEVERAGES THAT CONSIST OF MILK, FRUIT JUICES, NECTARS AND FRUIT DRINKS AND 12 FLUID OUNCES FOR OTHER BEVERAGES. NO CHANGES WERE RECOMMENDED TO THE SERVING SIZE OF FOOD PRODUCTS. FOR THE 12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , TOTAL SERVINGS INCREASED 6%, WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE REVISED GUIDELINES ON OUR PRIOR-YEAR SERVINGS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE AND OPERATING PROFIT  12 WEEKS ENDED  3/21/2020  3/23/2019  CHANGE  NET REVENUE  $13,881  $12,884  8%  OPERATING PROFIT  $1,924  $2,008  (4  )%  OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN  13.9%  15.6%  (1.7  )  SEE \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR A TABULAR PRESENTATION AND DISCUSSION OF KEY DRIVERS OF NET REVENUE.  WE ESTIMATE THAT CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS ARISING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO NET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH. THIS ESTIMATE OF THE COVID-19 IMPACT TO REPORTED NET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR INTERNAL ANALYSIS OF EXPECTED REVENUE PERFORMANCE AS REFLECTED IN OUR INTERNAL RECORDS BEFORE AND AFTER WHEN WE BELIEVE, BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US, THE PRIMARY MARKETS IN EACH SEGMENT APPEAR TO HAVE EXPERIENCED CHANGES IN CONSUMER PATTERNS IN RESPONSE TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED  4%  AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED  1.7  PERCENTAGE POINTS. OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 10-PERCENTAGE-POINT IMPACT OF AN UNFAVORABLE MARK-TO-MARKET NET IMPACT ON COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FUEL-RELATED DERIVATIVES, INCLUDED IN CORPORATE UNALLOCATED EXPENSES (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d). NET REVENUE GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY SAVINGS POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CERTAIN OPERATING COST INCREASES AND HIGHER ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CHARGES TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH COVID-19 NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING PROFIT PERFORMANCE BY 7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 DIVISION REVIEW  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, OUR HISTORICAL SEGMENT REPORTING PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT HAS BEEN RETROSPECTIVELY REVISED TO REFLECT THE NEW ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF SPECIFIED ITEMS AND ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES INTERNALLY TO MAKE OPERATING AND STRATEGIC DECISIONS, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN, EVALUATION OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND AS A FACTOR IN DETERMINING COMPENSATION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE PRESENTING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO FACILITATE COMPARISON OF OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS AND TRENDS IN OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY ON HOW WE EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE PRESENTING THESE MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q ALLOWS INVESTORS TO VIEW OUR PERFORMANCE USING THE SAME MEASURES THAT WE USE IN EVALUATING OUR FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CONSIDER QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS IN ASSESSING WHETHER TO ADJUST FOR THE IMPACT OF ITEMS THAT MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OR THAT COULD AFFECT AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR ONGOING FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OR TRENDS. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS FOR WHICH WE MAY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDE.  AMOUNTS RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS OR LOSSES (NON-CASH); CHARGES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING PLANS; AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES; PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL RELATED ITEMS; CHARGES OR ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF NEW LAWS, RULES OR REGULATIONS, SUCH AS SIGNIFICANT TAX LAW CHANGES; AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS; TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO REORGANIZATIONS OF OUR OPERATIONS; DEBT REDEMPTIONS, CASH TENDER OR EXCHANGE OFFERS; ASSET IMPAIRMENTS (NON-CASH); AND REMEASUREMENTS OF NET MONETARY ASSETS.  SEE BELOW AND \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPLEMENTAL IN NATURE AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE RELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTAINED IN THIS FORM 10-Q ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.  COST OF SALES, GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OTHER PENSION AND RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS INCOME, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO, EACH ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY  ,  OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH RATES  THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE THE NET IMPACT OF MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CENTRALLY MANAGED COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING, RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR 2019 PRODUCTIVITY PLAN, INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACQUISITIONS AND NET TAX RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT (SEE \u201cITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY\u201d FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THESE ITEMS). WE ALSO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON OPERATING PROFIT, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PEPSICO PER COMMON SHARE  \u2013  DILUTED, ADJUSTED FOR ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY, EACH ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH MEASURE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSUMING CONSTANT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES USED FOR TRANSLATION BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. IN ORDER TO COMPUTE OUR CONSTANT CURRENCY RESULTS, WE MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, OUR CURRENT-YEAR U.S. DOLLAR RESULTS BY THE CURRENT-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND THEN MULTIPLY OR DIVIDE, AS APPROPRIATE, THOSE AMOUNTS BY THE PRIOR-YEAR AVERAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS NET REVENUE GROWTH ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND OTHER STRUCTURAL CHANGES. WE BELIEVE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF OUR BUSINESS BECAUSE IT EXCLUDES ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF ONGOING PERFORMANCE OR THAT WE BELIEVE IMPACT COMPARABILITY WITH THE PRIOR YEAR.  SEE \u201cNET REVENUE AND ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH\u201d IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 DIVISION REVIEW\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FREE CASH FLOW  WE DEFINE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL SPENDING, PLUS SALES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. SINCE NET CAPITAL SPENDING IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR PRODUCT INNOVATION INITIATIVES AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MAINTAINING OUR OPERATIONAL CAPABILITIES, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS A RECURRING AND NECESSARY USE OF CASH. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER NET CAPITAL SPENDING WHEN EVALUATING OUR CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FREE CASH FLOW IS USED BY US PRIMARILY FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES SINCE WE HAVE CERTAIN NON-DISCRETIONARY OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS DEBT SERVICE THAT ARE NOT DEDUCTED FROM THE MEASURE.

INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES  IN THE  12 WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  ,  WE RECORDED MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES OF  $25 MILLION  ($22 MILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.02  PER SHARE), INCLUDING  $23 MILLION  IN OUR FLNA SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF BFY BRANDS AND  $2 MILLION  IN OUR AMESA SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF PIONEER FOODS. THESE CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATE TO CONTRACT TERMINATION AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS.  IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 23, 2019, WE RECORDED INVENTORY FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS AND MERGER AND INTEGRATION CHARGES OF  $15 MILLION  (  $0.01  PER SHARE) IN OUR EUROPE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACQUIRED INVENTORY INCLUDED IN SODASTREAM\u2019S BALANCE SHEET AT ACQUISITION DATE.  NET TAX RELATED TO THE TCJ ACT  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017, THE TCJ ACT WAS ENACTED IN THE UNITED STATES.

OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH GENERATING CAPABILITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, TOGETHER WITH OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, BRIDGE LOAN FACILITIES, WORKING CAPITAL LINES AND OTHER AVAILABLE METHODS OF DEBT FINANCING, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND LONG-TERM DEBT FINANCING, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING NEEDS. OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AVAILABLE TO FUND CASH OUTFLOWS, SUCH AS OUR ANTICIPATED SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS AND THE TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY UNDER THE TCJ ACT, INCLUDE CASH FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS OBTAINED FROM ISSUANCES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, BRIDGE LOAN FACILITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT, AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. OUR SOURCES AND USES OF CASH WERE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY COVID-19 IN THE 12 WEEKS ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 AND, TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY MATERIAL LIQUIDITY DEFICIENCIES AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT COVID-19 MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. SEE \u201cITEM 1A.

THE TCJ ACT IMPOSED A MANDATORY ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS. AS OF  MARCH 21, 2020  , OUR MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY WAS $3.3 BILLION, WHICH MUST BE PAID THROUGH 2026 UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TCJ ACT. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE TCJ ACT.  THE CARES ACT WAS ENACTED DURING OUR SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND INCLUDES SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING DELAYING CERTAIN PAYROLL TAX PAYMENTS, MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX PAYMENTS UNDER THE TCJ ACT, AND ESTIMATED INCOME TAX PAYMENTS THAT WE EXPECT TO DEFER TO FUTURE PERIODS. WE DO NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THIS LEGISLATION TO HAVE A MATERIAL DETRIMENTAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THE IMPACT THE CARES ACT AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION IN OTHER COUNTRIES MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.7 BILLION  , COMPARED TO NET CASH USED FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $0.3 BILLION  IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE OPERATING CASH FLOW PERFORMANCE PRIMARILY REFLECTS UNFAVORABLE WORKING CAPITAL COMPARISONS TO 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $0.9 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING NET CAPITAL SPENDING OF $0.5 BILLION AND ACQUISITIONS OF $0.5 BILLION.  IN LIGHT OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR BUSINESS, WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING OUR PLANS WITH RESPECT TO NET CAPITAL SPENDING.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  12  WEEKS ENDED  MARCH 21, 2020  , NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $7.5 BILLION  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $6.4 BILLION AND NET PROCEEDS OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $3.0 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RETURN OF OPERATING CASH FLOW TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $1.9 BILLION.  WE ANNUALLY REVIEW OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING OUR DIVIDEND POLICY AND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THE 2018 SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM PROVIDING FOR THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $15.0 BILLION OF PEPSICO COMMON STOCK WHICH COMMENCED ON JULY 1, 2018 AND WILL EXPIRE ON JUNE 30, 2021. ON FEBRUARY 13, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED A 7% INCREASE IN OUR ANNUALIZED DIVIDEND TO $4.09 PER SHARE FROM $3.82 PER SHARE, EFFECTIVE WITH THE DIVIDEND EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN JUNE  2020  . WE EXPECT TO RETURN A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $7.5 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS IN  2020  THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION AND DIVIDENDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.5 BILLION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE INFORMATION SET FORTH IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, IN RELATION TO THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FROM WHICH IT HAS BEEN DERIVED.

COVID-19  THE CORONAVIRUS (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) PANDEMIC HAS SPREAD RAPIDLY ACROSS THE GLOBE.  THIS OUTBREAK HAS RESULTED IN THE WIDESPREAD REDUCTION OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY, ADVERSELY IMPACTING CONSUMERS, OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS.  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, SOCIAL DISTANCING MEASURES AND UNEMPLOYMENT LEADING TO A CHANGE IN CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL BEHAVIOR.  THESE IMPACTS HAVE HAD, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE, A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  A WORSENING OF THESE CONDITIONS WOULD LIKELY EXACERBATE THE ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WHICH COULD INCREASE UNCERTAINTY AND VOLATILITY.  THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS IMPACTED OUR 2020 PERFORMANCE TO DATE, DURING WHICH WE HAVE SEEN UNFAVORABLE TRENDS COMPARED TO HISTORICAL PERIODS.  THE IMPACT OF THIS OUTBREAK STARTED IN FEBRUARY AND WAS MORE SIGNIFICANT IN MARCH AS WE EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN OUR KEY METRICS, PRIMARILY DUE TO TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND STAY-AT-HOME ORDERS IMPLEMENTED BY GOVERNMENTS IN MANY REGIONS AND COUNTRIES ACROSS THE GLOBE.  THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE PANDEMIC, AND MEASURES TAKEN IN RESPONSE, AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED AT THIS TIME.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  KEY HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  , VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2019, WERE AS FOLLOWS.  NET REVENUE  GAAP  NON-GAAP (CURRENCY-NEUTRAL)  NET REVENUE INCREASED 5% ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, WHICH INCLUDED GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENTAGE POINT FROM ACQUISITIONS.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF OUR  UP 3%  UP 5%  NET REVENUE GROWTH WERE.  - GROSS DOLLAR VOLUME GROWTH OF 8% ON A LOCAL CURRENCY BASIS  - SWITCHED TRANSACTION GROWTH OF 13%  - OTHER REVENUES GROWTH OF 26%, OR 28% ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS.  THIS  INCLUDES 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH DUE TO ACQUISITIONS.  THE REMAINING  GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR CYBER & INTELLIGENCE AND DATA & SERVICES  SOLUTIONS.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  - HIGHER REBATES AND INCENTIVES, WHICH INCREASED 24%, OR 26% ON A  CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT FROM NEW AND RENEWED  AGREEMENTS AND INCREASED VOLUMES.  - CROSS-BORDER VOLUME DECLINE OF 1% ON A LOCAL CURRENCY BASIS  OPERATING EXPENSES  ADJUSTED  OPERATING EXPENSES  GAAP  NON-GAAP (CURRENCY-NEUTRAL)  ADJUSTED OPERATING EXPENSES ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS INCLUDED A 6 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE FROM ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT RELATED TO THE DIFFERENTIAL IN HEDGING GAINS AND LOSSES VERSUS THE YEAR-AGO PERIOD.  THE REMAINING 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  UP 7%  UP 8%  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  ADJUSTED  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  GAAP  NON-GAAP (CURRENCY-NEUTRAL)  ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 14.9% PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A MORE FAVORABLE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF EARNINGS AND DISCRETE BENEFITS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.  14.8%  14.9%  OTHER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  WE GENERATED NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF  $1.9 BILLION.  \u2022  WE REPURCHASED  4.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR  $1.4 BILLION  AND PAID DIVIDENDS OF  $0.4 BILLION.  \u2022  WE COMPLETED A DEBT OFFERING FOR AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $4 BILLION.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS SO AS TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE MOST COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d).  OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS WHICH INCLUDES MARK-TO-MARKET FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS, IMPAIRMENTS AND GAINS AND LOSSES UPON DISPOSITION, AS WELL AS THE RELATED TAX IMPACTS.  OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ALSO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SPECIAL ITEMS, WHERE APPLICABLE, WHICH REPRESENT LITIGATION JUDGMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS AND CERTAIN ONE-TIME ITEMS, AS WELL AS THE RELATED TAX IMPACTS (\u201cSPECIAL ITEMS\u201d).  OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIODS EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE FOLLOWING.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS  \u2022  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  AND  2019  WE RECORDED NET LOSSES OF  $174 MILLION  (  $146 MILLION  AFTER TAX, OR  $0.14  PER DILUTED SHARE), AND NET GAINS OF  $5 MILLION  (  $5 MILLION  AFTER TAX, AND AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT PER DILUTED SHARE), RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY RELATED TO UNREALIZED FAIR MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ON MARKETABLE AND NON-MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES.  28  MASTERCARD MARCH 31, 2020 FORM 10-Q  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SPECIAL ITEMS  LITIGATION PROVISIONS  \u2022  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED PRE-TAX CHARGES OF  $6 MILLION  (  $5 MILLION  AFTER TAX, AND AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS WITH U.K. MERCHANTS.  TAX ACT  \u2022  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED A  $30 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT (  $0.03  PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO A REDUCTION TO THE 2017 ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS RESULTING FROM FINAL TRANSITION TAX REGULATIONS ISSUED IN 2019.  SEE  NOTE 6 (INVESTMENTS)  ,  NOTE 14 (INCOME TAXES)  AND  NOTE 15 (LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS)  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  WE EXCLUDED THESE ITEMS BECAUSE MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY SEPARATELY FROM THESE RECURRING AND NONRECURRING ITEMS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED FACILITATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS.  WE USE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, EVALUATE OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS IN RELATION TO HISTORICAL RESULTS, FOR INTERNAL PLANNING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES AND IN THE CALCULATION OF PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION.  IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT GROWTH RATES ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY WHICH IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  CURRENCY-NEUTRAL GROWTH RATES ARE CALCULATED BY REMEASURING THE PRIOR PERIOD\u2019S RESULTS USING THE CURRENT PERIOD\u2019S EXCHANGE RATES FOR BOTH THE TRANSLATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL IMPACTS ON OPERATING RESULTS.  THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION REPRESENTS THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING OPERATING RESULTS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR U.S. DOLLAR REPORTING CURRENCY.  THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY REPRESENTS THE EFFECT OF CONVERTING REVENUE AND EXPENSES OCCURRING IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.  WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF CURRENCY-NEUTRAL GROWTH RATES PROVIDES RELEVANT INFORMATION TO FACILITATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  NET REVENUE, OPERATING EXPENSES, OPERATING MARGIN, OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ADJUSTED FOR THE IMPACT OF GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, SPECIAL ITEMS AND/OR THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY, ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON AS SUBSTITUTES FOR MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

DOLLAR VOLUME REPRESENTS PURCHASE VOLUME PLUS CASH VOLUME AND INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BALANCE TRANSFERS AND CONVENIENCE CHECKS; \u201cPURCHASE VOLUME\u201d MEANS THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF PURCHASES MADE WITH MASTERCARD-BRANDED CARDS FOR THE RELEVANT PERIOD; AND \u201cCASH VOLUME\u201d MEANS THE AGGREGATE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF CASH DISBURSEMENTS OBTAINED WITH MASTERCARD-BRANDED CARDS FOR THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  INFORMATION DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS RELATING TO GDV IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING AN ESTABLISHED U.S. DOLLAR/LOCAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FOR EACH LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH MASTERCARD VOLUMES ARE REPORTED.  THESE EXCHANGE RATES ARE CALCULATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING THE AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATE FOR EACH QUARTER.  MASTERCARD  30  MASTERCARD MARCH 31, 2020 FORM 10-Q  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REPORTS PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD RATES OF CHANGE IN PURCHASE VOLUME AND CASH VOLUME ON THE BASIS OF LOCAL CURRENCY INFORMATION, IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF CURRENCIES AGAINST THE U.S. DOLLAR IN CALCULATING SUCH RATES OF CHANGE.  CROSS-BORDER VOLUME  2  MEASURES CROSS-BORDER DOLLAR VOLUME INITIATED AND SWITCHED THROUGH OUR NETWORK DURING THE PERIOD, ON A LOCAL CURRENCY BASIS AND U.S. DOLLAR-CONVERTED BASIS, FOR ALL MASTERCARD-BRANDED PROGRAMS.  SWITCHED TRANSACTIONS  2  MEASURES THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS SWITCHED BY MASTERCARD.  WE DEFINE TRANSACTIONS SWITCHED AS THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED AND SWITCHED THROUGH OUR NETWORK DURING THE PERIOD.  OPERATING MARGIN  MEASURES HOW MUCH PROFIT WE MAKE ON EACH DOLLAR OF SALES AFTER OUR OPERATING COSTS BUT BEFORE OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE. OPERATING MARGIN IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR OPERATING INCOME BY NET REVENUE.  1  DATA USED IN THE CALCULATION OF GDV IS PROVIDED BY MASTERCARD CUSTOMERS AND IS SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION BY MASTERCARD AND PARTIAL CROSS-CHECKING AGAINST INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MASTERCARD\u2019S TRANSACTION SWITCHING SYSTEMS.  ALL DATA IS SUBJECT TO REVISION AND AMENDMENT BY MASTERCARD OR MASTERCARD\u2019S CUSTOMERS.  2  NORMALIZED TO ELIMINATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERING SWITCHING AND CARRYOVER DAYS BETWEEN PERIODS.  CARRYOVER DAYS ARE THOSE WHERE TRANSACTIONS AND VOLUMES FROM DAYS WHERE THE COMPANY DOES NOT CLEAR AND SETTLE ARE PROCESSED.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  CURRENCY IMPACT (TRANSLATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL)  OUR PRIMARY REVENUE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES ARE THE U.S. DOLLAR, EURO, BRAZILIAN REAL AND THE BRITISH POUND.  OUR OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY CURRENCY TRANSLATION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING OPERATING RESULTS WHERE THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR U.S. DOLLAR REPORTING CURRENCY.  OUR OPERATING RESULTS CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY.  THE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY REPRESENTS THE EFFECT OF CONVERTING REVENUE AND EXPENSE TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.  CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DIRECTLY IMPACT THE CALCULATION OF GROSS DOLLAR VOLUME (\u201cGDV\u201d) AND GROSS EURO VOLUME (\u201cGEV\u201d), WHICH ARE USED IN THE CALCULATION OF OUR DOMESTIC ASSESSMENTS, CROSS-BORDER VOLUME FEES AND CERTAIN VOLUME-RELATED REBATES AND INCENTIVES.  IN MOST NON-EUROPEAN REGIONS, GDV IS CALCULATED BASED ON LOCAL CURRENCY SPENDING VOLUME CONVERTED TO U.S. DOLLARS USING AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD.  IN EUROPE, GEV IS CALCULATED BASED ON LOCAL CURRENCY SPENDING VOLUME CONVERTED TO EUROS USING AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FOR THE PERIOD.  AS A RESULT, OUR DOMESTIC ASSESSMENTS, CROSS-BORDER VOLUME FEES AND CERTAIN VOLUME-RELATED REBATES AND INCENTIVES ARE IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTHENING OR WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS NON-EUROPEAN LOCAL CURRENCIES AND THE STRENGTHENING OR WEAKENING OF THE EURO VERSUS OTHER EUROPEAN LOCAL CURRENCIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, OUR BILLING IN AUSTRALIA IS IN THE U.S. DOLLAR, HOWEVER, CONSUMER SPEND IN AUSTRALIA IS IN THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR.  THE CURRENCY TRANSACTIONAL IMPACT OF CONVERTING AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS TO OUR U.S. DOLLAR BILLING CURRENCY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE REVENUE GENERATED.  THE STRENGTHENING OR WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IS EVIDENT WHEN GDV GROWTH ON A U.S. DOLLAR-CONVERTED BASIS IS COMPARED TO GDV GROWTH ON A LOCAL CURRENCY BASIS.  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  , GDV ON A U.S. DOLLAR-CONVERTED BASIS INCREASED  6%  , WHILE GDV ON A LOCAL CURRENCY BASIS INCREASED  8%  , VERSUS THE COMPARABLE  PERIOD  IN  2019  .  FURTHER, THE IMPACT FROM TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY OCCURS IN TRANSACTION PROCESSING REVENUE, OTHER REVENUE AND OPERATING EXPENSES WHEN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THESE ITEMS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.  THE TRANSLATIONAL AND TRANSACTIONAL IMPACT OF CURRENCY (\u201cCURRENCY IMPACT\u201d) HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED IN OUR GROWTH IMPACT TABLES AND HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OUR CURRENCY-NEUTRAL GROWTH RATES, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  SEE \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON OUR NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE ACTIVITY  WE INCUR FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES FROM REMEASURING MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AND FROM REMEASURING FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS (\u201cFOREIGN EXCHANGE ACTIVITY\u201d).  THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE ACTIVITY HAS NOT BEEN ELIMINATED IN OUR CURRENCY-NEUTRAL RESULTS (SEE \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\u201d) AND IS RECORDED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  WE MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY BALANCE SHEET REMEASUREMENT AND TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE THROUGH OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN  NOTE 17 (DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS)  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1.  SINCE WE DO NOT DESIGNATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS PURSUANT TO THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WE RECORD GAINS AND LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES IMMEDIATELY IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS, WITH THE RELATED HEDGED ITEM BEING RECOGNIZED AS THE EXPOSURES MATERIALIZE.  RISK OF CURRENCY DEVALUATION  WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY DEVALUATION IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES.  IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXCHANGE CONTROL REGULATIONS THAT RESTRICT THE CONVERSION OF FINANCIAL ASSETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  WHILE THESE REVENUES AND ASSETS ARE NOT MATERIAL TO US ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, WE CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SHOULD THERE BE A CONTINUED AND SUSTAINED DEVALUATION OF LOCAL CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR AND/OR A CONTINUED AND SUSTAINED DETERIORATION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THESE COUNTRIES.

WE ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY  TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS, OR OTHERWISE EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION, YOU ARE ENCOURAGED TO REVIEW OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, INCLUDING OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND THE RISK FACTORS DISCUSSED THEREIN UNDER PART I. ITEM 1A.  BUSINESS  ON  JANUARY 31, 2020 (THE \u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (THE \u201cASSET  SALE\u201d) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $7,250,000 PURSUANT TO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN US AND MITSUBISHI  CHEMICAL PERFORMANCE POLYMERS, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (\u201cMCPP\u201d). PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE DEVELOPED AND  MANUFACTURED ADVANCED POLYMER MATERIALS WHICH PROVIDE CRITICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  OUR BIOMATERIALS WERE MARKETED AND SOLD TO MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS WHO USED OUR ADVANCED POLYMERS IN DEVICES DESIGNED FOR  TREATING A BROAD RANGE OF ANATOMICAL SITES AND DISEASE STATES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE ASSET SALE, WE CEASED OPERATING AS A DEVELOPER, MANUFACTURER, MARKETER AND SELLER OF ADVANCED POLYMERS. SUBSEQUENT  TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE BECAME ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH THROUGH AN EQUITY-BASED  EXCHANGE TRANSACTION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL. AS OUR EFFORTS IN ENGAGING WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY SUBSEQUENT  TO THE CLOSING DATE HAS NOT YET COMMENCED, OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE NEED  TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY DESIRING TO ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH US.  MANAGEMENT  IS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY AND ENGAGE IN A MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION OF SOME KIND, OR ACQUIRE ASSETS OR  SHARES OF AN ENTITY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS THAT GENERATES SUSTAINED REVENUES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INVESTIGATED CERTAIN OPPORTUNITIES  TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADD VALUE TO US FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WE HAVE NOT YET ENTERED  INTO ANY BINDING ARRANGEMENTS.  WE  DO NOT INTEND TO RESTRICT OUR CONSIDERATION TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY SEGMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES,  THE SCOPE AND NUMBER OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO MERGE WITH IS RELATIVELY LIMITED. BECAUSE WE MAY PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY  WITH A NEWLY FORMED FIRM, A FIRM THAT IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE, OR A FIRM THAT IS ENTERING A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH, WE MAY INCUR  FURTHER RISK DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE TARGET\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO HAVE PROVEN ITS ABILITIES OR EFFECTIVENESS, OR THE LACK  OF AN ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR THE TARGET\u2019S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE INABILITY TO REACH PROFITABILITY IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS.  17  ANY  BUSINESS COMBINATION OR TRANSACTION WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUANCE OF SHARES AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR PRESENT  STOCKHOLDERS. AS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CLOSING OF SUCH A TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL, SUCH TRANSACTION IS  EXPECTED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE MERGER, WITH THE OPERATING COMPANY BEING CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIREE AND ACCOUNTING  ACQUIRER, AND WE WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIRER AND THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIREE. AS A RESULT, AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING  OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE OPERATING COMPANY WOULD BECOME OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS  PRESENTED.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. HOWEVER, CERTAIN OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY OUR MANAGEMENT, AND SUCH JUDGMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN APPLYING THESE POLICIES, OUR MANAGEMENT USES ITS JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS TO BE USED IN THE DETERMINATION  OF ESTIMATES. THOSE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TERMS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS, OUR OBSERVANCE OF MARKET TRENDS,  INFORMATION PROVIDED BY OUR STRATEGIC PARTNERS AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM OTHER OUTSIDE SOURCES, AS APPROPRIATE. ACTUAL RESULTS  MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE ESTIMATES CONTAINED IN OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES  TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  AS  A RESULT OF THE ASSET SALE DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH CLOSED ON JANUARY 31, 2020, OUR SOLE BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING,  MARKETING AND SELLING OF ADVANCED POLYMERS CEASED. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE RECORDED ALL OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE FOLLOWING SEPARATELY PRESENTS OUR RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS,  WHICH ARE COMPOSED OF COSTS NECESSARY TO OPERATE AS A PUBLIC COMPANY; AND RESULTS OF OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, COMPOSED REVENUE  AND COSTS OF OPERATING THE ADVANCED POLYMER BUSINESS.  RESULTS  OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS  OUR  LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS REPRESENTS THOSE COSTS NECESSARY TO OPERATE A PUBLIC COMPANY. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2019 AND 2018, THESE COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $65,000 AND $54,000, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF $11,000 OR 20.3%. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, THESE COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $185,000 AND $152,000, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE  OF $33,000 OR 21.7%. THESE COSTS WERE COMPOSED OF ACCOUNTING FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, REGULATORY FEES, BOARD OF DIRECTORS FEES,  AND DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE PREMIUMS.  RESULTS  OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 VS DECEMBER 31, 2018  REVENUES  TOTAL  REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $808,000 AS COMPARED WITH  APPROXIMATELY $889,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $81,000, OR 9.1%.  PRODUCT  SALES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $457,000 AS COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY  $608,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $151,000, OR 24.8%. THE DECREASE IS DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN PRODUCT  SHIPMENTS TO CERTAIN KEY CUSTOMERS.  LICENSE  AND ROYALTY FEES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE APPROXIMATELY $351,000 AS COMPARED  WITH APPROXIMATELY $281,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $70,000 OR 24.9%. LICENSE AND ROYALTY FEES  INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MINIMUM ROYALTIES EARNED AT CALENDAR YEAR-END PURSUANT TO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH ONE OF TWO CUSTOMERS  WITH WHOM WE HAVE ROYALTY ARRANGEMENTS.  GROSS  PROFIT  GROSS  PROFIT ON TOTAL REVENUES FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $614,000,  OR 76.0% OF TOTAL REVENUES, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $630,000, OR 70.9% OF TOTAL REVENUES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

WE ALSO REPAID TWO NOTES PAYABLE TO AN AFFILIATE  OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, IN THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $125,000. IN LIEU OF A CASH PAYMENT FOR THE REPAYMENT OF  THESE NOTES, THE AFFILIATE ALLOWED OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO EXERCISE A PORTION OF HIS NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS TO PURCHASE  2,083,333 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL 3,201,667 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE CASHLESS EXERCISE  OF NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED TO OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES AND A CONSULTANT.  ON  JANUARY 31, 2020 (THE \u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (THE \u201cASSET  SALE\u201d) FOR A TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $7,250,000 PURSUANT TO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN US AND MITSUBISHI  CHEMICAL PERFORMANCE POLYMERS, INC., A DELAWARE CORPORATION (\u201cMCPP\u201d). PRIOR TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE DEVELOPED AND  MANUFACTURED ADVANCED POLYMER MATERIALS WHICH PROVIDE CRITICAL CHARACTERISTICS IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF MEDICAL DEVICES.  OUR BIOMATERIALS WERE MARKETED AND SOLD TO MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURERS WHO USED OUR ADVANCED POLYMERS IN DEVICES DESIGNED FOR  TREATING A BROAD RANGE OF ANATOMICAL SITES AND DISEASE STATES.  AS  A RESULT OF THE ASSET SALE, WE CEASED OPERATING AS A DEVELOPER, MANUFACTURER, MARKETER AND SELLER OF ADVANCED POLYMERS. SUBSEQUENT  TO THE CLOSING DATE, WE BECAME ENGAGED IN EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY TO ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH THROUGH AN EQUITY-BASED  EXCHANGE TRANSACTION THAT WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL. AS OUR EFFORTS IN ENGAGING WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY SUBSEQUENT  TO THE CLOSING DATE HAS NOT YET COMMENCED, OUR ACTIVITIES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE NEED  TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IF WE ARE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY DESIRING TO ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH US.  OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESENTED ON THE BASIS THAT WE ARE A GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS  AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE RECORDED OUR NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS  AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED ASSET SALE. ON THE CLOSING DATE WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS FROM  THE ASSET SALE OF APPROXIMATELY $6,100,000. WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS OF THE CLOSING DATE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS EXPECTED TO  DECLARE A DISTRIBUTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ASSET SALE, AFTER MAKING ADJUSTMENTS FOR (I) COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  RETAINED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020, (II) PAYMENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ASSUMED AS OF JANUARY 31, 2020; AND (III) RETENTION OF A REASONABLE  AMOUNT OF CASH FOR ANTICIPATED FUTURE OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, WE EXPECT OUR FUNDS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR NEEDS FOR  MORE THAN TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL  DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  MANAGEMENT  IS SEEKING TO IDENTIFY AN OPERATING COMPANY FOR THE PURPOSE OF EFFECTING A MERGER OR BUSINESS COMBINATION, OR TO ACQUIRE ASSETS  OR SHARES OF AN ENTITY ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN A BUSINESS THAT GENERATES SUSTAINED REVENUES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE INVESTIGATED CERTAIN  OPPORTUNITIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WOULD HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADD VALUE TO US FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS, WE HAVE  NOT YET ENTERED INTO ANY BINDING ARRANGEMENTS.  WE  DO NOT INTEND TO RESTRICT OUR CONSIDERATION TO ANY PARTICULAR BUSINESS OR INDUSTRY SEGMENT. BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES,  THE SCOPE AND NUMBER OF SUITABLE CANDIDATES TO MERGE WITH IS RELATIVELY LIMITED. BECAUSE WE MAY PARTICIPATE IN A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY  WITH A NEWLY FORMED FIRM, A FIRM THAT IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE, OR A FIRM THAT IS ENTERING A NEW PHASE OF GROWTH, WE MAY INCUR  FURTHER RISK DUE TO THE INABILITY OF THE TARGET\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO HAVE PROVEN ITS ABILITIES OR EFFECTIVENESS, OR THE LACK  OF AN ESTABLISHED MARKET FOR THE TARGET\u2019S PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE INABILITY TO REACH PROFITABILITY IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS.  ANY  BUSINESS COMBINATION OR TRANSACTION WILL LIKELY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ISSUANCE OF SHARES AND SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR PRESENT  STOCKHOLDERS. AS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CLOSING OF SUCH A TRANSACTION WILL RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL, SUCH TRANSACTION IS  EXPECTED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REVERSE MERGER, WITH THE OPERATING COMPANY BEING CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIREE AND ACCOUNTING  ACQUIRER, AND WE WOULD BE CONSIDERED THE LEGAL ACQUIRER AND THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIREE. AS A RESULT, AT AND SUBSEQUENT TO CLOSING  OF ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE OPERATING COMPANY WOULD BECOME OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ALL PERIODS  PRESENTED.  21  COMMITMENTS  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A CURRENT  OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "AdvanSource Biomaterials Corp", "CIK": 1011060, "Date": "2020-04-01T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ASNB", "Name": "Advansource Biomaterials Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 3841.0, "Business": "MA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 43186647.0, "key": "20200401ASNB", "labelr1": 14.285714285714276, "labelr2": 12.499999999999993, "labelr3": 5.555555555555562, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6393491, "prof1": 0.36065093, "return1&2": 0.7500000000000001, "return1&2&3": 0.7083333333333334, "return1&2&3&4": 0.7083333333333334, "return2": 0.8750000000000001, "return1": 0.8571428571428572, "return3": 0.9444444444444444, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 14.285714285714278, "cumulative_return1": 0.06833257347980125, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3806, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.1428571428571428, "cumreturn1b": 1.1428571428571428, "cumreturn1c": 1.018747903604171, "cumreturndow": 1.0228293470957297, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0224379625120374}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3807, "level_0": 3914, "index": 3034, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS SECTION INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS RELEVANT TO AN ASSESSMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AND THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  GENERAL  FOUNDED IN 1906, SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. (\u201cSSI\u201d), AN OREGON CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST RECYCLERS OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP METAL, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AND A MANUFACTURER OF FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS.  OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL AND REPORTING STRUCTURE INCLUDES TWO OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING (\u201cAMR\u201d) BUSINESS AND THE CASCADE STEEL AND SCRAP (\u201cCSS\u201d) BUSINESS.  AMR SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL IN BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS. AMR ACQUIRES, PROCESSES AND RECYCLES AUTO BODIES, RAIL CARS, HOME APPLIANCES, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, MANUFACTURING SCRAP AND CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION SCRAP THROUGH  ITS 90 AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES. OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF AUTO BODIES IS OUR OWN NETWORK OF RETAIL AUTO PARTS STORES, WHICH OPERATE UNDER THE COMMERCIAL BRAND-NAME PICK-N-PULL. AMR PROCURES SALVAGED VEHICLES AND SELLS SERVICEABLE USED AUTO PARTS FROM THESE VEHI  CLES THROUGH ITS  51 SELF  -SERVICE AUTO PARTS STORES LOCATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN CANADA. UPON ACQUIRING A SALVAGED VEHICLE, WE REMOVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS, ALUMINUM WHEELS AND BATTERIES FOR SEPARATE PROCESSING AND SALE PRIOR TO PLACING THE VEHICLE IN OUR RETAIL LOT. AFTER RETAIL CUSTOMERS HAVE REMOVED DESIRED PARTS FROM A VEHICLE, WE MAY REMOVE REMAINING MAJOR COMPONENT PARTS CONTAINING FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO WHOLESALERS. THE REMAINING AUTO BODIES ARE CRUSHED AND SHIPPED TO OUR METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES TO BE SHREDDED OR SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES WHERE GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE ECONOMICAL. AMR THEN PROCESSES MIXED AND LARGE PIECES OF SCRAP METAL INTO SMALLER PIECES BY CRUSHING, TORCHING, SHEARING, SHREDDING AND SORTING, RESULTING IN SCRAP METAL PIECES OF A SIZE, DENSITY AND METAL CONTENT REQUIRED BY CUSTOMERS TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION NEEDS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS INCLUDES PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS MATERIALS THROUGH AUTOMATED AND MANUAL PROCESSES INTO VARIOUS SUB-CLASSIFICATIONS, EACH OF WHICH HAS A VALUE AND METAL CONTENT USED BY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR END PRODUCTS. AMR USES A VARIETY OF SHREDDING AND SEPARATION SYSTEMS TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS AND SORT RECYCLED SCRAP METAL.  CSS OPERATES A STEEL MINI-MILL IN MCMINNVILLE, OREGON THAT PRODUCES A RANGE OF FINISHED STEEL LONG PRODUCTS SUCH AS REINFORCING BAR (REBAR) AND WIRE ROD. THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ITS PRODUCTS IS FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL. CSS\u2019S STEEL MILL OBTAINS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS SCRAP METAL RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS FROM ITS INTEGRATED METALS RECYCLING AND JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS. CSS\u2019S METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS COMPRISE A COLLECTION, SHREDDING AND EXPORT OPERATION IN PORTLAND, OREGON, FOUR FEEDER YARD OPERATIONS LOCATED IN OREGON AND SOUTHERN WASHINGTON, AND ONE METALS RECYCLING JOINT VENTURE OWNERSHIP INTEREST. ADDITIONALLY, CSS PURCHASES SMALL VOLUMES OF FERROUS SCRAP METAL FROM AMR AND SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL PRIMARILY INTO THE EXPORT MARKET.  WE USE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO MEASURE OUR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CORPORATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE TO OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO SHARED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ALLOCATED FROM CORPORATE TO THE SEGMENTS. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF EXPENSE FOR MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THAT BENEFIT BOTH REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CERTAIN ITEMS TO SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BECAUSE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFORMATION IN ITS MEASUREMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. SUCH UNALLOCATED ITEMS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES, CHARGES (NET OF RECOVERIES) RELATED TO LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, AND PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS. BECAUSE OF THE UNALLOCATED INCOME AND EXPENSE, THE OPERATING INCOME OF EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT DOES NOT REFLECT THE OPERATING INCOME THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT WOULD REPORT AS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY, NET OF TAX, FROM THE RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR RECYCLED METAL IN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS AND ON THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AVAILABLE TO BE PROCESSED AT OUR FACILITIES. WE RESPOND TO CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES FOR PROCESSED METAL BY SEEKING TO ADJUST PURCHASE PRICES FOR UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING INCOME. WE BELIEVE WE GENERALLY BENEFIT FROM SUSTAINED PERIODS OF STABLE OR RISING RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES, WHICH ALLOW US TO  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  BETTER MAINTAIN OR INCREASE BOTH OPERATING INCOME AND UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL FLOW INTO OUR FACILITIES. WHEN RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES DECLINE,  EITHER SHARPLY OR  FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD, OUR OPERATING MARGINS TYPICALLY COMPRESS.  OUR DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES ON BOTH THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF THE U.S. (IN EVERETT, MASSACHUSETTS; PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND; OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA; TACOMA, WASHINGTON; AND PORTLAND, OREGON) AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES (IN KAPOLEI, HAWAII AND SALINAS, PUERTO RICO) ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY MEET THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR RECYCLED FERROUS METAL BY ENABLING US TO SHIP BULK CARGOES TO STEEL MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. OUR EXPORTS OF NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL ARE SHIPPED IN CONTAINERS THROUGH VARIOUS PUBLIC DOCKS TO SPECIALTY STEELMAKERS, FOUNDRIES, ALUMINUM SHEET AND INGOT MANUFACTURERS, COPPER REFINERIES AND SMELTERS, BRASS AND BRONZE INGOT MANUFACTURERS, WIRE AND CABLE PRODUCERS, WHOLESALERS, AND OTHER RECYCLED METAL PROCESSORS GLOBALLY. WE ALSO TRANSPORT BOTH FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS BY TRUCK, RAIL AND BARGE IN ORDER TO TRANSFER SCRAP METAL BETWEEN OUR FACILITIES FOR FURTHER PROCESSING, TO LOAD SHIPMENTS AT OUR EXPORT FACILITIES, AND TO MEET REGIONAL DOMESTIC DEMAND.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE MANUFACTURE OF WHICH USES INTERNALLY SOURCED FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL AS THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK, AS WELL AS OTHER RAW MATERIALS. OUR STEEL MILL IN OREGON SELLS TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA.  OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS FOR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL AND FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL IN OUR DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND VARYING DEMAND FOR USED AUTO PARTS FROM OUR SELF-SERVICE RETAIL STORES. CERTAIN OF THESE FACTORS ARE INFLUENCED, TO A DEGREE, BY THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL CHANGES INCLUDING SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND INHIBIT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY UTILIZING OUR PRODUCTS, SCRAP METAL COLLECTION AT OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS IN OUR YARDS, AND RETAIL ADMISSIONS AND PARTS SALES AT OUR AUTO PARTS STORES. FURTHER, TRADE ACTIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANY RETALIATION BY AFFECTED COUNTRIES, AND LICENSING AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS CAN IMPACT THE LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY ON SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, IMPEDE OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO SELL TO CERTAIN EXPORT MARKETS OR REQUIRE US TO DIRECT OUR SALES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKET DESTINATIONS, WHICH CAN CAUSE OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS TO  FLUCTUATE.  OUR OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PANDEMICS, EPIDEMICS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES, SUCH AS THE RECENT OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) WHICH HAS SPREAD FROM CHINA TO MANY OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN MARCH 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CATEGORIZED COVID-19 AS A PANDEMIC, AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES DECLARED THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK A NATIONAL EMERGENCY. THE OUTBREAK HAS RESULTED IN GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD IMPLEMENTING INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEASURES TO HELP CONTROL THE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS, INCLUDING QUARANTINES, \u201cSHELTER IN PLACE\u201d AND \u201cSTAY AT HOME\u201d ORDERS, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, BUSINESS CURTAILMENTS, SCHOOL CLOSURES, AND OTHER MEASURES. IN ADDITION, GOVERNMENTS AND CENTRAL BANKS IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE ENACTED FISCAL AND MONETARY STIMULUS MEASURES TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19.  WE ARE A COMPANY OPERATING IN A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INDUSTRY, AS DEFINED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND WITH STATE AND LOCAL ORDERS TO DATE, WE CURRENTLY CONTINUE TO OPERATE ACROSS OUR FOOTPRINT. NOTWITHSTANDING OUR CONTINUED OPERATIONS, COVID-19 HAS BEGUN TO HAVE AND MAY HAVE FURTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN, TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS AND CUSTOMERS, WHICH MAY COMPRESS OUR MARGINS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF PREVENTATIVE AND PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES THAT WE, OTHER BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS ARE TAKING. THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IS A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS ADVERSELY AFFECTING THE ECONOMIES AND FINANCIAL MARKETS OF MANY COUNTRIES. ANY RESULTING ECONOMIC DOWNTURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND CONTRIBUTE TO VOLATILE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CONDITIONS AFFECTING PRICES AND VOLUMES IN THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND RAW MATERIALS. THE PROGRESSION OF THIS MATTER COULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THROUGH THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR OPERATING LOCATIONS OR THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, DISRUPTING SCRAP METAL INFLOWS TO OUR RECYCLING FACILITIES, LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO PROCESS SCRAP METAL THROUGH OUR SHREDDERS, INHIBITING THE MANUFACTURE OF STEEL PRODUCTS AT OUR STEEL MILL, REDUCING RETAIL ADMISSIONS AND PARTS SALES AT OUR AUTO PARTS STORES, AND DELAYING OR PREVENTING DELIVERIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AMONG OTHERS.  IN ADDITION, THE ABILITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR SUPPLIERS\u2019 AND CUSTOMERS\u2019 EMPLOYEES TO WORK MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY INDIVIDUALS CONTRACTING OR BEING EXPOSED TO COVID-19, OR AS A RESULT OF THE CONTROL MEASURES NOTED ABOVE, WHICH MAY SIGNIFICANTLY HAMPER OUR PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND CONSTRICT SALES CHANNELS. OUR CUSTOMERS MAY BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY BUSINESS CURTAILMENTS OR WEAK MARKET CONDITIONS AND MAY NOT BE WILLING OR ABLE TO FULFILL THEIR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR OPEN LETTERS OF CREDIT. WE MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE DELAYS IN OBTAINING LETTERS OF CREDIT OR PROCESSING LETTER OF CREDIT PAYMENTS DUE TO THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON FOREIGN ISSUING AND U.S. INTERMEDIARY BANKS. FURTHERMORE, THE PROGRESSION OF AND GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS BEGUN TO CAUSE AND INCREASES THE RISK OF FURTHER DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND EQUIPMENT DELIVERIES RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DELAYS IN OBTAINING PERMITS FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. THE EXTENT OF SUCH DELAYS AND OTHER EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ON  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS, CERTAIN OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL,  IS  UNKNOWN, BUT  THEY  MAY  IMPACT OR DELAY THE TIMING OF ANTICIPATED BENEFITS ON CAPITAL PROJECTS.  OUR BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS. EVENTS RESULTING FROM THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLY WITH THESE COVENANTS, WHICH COULD LEAD US TO SEEK AN AMENDMENT OR WAIVERS FROM OUR LENDERS, LIMIT ACCESS TO OR REQUIRE ACCELERATED REPAYMENT OF OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, OR REQUIRE US TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING. WE HAVE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE FINANCING, IF REQUIRED, COULD BE OBTAINED AT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ON FINANCIAL MARKETS AT SUCH TIME.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SIGNED AND ENACTED INTO LAW THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY (CARES) ACT, A $2 TRILLION ECONOMIC RELIEF BILL. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE CARES ACT ON OUR BUSINESS.  SINCE THE END OF OUR SECOND QUARTER ON FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAVE BEGUN TO SEE THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON OUR MARKETS AND OPERATIONS INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN BOTH EXPORT AND DOMESTIC PRICES FOR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METAL, SOFTENING DEMAND, SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF CONTAINERS, AND OTHER LOGISTICS CONSTRAINTS. THE EXTENT TO WHICH COVID-19 MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE, INCLUDING NEW INFORMATION CONCERNING THE SEVERITY OF THE OUTBREAK AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ACTIONS GLOBALLY TO CONTAIN OR MITIGATE ITS EFFECTS. WHILE WE EXPECT THIS MATTER TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS  AND FINANCIAL POSITION, THE CURRENT LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY OVER THE ECONOMIC AND OPERATIONAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 MEANS THE RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.

FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS MATTER, REFER \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d IN PART II OF THIS REPORT.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WE GENERATED CONSOLIDATED REVENUES OF  $439 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020,  A DECREASE  OF  7%  FROM THE $474 MILLION OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO  LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS PRODUCTS, IN BOTH EXPORT AND DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND REDUCED NONFERROUS SALES VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THESE DECREASES WERE DRIVEN BY WEAKER MARKET CONDITIONS FOR MOST RECYCLED METALS, PARTICULARLY FOR FERROUS RECYCLED METALS IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET, AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE MARKET FOR CERTAIN RECYCLED NONFERROUS PRODUCTS RESULTING FROM CHINESE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND TARIFFS. COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, DOMESTIC AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR AMR\u2019S FERROUS PRODUCTS DECREASED BY 15% AND FERROUS DOMESTIC SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 20%, REFLECTING SOFTER DEMAND AND REDUCED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES DUE TO THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT. NONFERROUS REVENUES AT AMR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 12% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AS NONFERROUS AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES AND SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 5% AND 20%, RESPECTIVELY, THE EFFECTS OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES REVENUES FROM  HIGHER-PRICED PLATINUM GROUP METAL (\u201cPGM\u201d) PRODUCTS, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  QUARTER. S  TEEL REVENUES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  INCREASED BY 16% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF INCREASED FINISHED STEEL SALES VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING  INCOME  WAS $8 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $19 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING  INCOME  WAS  $14 MILLION  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $20 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH PERIOD EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, NET OF RECOVERIES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT  CHARGES, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES.

THE DECLINING PRICES LED TO A COMPRESSION OF FINISHED STEEL MARGINS IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS DECREASES IN SELLING PRICES OUTPACED THE REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. FINISHED STEEL AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECLINED 15% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FINISHED STEEL SALES VOLUMES AND BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY AND RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE HIGHER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS REFLECTED THE IMPACTS OF REDUCED PRESSURE FROM STEEL IMPORTS AND HIGHER STEEL-MAKING RAW MATERIAL COSTS AT THE TIME.  CORPORATE EXPENSE  CORPORATE SG&A EXPENSE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020 INCREASED BY $2 MILLION, OR 29%, COMPARED  TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY  DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING FROM HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS, AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES FEES.  CORPORATE SG&A EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020 WAS MATERIALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEAKER PRICE ENVIRONMENT IN THE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS MARKETS, IN FISCAL 2019 WE IMPLEMENTED PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AIMED AT DELIVERING $35 MILLION IN ANNUAL BENEFITS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTION COST EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCTIONS IN SG&A EXPENSE. OF THE TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE TARGETED BENEFITS ARE IN AMR WITH THE REMAINDER SPLIT BETWEEN CSS AND CORPORATE. FOR FISCAL 2019, WE ACHIEVED APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THESE INITIATIVES, WITH THE FULL AMOUNT  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  EXPECTED TO BE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2020.  OUR FISCAL 2020 PERFORMANCE  TO DATE  REFLECTS ACHIEVEMENT OF THE FULL QUARTERLY RUN RATE OF THESE INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL 2020 WE ALSO INITIATED AND  HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY  IMPLEMENT  ED  PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES  AIMED AT FURTHER REDUCING OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES AT CORPORATE, AMR AND CSS,  MAINLY  THROUGH  REDUCTIONS IN  NON-TRADE PROCUREMENT SPEND  ,  INCLUDING OUTSIDE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES,  LOWER EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES  AND OTHER NON-HEADCOUNT MEASURES.

WE EXPECT TO INCUR AGGREGATE ESTIMATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INITIATIVES, THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2020 AND WILL REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS. THE ESTIMATED CHARGES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COSTS OF $4 MILLION, EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS OF $2 MILLION, AND A LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH A LEASE CONTRACT TERMINATION OF $1 MILLION. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED COSTS OF $5 MILLION RELATED TO THESE INITIATIVES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2020 WAS HIGHER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE OFFICERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND OTHER EXPENSES, AS WELL AS THE AGGREGATE IMPACT OF STATE TAXES, ON THE PROJECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE APPLIED TO THE QUARTERLY RESULTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, SUPPLEMENTED BY CURRENT CASH ON HAND AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES.

CASH BALANCES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED PRIMARILY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. WE USE EXCESS CASH ON HAND TO REDUCE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.

DEBT  OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR REVOLVING LOANS OF $700 MILLION AND C$15 MILLION, MATURE IN AUGUST 2023 PURSUANT TO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND OTHER LENDERS PARTY THERETO. INTEREST RATES ON OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BASED, AT OUR OPTION, ON EITHER THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), OR THE CANADIAN EQUIVALENT FOR C$ LOANS, PLUS A SPREAD OF BETWEEN 1.25% AND 2.75%, WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE SPREAD BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO, OR THE GREATER OF (A) THE PRIME RATE, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50% OR (C) THE DAILY RATE EQUAL TO ONE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.75%, IN EACH CASE PLUS A SPREAD OF BETWEEN ZERO AND 1.50% BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO. IN ADDITION, COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITIES AT RATES BETWEEN 0.15% AND 0.45% BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO.  WE HAD BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OF  $133 MILLION  AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND $97 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES WAS  3.31%  AND 3.78% AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  WE USE THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND FINANCIAL AND OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS) OUR ABILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCUR OR SUFFER TO EXIST CERTAIN LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, INCUR OR GUARANTY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, ENTER INTO CONSOLIDATIONS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND SALES OF ASSETS, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, CHANGE THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND ENTER INTO RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDE (A) A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, DEFINED AS THE FOUR-QUARTER ROLLING SUM OF CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA LESS DEFINED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES DIVIDED BY CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGES AND (B) A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO, DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH AND CONSOLIDATED FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS REQUIRED TO BE NO LESS THAN 1.50 TO 1.00 AND WAS  2.90  TO 1.00 AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020. THE CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO WAS REQUIRED TO BE NO MORE THAN 0.55 TO 1.00 AND WAS  0.18  TO 1.00 AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE GUARANTEED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE CREDIT FACILITIES AND THE RELATED GUARANTEES ARE SECURED BY SENIOR FIRST PRIORITY LIENS ON CERTAIN OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 ASSETS, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WHILE WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE EVENT MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER NEGATIVE FACTORS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN AMENDMENT OR WAIVER FROM OUR LENDERS, A BREACH OF A FINANCIAL COVENANT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ALLOW THE LENDERS TO EXERCISE REMEDIES UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, THE MOST SEVERE OF WHICH IS THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY UNDER OUR COMMITTED BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF THE AMOUNTS OWED UNDER THE AGREEMENT. IN SUCH CASE, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE FUNDS. WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE FUNDS, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $37 MILLION FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $41 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $90 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING $50 MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, INCLUDING ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND TO SUPPORT VOLUME INITIATIVES AND OTHER GROWTH PROJECTS, USING CASH GENERATED FROM  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE PROGRESSION OF AND GLOBAL RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK  HAS BEGUN TO  CAUSE  AND  INCREASES THE RISK OF  FURTHER  DELAYS IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND  EQUIPMENT  DELIVERIES RELATED TO OUR CAPITAL PROJECTS,  INCLUDING  POTENTIAL  DELAYS IN OBTAINING PERMITS FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES  , RESULTING IN DEFERRAL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  GIVEN THE RAPID AND EVOLVING NATURE OF THE COVID-19 MATTER, THE EXTENT OF SUCH DEFERRALS IS UNCERTAIN.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  BUILDING ON OUR COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING AND OPERATING OUR BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FACILITIES THAT IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR PARAGRAPH, WE  INVESTED $5 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, AND CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $10 MILLION FOR SUCH PROJECTS  IN FISCAL 2020. THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN STORM WATER SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES THAT OWN OR OPERATE OR FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED SITES WHICH ARE PART OF OR ADJACENT TO THE PORTLAND HARBOR SUPERFUND SITE (THE \u201cSITE\u201d). SEE NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS MATTER, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES. WE BELIEVE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF COSTS WHICH WE ARE LIKELY TO OR WHICH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS WE INCUR FOR DEFENSE (INCLUDING PRE-REMEDIAL DESIGN INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES), REMEDIAL DESIGN, REMEDIAL ACTION AND MITIGATION FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THOSE POLICIES WILL COVER ALL OF THE COSTS WHICH WE MAY INCUR. SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTFLOWS IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO THE SITE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COULD RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY.  DIVIDENDS  ON  JANUARY 30, 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF $0.1875 PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.75 PER COMMON SHARE. THE DIVIDEND TOTALING $5 MILLION WAS PAID ON FEBRUARY 24, 2020.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  PURSUANT TO OUR AMENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAD EXISTING AUTHORIZATION REMAINING UNDER THE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO APPROXIMATELY  706 THOUSAND SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHEN WE DEEM SUCH REPURCHASES TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, SUCH AS TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TO OFFSET DILUTION RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CASH NEEDS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REPURCHASED 53 THOUSAND SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK IN OPEN-MARKET TRANSACTIONS FOR A TOTAL OF $0.9 MILLION.  ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, CREDIT FACILITIES AND EQUITY OFFERINGS HAVE FINANCED OUR ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER FINANCING NEEDS.  WE GENERALLY BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ANY SUCH SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

GOODWILL  WE EVALUATE GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON JULY 1 AND UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS OR SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL MAY BE IMPAIRED. THERE WERE NO TRIGGERING EVENTS IDENTIFIED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 REQUIRING AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. A LACK OF RECOVERY OR FURTHER DETERIORATION IN MARKET CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE METALS RECYCLING INDUSTRY, A SUSTAINED TREND OF WEAKER THAN ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, A LACK OF RECOVERY OR FURTHER DECLINE IN OUR SHARE PRICE FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF TIME, OR AN INCREASE IN THE MARKET-BASED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AND MAY RESULT IN FUTURE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT, IF INCURRED, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 THERE WAS A ONE FOR 15 STOCK SPLIT.  WE ARE A FULLY OPERATIONAL RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANY FOCUSED ON CANNABINOID RESEARCH.  ON FEBRUARY 16, 2020, THE COMPANY  ACQUIRED LELANTOS BIOTECH, INC., WHICH WAS INVOLVED IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN AREAS THAT WERE OF INTEREST  TO MCTC. LELANTOS WAS A RECENTLY CREATED CORPORATION AND HAD ASSETS CONSISTING ONLY OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE FORM OF TRADE  SECRETS RELATIVE TO CANNABINOID DELIVERY SYSTEMS, HAD NO LIABILITIES AND NO OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE  ACQUISITION OF LELANTOS WILL ADVANCED ITS PROGRAMS IN THE AREAS OF CANNABINOID DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT BASED ON  TECHNOLOGIES RELATING TO THESE AREAS.  OUR AIM IS TO CREATE AND COMMERCIALIZE  ENGINEERED TECHNOLOGIES TO DELIVER HEMP EXTRACTS AND CANNABINOIDS TO THE HUMAN BODY.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 2020 VERSUS 2019 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO  THE ONGOING REORGANIZATION OF THE BUSINESS, THE HIRING OF CONSULTANTS AND PREPARATION TO ACCEPT CUSTOMER ORDERS FOR NEW PRODUCTS  DEVELOPED.  INTEREST EXPENSES FOR THE FINANCIAL PERIOD  ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020 WERE $522,203 COMPARED TO $2,661 FOR THE FINANCIAL PERIOD ENDING FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

DURING THE FINANCIAL PERIOD ENDING FEBRUARY  29, 2020, NET LOSS WAS $792,196 COMPARED TO $7,343 FOR THE FINANCIAL PERIOD ENDING FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS  WAS ATTRIBUTABLE MAINLY TO INCREASED SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH THE REORGANIZATION OF THE BUSINESS, EXPENSES RELATING TO HIRING CONSULTANTS  AND GENERAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN OF NEW PRODUCT IN PREPARATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, AND INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSES.  THE NET LOSS FINANCIAL PERIOD ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020, RESULTS IN A LOSS PER SHARE OF $0.06, COMPARED TO A NEGLIGIBLE LOSS PER  SHARE ($0.00) DURING THE YEAR AGO PERIOD.  21  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF THE END OF THE QUARTERLY FINANCIAL PERIOD  ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $2,275,234 AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $157,015.

AS OF THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020,  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E), TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF ANY MATERIAL WEAKNESSES OR  SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCIES UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d). A MATERIAL WEAKNESS  IS A DEFICIENCY, OR A COMBINATION OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, SUCH THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE  POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL OR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED OR  DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. A SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY IS A DEFICIENCY, OR A COMBINATION OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT IS LESS SEVERE THAN A MATERIAL WEAKNESS, YET IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO MERIT ATTENTION BY THOSE RESPONSIBLE  FOR OVERSIGHT OF THE REGISTRANT'S FINANCIAL REPORTING.  BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, WE CONCLUDED THAT  OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WERE NOT EFFECTIVE AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY  TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  24  PART II \u2013 OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.

BHOGAL, AND RECEIVED NOTICE OF REPRESENTATION OF BOTH DEFENDANTS. THE CASE IS CURRENTLY IN ITS  EARLY PHASE, AS NEITHER DEFENDANT HAS ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT.  ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  DURING THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020, THE COMPANY ISSUED FOUR CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES HAVING AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $256,500,  AGGREGATE ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT (OID) OF $10,500, AND AGGREGATE LEGAL FEES OF $11,000, RESULTING IN AGGREGATE NET PROCEEDS TO  THE COMPANY OF $235,000. THE NOTES MATURE IN ONE YEAR FROM THE RESPECTIVE ISSUANCE DATE AND BEAR INTEREST AT THE RATE OF 10%  PER ANNUM, PAYABLE AT MATURITY. COMMENCING ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY (180) DAYS FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE DATE OF $198,750 OF THE NOTES AND  COMMENCING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCE OF $57,750 OF THE NOTES, THE NOTEHOLDERS SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO CONVERT ALL OR ANY  PART OF THE OUTSTANDING AND UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE NOTE, AT ANY TIME, INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY AT VARIABLE  CONVERSION PRICES RANGING FROM 50% - 60% OF THE LOWEST PREVIOUS FIFTEEN (15) TO TWENTY (20) TRADING DAY CLOSING TRADE PRICES OF  THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT. AS A RESULT OF THE VARIABLE CONVERSION PRICES, UPON ISSUANCE, THE COMPANY  RECOGNIZED TOTAL DEBT DISCOUNT OF $256,500, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES. THE COMPANY  IS PROHIBITED FROM EFFECTING A CONVERSION OF THE NOTE TO THE EXTENT THAT, AS A RESULT OF SUCH CONVERSION, THE NOTEHOLDER, TOGETHER  WITH ITS AFFILIATES, WOULD BENEFICIALLY OWN MORE THAN 4.99% OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING  IMMEDIATELY AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTE. AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020,  THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE NOTES WAS $27,419, NET OF DEBT DISCOUNT OF $229,081 AND ACCRUED INTEREST WAS $2,749.  AUTHORIZATION  OF PREFERRED CLASS OF COMMON STOCK  ON  DECEMBER 16, 2019, THE CORPORATION AUTHORIZED TEN MILLION (10,000,000) SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.0001 PER SHARE,  OF THE COMPANY (\"PREFERRED STOCK\") IN ONE OR MORE SERIES, AND EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZED THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY  (THE \"BOARD\"), SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS PRESCRIBED BY LAW, TO PROVIDE, OUT OF THE UNISSUED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK,  FOR SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK, AND, WITH RESPECT TO EACH SUCH SERIES, TO ESTABLISH AND FIX THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE INCLUDED  IN ANY SERIES OF PREFERRED STOCK AND THE DESIGNATION, RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, POWERS, RESTRICTIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF THE SHARES  OF SUCH SERIES. ON THIS DATE, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE DESIGNATION OF EIGHT MILLION (8,000,000) PREFERRED SHARES  AS \u201cSERIES A PREFERRED STOCK.\u201d THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IS NOT CONVERTIBLE INTO ANY OTHER FORM OF SECURITIES,  INCLUDING COMMON SHARES, OF THE COMPANY. HOLDERS OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK SHALL BE ENTITLED TO FIFTY (50) VOTES FOR EVERY SHARE  OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK BENEFICIALLY OWNED AS OF THE RECORD DATE FOR ANY SHAREHOLDER VOTE OR WRITTEN CONSENT. THESE SHARES  WERE ISSUED TO COMPANY DIRECTORS AS FOLLOW: DIRECTOR ARMAN TABATABAEI, 2 MILLION SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK; DIRECTOR  EDWARD MANOLOS, 2 MILLION SHARES OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK; DIRECTOR ROBERT L.

REFERENCES TO \u201cNOTES\u201d ARE TO THE FOOTNOTES INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY RESEARCHES, DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, SELLS, AND DISTRIBUTES FURNISHINGS AND ACCESSORIES, FOR USE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING OFFICE, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATIONAL, AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS, AND PROVIDES RELATED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OWNED CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS, DIRECT CUSTOMER SALES, INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, OWNED RETAIL STUDIOS, DIRECT-MAIL CATALOGS AND THE COMPANY'S E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  .  \u2022  NET SALES WERE  $665.7 MILLION  AND ORDERS WERE  $651.7 MILLION  , REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  7.5%  AND  6.3%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ACQUISITIONS OF HAY AND NAUGHTONE, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL LIST PRICE INCREASES. ON AN ORGANIC BASIS, NET SALES WERE  $615.9 MILLION  (*)  AND ORDERS WERE  $604.1 MILLION  , REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF  0.5%  (*)  AND  1.4%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN WAS  36.5%  AS COMPARED TO  35.7%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THIS INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF SPECIAL CHARGES TOTALING  $1.4 MILLION  RELATED TO THE INITIAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN HAY. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LIST PRICE INCREASES, LOWER STEEL COSTS, AND PROFITABILITY IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ACQUISITIONS OF HAY AND NAUGHTONE.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $19.7 MILLION  OR  11.4%  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED SPECIAL CHARGES, TOTALING  $4.7 MILLION  , RELATED TO  TRANSACTION COSTS AND INITIAL PURCHASE ACCOUNTING EFFECTS OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN HAY AND NAUGHTONE.  OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE OF  $3.5 MILLION  RELATED  PRIMARILY TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PROFIT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES.  \u2022  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  22.4%  COMPARED TO  16.0%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  \u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED  $0.02  TO $0.64  , A  3.0%  DECREASE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES, ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE $0.74  (*)  , A  15.6%  INCREASE  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  THE COMPANY DECLARED CASH DIVIDENDS OF  $0.21  PER SHARE COMPARED TO  $0.1975  PER SHARE IN THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $79 MILLION WAS MADE IN ACQUIRING AN ADDITIONAL 34% OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY OF HAY.  (*) NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS; SEE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.  26  THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S VIEW ON THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT OPERATES.  \u2022  THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE THIRD QUARTER, OUR BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA REFLECTED A MIXED MACRO-ECONOMIC PICTURE. JOB GROWTH AND ARCHITECTURAL BILLING ACTIVITY REFLECT POSITIVE TRENDS, WHILE INDUSTRY ORDER TRENDS AS REPORTED BY THE BUSINESS AND INSTITUTIONAL FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION (\"BIFMA\") HAVE VARIED IN RECENT MONTHS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS MONITORING THE RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS TRADE POLICY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND KEY TRADING PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING THE U.K. REFERENDUM TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION (\"BREXIT\"). THESE NEGOTIATIONS CREATE A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY IN KEY MARKETS, PARTICULARLY THE U.K., CONTINENTAL EUROPE AND CHINA, WHICH, IF UNRESOLVED IN THE NEAR TERM, WILL LIKELY NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMER DEMAND.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS ALSO NAVIGATING THE IMPACT OF GLOBAL TARIFFS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE, BASED UPON EXISTING CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT PRICING, STRATEGIC SOURCING ACTIONS AND PROFIT OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVES HAVE FULLY OFFSET THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA.  \u2022  THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT IS FACING CONTINUING GROSS MARGIN PRESSURE FROM INCREASING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS THAT THE PRODUCTS THEY BUY SHOULD COME WITH FREE OR DISCOUNTED SHIPPING. IN RESPONSE, THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES, INCLUDING NEGOTIATING LOWER COSTS FROM THIRD PARTY FREIGHT PROVIDERS, IMPLEMENTING ACTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF ITS LOGISTICS PROCESSES AND MORE CLOSELY REFLECTING THE COST OF DELIVERY INTO THE BASE PRICE OF ITS PRODUCTS.  THE REMAINING SECTIONS WITHIN ITEM 2 INCLUDE ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  , INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF SIGNIFICANT VARIANCES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  COVID-19 UPDATE  THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 IN CHINA DURING OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER AND WILL HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 AND IN FISCAL 2021. THIS OUTBREAK HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED OUR SUPPLY BASE, INCLUDING GOODS SHIPPED FROM CHINA IN THE QUARTER AS WELL AS RESULTED IN TEMPORARY FACILITY CLOSURES IN OTHER LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE GLOBE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. WHILE WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE PRECISE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON OUR THIRD QUARTER RESULTS, WE DO KNOW THAT THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING PLANT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA REDUCED INTERNATIONAL SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION. THE EXTENT OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD AND DURATION OF THIS NEW VIRUS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT ON OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY.  EMPLOYEE SAFETY AND HEALTH  WHILE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING PLANT IN DONGGUAN, CHINA EXPERIENCED THE INITIAL IMPACT OF COVID-19, IT WAS RUNNING AT NEAR FULL CAPACITY BY LATE MARCH. LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT FIRST INTERACTION WITH THE VIRUS LED TO A NUMBER OF EMPLOYEE SAFETY MEASURES TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, WORK-FROM-HOME PRACTICES, EXTENSIVE CLEANING PROTOCOLS, AND ULTIMATELY THE CLOSURE OF OUR SHOWROOMS AND RETAIL OUTLETS TO THE PUBLIC.  CUSTOMER FOCUS  OUR CUSTOMER SERVICE, SALES, SUPPLIER, AND DEALER TEAMS ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH CUSTOMERS TO MEET CURRENT DEMAND. SALES TEAMS ARE MEETING WITH CUSTOMERS REMOTELY VIA VIDEO CALLS AND BY LEVERAGING VIRTUAL REALITY TO CONTINUE THE DESIGN AND SPECIFICATION PROCESS THAT WOULD NORMALLY TAKE PLACE IN A SHOWROOM. CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ARE WORKING REMOTELY TO STAY CONNECTED TO CUSTOMERS REGARDING ORDER STATUS AND PROJECTED DELIVERY DATES.  MANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONS  AS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, THE COMPANY IS RESPONDING TO SHELTER-IN-PLACE AND SIMILAR GOVERNMENT ORDERS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD.  IN MICHIGAN FOR EXAMPLE, GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER\u2019S \u201cSTAY HOME, STAY SAFE\u201d EXECUTIVE ORDER REQUIRED ALL NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES TO CLOSE FOR THREE WEEKS UNTIL APRIL 13. HOWEVER, AS THE COMPANY SERVES THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AMONG OTHER CRITICAL SECTORS, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO HELP SUPPORT CUSTOMERS WHO ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE COVID-19 RESPONSE. IN AN EFFORT TO SUPPORT THE THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL WORKERS ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE BATTLE AGAINST COVID-19, THIS WORK WILL ALSO INCLUDE TRANSFORMING A PORTION OF ITS MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT TO FULFILL THE IMMEDIATE NEED FOR MEDICAL AND PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR SIMILAR EXECUTIVE ORDERS TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON ITS OPERATIONS IN OTHER AREAS.  ELSEWHERE IN THE U.S., NEMSCHOFF, WHICH ALSO SERVES THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY, CONTINUES OPERATIONS AT FULL CAPACITY IN SHEBOYGAN, WI. OPERATIONS AT MAHARAM, BASED IN YAPHANK, NY AND GEIGER, IN BOTH ITS FULTON, GA AND HILDEBRAN, NC LOCATIONS, ALSO REMAIN OPEN.  27  INTERNATIONALLY, OUTSIDE OF CHINA, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED NEAR BANGALORE, INDIA IS TEMPORARILY CLOSED UNDER A GOVERNMENT ORDER. IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS ARE SUSPENDED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. IN BRAZIL AND MEXICO, THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES, WHICH SERVE THE LATIN AMERICA REGION, ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED UNDER A GOVERNMENT ORDER.  RETAIL OPERATIONS  DWR AND HAY RETAIL STUDIOS AND STORES ACROSS THE US ARE CURRENTLY CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, BUT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN BATAVIA, OH IS STILL OPERATIONAL. FREIGHT CARRIERS ARE DELIVERING TO EVERY MARKET DOMESTICALLY BUT CHANGING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DAILY THAT MAY AFFECT DISTRIBUTION. IN SOME MARKETS THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OFFER WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY AT THIS TIME, BUT CAN COORDINATE WITH CUSTOMERS TO DELIVER PRODUCT TO THEIR DOOR. ITS ECOMMERCE PLATFORMS ARE OPERATING, HOWEVER, THIS WILL NOT OFFSET THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE STUDIOS AND STORES.  COST REDUCTIONS  THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED A RANGE OF ACTIONS AIMED AT TEMPORARILY REDUCING COSTS AND PRESERVING LIQUIDITY. THESE ACTIONS INCLUDE A 10% REDUCTION IN CASH COMPENSATION FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S SALARIED WORKFORCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS IMMEDIATELY SUSPENDING CERTAIN EMPLOYER-PAID RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND WILL SUSPEND PREVIOUSLY PLANNED COMPENSATION INCREASES AND CASH INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAMS FOR THE UPCOMING FISCAL YEAR ENDING MAY 2021. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE FURTHER WAYS TO MANAGE COSTS IN LINE WITH REDUCED REVENUE LEVELS.  RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THIS REPORT CONTAINS REFERENCES TO ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. ORGANIC GROWTH (DECLINE) REPRESENTS THE CHANGE IN NET SALES, EXCLUDING CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS AND THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS. ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE REPRESENTS REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT FROM ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, AMORTIZATION OF AN INVENTORY STEP UP ON THE HAY EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT, A GAIN ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES AND OTHER SPECIAL CHARGES OR GAINS, INCLUDING RELATED TAXES. RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES INCLUDE ACTIONS INVOLVING FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION AND OPTIMIZATION, TARGETED WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH AN EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM. SPECIAL CHARGES INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO CEO TRANSITION, THIRD PARTY CONSULTING COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PROFIT ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, AND ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES PRESENTING ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON A MORE COMPARATIVE BASIS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  ORGANIC NET SALES AND ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE - DILUTED ARE NOT MEASUREMENTS OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO THE RELATED GAAP MEASUREMENT. THESE NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. OUR PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INDICATION THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT ITEMS. WE COMPENSATE FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY PROVIDING PROMINENCE OF OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ONLY AS A SUPPLEMENT.  28  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NET SALES TO ORGANIC NET SALES FOR THE PERIODS ENDED AS INDICATED BELOW.

AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY HAD A WELL-POSITIONED BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROFILE TO WEATHER THESE DISRUPTIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, THE COMPANY HAS ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY THROUGH CREDIT FACILITIES, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THESE SOURCES HAVE BEEN SUMMARIZED BELOW.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO  NOTE 14  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  (IN MILLIONS)  FEBRUARY 29, 2020  JUNE 1, 2019  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $110.6  $159.2  MARKETABLE SECURITIES  8.9  8.8  AVAILABILITY UNDER SYNDICATED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT  265.5  165.0  TOTAL LIQUIDITY  $385.0  $333.0  AT THE END OF THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020  , THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $110.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $94.6 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $8.9 MILLION  HELD BY ONE OF ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES.  THE SUBSIDIARY HOLDING THE COMPANY'S MARKETABLE SECURITIES IS TAXED AS A UNITED STATES TAXPAYER AT THE COMPANY'S ELECTION.  CONSEQUENTLY, FOR TAX PURPOSES, ALL UNITED STATES TAX IMPACTS FOR THIS SUBSIDIARY HAVE BEEN RECORDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REPATRIATE $23 MILLION IN CASH HELD IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND AS SUCH HAS RECORDED A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON THESE FUTURE DIVIDENDS RECEIVED IN THE U.S. FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF $0.5 MILLION. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS CASH WAS PREVIOUSLY TAXED UNDER THE U.S. TAX CUT AND JOBS ACT (TCJA) ONE-TIME U.S. TAX LIABILITY ON UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REMAIN INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE U.S.  THE COMPANY\u2019S SYNDICATED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT, WHICH EXPIRES ON AUGUST 28, 2024, PROVIDES THE COMPANY WITH UP TO $500 MILLION IN REVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST BORROWING CAPACITY AND INCLUDES AN \"ACCORDION FEATURE\" ALLOWING THE COMPANY TO INCREASE, AT ITS OPTION AND SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE PARTICIPATING BANKS, THE AGGREGATE BORROWING CAPACITY OF THE FACILITY BY UP TO $250 MILLION. OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS BEAR INTEREST AT RATES BASED ON THE PRIME RATE, FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, LIBOR OR NEGOTIATED RATES AS OUTLINED IN THE AGREEMENT. INTEREST IS PAYABLE PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD IF BORROWINGS ARE OUTSTANDING.  AS OF FEBRUARY 29, 2020, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING RELATED TO BORROWINGS UNDER THE SYNDICATED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WAS $225.0 MILLION WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS AGAINST THIS FACILITY OF $265.5 MILLION. SINCE THE END OF THE QUARTER, THE COMPANY WITHDREW $265 MILLION.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS FINANCIAL RESOURCES WILL ALLOW IT TO MANAGE THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHICH WILL INCLUDE MATERIALLY REDUCED REVENUE AND PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY. THE CHALLENGES POSED BY COVID-19 ON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS HAVE EVOLVED RAPIDLY IN THE PAST TWO MONTHS AND ARE LIKELY TO EVOLVE FURTHER. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION IN LIGHT OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATING TO COVID-19.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING BUSINESS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WILL REQUIRE CASH PAYMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. A TABLE SUMMARIZING THE AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED TIMING OF THESE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS AS OF  JUNE 1, 2019  WAS PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  JUNE 1, 2019  .

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF MEDICAL, SURGICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES USED BY PROFESSIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FOR VASCULAR ACCESS, FOR THE TREATMENT OF PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE AND FOR USE IN ONCOLOGY AND SURGICAL SETTINGS. OUR DEVICES ARE GENERALLY USED IN MINIMALLY INVASIVE, IMAGE-GUIDED PROCEDURES. MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED ONCE AND THEN DISCARDED, OR THEY MAY BE TEMPORARILY IMPLANTED FOR SHORT- OR LONGER-TERM USE.  OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS CROSS A VARIETY OF MARKETS. OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS IMPACTED BY CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS, WHICH HAVE INCLUDED AN EMERGENCE OF VALUE-BASED PURCHASING BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, CONSOLIDATION OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS, THE INCREASED ROLE OF THE CONSUMER IN HEALTH CARE DECISION-MAKING AND AN AGING POPULATION, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, OUR GROWTH IS IMPACTED BY CHANGES WITHIN OUR SECTOR, SUCH AS THE MERGING OF COMPETITORS TO GAIN SCALE AND INFLUENCE; CHANGES IN THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT FOR MEDICAL DEVICE; AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY.  OUR SALES AND PROFITABILITY GROWTH ALSO DEPENDS, IN PART, ON THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH ONGOING ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS. EXPANSIONS TO OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE CREATED THROUGH INTERNAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, TECHNOLOGY LICENSING AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND FEEL CONFIDENT THAT OUR EXISTING CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FREE CASH FLOW GENERATION WILL ALLOW US TO PROPERLY FUND THOSE ACTIVITIES.  WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES PRIMARILY THROUGH A DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. THROUGH A COMBINATION OF A DIRECT SALES AND DISTRIBUTOR RELATIONSHIPS. WE EXPECT OUR BUSINESSES TO GROW IN BOTH SALES AND PROFITABILITY THROUGH GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, MARKET PENETRATION, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND INCREASING OUR DIRECT PRESENCE INTERNATIONALLY.  ON DECEMBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE C3 WAVE TIP LOCATION ASSET FROM MEDICAL COMPONENTS INC. FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $10.0 MILLION WITH $5.0 MILLION OF POTENTIAL FUTURE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO TECHNICAL MILESTONES. THIS ACQUISITION FILLS A GAP IN THE VASCULAR ACCESS PORTFOLIO AND SUPPORTS THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC PLAN.  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THIS ACQUISITION AS AN ASSET PURCHASE.  THE COMPANY RECORDED THE AMOUNT PAID AT CLOSING AS INVENTORY  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OF $0.6 MILLION AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF A TRADEMARK OF $0.9 MILLION AND PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY OF $8.5 MILLION.  THE INTANGIBLE ASSET WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER 15 YEARS.   THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION COMPRISES TECHNICAL MILESTONES AND WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN THE CONTINGENCY IS RESOLVED OR BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE UNDER ASC 450.  ON OCTOBER 2, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SHARE PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE EXIMO MEDICAL, LTD., A PRE-COMMERCIAL STAGE MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANY AND ITS PROPRIETARY 355NM B LASER ATHERECTOMY TECHNOLOGY.  THE AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $60.7 MILLION INCLUDED AN UPFRONT PAYMENT OF $45.8 MILLION AND CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $14.9 MILLION.  THIS ACQUISITION EXPANDS AND COMPLEMENTS THE COMPANY\u2019S VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS AND THERAPIES PRODUCT PORTFOLIO BY ADDING THE 355NM B LASER ATHERECTOMY TECHNOLOGY WHICH TREATS PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE.  ON MAY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF THE NAMIC FLUID MANAGEMENT BUSINESS (THE \u201cDIVESTITURE\u201d) AND ALL OF THE ASSETS USED PRIMARILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE FLUID MANAGEMENT BUSINESS TO MEDLINE INDUSTRIES, INC. (\u201cMEDLINE\u201d) PURSUANT TO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED APRIL 17, 2019 (THE \u201cASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d).  TOTAL CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE DIVESTITURE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $169.2 MILLION IN CASH AND RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $46.6 MILLION AFTER WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS OF $0.6 MILLION.  A PORTION OF THE NET PROCEEDS WERE USED ON JUNE 3, 2019 TO RETIRE THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING FACILITY AND THE REMAINING NET PROCEEDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVESTED IN THE BUSINESS.  THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC MAY POSE SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS. IT IS TOO EARLY TO QUANTIFY THE IMPACT THIS SITUATION WILL HAVE ON REVENUE AND PROFITS FOR THE REMAINDER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2020 OR BEYOND, BUT THE PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS BEING UNDERTAKEN TO REDUCE SPREAD OF THE VIRUS ARE AND MAY CONTINUE TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER DEMAND, HOSPITAL OPERATING PROCEDURES AND WORKFLOW, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS AND THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT IS EVALUATING THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY POSITION, COMMUNICATING WITH AND MONITORING THE ACTIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, AND REVIEWING OUR NEAR-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AS WE MANAGE THE COMPANY THROUGH THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  1.  OUR FIELD BASED SALES PERSONNEL ARE RESTRICTED FROM TRAVELING, BOTH IN THE INTERESTS OF THEIR HEALTH AS WELL AS AT THE REQUEST OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS THEY SEEK TO INCREASE CRITICAL CARE CAPACITY;  2.  OUR OFFICE-BASED EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO WORK REMOTELY, AND  3.  OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN QUEENSBURY, NEW YORK IS OPERATING UNDER OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN WITH PRECAUTIONS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CREATING SMALL \u201cWORK PODS\u201d, INCREASING DISTANCING AND REGULARLY MONITORING TEMPERATURES.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT GUIDANCE AND RESTRICTIONS FROM THE CENTER FOR MEDICAID SERVICES, HOSPITALS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS TO REDUCE \u201cELECTIVE-LIKE\u201d PROCEDURES AND PRIORITIZE CRITICAL CARE AND CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE IMPACT ON CERTAIN PROCEDURE VOLUMES TO WHICH CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS RELATE.  AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW, WE WILL CLOSELY MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES THROUGH THE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  IN EVALUATING THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON REVENUE, GROSS MARGIN, OPERATING INCOME, EARNINGS PER SHARE AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. A SUMMARY OF THESE KEY FINANCIAL METRICS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  \u2022  REVENUE INCREASED BY 6.5% TO $69.8 MILLION  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED 40 BPS TO 57.8%  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS INCREASED BY $2.6 MILLION TO $6.2 MILLION  \u2022  LOSS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS INCREASED BY $0.03 TO A LOSS OF $0.15  NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020.  \u2022  REVENUE INCREASED BY 3.2% TO $205.8 MILLION  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN INCREASED 80 BPS TO 58.3%  \u2022  OPERATING LOSS DECREASED BY $1.8 MILLION TO $10.5 MILLION  \u2022  LOSS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IMPROVED BY $0.11 TO A LOSS OF $0.26  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN NOTE 1 TO NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR FORM 10-K. WHILE ALL THESE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE VIEW CERTAIN OF THESE POLICIES AS CRITICAL. POLICIES DETERMINED TO BE CRITICAL ARE THOSE POLICIES THAT HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE US TO USE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND/OR ESTIMATES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  AS OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, THE FOLLOWING UPDATES WERE MADE AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  INTANGIBLE ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL, INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND IN PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\"IP R&D\") ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES, WHICH RANGE BETWEEN TWO TO EIGHTEEN YEARS, ON EITHER A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE EXPECTED PERIOD OF BENEFIT OR AS REVENUES ARE EARNED FROM THE SALES OF THE RELATED PRODUCTS. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND REVIEW SUCH ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET IS CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT WILL EQUAL THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT RATHER, ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF IMPAIRMENT INDICATORS ARISE. GOODWILL REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NET TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN EACH BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE BEEN RECORDED AT EITHER INCURRED OR ALLOCATED COST. ALLOCATED COSTS WERE BASED ON RESPECTIVE FAIR MARKET VALUES AT THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.  FOR GOODWILL, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO WHICH THE GOODWILL IS ASSIGNED TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THAT REPORTING UNIT. THE DETERMINATION OF REPORTING UNITS ALSO REQUIRES MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS WHETHER A REPORTING UNIT EXISTS WITHIN A REPORTABLE SEGMENT BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF DISCRETE FINANCIAL INFORMATION. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL IS REDUCED TO ITS FAIR VALUE THROUGH AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE GOODWILL BALANCE, RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.  WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE WE TEST INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS. BASED UPON THE ULTIMATE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE COVID-19 GLOBAL PANDEMIC, THERE MAY BE MATERIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE WITH RESPECT TO OUR GOODWILL AND OTHER LONG LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF SUCH ASSETS.  THE COMPANY OPERATES AS A SINGLE OPERATING SEGMENT WITH ONE REPORTING UNIT AND CONSEQUENTLY EVALUATES GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BASED ON AN EVALUATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE MARKET VALUATION APPROACH AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS NOT MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNIT WAS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  INFORMATION REGARDING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 18 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020, THE COMPANY REPORTED NET LOSS OF $5.7 MILLION, OR $0.15 PER DILUTED SHARE, ON NET SALES OF $69.8 MILLION, COMPARED WITH NET LOSS OF $4.6 MILLION FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, OR $0.12 LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE, ON NET SALES OF $65.5 MILLION DURING THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET SALES  NET SALES  -  NET SALES ARE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS AND RELATED FREIGHT CHARGES, LESS DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS.

VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS & THERAPIES  \u2022  TOTAL VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS & THERAPIES SALES INCREASED $1.3 MILLION PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE ANGIOVAC BUSINESS WHICH GREW $1.5 MILLION AND IN CORE PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS WHICH GREW $1.3 MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR.  DURING THE QUARTER, THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO SEE STRONG CASE VOLUMES IN ANGIOVAC, WHICH INCREASED 33% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO INCREASED ADOPTION OF THE COMPANY'S UNIQUE TECHNOLOGY AND THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF THE ANGIOVAC PRODUCT.  THERE WAS $0.2 MILLION IN SALES OF THE ATHERECTOMY PRODUCT THAT WAS ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE EXIMO ACQUISITION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TERMINATION OF THE ASCLERA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTRIBUTED $1.7 MILLION OF REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  U.S. VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS & THERAPIES SALES INCREASED $0.5 MILLION DUE TO INCREASED CASE VOLUME IN ANGIOVAC AND INCREASED CORE PERIPHERAL PRODUCT SALES WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TERMINATION OF THE ASCLERA DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTRIBUTED $1.7 MILLION OF REVENUE IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  INTERNATIONAL VASCULAR INTERVENTIONS & THERAPIES SALES INCREASED $0.8 MILLION.

ONCOLOGY  \u2022  TOTAL ONCOLOGY SALES INCREASED $0.7 MILLION YEAR OVER YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NANOKNIFE CAPITAL SALES OF $1.0 MILLION AND INCREASED NANOKNIFE DISPOSABLE SALES OF $0.5 MILLION.  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SALES OF RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION DISPOSABLES.  \u2022  U.S. ONCOLOGY SALES DECREASED BY $0.1 MILLION DUE TO A DECREASE IN RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION AND MICROWAVE DISPOSABLE SALES.

ON JUNE 3, 2019 AND IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE FLUID MANAGEMENT DIVESTITURE, THE COMPANY REPAID ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ENTERED INTO A NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A $125.0 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH INCLUDES AN UNCOMMITTED EXPANSION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO INCREASE THE TOTAL REVOLVING COMMITMENTS AND/OR ADD NEW TRANCHES OF TERM LOANS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $75.0 MILLION.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS, AND ACCELERATION, INDEMNITY AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TWO FINANCIAL COVENANTS. ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF NOT LESS THAN 1.25 TO 1.00. THE OTHER FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO OF NOT GREATER THAN 3.00 TO 1.00.  THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO IS BASED UPON OUR TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS TOTAL ADJUSTED EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT).  THE AMOUNT THAT WE CAN BORROW UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT IS DIRECTLY BASED ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO.  ON DECEMBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY MADE A $15.0 MILLION DRAW ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE C3 WAVE TIP LOCATION ASSET FROM MEDICAL COMPONENTS INC. THAT IS DESCRIBED NOTE 2 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED NEEDS FOR CAPITAL FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IF WE SEEK TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES OR TECHNOLOGIES IN THE FUTURE FOR CASH, WE MAY REQUIRE EXTERNAL FINANCING.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ANGIODYNAMICS INC", "CIK": 1275187, "Date": "2020-04-08T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ANGO", "Name": "Angiodynamics Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3841.0, "Business": "NY", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 113146460.0, "key": "20200408ANGO", "labelr1": 5.2261306532663445, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -8.50047755491882, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.59494674, "prof1": 0.40505326, "return1&2": 0.9477386934673364, "return1&2&3": 1.0283010083848083, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0283010083848083, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 0.9477386934673364, "return3": 1.0850047755491885, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 5.2261306532663365, "cumulative_return1": 0.034795468143964815, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3821, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0848741689154406, "cumreturn1b": 1.2044219859792131, "cumreturn1c": 1.146049261383109, "cumreturndow": 1.1292532151386359, "cumreturnsp500": 1.132540314685286}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3823, "level_0": 3930, "index": 8892, "text": "ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  KINGSWAY IS A DELAWARE HOLDING COMPANY WITH OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE COMPANY OWNS OR CONTROLS SUBSIDIARIES PRIMARILY IN THE EXTENDED WARRANTY, ASSET MANAGEMENT AND REAL ESTATE INDUSTRIES.  KINGSWAY CONDUCTS ITS BUSINESS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: EXTENDED WARRANTY AND LEASED REAL ESTATE.  THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED ITS BUSINESS THROUGH A THIRD REPORTABLE SEGMENT, INSURANCE UNDERWRITING.  INSURANCE UNDERWRITING INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY: MENDOTA INSURANCE COMPANY, MENDAKOTA INSURANCE COMPANY, MENDAKOTA CASUALTY COMPANY, KINGSWAY AMIGO INSURANCE COMPANY (\"AMIGO\") AND KINGSWAY REINSURANCE CORPORATION (\"KINGSWAY RE\").  MENDOTA INSURANCE COMPANY, MENDAKOTA INSURANCE COMPANY AND MENDAKOTA CASUALTY COMPANY ARE REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY HEREIN AS \"MENDOTA.\"  ON JULY 16, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL MENDOTA.  ON OCTOBER 18, 2018, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT THE SALE WAS COMPLETED.  AS A RESULT, MENDOTA HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS ARE REPORTED SEPARATELY FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CLASSIFYING MENDOTA AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, THE REMAINING COMPOSITION OF THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT NO LONGER MEETS THE CRITERIA OF A REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  AS SUCH, ALL SEGMENTED INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO EXCLUDE THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.   THE OPERATING RESULTS OF AMIGO AND KINGSWAY RE, PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT, ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET.  EXTENDED WARRANTY INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY: IWS ACQUISITION CORPORATION (\"IWS\"), TRINITY WARRANTY SOLUTIONS LLC (\"TRINITY\"), PROFESSIONAL WARRANTY SERVICE CORPORATION (\"PWSC\") AND GEMINUS HOLDING COMPANY, INC. (\"GEMINUS\").  THROUGHOUT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, THE TERM \"EXTENDED WARRANTY\" IS USED TO REFER TO THIS SEGMENT.  IWS IS A LICENSED MOTOR VEHICLE SERVICE AGREEMENT COMPANY AND IS A PROVIDER OF AFTER-MARKET VEHICLE PROTECTION SERVICES DISTRIBUTED BY CREDIT UNIONS IN  23  STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA TO THEIR MEMBERS.  TRINITY SELLS HEATING, VENTILATION, AIR CONDITIONING (\"HVAC\"), STANDBY GENERATOR, COMMERCIAL LED LIGHTING AND REFRIGERATION WARRANTY PRODUCTS AND PROVIDES EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWN AND MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICES TO COMPANIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.  AS A SELLER OF WARRANTY PRODUCTS, TRINITY MARKETS AND ADMINISTERS PRODUCT WARRANTY CONTRACTS FOR CERTAIN NEW AND USED PRODUCTS IN THE HVAC, STANDBY GENERATOR, COMMERCIAL LED LIGHTING AND REFRIGERATION INDUSTRIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES.  TRINITY ACTS AS AN AGENT ON BEHALF OF THE THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT UNDERWRITE AND GUARANTY THESE WARRANTY CONTRACTS.

PENN AND PRIME DISTRIBUTE THESE PRODUCTS VIA INDEPENDENT USED CAR DEALERSHIPS AND FRANCHISED CAR DEALERSHIPS, RESPECTIVELY.  50  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  LEASED REAL ESTATE INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, CMC INDUSTRIES, INC. (\"CMC\").  CMC OWNS, THROUGH AN INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY (THE \"PROPERTY OWNER\"), A PARCEL OF REAL PROPERTY CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY  192  ACRES LOCATED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS (THE \"REAL PROPERTY\"), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO A LONG-TERM TRIPLE NET LEASE AGREEMENT.  THE REAL PROPERTY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO A MORTGAGE, WHICH IS RECORDED AS NOTE PAYABLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (THE \"MORTGAGE\").  THROUGHOUT MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, THE TERM \"LEASED REAL ESTATE\" IS USED TO REFER TO THIS SEGMENT.  IMPACT OF COVID-19  IN MARCH 2020, THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 CAUSED BY A NOVEL STRAIN OF THE CORONAVIRUS WAS RECOGNIZED AS A PANDEMIC BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, AND THE OUTBREAK HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS HAD A NOTABLE IMPACT ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF MANY BUSINESSES; \u201cSHELTER IN PLACE\u201d AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS; AND REDUCED CONSUMER SPENDING DUE TO BOTH JOB LOSSES AND OTHER EFFECTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COVID-19.  THERE REMAIN MANY UNKNOWNS.  THE NEAR-TERM IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ARE PRIMARILY WITH RESPECT TO OUR EXTENDED WARRANTY SEGMENT.  AS CONSUMER SPENDING HAS BEEN IMPACTED, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN THE PURCHASE OF NEW AND USED VEHICLES, AND MANY BUSINESSES THROUGH WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS REMAIN CLOSED, WE HAVE SEEN CASH FLOWS BEING AFFECTED BY A REDUCTION IN NEW WARRANTY SALES FOR VEHICLE SERVICE AGREEMENTS.  WITH RESPECT TO HOMEOWNER WARRANTIES, WE EXPECT TO SEE A REDUCTION IN NEW ENROLLMENTS IN OUR HOME WARRANTY PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON NEW HOME SALES IN THE UNITED STATES.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SIGNED THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY (\"CARES\") ACT, A SUBSTANTIAL TAX-AND-SPENDING PACKAGE INTENDED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC STIMULUS TO ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK CLOSELY, AS WELL AS ANY EFFECTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE CARES ACT.  HOWEVER, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK WILL IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE  THROUGHOUT THIS QUARTERLY REPORT, WE PRESENT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE WAY WE BELIEVE WILL BE MOST MEANINGFUL, USEFUL AND TRANSPARENT TO ANYONE USING THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE.  OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"U.S. GAAP\") FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. GAAP PRESENTATION OF NET LOSS, WE PRESENT SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AS A NON-U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS VALUABLE IN MANAGING OUR BUSINESS AND DRAWING COMPARISONS TO OUR PEERS.  BELOW IS A DEFINITION OF OUR NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO U.S. GAAP.  SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME REPRESENTS ONE MEASURE OF THE PRETAX PROFITABILITY OF OUR SEGMENTS AND IS DERIVED BY SUBTRACTING DIRECT SEGMENT EXPENSES FROM DIRECT SEGMENT REVENUES.  REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE PRESENTED IN THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, BUT ARE NOT SUBTOTALED BY SEGMENT; HOWEVER, THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN TOTAL AND BY SEGMENT IN NOTE  20  , \"  SEGMENTED INFORMATION  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REGARDING REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION.  THE NEAREST COMPARABLE U.S. GAAP MEASURE IS INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE THAT, IN ADDITION TO SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME, INCLUDES NET INVESTMENT INCOME, NET REALIZED GAINS, GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS, GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE, NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAIN ON PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS, INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT AND EQUITY IN NET (LOSS) INCOME OF INVESTEE.  A RECONCILIATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAX (BENEFIT) EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  IS PRESENTED IN TABLE 1 OF THE \"RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\" SECTION OF MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  51  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS  THE PREPARATION OF UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  ESTIMATES AND THEIR UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS ARE REVIEWED ON AN ONGOING BASIS.  CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN THE ACCOUNTING PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED.  THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE PROVISION FOR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES; VALUATION OF FIXED MATURITIES AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS; IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS; VALUATION OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE; VALUATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS; VALUATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES; VALUATION OF MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK; VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS; GOODWILL RECOVERABILITY; DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS; FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTIONS FOR SUBORDINATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS; AND REVENUE RECOGNITION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT.  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE SUBSEQUENT TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO THE INFORMATION PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE  2018  ANNUAL REPORT WITH RESPECT TO THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.  RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS  A RECONCILIATION OF TOTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  IS PRESENTED IN TABLE 1 BELOW.

INCOME (LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND NET INCOME (LOSS)  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REPORTED INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF  $3.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO A LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS OF  $2.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING INCOME IN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND LEASED REAL ESTATE, NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET.  THE LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET AND LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OPERATING INCOME IN EXTENDED WARRANTY AND LEASED REAL ESTATE, NET INVESTMENT INCOME AND GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REPORTED NET INCOME OF  $3.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF  $2.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  EXTENDED WARRANTY  THE EXTENDED WARRANTY SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME  INCREASE  D  1.0%  TO  $9.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  $9.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE INCREASE IN SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME RESULTS FROM THE INCLUSION OF GEMINUS IN 2019 FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES AT TRINITY.  GEMINUS SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME WAS  $0.9 MILLION  AND  ZERO  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  TRINITY MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES WERE LOWER DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AS A RESULT LESS SEVERE WEATHER, WHICH HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICES, AS WELL AS LOSS OF CLIENT ACCOUNTS.  THE EXTENDED WARRANTY OPERATING INCOME WAS  $0.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  $0.8 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING INCOME AT TRINITY, REFLECTING THE LOWER MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES, AND THE INCLUSION OF GEMINUS IN 2019 FOLLOWING ITS ACQUISITION EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2019.  GEMINUS OPERATING INCOME WAS A LOSS OF $0.1 MILLION AND ZERO FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF SERVICES SOLD DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH TRINITY\u2019S MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES, THE DECREASE IN SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME THAT RESULTED FROM LOWER MAINTENANCE SUPPORT SERVICE FEES AT TRINITY HAD A MUCH LESS SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME.  LEASED REAL ESTATE  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , LEASED REAL ESTATE RENTAL INCOME WAS  $3.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $3.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE RENTAL INCOME IS DERIVED FROM CMC'S LONG-TERM TRIPLE NET LEASE.  THE LEASED REAL ESTATE OPERATING INCOME WAS  $0.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  $0.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .   THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER LITIGATION EXPENSES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  SEE NOTE  23  , \"  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.  LEASED REAL ESTATE OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $1.5 MILLION  AND  $1.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  SEE \"INVESTMENTS\" SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  NET INVESTMENT INCOME  NET INVESTMENT INCOME WAS  $0.7 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  NET REALIZED GAINS  NET REALIZED GAINS WERE  $0.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $0.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS  GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS WAS  $0.1 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $1.2 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDES REALIZED GAINS OF  $0.0 MILLION  AND  $0.6 MILLION  ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS SOLD DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS HELD OF  $0.1 MILLION  AND  $0.6 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE  GAIN (LOSS) ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE WAS A GAIN OF  $4.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO A LOSS OF  $0.9 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .   THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $4.2 MILLION INCREASE IN  53  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  FAIR VALUE OF 1347 INVESTORS RECORDED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO A $1.4 MILLION DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF 1347 INVESTORS RECORDED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN 1347 INVESTORS IS CALCULATED BASED ON A MODEL THAT DISTRIBUTES THE NET EQUITY OF 1347 INVESTORS TO ALL CLASSES OF MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS. THE MODEL USES QUOTED MARKET PRICES AND SIGNIFICANT MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT INPUT TO THE MODEL IS THE OBSERVED STOCK PRICE OF LIMBACH HOLDINGS, INC. (\"LIMBACH\") COMMON STOCK.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT IN 1347 INVESTORS WAS DISSOLVED, WHICH RESULTED IN THE COMPANY HOLDING SHARES OF LIMBACH COMMON STOCK DIRECTLY.  DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, THE LIMBACH COMMON STOCK PRICE HAS DECLINED, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A LOWER VALUATION OF 1347 INVESTORS THROUGH THE DATE OF DISSOLUTION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE LIMBACH COMMON STOCK HELD DIRECTLY.  NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAIN ON PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS  NET CHANGE IN UNREALIZED GAIN ON PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS WAS  $0.0 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  ZERO  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT LOSS  AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY THE COMPANY TO DETERMINE DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE THAT ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, THE COMPANY RECORDED WRITE-DOWNS OF  $0.1 MILLION  AND  ZERO  FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  WAS  $2.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $1.7 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GENERALLY HIGHER LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED INTEREST RATES FOR THREE-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR DEPOSITS (\"LIBOR\") DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT BEARS INTEREST AT THE RATE OF LIBOR, PLUS SPREADS RANGING FROM 3.85% TO 4.20%.  INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ALSO INCLUDES $0.1 MILLION RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ACQUISITION OF GEMINUS.  SEE NOTE  5  , \"  ACQUISITION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET WAS A NET EXPENSE OF  $1.8 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO A NET EXPENSE OF  $2.4 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  .  INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS ARE EXPENSES OF $0.4 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION FOR AMIGO FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AMIGO WAS PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT ALONG WITH MENDOTA, MENDAKOTA AND MCC.  AS A CONSEQUENCE OF CLASSIFYING MENDOTA, MENDAKOTA AND MCC AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, THE REMAINING COMPOSITION OF THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT NO LONGER MEETS THE CRITERIA OF A REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  AS SUCH, ALL SEGMENTED INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO EXCLUDE THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.   THE OPERATING RESULTS OF AMIGO PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED IN THE INSURANCE UNDERWRITING SEGMENT ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES NOT ALLOCATED TO SEGMENTS, NET.

THE LENGTH OF TIME A FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT MAY BE HELD IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION MAY VARY BASED ON THE OPINION OF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE ANALYSES RELATED TO VALUATION AND TO THE VARIOUS CREDIT RISKS THAT MAY PREVENT US FROM RECAPTURING THE PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT.  IN THE CASE OF A FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT WHERE THE INVESTMENT MANAGER DETERMINES THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO RISK OF DEFAULT PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF A HOLDING, WE WOULD ELECT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION UNTIL THE PRICE RECOVERS OR THE INVESTMENT MATURES.  IN SITUATIONS WHERE FACTS EMERGE THAT MIGHT INCREASE THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH RECAPTURE OF PRINCIPAL, THE COMPANY MAY ELECT TO SELL A FIXED MATURITY INVESTMENT AT A LOSS.

SUBORDINATED DEBT  BETWEEN DECEMBER 4, 2002 AND DECEMBER 16, 2003, SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF THE COMPANY ISSUED $90.5 MILLION OF 30-YEAR CAPITAL SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES IN SEPARATE PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS.  IN EACH INSTANCE, A CORRESPONDING FLOATING RATE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEFERRABLE INTEREST DEBENTURE WAS THEN ISSUED BY KINGSWAY AMERICA INC. TO THE TRUST IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROCEEDS FROM THE PRIVATE SALE.  THE FLOATING RATE DEBENTURES BEAR INTEREST AT THE RATE OF LIBOR, PLUS SPREADS RANGING FROM 3.85% TO 4.20%.  THE COMPANY HAS THE RIGHT TO CALL EACH OF THESE SECURITIES AT PAR VALUE ANY TIME AFTER FIVE YEARS FROM THEIR ISSUANCE UNTIL THEIR MATURITY.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY GAVE NOTICE TO ITS TRUST PREFERRED TRUSTEES OF ITS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS VOLUNTARY RIGHT TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR UP TO 20 QUARTERS, PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF ITS OUTSTANDING TRUST PREFERRED INDENTURES, WHICH PERMIT INTEREST DEFERRAL. THIS ACTION DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DEFAULT UNDER THE COMPANY'S TRUST PREFERRED INDENTURES OR ANY OF ITS OTHER DEBT INDENTURES.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , DEFERRED INTEREST PAYABLE OF  $4.1 MILLION  IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT IS MEASURED AND REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT IS  $50.4 MILLION  .  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT IS CALCULATED USING A MODEL BASED ON SIGNIFICANT MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND INPUTS DEVELOPED BY A THIRD PARTY.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE MARKET OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND INPUTS DEVELOPED BY A THIRD PARTY USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, SEE NOTE  21  , \"  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES CHANGED, AND THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A DECREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION DEVELOPED BY THE THIRD PARTY.  CHANGES IN THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES AFFECT THE FAIR VALUE MODEL IN DIFFERENT WAYS.  AN INCREASE IN THE LIBOR SWAP RATES HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT WHILE AN INCREASE IN THE RISK-FREE SWAP RATES HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FAIR VALUE.  THE INCREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S SUBORDINATED DEBT WHILE A DECREASE IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE.  THE OTHER PRIMARY VARIABLE AFFECTING THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT CALCULATION IS THE PASSAGE OF TIME, WHICH WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT.   THE CHANGES TO THE CREDIT SPREAD AND SWAP RATE VARIABLES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , ALONG WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, CONTRIBUTED TO THE  $0.4 MILLION  INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT BETWEEN  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2019.  OF THE  $0.4 MILLION  INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT BETWEEN  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  $0.9 MILLION  IS REPORTED AS INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK IN THE COMPANY'S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AND  $0.6 MILLION  IS REPORTED AS GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-01, A CUMULATIVE  $40.5 MILLION  CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF SUBORDINATED DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED DEFICIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018.  AS LONG AS THE COMPANY REPAYS ITS SUBORDINATED DEBT AT MATURITY, IT CAN BE EXPECTED THAT THIS  $40.5 MILLION  RECLASSIFICATION WILL REVERSE WITHOUT BEING REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THOUGH CHANGES IN THE MARKET OBSERVABLE SWAP RATES WILL CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE SOME VOLATILITY EACH QUARTER TO THE COMPANY\u2019S REPORTED GAIN OR LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, CHANGES IN THE CREDIT SPREAD ASSUMPTION DEVELOPED BY THE THIRD PARTY WILL NO LONGER INTRODUCE VOLATILITY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT WILL EVENTUALLY EQUAL THE PRINCIPAL VALUE OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT BY THE TIME OF THE STATED REDEMPTION DATE OF EACH TRUST, BEGINNING WITH THE TRUST MATURING ON DECEMBER 4, 2032 AND CONTINUING THROUGH JANUARY 8, 2034, THE REDEMPTION DATE OF THE LAST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OUTSTANDING TRUSTS.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF EACH OF THE COMPANY'S SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS, SEE NOTE  13  , \"  DEBT  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE  4  , \"  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  ,\" TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR DISCUSSION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT MAY BE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND FUTURE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE PURPOSE OF LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT IS TO ENSURE THERE IS SUFFICIENT CASH TO MEET ALL FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS AS THEY FALL DUE.  THE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE BEEN MET PRIMARILY BY FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, CAPITAL RAISING, DISPOSAL OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, INVESTMENT MATURITIES AND INCOME AND OTHER RETURNS RECEIVED ON INVESTMENTS OR FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS.  CASH PROVIDED FROM THESE SOURCES IS USED PRIMARILY FOR MAKING INVESTMENTS AND FOR WARRANTY EXPENSES AND LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE PAYMENTS, DEBT SERVICING AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  THE TIMING AND  59  KINGSWAY FINANCIAL SERVICES INC.  AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PROVISIONS FOR UNPAID LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES, WHICH MAY CREATE INCREASED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  $2.9 MILLION  OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.  THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S REPORTED NET INCOME OF  $3.2 MILLION  AND THE  $2.9 MILLION  OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS CAN BE EXPLAINED PRIMARILY BY THE  $4.3 MILLION  GAIN ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF LIMITED LIABILITY INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS  $5.9 MILLION  .  THIS USE OF CASH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PURCHASES OF FIXED MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF FIXED MATURITIES AND SALES OF OTHER INVESTMENTS AND FROM ACQUISITION OF BUSINESS, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS  $7.8 MILLION  .  THIS SOURCE OF CASH IS ATTRIBUTED TO  $9.0 MILLION  OF NET BANK LOAN PROCEEDS OFFSET BY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ON BANK LOANS OF  $0.3 MILLION  AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $0.9 MILLION  ON THE NOTES PAYABLE.  IN SUMMARY, AS REPORTED ON THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, THE COMPANY'S NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS  $1.0 MILLION.  RECEIPT OF DIVIDENDS FROM THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES HAS NOT GENERALLY BEEN CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE HOLDING COMPANY.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES REQUIRE REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR THE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, PRIOR TO THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY WERE RESTRICTED FROM MAKING ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY WITHOUT REGULATORY APPROVAL PURSUANT TO THE DOMICILIARY INSURANCE REGULATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH SERVICE FEE AND COMMISSION INCOME.  THE COMPANY'S LEASED REAL ESTATE SUBSIDIARY FUNDS ITS OBLIGATIONS THROUGH RENTAL INCOME.  THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES FUND THEIR OBLIGATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH INVESTMENT INCOME AND MATURITIES IN THE INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIOS.  THE LIQUIDITY OF THE HOLDING COMPANY IS MANAGED SEPARATELY FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  ACTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE HOLDING COMPANY TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY IN ORDER TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SALE OF PASSIVE INVESTMENTS; SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES; ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES; DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S EXTENDED WARRANTY SUBSIDIARIES, AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW; AND GIVING NOTICE TO ITS TRUST PREFERRED TRUSTEES OF ITS INTENTION TO EXERCISE ITS VOLUNTARY RIGHT TO DEFER INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR UP TO 20 QUARTERS ON THE SIX SUBSIDIARY TRUSTS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBORDINATED DEBT, WHICH RIGHT THE COMPANY EXERCISED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  ON MARCH 1, 2019, THE COMPANY CLOSED ON THE ACQUISITION OF GEMINUS, A SPECIALTY, FULL-SERVICE PROVIDER OF VEHICLE SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCE AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS OFFERED THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE PENN WARRANTY CORPORATION (\"PENN\") AND PRIME AUTO CARE, INC. (\"PRIME\").  GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE INCLUDED IN EXTENDED WARRANTY.  RELATED TO THE GEMINUS ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY SECURED THE KWH LOAN.  IWS, TRINITY, GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE BORROWERS UNDER THE KWH LOAN.  PURSUANT TO SATISFYING THE COVENANTS UNDER THE KWH LOAN, IWS, TRINITY, GEMINUS, PENN AND PRIME ARE PERMITTED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $1.5 MILLION IN ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD.  SEPARATELY, PURSUANT TO COVENANTS UNDER THE PWSC LOAN SECURED TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OF PWSC ON OCTOBER 12, 2017, PWSC IS NOT PERMITTED TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE HOLDING COMPANY WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE LENDER.  THE PWSC LOAN WAS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 12, 2022; HOWEVER, THE PRINCIPAL TOTALING $0.3 MILLION WAS FULLY REPAID ON JANUARY 30, 2020.  DIVIDENDS FROM THE LEASED REAL ESTATE SEGMENT ARE NOT GENERALLY CONSIDERED A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE HOLDING COMPANY.   BECAUSE OF THE LEASE AMENDMENT, CMC MAY BE IN A POSITION TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE COMPANY SOME OF THE CASH RECEIVED FROM THE ADDITIONAL RENTAL INCOME.  ANY MATERIAL CASH FLOW TO THE COMPANY, HOWEVER, TO HELP THE COMPANY MEET ITS HOLDING COMPANY OBLIGATIONS REMAINS LIKELY TO OCCUR ONLY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF ONE OF THE THREE EVENTS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH THAT WOULD TRIGGER PAYMENT OF SERVICE FEES.

THE  COMPANY\u2019S GROSS MARGIN ON PRODUCT SALES DECREASED TO 26% ($324,292 ON $1,241,919 OF REVENUE) IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY  29, 2020 FROM 36% ($535,741 ON $1,493,939 OF REVENUE) IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ADDRESSING ITS  LIQUIDITY CONCERNS BY BUILDING UPON ITS REVENUE GENERATING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE PRODUCTS, INCREASING ITS ADVERTISING-BASED REVENUES,  INCREASING ITS OFFERINGS OF OTHER CONSULTING SERVICES, AND SALE OF INDUSTRIAL HEMP PRODUCTS. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN  1997, THE COMPANY HAS, AT TIMES, RELIED PRIMARILY UPON PROCEEDS FROM PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND SALES OF SHARES OF ITS EQUITY SECURITIES  TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE COMPANY RAISED $5,000,043 THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ITS SERIES C-2016 CONVERTIBLE  PREFERRED STOCK AND $10,371,050 THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF ITS SERIES D-2017 CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING  TO RELY ON SALES OF OUR SECURITIES AS WELL AS INCREASING OUR GENERAL REVENUES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  35  PLAN OF CONTINUED OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN FOR THE FISCAL  YEAR 2020  BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  MOST SIGNIFICANT ASSETS IS ITS UNIQUE NETWORK OF CHINESE INVESTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND WORLDWIDE; THUS, ONE OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S  IMMEDIATE SHORT-TERM GOALS IS TO FOCUS ON ACHIEVING BRAND-MARKETING GOALS FOR BOTH ITS CORE SUBSCRIPTION AND INVESTOR RELATIONS  BUSINESS AND ITS INDUSTRIAL HEMP/CBD BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THIS DEMOGRAPHIC IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO GROW, ESPECIALLY  AT THE UPPER END OF THE INCOME SCALE, PARTLY BECAUSE CHINESE ARE BELIEVED TO BE HIGHLY ADAPTIVE TO THE ECONOMY, ARE BELIEVED TO  HAVE THE ABILITY TO SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE WHEN IT COMES TO MONETARY INVESTMENTS IN THE STOCK MARKET, AND ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE  THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE NEW TRENDS IN CAPITAL MARKETS. MOREOVER, MANAGEMENT ALSO BELIEVES CHINESE ARE AN AFFLUENT  DEMOGRAPHIC AND THEY ACCUMULATE DISPOSABLE SAVINGS OVER AND ABOVE OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS. HAVING ACCESS TO THIS MARKET THAT IS OPEN  TO THE NEW IDEAS AND OPPORTUNITIES GIVES THE COMPANY A COMPETITIVE EDGE OVER OTHER COMPANIES THAT MARKET TO OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS UNIQUE NETWORK NOT BEEN MAXIMIZED TO CAPTURE ITS FULL MONETARY VALUE TO THE COMPANY.  IN LIGHT OF CURRENT POLITICAL EVENTS AND  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CHINESE INVESTOR IS EVEN MORE FOCUSED AND ENGAGED WHEN IT COMES TO STAYING  UP TO DATE ON INVESTMENT MARKETS, AND IS SEEKING NEW PRODUCTS, SUBSCRIPTION OFFERINGS AND INVESTOR TOOLS TO SERVE SUCH NEEDS. THE  COMPANY RECOGNIZES THIS NEED AND IS RESPONDING THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF THE SAME. BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2020, WE ADJUSTED OUR BUSINESS  MODEL AND ENHANCED OUR YOUTUBE PROGRAMMING TO INCLUDE FREE LIVE BROADCASTS PROVIDING ANALYSIS AND UPDATES ON THE U.S. EQUITY AND  OPTION MARKETS IN A GRASS ROOTS EFFORT TO GENERATE NEW LEADS, WITH NO ASSOCIATED ADVERTISING FEES. SUBSCRIPTIONS TO OUR FREE YOUTUBE  CHANNEL HAVE GROWN FROM APPROXIMATELY 15,000 TO 22,000 IN SIX WEEKS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 5%-10% OF THE FREE SUBSCRIBERS BECOMING  PAID SUBSCRIBERS. THIS IN TURN INCREASED OUR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES IN RECENT MONTHS AS FOLLOWS: APPROXIMATELY $260K IN SUBSCRIPTION  REVENUES FOR THE MONTH ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 (THE THIRD LARGEST MONTH FOR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES IN COMPANY HISTORY); APPROXIMATELY  $510K IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES FOR THE MONTH ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 (THE HIGHEST SINGLE MONTH FOR SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES IN COMPANY  HISTORY); AND APPROXIMATELY $80K IN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2020. MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ADD MORE  CONTENT TO ITS YOUTUBE CHANNEL OVER THE NEXT 6-12 MONTHS. WE BELIEVE THIS BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH HAS COST THE COMPANY $0 IN ADVERTISING  FEES, WILL AFFORD US OPPORTUNITIES UNLIKE WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS (DURING WHICH TIME THE COMPANY AVERAGED $400K- $800K  PER YEAR IN ADVERTISING COSTS FOR ITS SUBSCRIPTION PRODUCTS). MANAGEMENT IS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND IF SUBSCRIPTION  REVENUES CONTINUE AS THEY HAVE IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2020, THE COMPANY HOPES TO BECOME CASH FLOW POSITIVE WITH RECORD REVENUES  OVER NEXT TWELVE (12) MONTHS.  MOREOVER, AS PART OF ITS COST-CUTTING MEASURES  MANAGEMENT HAS CLOSED TWO OFFICE LOCATIONS, ONE IN SAN GABRIEL, CA AND ONE IN NEW YORK CITY, NY, WITH PLANS TO CLOSE THE OFFICE  IN FLUSHING, NY AND ONE LOCATION IN SHANGHAI. IN ADDITION MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO CUT OVERALL ADVERTISING COSTS TO LESS THAN $10K  PER MONTH OVER THE NEXT TWELVE (12) MONTHS.  IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT IS EXPLORING JOINT  VENTURE OPPORTUNITIES WITH PARTNERS THAT ARE LOOKING TO REACH OUR UNIQUE NETWORK OF CONSUMERS. WITH REGARD TO ITS INDUSTRIAL HEMP/CBD  BUSINESS IN CHINA, THE COMPANY HAS TWO NEW HEMP-INFUSED, SKIN-FRIENDLY, ANTIMICROBIAL SANITIZER PRODUCTS IN DEVELOPMENT.  THE COMPANY WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO  RECRUIT AND WILL SEEK TO RETAIN A TALENTED AND KNOWLEDGEABLE WORKFORCE AND MORE SPECIFICALLY, WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN ITS  EXISTING SALES FORCE THROUGH ENHANCED TRAINING, ALLOCATION OF RESOURCES AND PROVIDING CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES. AS SUCH,  THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONTEMPLATE ANY FURTHER LAYOFFS OF ITS SALES FORCE OTHER THAN IN THE NORMAL COURSE.  36  BUDGETARY CONTROL  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL  BE CONTROLLED AND WERE REDUCED IN BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS  LAST YEAR. AS NOTED ABOVE, CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 29, 2020 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WERE  $5,237,878 AND $8,398,744, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASED CASH USED IN OPERATIONS WAS DUE TO A REDUCTION IN GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES USED IN OPERATIONS. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, HAS RELINQUISHED ONE OF ITS COMMERCIAL LEASES IN  SAN GABRIEL, CA AND ITS COMMERCIAL LEASE IN NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FORCED TO LAY OFF EMPLOYEES  IN BOTH THE NEW YORK AND CALIFORNIA OFFICES WHOSE PRIMARY DUTIES RELATED TO CRYPTOCURRENCY PRODUCTS, MARKETING, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THE MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN LARGELY TRANSFERRED TO EXISTING EMPLOYEES IN CHINA.  THE MANAGEMENT HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED BUDGETARY  CONTROL ON CERTAIN EXPENDITURES SUCH AS OFFICE UTILITIES, OTHER GENERAL OFFICE EXPENSES, AND COMPANY TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT IN  AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO APPROXIMATELY $300,000 USD EACH MONTH FROM THE CURRENT  EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $400,000, EXCLUDING CURRENT DEBT DUE AND OWING.  FINANCING  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTINUING TO RELY  ON SALES OF ITS SECURITIES TO FUND A PORTION OF ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, PLANS TO MEET ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS,  AND WILL CONFORM TO ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO REMAINING A FULLY REPORTING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WHILE INCREASING ITS MARKET PRESENCE  AS WELL AS SERVICES OFFERING SPECTRUM.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.", "CIK": 1459482, "Date": "2020-04-14T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CIIX", "Name": "Chineseinvestorscom Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 8200.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "IN", "IRS": null, "key": "20200414CIIX", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -11.111111111111107, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.59347636, "prof1": 0.40652362, "return1&2": 1.1111111111111112, "return1&2&3": 1.1111111111111112, "return1&2&3&4": 1.1111111111111112, "return2": 1.1111111111111112, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.03152020264506174, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3830, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0, "cumreturn1b": 1.2313167033412926, "cumreturn1c": 1.097465393076904, "cumreturndow": 1.126638375632463, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1222736719686452}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3832, "level_0": 3940, "index": 36641, "text": "ITEM 2.

ESCALADE\u2019S FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD DIFFER  MATERIALLY FROM THE EXPECTATIONS OF MANAGEMENT CONTAINED HEREIN. ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ARE CURRENTLY  ELEVATED BY AND MAY OR WILL CONTINUE TO BE ELEVATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT OR IDENTIFY ALL SUCH  RISKS, BUT MAY BECOME MATERIAL IN THE FUTURE. ESCALADE UNDERTAKES NO OBLIGATION TO RELEASE REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  ESCALADE, INCORPORATED (ESCALADE, THE COMPANY, WE, US OR OUR)  IS FOCUSED ON GROWING ITS SPORTING GOODS BUSINESS THROUGH ORGANIC GROWTH OF EXISTING CATEGORIES, STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, AND NEW  PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THE SPORTING GOODS BUSINESS COMPETES IN A VARIETY OF CATEGORIES INCLUDING BASKETBALL GOALS, ARCHERY, INDOOR  AND OUTDOOR GAME RECREATION AND FITNESS PRODUCTS. STRONG BRANDS AND ON-GOING INVESTMENT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROVIDE A SOLID  FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING CUSTOMER LOYALTY AND CONTINUED GROWTH.  WITHIN THE SPORTING GOODS INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY  BUILT A ROBUST MARKET PRESENCE IN SEVERAL NICHE MARKETS. THIS STRATEGY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE, BARRIERS  TO ENTRY, STRONG BRANDS, EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE AND A COMMITMENT TO INNOVATION. A KEY STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE IS THE COMPANY\u2019S  ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH MAJOR CUSTOMERS THAT ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BRING NEW PRODUCTS TO MARKET IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER  WHILE MAINTAINING A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION TO STRATEGIC CUSTOMER RELATIONS,  THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL MANUFACTURING AND IMPORT EXPERIENCE THAT ENABLE IT TO BE A LOW COST SUPPLIER.  TO ENHANCE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, THE COMPANY HAS FOCUSED ON  PROMOTING NEW PRODUCT INNOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT AND BRAND MARKETING. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS EMBARKED ON A STRATEGY OF ACQUIRING  COMPANIES OR PRODUCT LINES THAT COMPLEMENT OR EXPAND THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCT LINES OR PROVIDE EXPANSION INTO NEW OR EMERGING  CATEGORIES IN SPORTING GOODS. A KEY OBJECTIVE IS THE ACQUISITION OF PRODUCT LINES WITH BARRIERS TO ENTRY THAT THE COMPANY CAN TAKE  TO MARKET THROUGH ITS ESTABLISHED DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OR THROUGH NEW MARKET CHANNELS. SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH  ASSIMILATION OF ACQUIRED PRODUCT LINES INTO THE EXISTING COMPANY STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY ALSO SOMETIMES DIVESTS OR DISCONTINUES  CERTAIN OPERATIONS, ASSETS, BRANDS, AND PRODUCTS THAT DO NOT PERFORM TO THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS OR NO LONGER FIT WITH THE COMPANY'S  STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT KEY INDICATORS IN MEASURING THE SUCCESS  OF THESE STRATEGIES ARE REVENUE GROWTH, EARNINGS GROWTH, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND THE EXPANSION OF CHANNELS OF DISTRIBUTION.  13  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  THE EMERGENCE OF THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) AROUND THE WORLD,  AND PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO THE COMPANY, NOT ALL OF WHICH THE COMPANY IS ABLE  TO FULLY EVALUATE OR EVEN TO FORESEE AT THE CURRENT TIME. WHILE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC DID NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S  FINANCIAL RESULTS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FIRST FISCAL QUARTER ENDED MARCH 21, 2020, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH  CONDITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS MOST OF THE GLOBE HAVE CHANGED RAPIDLY SINCE THE END OF THE QUARTER. IN THE SHORT-TERM,  DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS HAS INCREASED, NOTABLY IN OUR FITNESS PRODUCTS, BASKETBALL, PLAYGROUND, INDOOR/OUTDOOR  GAMES, AND TRAMPOLINES. SOME OF THE INCREASE IN DEMAND IS LIKELY DUE TO CONSUMERS BEING REQUIRED OR ENCOURAGED BY GOVERNMENTAL  AUTHORITIES TO STAY AT HOME, SCHOOLS BEING CLOSED, AND EMPLOYERS REQUIRING EMPLOYEES TO WORK REMOTELY AND/OR IMPLEMENTING FURLOUGHS  AND LAYOFFS. SUCH INCREASED DEMAND MAY NOT CONTINUE AND/OR DEMAND MAY DECREASE FROM HISTORICAL LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE DURATION  AND SEVERITY OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES FOR NORMAL ECONOMIC AND OPERATING CONDITIONS TO RESUME, ADDITIONAL  GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN AND/OR EXTENSIONS OF TIME FOR RESTRICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED TO DATE, AND NUMEROUS  OTHER UNCERTAINTIES.  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS AFFECTING THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS  IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO INDEFINITELY THEREAFTER. ALL OF THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE FAR REACHING IMPACTS ON  THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITIONS, DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION  IMPACTS ON THE HEALTH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEES, MANUFACTURING, DISTRIBUTION, MARKETING AND SALES OPERATIONS,  CUSTOMER AND CONSUMER BEHAVIORS, AND ON THE OVERALL ECONOMY. THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THESE IMPACTS, MOST OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE  COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND THE OUTCOMES ARE UNCERTAIN.  DUE TO THE ABOVE CIRCUMSTANCES AND AS DESCRIBED GENERALLY IN  THIS FORM 10-Q, THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 21, 2020 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE  OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR. MANAGEMENT CANNOT PREDICT THE FULL IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE  COMPANY\u2019S SALES CHANNELS, SUPPLY CHAIN, MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION NOR TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS GENERALLY, INCLUDING THE  EFFECTS ON CONSUMER SPENDING. THE ULTIMATE EXTENT OF THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE COMPANY IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND  WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, AND SUCH EFFECTS COULD EXIST FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME EVEN AFTER THE PANDEMIC MIGHT END.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE SETS FORTH CERTAIN CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT  OF OPERATIONS DATA AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE.

THE OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE INCREASED TO 27.4% FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED TO 26.4% FOR 2019 DUE TO PRODUCT MIX AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED OVER  THE LAST YEAR.  SELLING, GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) WERE  $7.5 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO $7.7 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, A DECREASE OF $0.2 MILLION  OR 3.7%. THE REDUCTION IN SG&A WAS A RESULT OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES PUT IN PLACE DURING 2019.  SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES IS 20.0% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED WITH 24.1% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 WAS  FLAT COMPARED TO LAST YEAR AT 19.6%.  14  FINANCIAL CONDITION  AND LIQUIDITY  TOTAL DEBT AT THE END OF THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 WAS  ZERO, A DECREASE OF $135 THOUSAND FROM DECEMBER 28, 2019.

ON MARCH 24, 2020, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT  TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (\u201c2019 RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH ITS ISSUING BANK, JP MORGAN CHASE  BANK, N.A. (\u201cCHASE\u201d), AND THE OTHER LENDERS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cLENDER\u201d).  THE SOLE PURPOSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT WAS TO PERMIT AN INCREASE IN AUTHORIZED STOCK REPURCHASES, INCREASING THE LIMIT FROM $5,000,000  TO $15,000,000.  THE COMPANY FUNDS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THROUGH OPERATING  CASH FLOWS AND REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS WITH ITS BANK.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATING TO ENABLE PHYSICIANS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF AND ACCESS TO MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE. WE BELIEVE THAT MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE IS LIFE-ENHANCING CARE. INTUITIVE BRINGS MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF LEADERSHIP IN ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS TO ITS OFFERINGS. WHILE SURGERY AND ACUTE INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST DECADES, THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND DECREASED VARIABILITY OF THESE OUTCOMES ACROSS CARE TEAMS. THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT IS EXERTING A LARGE AND INCREASING BURDEN ON CRITICAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING THE PROFESSIONALS WHO STAFF CARE TEAMS: SURGEONS, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS, NURSES, AND OTHER STAFF. AT THE SAME TIME, GOVERNMENTS ARE STRAINING TO COVER THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THEIR POPULATIONS AND ARE DEMANDING LOWER TOTAL COST PER PATIENT TO TREAT DISEASE. IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES, WE BELIEVE SCIENTIFIC, PROCESS, AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BIOLOGY, COMPUTING, IMAGING, ALGORITHMS, AND ROBOTICS OFFER THE PROMISE OF NEW METHODS TO SOLVE OLD AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  WE ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY FOCUSING ON THE QUADRUPLE AIM. FIRST, WE FOCUS ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DECREASE VARIABILITY IN THE HANDS OF CARE TEAMS. SECOND, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE BY MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO LIVES AND CREATING GREATER PREDICTABILITY FOR THE TREATMENT EXPERIENCE. THIRD, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE CARE TEAM SATISFACTION BY CREATING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DEPENDABLE, SMART, AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CARE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY ARE USED. FINALLY, WE SEEK TO LOWER THE TOTAL COST TO TREAT PER PATIENT EPISODE WHEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES, PROVIDING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND VALUE FOR PAYERS.  OPEN SURGERY REMAINS THE PREDOMINANT FORM OF SURGERY AND IS USED IN ALMOST EVERY AREA OF THE BODY. HOWEVER, THE LARGE INCISIONS REQUIRED FOR OPEN SURGERY CREATE TRAUMA TO PATIENTS, TYPICALLY RESULTING IN LONGER HOSPITALIZATION AND RECOVERY TIMES, INCREASED HOSPITALIZATION COSTS, AND ADDITIONAL PAIN AND SUFFERING RELATIVE TO MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY (\u201cMIS\u201d), WHERE MIS IS AVAILABLE. FOR OVER THREE DECADES, MIS HAS REDUCED TRAUMA TO PATIENTS BY ALLOWING SELECTED SURGERIES TO BE PERFORMED THROUGH SMALL PORTS RATHER THAN LARGE INCISIONS. MIS HAS BEEN WIDELY ADOPTED FOR CERTAIN SURGICAL PROCEDURES.  DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ENABLE SURGEONS TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF MIS TO MANY PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO A MORE INVASIVE SURGERY BY USING COMPUTATIONAL, ROBOTIC, AND IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO OVERCOME MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL OPEN SURGERY OR CONVENTIONAL MIS. SURGEONS USING A DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM OPERATE WHILE SEATED COMFORTABLY AT A CONSOLE VIEWING A 3D, HIGH-DEFINITION IMAGE OF THE SURGICAL FIELD. THIS IMMERSIVE CONSOLE CONNECTS SURGEONS TO THE SURGICAL FIELD AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHILE SEATED AT THE CONSOLE, THE SURGEON MANIPULATES INSTRUMENT CONTROLS IN A NATURAL MANNER, SIMILAR TO OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH A RANGE OF ARTICULATION OF THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE SURGICAL FIELD ANALOGOUS TO THE MOTIONS OF A HUMAN WRIST, WHILE FILTERING OUT THE TREMOR INHERENT IN A SURGEON\u2019S HAND. IN DESIGNING OUR PRODUCTS, WE FOCUS ON MAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY EASY AND SAFE TO USE.  OUR DA VINCI PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BROAD CATEGORIES: DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES, DA VINCI STAPLING, DA VINCI ENERGY, AND DA VINCI VISION, INCLUDING FIREFLY FLUORESCENCE IMAGING SYSTEMS (\u201cFIREFLY\u201d) AND DA VINCI ENDOSCOPES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF SERVICES, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WITHIN OUR INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM, OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO DECREASE VARIABILITY IN SURGERY BY OFFERING DEPENDABLE, CONSISTENT FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCES FOR SURGEONS SEEKING BETTER OUTCOMES. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC APPROACH, OFFERING INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE MIS INTERVENTION MORE AVAILABLE AND APPLICABLE.  WE HAVE COMMERCIALIZED THE FOLLOWING DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS: THE DA VINCI STANDARD SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 1999, THE DA VINCI S SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2006, THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2009, AND THE FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2014. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM BY ADDING THE DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH OF OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND WE HAVE AN INSTALLED BASE OF 47 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020. OUR PLANS FOR THE ROLLOUT OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN THE HANDS OF EXPERIENCED DA VINCI USERS FIRST WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGICAL AND CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE USED FOR A BROAD SET OF PROCEDURES. WE PLAN TO SEEK FDA CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS FOR DA VINCI SP OVER TIME. THE SUCCESS OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PROCEDURES FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN CLEARED AS WELL AS SECURING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL CLEARANCES. ALL DA VINCI SYSTEMS INCLUDE A SURGEON\u2019S CONSOLE (OR CONSOLES), IMAGING ELECTRONICS, A PATIENT-SIDE CART, AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  WE OFFER OVER 80 DIFFERENT MULTI-PORT DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH FLEXIBILITY IN CHOOSING THE TYPES OF TOOLS NEEDED TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR SURGERY. THESE MULTI-PORT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY ROBOTICALLY CONTROLLED AND PROVIDE END EFFECTORS (TIPS) THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN EITHER OPEN OR LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY. WE OFFER ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND AND DA VINCI STAPLER PRODUCTS, TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH SOPHISTICATED, COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS TO PRECISELY AND EFFICIENTLY INTERACT WITH TISSUE. DA VINCI X AND DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS SHARE THE SAME INSTRUMENTS WHEREAS THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM USES INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITH X OR XI SYSTEMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NINE CORE INSTRUMENTS ON OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM. WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SP INSTRUMENT OFFERING OVER TIME.  TRAINING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE OUR INTUITIVE SIMULATION PRODUCTS, OUR INTUITIVE TELEPRESENCE REMOTE CASE OBSERVATION AND TELEMENTORING TOOLS, AND OUR DUAL CONSOLE FOR USE IN SURGEON PROCTORING AND COLLABORATIVE SURGERY.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE FDA CLEARED OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM TO ENABLE MINIMALLY INVASIVE BIOPSIES IN THE LUNG. OUR ION SYSTEM EXTENDS OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING BEYOND SURGERY INTO DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES WITH THIS FIRST APPLICATION. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH AND HAVE PLACED 18 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020. ION SYSTEMS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED BASE. WE ALSO HAVE 4 ION SYSTEMS PLACED WITH HOSPITALS FOR GATHERING CLINICAL DATA.  THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING, COMPETITION, MARKET AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, THE EFFECTIVE FORECASTING AND MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCT DEMAND, INVENTORY LEVELS, THE MANAGEMENT OF MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY COSTS, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION.  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  PRIOR TO THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, WE EXPERIENCED PROCEDURE GROWTH TRENDS CONSISTENT WITH THOSE EXPERIENCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, INCLUDING STRENGTH IN GENERAL SURGERY, GROWTH IN MATURE PROCEDURES IN THE U.S., AND GROWTH IN OUS UROLOGY. WE ALSO SAW EARLY STRENGTH IN CAPITAL PLACEMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., WITH OVER HALF THE SYSTEMS PLACED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 RELATED TO ARRANGEMENTS WHERE THE SALES CYCLE WAS MOSTLY COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2020, WE SAW A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN CHINA AND, BY EARLY FEBRUARY 2020, PROCEDURES PER WEEK IN CHINA HAD DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 90% COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATES EXPERIENCED IN EARLY JANUARY 2020. AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SUBSIDED IN CHINA IN MARCH 2020, DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME BEGAN TO RECOVER AND, BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, CHINA PROCEDURES PER WEEK WERE APPROXIMATELY 70% OF THE EARLY JANUARY 2020 WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE. WE SAW VARIED IMPACTS ON DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN SOME OF THE OTHER EARLY COUNTRIES AFFECTED BY COVID-19. COVID-19 HAD LITTLE IMPACT ON THE PROCEDURE VOLUME IN KOREA AND JAPAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WHILE IT HAD A SEVERE IMPACT ON THE PROCEDURE VOLUME IN ITALY. OVERALL, THE DISRUPTION TO WORLDWIDE DA VINCI PROCEDURES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF MARCH 2020. AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC SPREAD TO WESTERN EUROPE AND THE U.S., WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN THE LAST HALF OF MARCH 2020. PROCEDURES PER WEEK IN THE U.S., WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 72% OF OUR PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2019, DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 65% COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. PROCEDURES IN FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE UK ALSO DECLINED COMPARED WITH THE WEEKLY PROCEDURE RATE EXPERIENCED EARLIER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 BUT TO A LESSER EXTENT THAN IN THE U.S.  MOST OF THE SALES CYCLE FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WERE COMPLETED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. AS WE PROGRESSED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AND THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC PROGRESSED, CUSTOMERS BEGAN TO DEFER DECISIONS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE SYSTEMS INTO FUTURE QUARTERS AND, IN SOME CASES, INDEFINITELY. THE DEPTH AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT INDIVIDUAL MARKETS WILL VARY BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF TESTING CAPABILITIES, PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT, INTENSIVE CARE UNITS AND OPERATING ROOMS, AND MEDICAL STAFF AS WELL AS GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS. AS COVID-19 CONTINUES TO SPREAD, IT IS LIKELY THAT DA VINCI PROCEDURES WILL DECLINE FROM THOSE RATES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. IN ADDITION, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT SYSTEM PLACEMENTS WILL FOLLOW THE DECLINE IN PROCEDURES. WHILE SOME MARKETS, E.G., CHINA, APPEAR TO BE RECOVERING, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A RECURRENCE OF COVID-19 WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT DA VINCI PROCEDURES. MOREOVER, WE DO NOT EXPECT ALL MARKETS TO RECOVER AT THE SAME PACE. WHILE WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT OR LENGTH OF THE IMPACT, WE EXPECT PROCEDURE VOLUME AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE OR BE DELAYED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND BEYOND AS COVID-19 INFECTIONS SPREAD, CAUSING ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON HOSPITAL RESOURCES, COUPLED WITH THE RECOMMENDED DEFERRALS OF ELECTIVE PROCEDURES BY GOVERNMENTS AND OTHER AUTHORITIES.  CAPITAL MARKETS AND WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES HAVE ALSO BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD CAUSE A LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. SUCH ECONOMIC RECESSION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS AS HOSPITALS CURTAIL AND REDUCE CAPITAL AND OVERALL SPENDING. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND LOCAL ACTIONS, SUCH AS \u201cSHELTER-IN-PLACE\u201d ORDERS AND RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO TRAVEL AND ACCESS OUR CUSTOMERS OR TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF OUR FACILITIES OR THE FACILITIES OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEIR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, COULD FURTHER SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR SALES AND OUR ABILITY TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS AND SUPPLY OUR CUSTOMERS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE NUMBER OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED OR THE NUMBER OF SYSTEM PLACEMENTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE SET OUR PRIORITIES AND ACTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE PHASED FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED IN THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE\u2019S PAPER ENTITLED \u201cNATIONAL CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE \u2013 A ROAD MAP TO REOPENING.\u201d IN PHASE 1, WHICH IS THE \u2018SLOW THE SPREAD\u2019 PHASE OF CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE, OUR PRIORITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS. FIRST, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL THOSE WE SERVE \u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS, OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR EMPLOYEES, AND OUR SUPPLIERS \u2013 IMPLEMENTING EARLY AND CONTINUOUS UPDATES TO OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY POLICIES AND PROCESSES. SECOND, WE ARE SUPPORTING OUR CUSTOMERS ACCORDING TO THEIR PRIORITIES \u2013 CLINICAL, OPERATIONAL, AND ECONOMIC. THIRD, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUITY OF SUPPLY BY WORKING WITH OUR SUPPLIERS AND OUR DISTRIBUTORS. FOURTH, WE ARE SECURING OUR WORKFORCE ECONOMICALLY. WE HAVE BUILT A VALUABLE TEAM OVER THE YEARS, AND WE BELIEVE THEY WILL BE IMPORTANT IN THE RECOVERY THAT FOLLOWS THE PANDEMIC. FIFTH, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR INTUITIVE FOUNDATION, WE ARE CONTRIBUTING MATERIAL, PRODUCT, AND VOLUNTEERS TO THE FRONT LINES OF COVID-19 SUPPORT \u2013 WE HAVE DESIGNED, PRODUCED, AND DELIVERED PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO LOCAL HOSPITALS, AND OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE VOLUNTEERED IN SEVERAL COMMUNITIES. FINALLY, WE ARE ELIMINATING AVOIDABLE SPEND DURING THE \u2018SLOW THE SPREAD\u2019 PHASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  BUSINESS MODEL  OVERVIEW  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, IN SALES OR SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UP-FRONT OR IN OPERATING LEASE TRANSACTIONS AND USAGE-BASED MODELS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASES. THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM GENERALLY SELLS FOR BETWEEN $0.5 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, DEPENDING UPON THE MODEL, CONFIGURATION, AND GEOGRAPHY, AND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN PURCHASED. OUR INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES HAVE LIMITED LIVES AND WILL EITHER EXPIRE OR WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE USED IN SURGERY, AT WHICH POINT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE GENERALLY EARN BETWEEN $700 AND $3,500 OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE PER SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES PERFORMED AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS USED. WE TYPICALLY ENTER INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS AT THE TIME SYSTEMS ARE SOLD OR LEASED AT AN ANNUAL FEE BETWEEN $80,000 AND $190,000, DEPENDING UPON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM AND COMPOSITION OF THE SERVICES OFFERED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THESE SERVICE CONTRACTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL CONTRACTUAL SERVICE PERIODS.  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTENT WITH THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF THE ION SYSTEM, AND WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES USED IN BIOPSIES AND ONGOING SYSTEM SERVICE. ION SYSTEMS ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED BASE. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT TO REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.  RECURRING REVENUE  RECURRING REVENUE CONSISTS OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE, SERVICE REVENUE, AND OPERATING LEASE REVENUE. RECURRING REVENUE INCREASED TO $3.2 BILLION, OR 72% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $2.6 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2018, AND $2.2 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2017.  INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN SYSTEMS REVENUE OVER TIME. INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.4 BILLION IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $2.0 BILLION IN 2018 AND $1.6 BILLION IN 2017. THE GROWTH OF INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE LARGELY REFLECTS CONTINUED PROCEDURE ADOPTION.  SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED TO $724 MILLION IN 2019, COMPARED WITH $635 MILLION IN 2018 AND $573 MILLION IN 2017. SERVICE REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW 12% TO APPROXIMATELY 5,582 AT DECEMBER 31, 2019; 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,986 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018; AND 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,409 AT DECEMBER 31, 2017.  WE USE THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS METRICS FOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PERFORMANCE, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE AN INDICATOR OF THE RATE OF ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY AS WELL AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE RECURRING REVENUE (PARTICULARLY SERVICE REVENUE). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BOTH IT AND INVESTORS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND WHEN PLANNING, FORECASTING, AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ALSO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTERNAL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS METRICS, BECAUSE (1) THEY ALLOW FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, AND (2) THEY ARE USED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND THE ANALYST COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED ARE CONNECTED VIA THE INTERNET. SYSTEM LOGS CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED BY FIELD ENGINEERS FOR SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. WE UTILIZE THIS INFORMATION AS WELL AS OTHER INFORMATION FROM AGREEMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS THAT INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  JUDGMENTS, WHICH ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS MAY BE IMPACTED OVER TIME BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING SYSTEM INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, HOSPITAL AND DISTRIBUTOR REPORTING BEHAVIOR, AND INHERENT COMPLEXITIES IN NEW AGREEMENTS. SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO TECHNICAL ERRORS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AND GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE AND IN THE NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN REVENUE. THE INSTALLED BASE AND NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, REVENUE OR OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC REDUCED OUR EXPECTED NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. AS THE PANDEMIC SPREADS TO OTHER GEOGRAPHIES, SUCH AS EUROPE AND THE U.S., WHICH REPRESENT A LARGER PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS, IT WILL HAVE A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF SHIPMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROLONGED LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. THIS COULD PRESSURE HOSPITAL SPENDING, IMPACTING SYSTEM SHIPMENTS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS, THE ABILITY TO FORECAST FUTURE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS HAS BEEN DISRUPTED. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT HISTORICAL SYSTEM SHIPMENT TRENDS MAY NOT BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF FUTURE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS.  INTUITIVE SYSTEM LEASING  SINCE 2013, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SALES-TYPE AND OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH CERTAIN QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS AS A WAY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ACQUIRE SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THEIR ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY PROGRAMS WHILE LEVERAGING OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE LEASES GENERALLY HAVE COMMERCIALLY COMPETITIVE TERMS AS COMPARED WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES THAT OFFER EQUIPMENT LEASING. WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH LARGER CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE COMMITTED DA VINCI PROGRAMS WHERE WE CHARGE FOR THE SYSTEM AND SERVICE AS THE SYSTEMS ARE UTILIZED. WE INCLUDE OPERATING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES, AND SYSTEMS PLACED UNDER USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, IN OUR SYSTEM SHIPMENT AND INSTALLED BASE DISCLOSURES. WE EXCLUDE OPERATING LEASE-RELATED REVENUE, USAGE-BASED REVENUE, AND ION SYSTEM REVENUE FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (\u201cASP\u201d) COMPUTATIONS.  IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, WE SHIPPED 425, 272, AND 139 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 384, 229, AND 108 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. FOR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, SYSTEMS REVENUE AND SERVICE REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED AS THE SYSTEMS ARE USED. WE SET OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PRICING AT A MODEST PREMIUM RELATIVE TO PURCHASED SYSTEMS REFLECTING THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND, IN THE CASE OF USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, THE RISK THAT SYSTEM UTILIZATION MAY FALL SHORT OF ANTICIPATED LEVELS. THE PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND IS INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING LEASE METRICS HEREIN. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN OVERALL SYSTEMS REVENUE AND WAS $106.9 MILLION, $51.4 MILLION, $25.9 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. GENERALLY, LEASE TRANSACTIONS GENERATE SIMILAR GROSS MARGINS AS OUR SALE TRANSACTIONS.  OUR SYSTEM LEASING AND USAGE-BASED MODELS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH FLEXIBILITY REGARDING HOW THEY ACQUIRE OR OBTAIN ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-RECEIVED, AND WE ARE WILLING TO EXPAND THE PROPORTION OF THESE STRUCTURES BASED ON CUSTOMER DEMAND. AS REVENUE FOR OPERATING LEASES AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, TOTAL SYSTEMS REVENUE GROWTH IS REDUCED IN A PERIOD WHEN THE NUMBER OF OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PLACEMENTS INCREASES AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  OUR EXPOSURE TO THE CREDIT RISKS RELATING TO OUR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY INCREASE IF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN HEALTHCARE LAWS, COVERAGE, AND REIMBURSEMENT, ECONOMIC PRESSURES OR UNCERTAINTY, INCLUDING DISRUPTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, OR OTHER CUSTOMER-SPECIFIC FACTORS. IN ADDITION, AS CUSTOMERS DIVERT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO THE TREATMENT OF OR THE PREPARATION TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH THE COVID-19 VIRUS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO DEFAULTS UNDER OUR LEASE FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. MOREOVER, USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY CONTAIN NO MINIMUM PAYMENTS; THEREFORE, CUSTOMERS MAY EXIT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT PAYING A FINANCIAL PENALTY TO US. AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME CUSTOMERS WILL EXIT SUCH ARRANGEMENTS OR SEEK TO AMEND THE TERMS OF OUR OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH THEM.  FOR SOME OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE LEASED SYSTEM AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING AND/OR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. REVENUE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cLEASE BUYOUTS\u201d) WAS $92.8 MILLION, $48.8 MILLION, AND $39.5 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, 2018, AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CUSTOMER EXERCISES OF THE BUYOUT OPTIONS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR BUYOUT OPTIONS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE  SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST MARKETS. IN GEOGRAPHIES WHERE DA VINCI PROCEDURE ADOPTION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE, SYSTEM SALES WILL PRECEDE PROCEDURE GROWTH. SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ALSO VARY DUE TO SEASONALITY LARGELY ALIGNED WITH HOSPITAL BUDGETING CYCLES. WE TYPICALLY PLACE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF ANNUAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A LOWER PROPORTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS CUSTOMER BUDGETS ARE RESET. SYSTEM REVENUE GREW 19% TO $1,346 MILLION IN 2019; 21% TO $1,127 MILLION IN 2018; AND 16% TO $928 MILLION IN 2017. SYSTEMS REVENUE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SYSTEM PLACEMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, RECURRING OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED REVENUE, OPERATING LEASE BUYOUTS, PRODUCT MIX, ASPS, TRADE-IN ACTIVITIES, AND CUSTOMER MIX.  PROCEDURE MIX / PRODUCTS  OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR SOFT TISSUE SURGERY FOR AREAS OF THE BODY BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE NECK, PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES, PROCEDURES RANGE IN COMPLEXITY FROM CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TO LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TEND TO BE REIMBURSED AT HIGHER RATES THAN LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. THUS, HOSPITALS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING LESS COMPLEX, BENIGN CONDITIONS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE HOSPITALS WITH ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PROCEDURE COMPLEXITY. OUR FULLY FEATURED DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM WITH ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER AND ENDOWRIST STAPLER PRODUCTS, AND OUR INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION PRODUCT TARGETS THE MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURE SEGMENT. OUR DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM IS TARGETED TOWARDS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKETS AND PROCEDURES. OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM COMPLEMENTS THE DA VINCI XI AND X SURGICAL SYSTEMS BY ENABLING SURGEONS TO ACCESS NARROW WORKSPACES.  PROCEDURE SEASONALITY  MORE THAN HALF OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED ARE FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIRS, HYSTERECTOMIES, AND CHOLECYSTECTOMIES. THESE BENIGN PROCEDURES AND OTHER SHORT-TERM ELECTIVE PROCEDURES TEND TO BE MORE SEASONAL THAN CANCER OPERATIONS AND SURGERIES FOR OTHER LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. SEASONALITY IN THE U.S. FOR THESE PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER FOURTH QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN MORE PATIENTS HAVE MET ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER FIRST QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN DEDUCTIBLES ARE RESET. SEASONALITY OUTSIDE THE U.S. VARIES AND IS MORE PRONOUNCED AROUND LOCAL HOLIDAYS AND VACATION PERIODS. AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SURGEON GENERAL AND AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS TO DEFER ELECTIVE PROCEDURES, WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES TO BE DEFERRED.  DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATIONS IN THE U.S., EUROPE (EXCLUDING SPAIN, PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE, AND MOST EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), CHINA, JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, INDIA, AND TAIWAN. IN 2018, WE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS IN INDIA AND TAIWAN. IN JANUARY 2019, OUR INTUITIVE-FOSUN JOINT VENTURE BEGAN DIRECT SALES FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. IN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OUS MARKETS, WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  REGULATORY ACTIVITIES  OVERVIEW  OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A LARGE AND GROWING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THAT GOVERN THE PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, ADVERTISING, LABELING, SAFETY REPORTING DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MATERIALS CONTENT AND SOURCING, TESTING, CERTIFICATION, PACKAGING, INSTALLATION, USE, AND DISPOSAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STANDARDS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL SAFETY STANDARDS, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION, AND COMPOSITION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVES. FAILURE TO MEET THESE STANDARDS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE REGIONS THAT REQUIRE COMPLIANCE TO SUCH STANDARDS.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEDICAL DEVICE, PRIVACY, AND OTHER REGULATIONS BY REGIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT TIMELINES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND/OR INDICATIONS MAY BE EXTENDED RELATIVE TO PAST EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATIONS.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CLEARANCES AND APPROVALS  WE HAVE GENERALLY OBTAINED THE CLEARANCES REQUIRED TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL MULTIPORT SYSTEMS (STANDARD, S, SI, XI, AND X SYSTEMS) FOR OUR TARGETED SURGICAL SPECIALTIES WITHIN THE U.S., SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND THE EUROPEAN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SINCE 2018, WE OBTAINED REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS.  \u2022  IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SYNCHROSEAL INSTRUMENT AND E-100 GENERATOR.  \u2022  IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD, WHICH ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS FOR THE DA VINCI X/XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS.  \u2022  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM, DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE PLACED 18 ION SYSTEMS FOR COMMERCIAL USE AS OF MARCH 31, 2020.  \u2022  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT. IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  \u2022  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. THE XI CLEARANCE DOES NOT INCLUDE ADVANCED ENERGY OR STAPLING PRODUCTS THAT ATTACH TO THE XI SYSTEM. SEPARATE CLEARANCES ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS BY CHINA NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION (\u201cNMPA\u201d).  \u2022  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION PUBLISHED ON ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE THE QUOTA FOR MAJOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO BE IMPORTED AND SOLD IN CHINA THROUGH 2020. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SURGICAL SYSTEMS INTRODUCED BY OTHERS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAVE SOLD 65 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THIS QUOTA. FUTURE SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS.  \u2022  IN JULY 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 60, OUR DA VINCI ENDOWRIST 60MM STAPLER. IN JANUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 45. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN TAIWAN, SOUTH KOREA, AND JAPAN TO MARKET BOTH SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45.  \u2022  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A SINGLE PORT APPROACH. IN MARCH 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA IN MAY 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE AN INSTALLED BASE OF 47 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020.  \u2022  IN APRIL 2018, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND.  REFER TO THE DESCRIPTIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCES IN 2020, 2019, AND 2018 IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW.  THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE (\u201cMHLW\u201d) CONSIDERS REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES IN APRIL OF EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS. THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRES JAPANESE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS AND SURGICAL SOCIETIES, WITH OUR SUPPORT, TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT REQUIRE IN-COUNTRY CLINICAL DATA/ECONOMIC DATA. IN APRIL 2012 AND APRIL 2016, THE MHLW GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS FOR DA VINCI PROSTATECTOMY (\u201cDVP\u201d) AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, RESPECTIVELY. MOST PROSTATECTOMIES AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMIES WERE OPEN PROCEDURES PRIOR TO DA VINCI REIMBURSEMENT. DA VINCI PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY PROCEDURES ARE HIGHER THAN OPEN PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS. AN ADDITIONAL 12 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. AN ADDITIONAL 7 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2020. THESE ADDITIONAL 19 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND WILL BE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE 19 PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURES. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECALLS AND CORRECTIONS  MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES HAVE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS TO CORRECT OR REMOVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE FIELD THAT COULD POSE A RISK TO HEALTH. THE DEFINITION OF \u201cRECALLS AND CORRECTIONS\u201d IS EXPANSIVE AND INCLUDES REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, INSPECTIONS, RELABELING, AND ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OR REINFORCEMENT OF EXISTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND TRAINING WHEN SUCH ACTIONS ARE TAKEN FOR SPECIFIC REASONS OF SAFETY OR COMPLIANCE. THESE FIELD ACTIONS REQUIRE STRINGENT DOCUMENTATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING WORLDWIDE. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIONS THAT A MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER MAY TAKE IN THE FIELD WITHOUT REPORTING INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ROUTINE SERVICING AND STOCK ROTATIONS.  AS WE DETERMINE WHETHER A FIELD ACTION IS REPORTABLE IN ANY REGULATORY JURISDICTION, WE PREPARE AND SUBMIT NOTIFICATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCY FOR THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. REGULATORS CAN REQUIRE THE EXPANSION, RECLASSIFICATION, OR CHANGE IN SCOPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE FIELD ACTION. IN GENERAL, UPON SUBMITTING REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS TO REGULATORS REGARDING A FIELD ACTION THAT IS A RECALL OR CORRECTION, WE WILL NOTIFY CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE FIELD ACTION, PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED IN THEIR NATIONAL LANGUAGE, AND ARRANGE, AS REQUIRED, RETURN OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT OR A FIELD SERVICE VISIT TO PERFORM THE CORRECTION.  FIELD ACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN OUTCOMES FROM REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, DELAYS BY CUSTOMERS OF PURCHASE DECISIONS, REDUCTION OR STOPPAGE OF THE USE OF INSTALLED SYSTEMS, AND REDUCED REVENUE AS WELL AS INCREASED EXPENSES.  PROCEDURES  WE MODEL PATIENT VALUE AS EQUAL TO  PROCEDURE EFFICACY / INVASIVENESS  . IN THIS EQUATION,  PROCEDURE EFFICACY  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE SURGERY IN RESOLVING THE UNDERLYING DISEASE, AND  INVASIVENESS  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF PATIENT PAIN AND DISRUPTION OF REGULAR ACTIVITIES. WHEN THE PATIENT VALUE OF A DA VINCI PROCEDURE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM SEEKING OUT SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS THAT OFFER DA VINCI SURGERY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A LOCAL MARKET SHARE SHIFT. ADOPTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES OCCURS PROCEDURE BY PROCEDURE AND MARKET BY MARKET AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PATIENT VALUE AND TOTAL TREATMENT COSTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE SAME DISEASE STATE OR CONDITION.  WE USE THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS METRICS FOR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PROVIDE MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR PERFORMANCE, AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES PROCEDURE VOLUME IS AN INDICATOR OF THE RATE OF ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY AS WELL AS AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE REVENUE (INCLUDING REVENUE FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS). MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BOTH IT AND INVESTORS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE AND WHEN PLANNING, FORECASTING, AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ALSO FACILITATE MANAGEMENT\u2019S INTERNAL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS METRICS, BECAUSE (1) THEY ALLOW FOR GREATER TRANSPARENCY WITH RESPECT TO KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, AND (2) THEY ARE USED BY INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND THE ANALYST COMMUNITY TO HELP THEM ANALYZE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED ARE CONNECTED VIA THE INTERNET. SYSTEM LOGS CAN ALSO BE ACCESSED BY FIELD ENGINEERS FOR SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET. WE UTILIZE CERTAIN METHODS THAT RELY ON INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM THE SYSTEMS INSTALLED FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED THAT INVOLVE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, WHICH ARE, BY THEIR NATURE, SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS. ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS FOR DETERMINING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES MAY BE IMPACTED OVER TIME BY VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN TREATMENT MODALITIES, HOSPITAL AND DISTRIBUTOR REPORTING BEHAVIOR, AND SYSTEM INTERNET CONNECTIVITY. SUCH ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO SUSCEPTIBLE TO ALGORITHMIC OR OTHER TECHNICAL ERRORS. IN ADDITION, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AND OUR REVENUES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AND DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME GROWTH MAY NOT CORRESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN REVENUE. THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, REVENUE OR OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE RECENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC REDUCED OUR EXPECTED NUMBER OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. AS THE PANDEMIC INTENSIFIED GLOBALLY, WE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN PROCEDURE VOLUME IN THE U.S. AND WESTERN EUROPE, AS HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN THOSE AREAS DIVERTED RESOURCES TO MEET THE INCREASING DEMANDS OF MANAGING COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DISRUPTED THE CAPITAL MARKETS AS WELL AS WORLDWIDE ECONOMIES, WHICH COULD LEAD TO PROLONGED LOCAL AND/OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSIONS. THIS COULD PRESSURE HOSPITAL SPENDING, IMPACTING PROCEDURES, PROCEDURE GROWTH, AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THESE FACTORS, THE ABILITY TO FORECAST FUTURE PROCEDURES BASED ON HISTORICAL PROCEDURE PATTERNS HAS BEEN DISRUPTED. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE THAT HISTORICAL PROCEDURE TRENDS MAY NOT BE A GOOD INDICATOR OF FUTURE PROCEDURE VOLUMES. IN GEOGRAPHIES SUCH AS THE U.S. AND CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHERE COVID-19 CASES CONTINUE TO INCREASE, DA VINCI PROCEDURE VOLUME COULD DECLINE BELOW THE LEVELS EXPERIENCED AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WORLDWIDE PROCEDURES  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEMS AND INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULATED INDEPENDENTLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THE DISCUSSION OF INDICATIONS FOR USE AND REPRESENTATIVE OR TARGET PROCEDURES IS INTENDED SOLELY TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARKET FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO PROMOTE THE SALE OR USE OF ANY INTUITIVE PRODUCT OUTSIDE OF ITS LICENSED OR CLEARED LABELING AND INDICATIONS FOR USE.  THE ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY USING THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW FOR THOSE PROCEDURES THAT OFFER GREATER PATIENT VALUE AS COMPARED TO NON-DA VINCI ALTERNATIVES AND TO PROVIDE COMPETITIVE TOTAL ECONOMICS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USED PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GENERAL SURGERY INCLUDE HERNIA REPAIR (BOTH VENTRAL AND INGUINAL) AND COLORECTAL PROCEDURES. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GYNECOLOGY INCLUDE DA VINCI HYSTERECTOMY (\u201cDVH\u201d), FOR BOTH CANCER AND BENIGN CONDITIONS, AND SACROCOLPOPEXY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN UROLOGY INCLUDE DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY. IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE DA VINCI LOBECTOMY AND DA VINCI  MITRAL VALVE REPAIR. IN HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE CERTAIN PROCEDURES RESECTING BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMORS CLASSIFIED AS T1 AND T2. NOT ALL OF THE INDICATIONS, PROCEDURES, OR PRODUCTS DESCRIBED MAY BE AVAILABLE IN A GIVEN COUNTRY OR REGION OR ON ALL GENERATIONS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. SURGEONS AND THEIR PATIENTS NEED TO CONSULT THE PRODUCT LABELING IN THEIR SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND FOR EACH PRODUCT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CLEARED USES, AS WELL AS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS, RESTRICTIONS, OR CONTRAINDICATIONS.  IN 2019, APPROXIMATELY 1,229,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 1,038,000 AND 877,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH IN OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2018 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES AND WORLDWIDE UROLOGY PROCEDURES.  U.S. PROCEDURES  OVERALL U.S. PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 883,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 753,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 644,000 IN 2017. GENERAL SURGERY WAS OUR LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING U.S. SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 421,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 325,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 246,000 IN 2017. GYNECOLOGY WAS OUR SECOND LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 282,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 265,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 252,000 IN 2017. UROLOGY WAS OUR THIRD LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2019 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 138,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 128,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 118,000 IN 2017.  PROCEDURES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.  OVERALL OUS PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 346,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 285,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 233,000 IN 2017. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST OUS MARKETS WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME, WHICH GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 206,000 IN 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 175,000 IN 2018 AND APPROXIMATELY 149,000 IN 2017. GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH.  RECENT BUSINESS EVENTS AND TRENDS  PROCEDURES  OVERALL.  TOTAL DA VINCI PROCEDURES GREW APPROXIMATELY 10% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THORACIC PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS LOWER GROWTH IN THE MORE MATURE UROLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORY.  PROCEDURE VOLUME OUS GREW APPROXIMATELY 11% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. THE DISRUPTION WAS MOST PRONOUNCED IN CHINA, ITALY, FRANCE, GERMANY, AND THE REST OF EUROPE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY (PARTICULARLY COLORECTAL), GYNECOLOGY, KIDNEY CANCER, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  U.S. GENERAL SURGERY.  GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE MAJORITY OF INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. INGUINAL AND VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIRS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS THEY DID IN 2019 AND 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT GROWTH IN DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR REFLECTS IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES WITHIN CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL COST BENEFITS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS. WE BELIEVE HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE GROWTH IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OF VARIOUS HERNIA PATIENT POPULATIONS AND VARYING SURGEON OPINION REGARDING OPTIMAL SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF AND TO WHAT EXTENT DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURE VOLUME WILL GROW IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT A LARGE PORTION OF HERNIA REPAIRS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED VIA DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF SURGERY.  ADOPTION OF DA VINCI FOR COLORECTAL PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL UNDERLYING PROCEDURES INCLUDING LOW ANTERIOR RESECTIONS FOR RECTAL CANCERS AND CERTAIN COLON PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN AND CANCEROUS CONDITIONS, HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IS SUPPORTED BY OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE ENDOWRIST STAPLERS, ENERGY DEVICES, AND INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION.  IN RECENT QUARTERS, WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH FROM OTHER U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CHOLECYSTECTOMY AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. OUR INTRODUCTION OF THE SUREFORM 60MM STAPLER PRODUCT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 HAS PROVIDED SURGEONS A BETTER OPTIMIZED ROBOTIC TOOL FOR BARIATRIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. GYNECOLOGY  . U.S. GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES DECLINED MODESTLY DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED TO 2019. THE DECLINE REFLECTS SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE. COMBINING ROBOTIC, LAPAROSCOPIC, AND VAGINAL APPROACHES, MIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 80% OF THE U.S. HYSTERECTOMY MARKET FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS.  GLOBAL UROLOGY.  GLOBAL UROLOGY PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE GROWTH. IN THE U.S., DVP IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER, AND WE BELIEVE GROWTH IS LARGELY ALIGNED WITH SURGICAL VOLUMES OF PROSTATE CANCER. FOR OUS, DVP IS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD BUT IS THE LARGEST OVERALL DA VINCI PROCEDURE. THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 GROWTH IN OUS DVP WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO THIRDS OF THE GROWTH IN 2019, WHICH IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PROCEDURE DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE.  KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR RECENT GLOBAL UROLOGY GROWTH. CLINICAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USE OF A DA VINCI SYSTEM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PATIENT WILL RECEIVE NEPHRON-SPARING SURGERY THROUGH A PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, WHICH IS TYPICALLY THE SURGICAL SOCIETY GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED THERAPY.  OUS PROCEDURES.  THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH RATE REFLECTS CONTINUED DA VINCI ADOPTION IN EUROPEAN AND ASIAN MARKETS. IN 2018 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA MODERATED, AS THE PREVIOUS SYSTEMS QUOTA EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2015 AND SYSTEMS INSTALLED IN CHINA WERE HIGHLY UTILIZED. IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A NEW QUOTA TO ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA THROUGH 2020, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THIS QUOTA APPLIES TO THE DA VINCI SI AND RECENTLY APPROVED XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (REFER TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN THE \u201cCLEARANCES AND APPROVALS\u201d SECTION), AS WELL AS COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS WHEN AND IF CLEARED BY NMPA. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON PROVINCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESSES AND HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS. IN THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA ACCELERATED, AS INITIAL SYSTEMS PLACED DURING THESE QUARTERS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE FIELD. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK IN CHINA DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE, THE PROCEDURE VOLUME DECREASED BY 23% AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. IN JAPAN, WE EXPERIENCED STRONG PROCEDURE GROWTH AFTER RECEIVING THE NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY IN 2012 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, AS ADOPTION FOR THESE PROCEDURES HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS HIGHER LEVELS OF PENETRATION, GROWTH IN THESE TWO UROLOGIC PROCEDURES HAS MODERATED. A TOTAL OF 12 ADDITIONAL DA VINCI  PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT STATUS EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN JAPAN HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE NEW PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS. HOWEVER, THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND ARE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURE. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON PROCEDURE VOLUME IN JAPAN WAS LIMITED. IN ITALY, FRANCE, GERMANY, AND WESTERN EUROPE, WHILE PROCEDURE VOLUME CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE GROWTH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEM DEMAND  FUTURE DEMAND FOR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE IMPACTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AS NOTED IN THE  COVID-19 PANDEMIC  SECTION ABOVE, HOSPITAL RESPONSE TO THE EVOLVING HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION, PROCEDURE GROWTH RATES, HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION TRENDS, EVOLVING SYSTEM UTILIZATION AND POINT OF CARE DYNAMICS, CAPITAL REPLACEMENT TRENDS, ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS IN VARIOUS GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING JAPAN, THE TIMING AROUND GOVERNMENTAL TENDERS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, INCLUDING CHINA, THE TIMING OF WHEN WE RECEIVE REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN OUR OTHER OUS MARKETS FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM, DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS, AND MARKET RESPONSE.  MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE NATURE AND TIMING OF ADDITIONAL DA VINCI SP REGULATORY INDICATIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT FUTURE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY COMPETITION, INCLUDING FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE INTRODUCED PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY OR HAVE MADE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTER THE FIELD INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AVATERA MEDICAL GMBH; CMR SURGICAL LIMITED; JOHNSON & JOHNSON (INCLUDING THEIR WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AURIS HEALTH, INC. AND VERB SURGICAL INC.); MEDICAROID INC.; MEDROBOTICS CORP.; MEDTRONIC PLC; MEERECOMPANY INC.; OLYMPUS CORP.; SAMSUNG CORPORATION; SMART ROBOT TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO. LTD.; TITAN MEDICAL, INC.; TRANSENTERIX, INC.; AND WEGO HOLDING CO., LTD.  MANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WILL ALSO IMPACT FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR RECENTLY CLEARED ION SYSTEM, AS WE EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING INTO DIAGNOSTICS, ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPETITION, CLINICAL DATA TO DEMONSTRATE VALUE, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE.  NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS  SYNCHROSEAL AND E100 GENERATOR.  IN NOVEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SYNCHROSEAL INSTRUMENT AND E-100 GENERATOR. SYNCHROSEAL IS A SINGLE-USE, BIPOLAR, ELECTROSURGICAL INSTRUMENT INTENDED FOR GRASPING, DISSECTION, SEALING, AND TRANSECTION OF TISSUE.

REVENUE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 19% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE GENERALLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES WHERE WE HAVE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  REVENUE GENERATED IN THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR BOTH THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019. WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. REVENUE HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF TOTAL REVENUE DUE TO U.S. PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO CHOOSE THEIR PROVIDER AND METHOD OF TREATMENT, REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES SUPPORTIVE OF INNOVATION AND MIS, AND OUR INITIAL INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS IN THE OUS MARKETS, AND OUR OUS PROCEDURES HAVE GROWN FASTER IN PROPORTION TO U.S. PROCEDURES. WE EXPECT THAT OUR OUS PROCEDURES AND REVENUE WILL MAKE UP A GREATER PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE LONG TERM.  AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AND CAUSES STRAIN ON HOSPITAL RESOURCES, COUPLED WITH RECOMMENDED DEFERRALS OF ELECTIVE PROCEDURES, WE EXPECT PROCEDURES AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS TO DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT PROCEDURES AND SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND BEYOND.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR REVENUE AND SYSTEM UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND UNIT SHIPMENTS).

INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE INCREASED BY 12% TO $618 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $552 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES REVENUE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PROCEDURE GROWTH OF 10%, INCREMENTAL SALES OF OUR ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, AND CUSTOMER BUYING PATTERNS. FIRST QUARTER 2020 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH OF 9% WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES AS WELL AS SLOWER GROWTH IN THE MORE MATURE UROLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORY. OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS 11% AND WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN UROLOGIC PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES. GEOGRAPHICALLY, FIRST QUARTER 2020 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE EXPANSION IN JAPAN, KOREA, AND GERMANY WITH VARYING RESULTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING A 23% DECLINE IN PROCEDURES IN CHINA AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $283 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $248 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 SYSTEMS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SYSTEM SHIPMENTS, HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 ASPS, AND HIGHER OPERATING LEASE REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LEASE BUYOUTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, A TOTAL O  F 237 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED COMPARED WITH 235 SYSTEMS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. BY GEOGRAPHY, 182 SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 25 INTO EUROPE, 27 INTO ASIA, AND 3 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2020  , COMPARED WITH 154 SYSTEMS SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 49 INTO EUROPE, 21 INTO ASIA, AND 11 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN SYSTEMS SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH, THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH CAPACITY, AND MORE CUSTOMERS TRADING IN OLDER DA VINCI MODELS FOR FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X SYSTEMS.  WE SHIPPED 121 AND 81 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 77 AND 78 SYSTEMS WERE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE WAS $39.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $20.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. SYSTEMS PLACED AS OPERATING LEASES REPRESENTED 32% OF TOTAL SHIPMENTS DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, COMPARED WITH 33% DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. A TOTAL 721 OF DA VINCI  SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED AT CUSTOMERS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH 423 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS WAS $12.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $12.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS TO FLUCTUATE PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THE BUYOUT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THEIR LEASES.  THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM ASP, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMS SHIPPED UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AND ION SYSTEMS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.44 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.31 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER FIRST QUARTER 2020 ASP WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TRADE-IN VOLUME. ASP FLUCTUATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCT PRICING, SYSTEMS SHIPPED INVOLVING TRADE-INS, AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  SERVICE REVENUE  SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $199 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED WITH $174 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS PRODUCING SERVICE REVENUE.  GROSS PROFIT  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED 9% TO $604 MILLION, REPRESENTING 67.1% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $553 MILLION, REPRESENTING 69.2% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCT REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE LOWER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DA VINCI SI PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $12.8 MILLION AND $11.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $8.8 MILLION AND $7.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $134 MILLION, REPRESENTING 67.5% OF SERVICE REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $116 MILLION, REPRESENTING 66.8% OF SERVICE REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE, REFLECTING A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. THE HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER REPAIR COSTS.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $5.5 MILLION AND $4.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $0.9 MILLION AND $0.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  AS A RESULT OF AN EXPECTED DECREASE IN OVERALL DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020, WE EXPECT THAT OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES WILL RUN AT LESS THAN NORMAL CAPACITY. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN LABOR AND FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEAD COSTS WILL BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN. WE CANNOT RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL IMPACT OUR OVERALL DEMAND IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND BEYOND.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS FOR SALES, MARKETING, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRADESHOW EXPENSES, LEGAL EXPENSES, REGULATORY FEES, AND GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED BY 13% TO $308 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $273 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER HEADCOUNT, INCLUDING EXPANSION OF OUR ASIAN AND EUROPEAN TEAMS, AND INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $45.7 MILLION AND $38.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $1.7 MILLION AND $1.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR SPENDING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 REFLECTED NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES INTO MARCH AND THEN A CURTAILMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WHILE CERTAIN SPENDING WILL DECREASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN REVENUE AND ACTIVITIES LIMITED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MUCH OF OUR SPENDING WILL CONTINUE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS, INVEST IN INNOVATION FOCUSED ON THE QUADRUPLE AIM, AND INVEST IN MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO ENSURE SUPPLY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. CERTAIN COSTS WILL DECLINE AS THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITIES ARE RESTRICTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, INCLUDING TRAVEL AND RELATED EXPENSES, CLINICAL TRIALS, SURGEON TRAINING, AND CUSTOMER DATA COLLECTION. WE WILL ELIMINATE SPENDING THAT IS INEFFECTIVE DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, SUCH AS SURGEON AND HOSPITAL EVENTS, AND WE ARE PAUSING THE HIRING OF VOLUME-RELATED ROLES, SUCH AS SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND MANUFACTURING EMPLOYEES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, INCREASED BY 2% TO $147 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $144 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES AND OTHER PROJECT COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT A BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ION AND SP PLATFORM INVESTMENTS, INFORMATICS, ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROBOTICS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTANGIBLE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $27.2 MILLION AND $22.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND INTANGIBLE ASSET-RELATED CHARGES OF $1.9 MILLION AND $20.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FLUCTUATE WITH PROJECT TIMING. BASED UPON OUR BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND THE STAGE OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATE THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $25.1 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $27.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY REALIZED FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME EARNED DUE TO HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. HOWEVER, AVERAGE INTEREST RATES DECLINED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT  INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $8.1 MILLION, OR 2.6% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $24.3 MILLION, OR 8.7% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS MAINLY DUE TO LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019, INCLUDED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS OF $65.4 MILLION AND $72.7 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 21.2 AND 26.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OR DEFICIENCIES WILL FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE VOLUME OF SHARE-BASED INSTRUMENTS SETTLED OR VESTED, AND THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS UNDER U.S. GAAP, WHICH RESULTS IN INCREASED INCOME TAX EXPENSE VOLATILITY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE FILE FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN INCOME TAX RETURNS IN MANY U.S. AND OUS JURISDICTIONS. YEARS BEFORE 2016 ARE CLOSED FOR THE SIGNIFICANT JURISDICTIONS. CERTAIN OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE TO ACTIVITIES OF VARIOUS TAX AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING EVOLVING INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS IN THE JURISDICTIONS WE OPERATE, POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT OF ADDITIONAL TAX, POSSIBLE SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS, OR THROUGH NORMAL EXPIRATION OF VARIOUS STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY CHANGE. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE TIMING AND POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF AUDITS, WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT MAY OCCUR IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN OUR TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  IN JULY 2015, A U.S. TAX COURT OPINION (THE \u201c2015 OPINION\u201d) WAS ISSUED INVOLVING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY CHARGES FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE U.S. TAX COURT, WE WERE REQUIRED TO, AND DID, REFUND TO OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ELEMENT OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY CHARGES MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. STARTING IN 2015, DIRECT SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM INTERCOMPANY CHARGES. IN JUNE 2019, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT\u201d) REVERSED THE 2015 OPINION (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT OPINION\u201d). SUBSEQUENTLY, A RE-HEARING OF THE CASE WAS REQUESTED BUT WAS DENIED IN NOVEMBER 2019. IN FEBRUARY 2020, A PETITION WAS FILED TO APPEAL THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. SINCE THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION POTENTIALLY IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER JUDICIAL REVIEW, WE CONTINUE TO TREAT OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2015 OPINION AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION OF THE POSITION IN LIGHT OF THE PRESENT FACTS. IN THE EVENT OF A FINAL OPINION WHICH REVERSES THE 2015 OPINION, THERE MAY BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  THE COMPANY\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE (THE \u201cJOINT VENTURE\u201d) WITH SHANGHAI FOSUN PHARMACEUTICAL (GROUP) CO., LTD. (\u201cFOSUN PHARMA\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, WAS ESTABLISHED TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THE JOINT VENTURE IS OWNED 60% BY US AND 40% BY FOSUN PHARMA AND IS LOCATED IN CHINA. THE CATHETER-BASED TECHNOLOGY WILL INITIALLY TARGET EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED FORMS OF CANCER IN THE WORLD. DISTRIBUTION OF CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES IN CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT VENTURE, WHILE DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE OF CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY US.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE JOINT VENTURE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND CERTAIN PERSONNEL, FROM CHINDEX AND ITS AFFILIATES, A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN PHARMA, AND BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED $55 MILLION OF UP TO $100 MILLION REQUIRED BY THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THE JOINT VENTURE TO GENERATE REVENUE IN 2020 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE SUCH PRODUCTS. THERE CAN ALSO BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND ITS BUSINESS, THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROFITABLE, OR THAT THE ACQUIRED CHINDEX ASSETS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS WILL BE REALIZED.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, WAS $2.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $(2.5) MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE AND A RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND BY THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PLUS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED BY $0.1 BILLION TO $5.9 BILLION AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, FROM $5.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, PRIMARILY FROM CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY TAXES PAID RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF EQUITY AWARDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE RESOURCES WE DEVOTE TO DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING OUR PRODUCTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND PROCEDURE ADOPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, FACILITIES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BASED UPON OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH INCOME TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE EXPECT TO EXPERIENCE REDUCED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUES AND EXTENDING PAYMENT TERMS ON SALES AND OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. MOREOVER, WE ARE FOCUSED ON ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPLIES ON HAND GIVEN THE POTENTIAL DISRUPTION OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO OUR SUPPLIERS AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE INVENTORY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 AND BEYOND.  SEE \u201cITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, FOR DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW DATA  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AND 2019 (IN MILLIONS).  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2020  2019  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $352.8  $333.2  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (117.1)  (308.9)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (178.7)  (41.8)  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (0.8)  (1.2)  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $56.2  $(18.7)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $353 MILLION EXCEEDED OUR NET INCOME OF $316 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  1.  OUR NET INCOME INCLUDED NON-CASH CHARGES OF $223 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT ITEMS: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF $91 MILLION; DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OF $65 MILLION; DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND LOSSES ON THE DISPOSAL OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $51 MILLION; AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $12 MILLION.  2.  THE NON-CASH CHARGES OUTLINED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT RESULTED IN $186 MILLION OF CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED BY $132 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN LEASING AND AN INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DECREASED BY $95 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENTS OF 2019 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. INVENTORY, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT FROM INVENTORY TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, INCREASED BY $65 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED NUMBER OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS AND BUILD-UP TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS TO MITIGATE RISKS OF DISRUPTION THAT COULD ARISE FROM TRADE, SUPPLY, OR OTHER MATTERS, SUCH AS THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $118 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $105 MILLION, THE ORPHEUS MEDICAL ACQUISITION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF $38 MILLION, AND PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS (NET OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS) OF $26 MILLION. WE INVEST PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGH QUALITY, FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY, AT ANY TIME, CONTAIN INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL NOTES, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CASH DEPOSITS, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES OF $149 MILLION AND CASH USED IN THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $100 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES OF $91 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INTENSIVE. HOWEVER, WITH THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY AND FACILITIES AND IN MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS HAVE INCREASED. WE EXPECT THESE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO EXCEED $400 MILLION IN BOTH 2020 AND 2021. WE INTEND TO FUND THESE NEEDS WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW OR MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE, OR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE, TO THE COMPANY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC", "CIK": 1035267, "Date": "2020-04-17T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ISRG", "Name": "Intuitive Surgical Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3842.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 770416458.0, "key": "20200417ISRG", "labelr1": -1.51995896110805, "labelr2": -4.1865220998205865, "labelr3": 3.1210357811650526, "labelr4": 0.2128365844609829, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5583751, "prof1": 0.4416249, "return1&2": 1.0577011447874365, "return1&2&3": 1.024689913600828, "return1&2&3&4": 1.022508998587404, "return2": 1.0418652209982058, "return1": 1.0151995896110806, "return3": 0.9687896421883496, "return4": 0.9978716341553902, "1_day_return": -1.5199589611080475, "cumulative_return1": 0.030367355970512763, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3833, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9848004103889195, "cumreturn1b": 1.233050573772734, "cumreturn1c": 1.0661318587020137, "cumreturndow": 1.142748395871281, "cumreturnsp500": 1.129249095172886}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3834, "level_0": 3942, "index": 50432, "text": "ITEM 2  .

SNAP-ON HAS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS INHERENT WITH FOREIGN OPERATIONS, INCLUDING FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION FLUCTUATIONS.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES PERFORMANCE BASED ON ORGANIC SALES GROWTH, WHICH PRIMARILY REFLECTS GROWTH FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S EXISTING BUSINESSES AS A RESULT OF INCREASED OUTPUT, CUSTOMER BASE AND GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND/OR PRICING, AND EXCLUDES SALES CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACQUIRED OPERATIONS THE COMPANY DID NOT OWN AS OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY\u2019S ORGANIC SALES DISCLOSURES ALSO EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY THAT CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ORGANIC SALES IS MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES THEM WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO AID IN IDENTIFYING UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESSES AND FACILITATES COMPARISONS OF OUR SALES PERFORMANCE WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  RECENT ACQUISITIONS  ON JANUARY 31, 2020, SNAP-ON ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE TREADREADER PRODUCT LINE FROM SIGMAVISION LIMITED (\u201cSIGMAVISION\u201d) FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $5.9  MILLION. SIGMAVISION DESIGNS AND MANUFACTURES HANDHELD DEVICES AND DRIVE-OVER RAMPS THAT PROVIDE TIRE INFORMATION FOR USE IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES.  THE ACQUISITION ENHANCES AND EXPANDS SNAP-ON\u2019S EXISTING CAPABILITIES IN SERVING VEHICLE REPAIR FACILITIES AND WILL EXPAND THE COMPANY\u2019S PRESENCE WITH REPAIR SHOP OWNERS AND MANAGERS.  ON AUGUST 7, 2019, SNAP-ON ACQUIRED COGNITRAN LIMITED (\u201cCOGNITRAN\u201d) FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $30.6  MILLION (OR $29.6  MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED). COGNITRAN, BASED IN CHELMSFORD, UNITED KINGDOM, SPECIALIZES IN FLEXIBLE, MODULAR AND HIGHLY SCALABLE \u201cSOFTWARE AS A SERVICE\u201d (SAAS) PRODUCTS FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (\u201cOEM\u201d) CUSTOMERS AND THEIR DEALERS, FOCUSED ON THE CREATION AND DELIVERY OF SERVICE, DIAGNOSTICS, PARTS AND REPAIR INFORMATION TO OEM DEALERS AND CONNECTED VEHICLE PLATFORMS. THE ACQUISITION ENHANCED AND EXPANDED SNAP-ON\u2019S CAPABILITIES IN PROVIDING SHOP EFFICIENCY SOLUTIONS THROUGH INTEGRATED UPSTREAM SERVICES TO OEM CUSTOMERS IN AUTOMOTIVE, HEAVY DUTY, AGRICULTURAL AND RECREATIONAL APPLICATIONS.  ON APRIL 2, 2019, SNAP-ON ACQUIRED POWER HAWK TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (\u201cPOWER HAWK\u201d) FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $7.9  MILLION.  POWER HAWK, BASED IN ROCKAWAY, NEW JERSEY, DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES RESCUE TOOLS AND RELATED EQUIPMENT FOR A VARIETY OF MILITARY, GOVERNMENTAL, AND FIRE, RESCUE AND EMERGENCY OPERATIONS. THE ACQUISITION OF THE POWER HAWK PRODUCT LINE COMPLEMENTED AND INCREASED SNAP-ON\u2019S EXISTING PRODUCT OFFERING AND BROADENED ITS ESTABLISHED CAPABILITIES IN SERVING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES.  ON JANUARY 25, 2019, SNAP-ON ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF TMB GEOMARKETING LIMITED (\u201cTMB\u201d) FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $1.3  MILLION. TMB, BASED IN DORKING, UNITED KINGDOM, DESIGNS PLANNING SOFTWARE USED BY OEMS TO OPTIMIZE DEALER LOCATIONS AND MANAGE THE PERFORMANCE OF DEALER OUTLETS.  THE ACQUISITION OF TMB EXTENDED SNAP-ON\u2019S PRODUCT LINE IN ITS CORE DEALER NETWORK SOLUTIONS BUSINESS.  FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ASSETS OF SIGMAVISION, COGNITRAN AND TMB HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE REPAIR SYSTEMS & INFORMATION GROUP SINCE THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION DATES AND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ASSETS OF POWER HAWK HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMMERCIAL & INDUSTRIAL GROUP SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE.

THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE FIRST QUARTER PROGRESSED, IMPACTING SNAP-ON\u2019S SALES VOLUMES IN MOST GEOGRAPHIES AND ACROSS A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR.  IN ADDITION, THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY COVID-19 LED TO AN INCREASE IN OUR CREDIT RESERVE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO.  COVID-19 HAS CAUSED DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, AND HAS AUTHORED AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN.  IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19, NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVE INSTITUTED CERTAIN MEASURES, INCLUDING TRAVEL BANS, PROHIBITIONS ON GROUP EVENTS AND GATHERINGS, SHUTDOWNS OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES, CURFEWS, SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDERS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRACTICE SOCIAL DISTANCING.  ALTHOUGH OUR OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN DEEMED ESSENTIAL AND WE FOLLOW THE COVID-19 GUIDELINES FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (\u201cCDC\u201d) CONCERNING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR PERSONNEL, THESE MEASURES HAVE RESULTED IN ATTENUATING ACTIVITY AND, IN SOME CASES, REQUIRED TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF CERTAIN OF OUR FACILITIES, AMONG OTHER IMPACTS.  THE DURATION OF THESE MEASURES IS UNKNOWN, MAY BE EXTENDED AND ADDITIONAL MEASURES MAY BE IMPOSED.

SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND COLLECTIONS OF FINANCE RECEIVABLES, COUPLED WITH ITS SOURCES OF BORROWINGS AND AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, NEW RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, THE FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS, AND FUNDING FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS, IF AND AS THEY ARISE.  DUE TO SNAP-ON\u2019S CREDIT RATING OVER THE YEARS, EXTERNAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE AT AN ACCEPTABLE COST. AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 17, 2020, SNAP-ON\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER WERE RATED, RESPECTIVELY, A2 AND P-1 BY MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE; A- AND A-2 BY STANDARD & POOR\u2019S; AND A AND F1 BY FITCH RATINGS. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CURRENT CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE SOUND AND THAT THE STRENGTH OF ITS BALANCE SHEET AFFORDS THE COMPANY THE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, INCLUDING THROUGH ACCESS TO FINANCIAL MARKETS FOR POTENTIAL NEW FINANCING, TO RESPOND TO BOTH INTERNAL GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AND THOSE AVAILABLE THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, BASED ON CURRENT MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS RESULTING FROM THE UNCERTAINTY CAUSED BY COVID-19, SNAP-ON CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES OF THE AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE FINANCING OR THE TERMS ON WHICH IT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE, OR THAT ITS DEBT RATINGS MAY NOT DECREASE.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, WORKING CAPITAL (CURRENT ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES) OF $1,381.2 MILLION DECREASED $51.7 MILLION FROM $1,432.9 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019 (FISCAL 2019 YEAR END) PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE NET CHANGES DISCUSSED BELOW.

THESE INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY: (I) THE FUNDING OF $212.8 MILLION OF NEW FINANCE RECEIVABLES; (II) DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $59.0 MILLION; (III) THE REPURCHASE OF 349,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK FOR $50.5 MILLION; (IV) $41.9 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS FROM OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS; (V) THE FUNDING OF $17.2 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; AND (VI) THE FUNDING OF $6.1 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS.  OF THE $185.8 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, $154.3 MILLION WAS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. SNAP-ON MAINTAINS NON-U.S. FUNDS IN ITS FOREIGN OPERATIONS TO: (I) PROVIDE ADEQUATE WORKING CAPITAL; (II) SATISFY VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND/OR (III) TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BUSINESS EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  ALTHOUGH THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d) GENERALLY ELIMINATED U.S. FEDERAL TAXATION OF DIVIDENDS FROM FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, SUCH DIVIDENDS MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO STATE INCOME TAXATION AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES. SNAP-ON PERIODICALLY EVALUATES ITS CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND MAY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO REPATRIATE CERTAIN FOREIGN CASH AMOUNTS TO THE EXTENT THAT IT DOES NOT INCUR UNFAVORABLE NET TAX CONSEQUENCES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  TRADE AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \u2013 NET OF $635.2 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $59.4 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COLLECTIONS, THE IMPACT OF LOWER SALES VOLUME AND $21.9 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (TRADE AND OTHER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE \u2013 NET AS OF THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD END, DIVIDED BY THE RESPECTIVE TRAILING 12 MONTHS SALES, TIMES 360 DAYS) WAS 62 DAYS AT MARCH 28, 2020, AND 67 DAYS AT DECEMBER 28, 2019.  THE CURRENT PORTIONS OF NET FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $606.5 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, COMPARED TO $630.8 MILLION AT 2019 YEAR END. THE LONG-TERM PORTIONS OF NET FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OF $1,457.3 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, COMPARED TO $1,463.6 MILLION AT 2019 YEAR END. THE COMBINED $30.6 MILLION DECREASE IN NET CURRENT AND LONG-TERM FINANCE AND CONTRACT RECEIVABLES OVER 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $25.7 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, $8.1 MILLION OF PROVISION CHARGES RESULTING FROM THE FISCAL YEAR 2020 ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326  ) AND $2.6 MILLION OF HIGHER CREDIT RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO.  INVENTORIES \u2013 NET OF $757.4 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $3.0 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS, REFLECTING $25.1 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $22.1 MILLION PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT CONTINUED CUSTOMER DEMAND AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS.  INVENTORY TURNS (TRAILING 12 MONTHS OF COST OF GOODS SOLD, DIVIDED BY THE AVERAGE OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING INVENTORY BALANCE FOR THE TRAILING 12 MONTHS) WERE 2.5 TURNS AND 2.6 TURNS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. INVENTORIES ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cFIFO\u201d) METHOD APPROXIMATED 57% AND 58% OF TOTAL INVENTORIES AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER INVENTORIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\u201cLIFO\u201d) METHOD. THE COMPANY\u2019S LIFO RESERVE WAS $84.5 MILLION AS OF BOTH MARCH 28, 2020, AND DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NOTES PAYABLE OF $160.1 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, INCLUDED $150 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITY BORROWINGS, WHICH BEAR A MATURITY DATE WITHIN THREE MONTHS FROM THE BORROWING DATE, AND $10.1 MILLION OF OTHER NOTES. THERE WERE NO COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AS OF MARCH 28, 2020 DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. AS OF 2019 YEAR END, NOTES PAYABLE OF $202.9 MILLION INCLUDED $193.6 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS AND $9.3 MILLION OF OTHER NOTES.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $193.7 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, DECREASED $4.8 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND $3.3 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $397.0 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, INCREASED $26.2 MILLION FROM 2019 YEAR-END LEVELS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INCOME TAX ACCRUALS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8.0 MILLION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  LONG-TERM DEBT OF $948.2 MILLION AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, CONSISTED OF: (I) $250 MILLION OF UNSECURED 6.125% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2021 (THE \u201c2021 NOTES\u201d); (II) $300 MILLION OF UNSECURED 3.25% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2027 (THE \u201c2027 NOTES\u201d); AND (III) $400 MILLION OF UNSECURED 4.10% NOTES THAT MATURE IN 2048 (THE \u201c2048 NOTES\u201d), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.8 MILLION FROM THE NET EFFECTS OF DEBT AMORTIZATION COSTS AND FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS. LONG-TERM DEBT OF $946.9 MILLION AS OF 2019 YEAR END CONSISTED OF: (I) $250 MILLION OF THE 2021 NOTES; (II) $300 MILLION OF THE 2027 NOTES; AND (III) $400 MILLION OF THE 2048 NOTES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.1 MILLION FROM THE NET EFFECTS OF DEBT AMORTIZATION COSTS AND FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS.  SNAP-ON HAS AN $800 MILLION MULTI-CURRENCY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT TERMINATES ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2024 (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d); $150 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF MARCH 28, 2020.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARYING RATES BASED ON EITHER: (I) SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT, LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS; OR (II) SNAP-ON\u2019S THEN-CURRENT RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT NET OF CERTAIN CASH ADJUSTMENTS (\u201cCONSOLIDATED NET DEBT\u201d) TO EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE PRECEDING FOUR FISCAL QUARTERS THEN ENDED (THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO\u201d). THE CREDIT FACILITY\u2019S FINANCIAL COVENANT REQUIRES THAT SNAP-ON MAINTAIN, AS OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER END, EITHER (I) A RATIO NOT GREATER THAN 0.60 TO 1.00 OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO THE SUM OF CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT PLUS TOTAL EQUITY AND LESS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS (THE \u201cLEVERAGE RATIO\u201d); OR (II) A CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO NOT GREATER THAN 3.50 TO 1.00. SNAP-ON MAY, UP TO TWO TIMES DURING ANY FIVE-YEAR PERIOD DURING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY (INCLUDING ANY EXTENSIONS THEREOF), ELECT TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO TO 0.65 TO 1.00 AND/OR INCREASE THE MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED NET DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO TO 4.00 TO 1.00 FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN MATERIAL ACQUISITIONS (AS DEFINED IN THE RELATED CREDIT AGREEMENT). AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL RATIOS OF 0.20 AND 0.93 RESPECTIVELY, WERE BOTH WITHIN THE PERMITTED RANGES SET FORTH IN THIS FINANCIAL COVENANT. SNAP-ON GENERALLY ISSUES COMMERCIAL PAPER TO FUND ITS FINANCING NEEDS ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS AND USES THE CREDIT FACILITY AS BACK-UP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT SUCH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  SNAP-ON BELIEVES IT HAS SUFFICIENT AVAILABLE CASH AND ACCESS TO BOTH COMMITTED AND UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO COVER ITS EXPECTED FUNDING NEEDS ON BOTH A SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BASIS, HOWEVER, IT IS CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON ITS BUSINESS AND THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS. SNAP-ON MANAGES ITS AGGREGATE SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS SO AS NOT TO EXCEED ITS AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT IT CAN ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, TO FUND ITS SHORT-TERM REQUIREMENTS AND TO ENSURE NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY. SNAP-ON REGULARLY MONITORS THE CREDIT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AND, IF IT BELIEVES CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE, IT MAY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SUCH CONDITIONS TO ISSUE LONG-TERM DEBT TO FURTHER IMPROVE ITS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR SNAP-ON INCLUDE SCHEDULED DEBT PAYMENTS, PAYMENTS OF INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS, FUNDING TO SUPPORT NEW RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY OUR FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, THE FUNDING OF PENSION PLANS, AND FUNDING FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS, IF AND AS THEY ARISE. SNAP-ON INTENDS TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS OF $8.7 MILLION TO ITS FOREIGN PENSION PLANS AND $2.9 MILLION TO ITS DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS IN 2020, AS REQUIRED BY LAW. DEPENDING ON MARKET AND OTHER CONDITIONS, SNAP-ON MAY MAKE DISCRETIONARY CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS IN 2020.  SNAP-ON\u2019S LONG-TERM FINANCING STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE DEBT MARKETS TO ACCOMMODATE ITS LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL USE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, ADDITIONAL FIXED-TERM DEBT AND/OR SECURITIZATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $213.4 MILLION AND $201.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE $12.1 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF $62.6 MILLION FROM NET CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40.1 MILLION DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $49.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO FINANCE RECEIVABLES OF $212.8 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COLLECTIONS OF $190.7 MILLION. NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $38.7 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDED ADDITIONS TO FINANCE RECEIVABLES OF $210.5 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COLLECTIONS OF $191.9 MILLION. FINANCE RECEIVABLES ARE COMPRISED OF EXTENDED-TERM INSTALLMENT PAYMENT CONTRACTS TO BOTH TECHNICIANS AND INDEPENDENT SHOP OWNERS (I.E., FRANCHISEES\u2019 CUSTOMERS) TO ENABLE THEM TO PURCHASE TOOLS AND DIAGNOSTIC AND EQUIPMENT PRODUCTS ON AN EXTENDED-TERM PAYMENT PLAN, GENERALLY WITH AVERAGE PAYMENT TERMS OF APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS.  NET CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE RESPECTIVE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019 ALSO INCLUDED $6.1 MILLION AND $1.3 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS. SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT ACQUISITIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $17.2 MILLION AND $20.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN BOTH YEARS INCLUDED CONTINUED INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTION OF ITS STRATEGIC VALUE CREATION PROCESSES AROUND SAFETY, QUALITY, CUSTOMER CONNECTION, INNOVATION AND RCI.  THE LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS A RESULT OF DECREASED EXPENDITURES AS A RESULT OF THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO COVID-19.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $157.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 INCLUDED REPAYMENTS OF NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $41.9 MILLION. NET CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $147.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 INCLUDED REPAYMENTS OF NOTES PAYABLE AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF $43.8 MILLION.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  PROCEEDS FROM STOCK PURCHASE AND OPTION PLAN EXERCISES TOTALED $1.5 MILLION AND $4.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. SNAP-ON HAS UNDERTAKEN STOCK REPURCHASES FROM TIME TO TIME TO OFFSET DILUTION CREATED BY SHARES ISSUED FOR EMPLOYEE AND FRANCHISEE STOCK PURCHASE PLANS, AS WELL AS STOCK OPTIONS, AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020, SNAP-ON REPURCHASED 349,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $50.5 MILLION UNDER ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, SNAP-ON REPURCHASED 295,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR $47.4 MILLION UNDER ITS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, SNAP-ON HAD REMAINING AVAILABILITY TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $313.3 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO ITS BOARD\u2019S AUTHORIZATIONS. THE PURCHASE OF SNAP-ON COMMON STOCK IS AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO PREVAILING FINANCIAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS.   SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY.  SNAP-ON HAS PAID CONSECUTIVE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS, WITHOUT INTERRUPTION OR REDUCTION, SINCE 1939. CASH DIVIDENDS TOTALED $59.0 MILLION AND $52.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, THE BOARD INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND BY 13.7% TO $1.08 PER SHARE ($4.32 PER SHARE ANNUALIZED). SNAP-ON BELIEVES THAT ITS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE FROM ITS CREDIT FACILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY DIVIDENDS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS OF MARCH 28, 2020.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  SNAP-ON\u2019S DISCLOSURES OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE CONTAINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019, HAVE NOT MATERIALLY CHANGED SINCE THAT REPORT WAS FILED, WITH THE EXCEPTION TO THE ADOPTION OF ASU NO. 2016-13,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326)  . AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN SNAP-ON\u2019S FINANCE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN UPDATED TO BE BASED ON ONGOING ASSESSMENTS AND EVALUATIONS OF CREDIT LOSSES OVER THE EXPECTED CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO CONSIDERING COLLECTABILITY, HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND FUTURE MARKET CHANGES. THE ALLOWANCE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION NUMEROUS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS THAT INCLUDE RECEIVABLE TYPE, HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, DELINQUENCY TRENDS, COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, CURRENT AND FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CREDIT RISK CHARACTERISTICS. SOME OF THESE FACTORS ARE INFLUENCED BY ITEMS SUCH AS THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST PAYMENT EXPERIENCE, CREDIT BUREAU AND PROPRIETARY SNAP-ON CREDIT MODEL INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.  MANAGEMENT UTILIZES ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE WELL CONTROLLED, REVIEWED AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED.  AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, THE RATIO OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES WAS 4.11%.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THE ALLOWANCE RATIO WAS 3.65%.  WHILE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT EXERCISES PRUDENT JUDGEMENT AND APPLIES REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS IN ESTABLISHING ITS ESTIMATE FOR THE ALLOWANCE FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR OTHER FACTORS WOULD NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATES USED IN THE ALLOWANCE CALCULATION.  FOR REFERENCE, A 100 BPS INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE RATIO FOR FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS OF MARCH 28, 2020, WOULD INCREASE SNAP-ON\u2019S 2020 ANNUAL EXPENSE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND THE RELATED PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES BY APPROXIMATELY $16.9 MILLION.  SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 4 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON SNAP-ON\u2019S ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SNAP-ON INCORPORATED  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  (CONTINUED)  OUTLOOK  THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS THE FIRST QUARTER PROGRESSED, IMPACTING SNAP-ON\u2019S SALES VOLUMES IN MOST GEOGRAPHIES AND ACROSS A VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THOSE IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR.  COVID-19 HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE GLOBE DURING 2020 AND IS IMPACTING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WORLDWIDE.  IN THE NEAR TERM, SNAP-ON ANTICIPATES NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE MACROECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND, AS A RESULT, EXPECTS SALES AND CREDIT ORIGINATIONS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020 TO BE DOWN YEAR OVER YEAR.  SNAP-ON DOES NOT, AS A GENERAL PRACTICE, FURNISH QUARTERLY SALES OR EARNINGS PROJECTIONS.  HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF ACTIONS IMPOSED BY NATIONAL AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS SECOND QUARTER 2020 SALES AND EARNINGS WILL BE LOWER THAN REPORTED SECOND QUARTER 2019 AMOUNTS.  SNAP-ON IS RESPONDING TO THE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES BY DEEPENING ITS RCI, SOURCING AND OTHER COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES.  SNAP-ON RECORDED $7.5 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN EUROPE, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  SNAP-ON WILL CONTINUE TO MANAGE ITS CASH FLOWS AND BALANCE ITS CAPITAL ALLOCATION PRIORITIES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS AND THE NEED FOR FURTHER COST REDUCTION ACTIONS; THE CURRENT ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO PRESENTLY PREDICT THIS BALANCE AS THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY ADJUSTS TO THE CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT.  SNAP-ON EXPECTS THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2020 WILL BE IN A RANGE OF $70 MILLION TO $80 MILLION, OF WHICH $17.2 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  DESPITE NEAR TERM UNCERTAINTY, SNAP-ON EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN FOCUS ON ITS DEFINED RUNWAYS FOR COHERENT GROWTH, LEVERAGING CAPABILITIES ALREADY DEMONSTRATED IN THE AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR ARENA AND DEVELOPING AND EXPANDING ITS PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER BASE, NOT ONLY IN AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR, BUT IN ADJACENT MARKETS, ADDITIONAL GEOGRAPHIES AND OTHER AREAS, INCLUDING EXTENDING IN CRITICAL INDUSTRIES, WHERE THE COST AND PENALTIES FOR FAILURE CAN BE HIGH.  SNAP-ON CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS FULL YEAR 2020 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WILL BE IN THE RANGE OF 23% TO 25%.  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Snap-on Inc", "CIK": 91440, "Date": "2020-04-21T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SNA", "Name": "Snap-on Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3420.0, "Business": "WI", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 390622040.0, "key": "20200421SNA", "labelr1": 2.9129726795730035, "labelr2": -0.0791139240506359, "labelr3": 2.1113750329902268, "labelr4": 7.728095115016812, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.54349124, "prof1": 0.45650876, "return1&2": 0.971638366774843, "return1&2&3": 0.951123436887805, "return1&2&3&4": 0.8776197130238985, "return2": 1.0007911392405064, "return1": 0.97087027320427, "return3": 0.9788862496700976, "return4": 0.922719048849832, "1_day_return": 2.9129726795730004, "cumulative_return1": 0.029168663976307508, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3837, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0324767425330774, "cumreturn1b": 1.2546640651987506, "cumreturn1c": 1.0516765183621621, "cumreturndow": 1.1330945391621128, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1209114697246683}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3843, "level_0": 3951, "index": 76071, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A GLOBAL SECURITY AND AEROSPACE COMPANY PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED IN THE RESEARCH, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, INTEGRATION AND SUSTAINMENT OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A BROAD RANGE OF MANAGEMENT, ENGINEERING, TECHNICAL, SCIENTIFIC, LOGISTICS, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND CYBERSECURITY SERVICES. WE SERVE BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS WITH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT HAVE DEFENSE, CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS, WITH OUR PRINCIPAL CUSTOMERS BEING AGENCIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  72%  OF OUR  $15.7 BILLION  IN NET SALES WERE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, EITHER AS A PRIME CONTRACTOR OR AS A SUBCONTRACTOR (INCLUDING  61%  FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)),  27%  WERE FROM INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS (INCLUDING FOREIGN MILITARY SALES (FMS) CONTRACTED THROUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT) AND  1%  WERE FROM U.S. COMMERCIAL AND OTHER CUSTOMERS. OUR MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS ARE IN DEFENSE, SPACE, INTELLIGENCE, HOMELAND SECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING CYBERSECURITY.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED ON JULY 1, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE FINAL STEP OF THE PLANNED FREEZE OF OUR QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS FOR SALARIED EMPLOYEES EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020; THE PLANS ARE NOW FULLY FROZEN. WITH THE FREEZE COMPLETE, THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALARIED EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATE IN AN ENHANCED DEFINED CONTRIBUTION RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN.  COVID-19  THE GLOBAL OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) WAS DECLARED A PANDEMIC BY THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND A NATIONAL EMERGENCY BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN MARCH 2020 AND HAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE U.S. AND GLOBAL ECONOMY, DISRUPTED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT TRAVEL AND TRANSPORT RESTRICTIONS, INCLUDING MANDATED CLOSURES AND ORDERS TO \u201cSHELTER-IN-PLACE,\u201d AND CREATED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION OF THE FINANCIAL MARKETS.  LOCKHEED MARTIN HAS TAKEN MEASURES TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL DISRUPTIONS AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY IN ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES POSED BY THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC. THE EXTENT OF THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR PROGRAMS IN THE EXPECTED TIMEFRAME, WILL DEPEND ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING THE DURATION AND SPREAD OF THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS TO PREVENT DISEASE SPREAD, ALL OF WHICH ARE UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE PREDICTED. THE OUTBREAK DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR BUSINESS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. HOWEVER, WE ARE BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE SOME ISSUES IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS AREAS RELATED TO COVID-19, PRIMARILY IN ACCESS TO SOME LOCATIONS AND DELAYS OF SUPPLIER DELIVERIES. WE HAVE UPDATED OUR 2020 SALES OUTLOOK, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, AND THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 IS UNCERTAIN.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DOD GUIDANCE ISSUED IN MARCH 2020 DESIGNATING THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE AS A CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE WORKFORCE, OUR U.S. PRODUCTION FACILITIES HAVE CONTINUED TO OPERATE IN SUPPORT OF ESSENTIAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES REQUIRED TO MEET NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITMENTS TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND THE U.S. MILITARY, HOWEVER, FACILITY CLOSURES OR WORK SLOWDOWNS OR TEMPORARY STOPPAGES COULD OCCUR. IN ADDITION, OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DIFFERENT PRACTICES AND POLICIES THAT CAN AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUR SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAD A BRIEF PAUSE IN OPERATIONS AT THE F-35 FINAL ASSEMBLY AND CHECK OUT (FACO) FACILITIES IN JAPAN AND ITALY IN MARCH IN OBSERVANCE OF SUCH COUNTRIES\u2019 COVID-19 POLICIES AND ADDITIONAL CLOSURES COULD OCCUR, AND WE ARE SEEING IMPACTS FROM BASE CLOSURES AND TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN MANY CASES FACILITIES ARE NOT OPERATING UNDER FULL STAFFING AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, WHICH COULD HAVE A LONGER-TERM IMPACT. FLIGHT TEST OPERATIONS AND TRAINING ARE BEING IMPACTED BY TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, WHICH COULD DELAY OUR DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO HAVE SOME LIMITED OPERATIONS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEREFORE HAVE BEEN MANDATED TO CLOSE OR OPERATE AT ONLY MINIMUM BASIC OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THESE CLOSURES TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 TO INCREASE PROGRESS PAYMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING CONTRACTS AND ACCELERATE CONTRACT AWARDS THROUGH INCREASED USE OF UNDEFINITIZED CONTRACTING ACTIONS (UCAS) TO PROVIDE CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY FOR COMPANIES IN THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL BASE, INCLUDING LARGE PRIME CONTRACTORS LIKE LOCKHEED MARTIN AND SMALLER SUPPLIERS. WE ARE IMPLEMENTING MULTIPLE ACTIONS TO HELP SUPPORT CERTAIN SUPPLIERS AFFECTED BY COVID-19, INCLUDING ACCELERATING PAYMENTS OF OVER $150 MILLION TO OUR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS, AND PAYING THE FIRST $50 MILLION OF AN ADDITIONAL $450 MILLION IN ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO OUR GLOBAL SUPPLY BASE AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE DOD IN CHANGING THE PROGRESS PAYMENT POLICY. AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, WE RELY ON OTHER COMPANIES TO PROVIDE MATERIALS, MAJOR COMPONENTS  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND PRODUCTS, AND TO PERFORM A PORTION OF THE SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED TO OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER THE TERMS OF MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTION CAUSED BY THE RESPONSE TO COVID-19 COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO PERFORM ON OUR CONTRACTS. TO DATE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS THAT HAVE POTENTIAL DELIVERY IMPACTS DUE TO COVID-19 AND, IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ALTERNATIVES OR OTHER MITIGATIONS, DELIVERIES AND OTHER MILESTONES ON AFFECTED PROGRAMS COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS AND COMMUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND CUSTOMERS, AND TO TAKE ACTIONS IN AN EFFORT TO MITIGATE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES.  2020 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS. THE PROJECTED GROWTH IN NET SALES FROM 2019 IS DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUME AT ALL FOUR BUSINESS AREAS. SPECIFICALLY, THE INCREASED GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY THE F-35 PROGRAM AT AERONAUTICS, INCREASED VOLUME IN THE TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILES AND AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE BUSINESSES AT MFC, SIKORSKY VOLUME AT RMS, AND HYPERSONICS VOLUME AT SPACE. TOTAL BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN IN 2020 IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 10.9%; AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT CASH FROM OPERATIONS TO BE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO $7.6 BILLION.  WE ARE SEEING SOME IMPACT FROM COVID-19 ON OUR EXPECTED 2020 SALES GROWTH. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON OUR 2020 OUTLOOK FOR SALES, SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS REMAINS UNCERTAIN. OUR 2020 OUTLOOK ASSUMES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND WE DO NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT WORK STOPPAGES OR CLOSURES, WE ARE ABLE TO MITIGATE ANY SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS AND THESE DO NOT WORSEN, AND WE ARE ABLE TO RECOVER OUR COSTS UNDER CONTRACTS AND GOVERNMENT FUNDING PRIORITIES DO NOT CHANGE. IN ADDITION, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ASSUMES ACTUAL RETURNS ON OUR PENSION ASSETS DURING 2020 WILL BE 7.0%, AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO RE-MEASURE OUR PENSION LIABILITIES AT YEAR-END 2020 WILL BE 3.25%.  DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THESE ASSUMED VALUES AND ACTUAL VALUES WILL AFFECT OUR PLAN\u2019S FUNDED STATUS AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS MEASURED AT YEAR-END 2020. WE ARE ALSO MONITORING THE IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, FUTURE CHANGES IN EXPECTATIONS FOR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL BELOW OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS COULD CAUSE THESE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED. WHILE THESE ARE OUR CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, THIS IS AN EMERGING SITUATION AND THESE COULD CHANGE, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR OUTLOOK. RISK RELATED TO THESE ITEMS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW AND UNDER ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.  OUR OUTLOOK FOR 2020 ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT IN THE ADVANCED MILITARY MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL CENTER LLC (AMMROC) JOINT VENTURE THAT COULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS THE SECOND QUARTER (SEE \u201cOTHER INCOME, NET\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR MORE DETAIL). OUR OUTLOOK ALSO ASSUMES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO SUPPORT AND FUND OUR KEY PROGRAMS AND DOES NOT INCLUDE POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM, RESULTING FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS RELATED TO TURKEY (SEE \u201cOTHER MATTERS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES MAY REQUIRE US TO REVISE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF 2020 NET SALES, OPERATING MARGIN AND CASH FLOWS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS A SUPPLEMENT TO AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  (  2019  FORM 10-K).  INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS  U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING  ON FEBRUARY 10, 2020, THE ADMINISTRATION SUBMITTED THE FISCAL YEAR (FY) 2021 PRESIDENT\u2019S BUDGET, REQUESTING $1.34 TRILLION IN TOTAL DISCRETIONARY FUNDING (A U.S. GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEAR STARTS ON OCTOBER 1 AND ENDS ON SEPTEMBER 30). THE FY 2021 BUDGET REQUESTS $672 BILLION FOR BASE DISCRETIONARY NATIONAL DEFENSE SPENDING, THE MAXIMUM PERMITTED UNDER THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2019 (BBA-19). THE TOTAL NATIONAL DEFENSE REQUEST IS $741 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDES $69 BILLION REQUESTED FOR OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO). OCO FUNDING DOES NOT COUNT TOWARD DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAPS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FY 2021 BUDGET REQUESTS $705 BILLION FOR THE DOD, INCLUDING $636 BILLION FOR THE BASE BUDGET AND $69 BILLION FOR OCO.  THE DOD REQUEST IS ONLY $800 MILLION ABOVE THE FY 2020 ENACTED LEVEL FOR BOTH BASE NATIONAL DEFENSE SPENDING AND OCO.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF, AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT (THE CARES ACT), THE BIPARTISAN $2 TRILLION ECONOMIC RELIEF PACKAGE AIMED AT HELPING AMERICAN WORKERS AND BUSINESSES IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC. THE BILL INCLUDES $10.4 BILLION FOR DOD TO FUND DEFENSE HEALTH PROGRAMS, NATIONAL GUARD AND HOSPITAL SHIP DEPLOYMENTS, AND THE DEFENSE PROCUREMENT ACT FUND. THE FUNDING IS IDENTIFIED AS EMERGENCY AND IS EXEMPT FROM THE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS OF THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT OF 2011 (BCA).  SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT FUNDING RISKS WITHIN \u201cITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10\u2010K.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR OPERATING CYCLE IS PRIMARILY LONG-TERM AND INVOLVES MANY TYPES OF CONTRACTS FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES WITH VARYING DELIVERY SCHEDULES. CONSEQUENTLY, THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF A PARTICULAR PERIOD, OR PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF SALES AND PROFITS, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

UNDER THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD, WE RECORD NET SALES ON CONTRACTS OVER TIME BASED UPON OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT, AS WELL AS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE PROFIT TO BE EARNED AT COMPLETION. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES SHOULD BE READ IN TANDEM WITH THE SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION OF CHANGES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES AND OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE CHANGES IN OUR SALES ARE TYPICALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OUR COST OF SALES DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD.  PRODUCT SALES  PRODUCT SALES  INCREASED  $1.2 BILLION  , OR  10%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT SALES OF APPROXIMATELY  $660 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS,  $360 MILLION  AT MFC AND  $250 MILLION  AT SPACE. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT AERONAUTICS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUME FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM AND HIGHER VOLUME ON CLASSIFIED CONTRACTS. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HIGH-MOBILITY ARTILLERY ROCKET SYSTEM (HIMARS), GUIDED MULTIPLE LAUNCH ROCKET SYSTEM (GMLRS) AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND INCREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY TERMINAL HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE (THAAD) AND PATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY-3 (PAC-3)). THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT SALES AT SPACE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY NEXT GENERATION OVERHEAD PERSISTENT INFRARED (NEXT GEN OPIR)).  SERVICE SALES  SERVICE SALES  INCREASED  $119 MILLION  , OR  5%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES OF ABOUT  $125 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS AND  $55 MILLION  AT RMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF ABOUT  $90 MILLION  AT MFC. HIGHER SERVICE SALES AT AERONAUTICS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUSTAINMENT VOLUME FOR THE F-35, F-22 AND F-16 PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE SALES AT RMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED WARFARE SYSTEMS AND SENSORS (IWSS) PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY AEGIS COMBAT SYSTEM (AEGIS)) AND SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAM. THE DECREASE IN SERVICE SALES AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019; AND DECREASED VOLUME FOR SENSORS AND GLOBAL SUSTAINMENT PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY APACHE) AND INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY PAC-3).  COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES, FOR BOTH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CONSIST OF MATERIALS, LABOR, SUBCONTRACTING COSTS, AN ALLOCATION OF INDIRECT COSTS (OVERHEAD AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE), AS WELL AS THE COSTS TO FULFILL OUR INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS OFFSET AGREEMENTS, REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. FOR EACH OF OUR CONTRACTS, WE MONITOR THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF COSTS AT THE CONTRACT LEVEL, WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR ESTIMATING OUR TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT.

EXCEPT FOR IMPACTS OF COVID-19; POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM, RESULTING FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT ACTIONS RELATED TO TURKEY; AND PROJECTED FAS PENSION INCOME IN 2020 AS A RESULT OF COMPLETING THE PLANNED FREEZE OF OUR SALARIED PENSION PLANS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020, WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY ADDITIONAL DEVELOPING  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRENDS IN COST OF SALES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FUTURE OPERATIONS (SEE \u201cOTHER MATTERS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).  PRODUCT COSTS  PRODUCT COSTS  INCREASED  $1.1 BILLION  , OR  11%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $575 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS,  $360 MILLION  AT MFC AND  $265 MILLION  AT SPACE. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT AERONAUTICS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION VOLUME FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY THAAD AND PAC-3) AND INCREASED VOLUME FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HIMARS, GMLRS AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS). THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT COSTS AT SPACE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER VOLUME FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS) AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY NEXT GEN OPIR).  SERVICE COSTS  SERVICE COSTS  INCREASED  $166 MILLION  , OR  8%  , DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN SERVICE COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SERVICE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $125 MILLION  AT AERONAUTICS AND  $75 MILLION  AT RMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SERVICE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $65 MILLION  AT MFC. HIGHER SERVICE COSTS AT AERONAUTICS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SUSTAINMENT VOLUME FOR THE F-35, F-22 AND F-16 PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE IN SERVICE COSTS AT RMS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS AND IWSS PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY AEGIS). THE DECREASE IN SERVICE COSTS AT MFC WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019 AND DECREASED VOLUME FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO DECREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY PAC-3).  OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET  OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES THE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT (WHICH REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CAS) PENSION COST RECORDED IN OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE)), STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OTHER CORPORATE COSTS. THESE ITEMS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND, THEREFORE, ARE EXCLUDED FROM COST OF SALES FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET REDUCED COST OF SALES BY  $395 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO  $524 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . OTHER UNALLOCATED, NET DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET DECLINES THAT REDUCED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT ASSETS, AND A DECREASE IN OUR FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT (SEE \u201cBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d DISCUSSION BELOW FOR MORE DETAIL).  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES. DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , OTHER INCOME, NET WAS  $31 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $95 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . OTHER INCOME, NET DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCLUDED LOWER EARNINGS GENERATED BY EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES. OTHER INCOME, NET DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCLUDED A PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED NON-CASH GAIN OF $51 MILLION ($38 MILLION, OR $0.13 PER SHARE, AFTER TAX) RELATED TO PROPERTIES SOLD IN 2015 AS A RESULT OF COMPLETING OUR REMAINING OBLIGATIONS.  AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, WE HAD AN INVESTMENT IN THE ADVANCED MILITARY MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL CENTER LLC (AMMROC) JOINT VENTURE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF $435 MILLION. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN AMMROC USING THE EQUITY METHOD. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF AMMROC\u2019S CURRENT BUSINESS IS DEPENDENT ON A SINGLE CUSTOMER CONTRACT TO PROVIDE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL (MRO) SERVICES FOR FIXED AND ROTARY WING MILITARY AIRCRAFT THAT WAS UP FOR RE-COMPETITION. IN APRIL 2020, SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF OUR FIRST QUARTER, THE CUSTOMER ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO AWARD THE CONTRACT TO A COMPETITOR. HOWEVER, THE CUSTOMER HAS NOT YET EXECUTED THE NEW CONTRACT NOR DEFINED WHEN OR HOW THE MRO SERVICES WILL TRANSITION TO THE COMPETITOR. WE ARE WORKING WITH AMMROC\u2019S MANAGEMENT AND OUR JOINT VENTURE PARTNER TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER THERE IS A BASIS TO CHALLENGE THE AWARD AND RETAIN THE MRO SERVICES, EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF AMMROC CONTINUING TO PROVIDE MRO SERVICES AS A SUBCONTRACTOR TO THE COMPETITOR, AN OPPORTUNITY TO REPLACE THE CONTRACT WITH OTHER CUSTOMER ARRANGEMENTS, OR WINDING DOWN THE BUSINESS. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, IF ANY, RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT UNTIL WE FULLY EVALUATE THE OPTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PLAN TO TRANSITION THE MRO SERVICES TO THE COMPETITOR, WHAT MAY OCCUR WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF AMMROC\u2019S BUSINESS, THE POTENTIAL LIQUIDATION OF AMMROC\u2019S ASSETS AND A FINAL  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DISTRIBUTION TO THE OWNERS, AND OUR RIGHTS UNDER JURISDICTIONAL LAW AND THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. HOWEVER, IF THE CUSTOMER MOVES FORWARD WITH TRANSITIONING THE MRO SERVICES TO THE COMPETITOR AND AMMROC IS NOT A SUBCONTRACTOR (OR HAS ONLY A LIMITED ROLE), WE EXPECT THERE WOULD BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO AMMROC\u2019S BUSINESS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT, WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND AN IMPAIRMENT COULD OCCUR AS EARLY AS THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. OTHER THAN THE IMPACT TO EARNINGS FOR A POTENTIAL NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE, CURRENTLY WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY OTHER SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO OUR 2020 OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET PRIMARILY INCLUDES THE NON-SERVICE COST COMPONENTS OF FAS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN INCOME (EXPENSE) (I.E., INTEREST COST, EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, NET ACTUARIAL GAINS OR LOSSES, AND AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR SERVICE COST OR CREDITS). DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME, NET WAS  $56 MILLION  COMPARED TO OTHER NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET OF  $167 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN NON-SERVICE FAS PENSION EXPENSE FOR OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS  15.4%  FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , AND  12.4%  FOR THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE RATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  BENEFITED FROM ADDITIONAL TAX DEDUCTIONS OF $65 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER SHARE, RECORDED DISCRETELY FOR 2018, BASED ON PROPOSED TAX REGULATIONS RELEASED ON MARCH 4, 2019, WHICH CLARIFIED THAT FOREIGN MILITARY SALES QUALIFY FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME TREATMENT.  THE RATES FOR BOTH PERIODS BENEFITED FROM TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS, THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT, TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME, AND DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE CORPORATION'S DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WITH AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN FEATURE.  CHANGES IN U.S. FEDERAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS, OR THEIR INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION, INCLUDING THOSE WITH RETROACTIVE EFFECT, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION FOR RESEARCH OR EXPERIMENTAL EXPENDITURES, COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE, OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES, AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE AMOUNT OF NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL CHANGE PERIODICALLY BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN OBLIGATIONS, ACTUAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, AND FUTURE CHANGES IN TAX LAWS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REGULARLY UNDER AUDIT OR EXAMINATION BY TAX AUTHORITIES, INCLUDING FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD SIMILARLY RESULT IN UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR TAX EXPENSE AND AFFECT PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW THE CARES ACT, WHICH, ALONG WITH EARLIER ISSUED IRS GUIDANCE, PROVIDES FOR DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN TAXES. THE CARES ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALSO CONTAINS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH MAY BENEFIT LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE CARES ACT AND ONGOING GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE RELATED TO COVID-19 THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  NET EARNINGS  WE REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF  $1.7 BILLION  (  $6.08  PER SHARE) DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1.7 BILLION  (  $5.99  PER SHARE) DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . BOTH NET EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE AFFECTED BY THE FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE. EARNINGS PER SHARE ALSO BENEFITED FROM A NET DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 2.0 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING FROM  MARCH 31, 2019  TO  MARCH 29, 2020  AS A RESULT OF SHARE REPURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SHARE ISSUANCE UNDER OUR STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS.  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  WE OPERATE IN  FOUR  BUSINESS SEGMENTS: AERONAUTICS,  MFC, RMS  AND SPACE. WE ORGANIZE OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED ON THE NATURE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED.  NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS EXCLUDE INTERSEGMENT SALES, COST OF SALES, AND PROFIT AS THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT INCLUDES OUR SHARE OF EARNINGS OR LOSSES FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES AS THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF THE EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT ALSO EXCLUDES THE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT DESCRIBED BELOW, A PORTION OF CORPORATE COSTS NOT CONSIDERED ALLOWABLE OR ALLOCABLE TO CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT UNDER THE APPLICABLE U.S. GOVERNMENT COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (CAS) OR FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS (FAR), AND OTHER ITEMS NOT CONSIDERED PART OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S EVALUATION OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE SUCH AS A PORTION OF MANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS, LEGAL FEES AND SETTLEMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RETIREE BENEFITS, SIGNIFICANT SEVERANCE ACTIONS, SIGNIFICANT ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SIGNIFICANT DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE ACTIVITIES.  EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN THE RECONCILING ITEM \u201cUNALLOCATED ITEMS\u201d BETWEEN OPERATING PROFIT FROM OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT. SEE \u201c  NOTE 10 \u2013 OTHER  \u201d INCLUDED IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR A DISCUSSION RELATED TO CERTAIN FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  AERONAUTICS  $6,369  $5,584  MISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL  2,619  2,350  ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS  3,746  3,762  SPACE  2,917  2,640  TOTAL NET SALES  $15,651  $14,336  OPERATING PROFIT  AERONAUTICS  $672  $585  MISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL  396  417  ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS  376  379  SPACE  281  334  TOTAL BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT  1,725  1,715  UNALLOCATED ITEMS  FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT  (A)  469  512  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  (42  )  (37  )  OTHER, NET  (30  )  93  TOTAL UNALLOCATED ITEMS  397  568  TOTAL CONSOLIDATED OPERATING PROFIT  $2,122  $2,283  (A)  THE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) AND TOTAL PENSION COSTS RECOVERABLE ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH CAS.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR TOTAL NET FAS/CAS PENSION ADJUSTMENT FOR THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  , INCLUDING THE SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE COST COMPONENTS OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) FOR OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  TOTAL FAS INCOME (EXPENSE) AND CAS COSTS  FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE)  $30  $(273  )  LESS: CAS PENSION COST  494  641  NET FAS/CAS PENSION ADJUSTMENT  $524  $368  SERVICE AND NON-SERVICE COST RECONCILIATION  FAS PENSION SERVICE COST  $(25  )  $(129  )  LESS: CAS PENSION COST  494  641  FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT  469  512  NON-OPERATING FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE)  55  (144  )  NET FAS/CAS PENSION ADJUSTMENT  $524  $368  WE RECOVER CAS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN COST THROUGH THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND, THEREFORE, RECOGNIZE CAS COST IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT\u2019S NET SALES AND COST OF SALES. OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST PRESENT FAS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS REQUIREMENTS UNDER U.S. GAAP. THE OPERATING PORTION OF THE NET FAS/CAS PENSION ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) AND TOTAL CAS PENSION COST. THE NON-SERVICE FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE) COMPONENT IS INCLUDED IN OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS. AS A RESULT, TO THE EXTENT THAT CAS PENSION COST EXCEEDS THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT OF FAS PENSION INCOME (EXPENSE), WE HAVE A FAVORABLE FAS/CAS OPERATING ADJUSTMENT.  MANAGEMENT EVALUATES PERFORMANCE ON OUR CONTRACTS BY FOCUSING ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT AND NOT BY TYPE OR AMOUNT OF OPERATING EXPENSE. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR DISCUSSION OF BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE FOCUSES ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, CONSISTENT WITH OUR APPROACH FOR MANAGING THE BUSINESS. THIS APPROACH IS CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT THE LIFE CYCLE OF OUR CONTRACTS, AS MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE BIDDING OF EACH CONTRACT BY FOCUSING ON NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT AND MONITORS PERFORMANCE ON OUR CONTRACTS IN A SIMILAR MANNER THROUGH THEIR COMPLETION.  WE REGULARLY PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH REPORTS OF OUR COSTS AS THE CONTRACT PROGRESSES. THE COST INFORMATION IN THE REPORTS IS ACCUMULATED IN A MANNER SPECIFIED BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF EACH CONTRACT. FOR EXAMPLE, COST DATA PROVIDED TO A CUSTOMER FOR A PRODUCT WOULD TYPICALLY ALIGN TO THE SUBCOMPONENTS OF THAT PRODUCT (SUCH AS A WING-BOX ON AN AIRCRAFT) AND FOR SERVICES WOULD ALIGN TO THE TYPE OF WORK BEING PERFORMED (SUCH AS AIRCRAFT SUSTAINMENT). OUR CONTRACTS GENERALLY ALLOW FOR THE RECOVERY OF COSTS IN THE PRICING OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE BID AND NEGOTIATED WITH OUR CUSTOMERS UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH WE ARE REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE OUR ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO PROVIDE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. THIS APPROACH FOR NEGOTIATING CONTRACTS WITH OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS GENERALLY ALLOWS FOR RECOVERY OF OUR ACTUAL COSTS PLUS A REASONABLE PROFIT MARGIN. WE ALSO MAY ENTER INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS FOR CERTAIN MATERIALS OR COMPONENTS TO COINCIDE WITH THE PRODUCTION SCHEDULE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND TO ENSURE THEIR AVAILABILITY AT KNOWN UNIT PRICES.  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS SPAN SEVERAL YEARS AND INCLUDE HIGHLY COMPLEX TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. AT THE OUTSET OF A CONTRACT, WE IDENTIFY AND MONITOR RISKS TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF THE CONTRACT AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF THOSE RISKS ON OUR ESTIMATES OF TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. THE ESTIMATES CONSIDER THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS (E.G., A NEWLY-DEVELOPED PRODUCT VERSUS A MATURE PRODUCT), THE SCHEDULE AND ASSOCIATED TASKS (E.G., THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF MILESTONE EVENTS) AND COSTS (E.G., MATERIAL, LABOR, SUBCONTRACTOR, OVERHEAD AND THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FULFILL OUR INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AGREEMENTS, SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS OFFSET AGREEMENTS, REQUIRED UNDER CERTAIN CONTRACTS WITH INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS). THE INITIAL PROFIT BOOKING RATE OF EACH CONTRACT CONSIDERS RISKS SURROUNDING THE ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS, SCHEDULE AND COSTS IN THE INITIAL ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. PROFIT BOOKING RATES MAY INCREASE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT IF WE SUCCESSFULLY RETIRE RISKS SURROUNDING THE TECHNICAL, SCHEDULE AND COST ASPECTS OF THE CONTRACT, WHICH DECREASES THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, OUR PROFIT BOOKING RATES MAY DECREASE IF THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO COMPLETE THE  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACT INCREASE. ALL OF THE ESTIMATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT AND MAY AFFECT THE PROFIT BOOKING RATE.  WE HAVE A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CLASSIFIED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WHICH CANNOT BE SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBED. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE CLASSIFIED PROGRAMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED AND BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS AND ARE SUBJECTED TO THE SAME OVERSIGHT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS AS OUR OTHER PROGRAMS.  OUR NET SALES ARE PRIMARILY DERIVED FROM LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS WELL AS FMS CONTRACTED THROUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED AND THE CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS WITH CONTINUOUS TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE EXTENT OF PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, GENERALLY USING THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST MEASURE OF PROGRESS FOR OUR CONTRACTS BECAUSE IT BEST DEPICTS THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER AS WE INCUR COSTS ON OUR CONTRACTS. FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN WHICH CONTROL DOES NOT CONTINUOUSLY TRANSFER TO THE CUSTOMER, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE AT THE POINT IN TIME IN WHICH EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULLY SATISFIED.  CHANGES IN NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT GENERALLY ARE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF VOLUME. CHANGES IN VOLUME REFER TO INCREASES OR DECREASES IN SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT RESULTING FROM VARYING PRODUCTION ACTIVITY LEVELS, DELIVERIES OR SERVICE LEVELS ON INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS. VOLUME CHANGES IN SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON THE CURRENT PROFIT BOOKING RATE FOR A PARTICULAR CONTRACT.  IN ADDITION, COMPARABILITY OF OUR SEGMENT SALES, OPERATING PROFIT AND OPERATING MARGIN MAY BE IMPACTED FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY BY CHANGES IN PROFIT BOOKING RATES ON OUR CONTRACTS FOR WHICH WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER TIME USING THE PERCENTAGE-OF-COMPLETION COST-TO-COST METHOD TO MEASURE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION. INCREASES IN THE PROFIT BOOKING RATES, TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AS RISK RETIREMENTS, USUALLY RELATE TO REVISIONS IN THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO FULFILL THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT REFLECT IMPROVED CONDITIONS ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT. CONVERSELY, CONDITIONS ON A PARTICULAR CONTRACT MAY DETERIORATE, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATED TOTAL COSTS TO FULFILL THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS AND A REDUCTION IN THE PROFIT BOOKING RATE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN PROFIT BOOKING RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AND REFLECT THE INCEPTION-TO-DATE EFFECT OF SUCH CHANGES. SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT AND MARGIN MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY BY OTHER ITEMS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT IMPACT SALES. FAVORABLE ITEMS MAY INCLUDE THE POSITIVE RESOLUTION OF CONTRACTUAL MATTERS, COST RECOVERIES ON SEVERANCE AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND GAINS ON SALES OF ASSETS. UNFAVORABLE ITEMS MAY INCLUDE THE ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF CONTRACTUAL MATTERS; RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, EXCEPT FOR SIGNIFICANT SEVERANCE ACTIONS, WHICH ARE EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS; RESERVES FOR DISPUTES; CERTAIN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS; AND LOSSES ON SALES OF CERTAIN ASSETS.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PROGRAM TO DESIGN, DEVELOP AND CONSTRUCT A GROUND-BASED RADAR AT OUR ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS (RMS) BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE PROGRAM HAS EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES FOR WHICH WE HAVE PERIODICALLY ACCRUED RESERVES. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , CUMULATIVE LOSSES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $225 MILLION  ON THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES RELATED TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS CONTRACT AND HAVE TO RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE LOSSES PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AND OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE SALES AND COSTS TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE HAVE A PROGRAM, EADGE-T, TO DESIGN, INTEGRATE, AND INSTALL AN AIR MISSILE DEFENSE COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS - INTELLIGENCE (C4I) SYSTEM FOR AN INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMER THAT HAS EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES AND FOR WHICH WE HAVE PERIODICALLY ACCRUED RESERVES AT OUR RMS BUSINESS SEGMENT. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY $260 MILLION. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE. AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ADDITIONAL CHARGES THAT WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE HAVE TWO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS AT OUR SPACE BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR WHICH WE HAVE EXPERIENCED PERFORMANCE ISSUES RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION OF A MODERNIZED LM 2100 SATELLITE PLATFORM. THESE PROGRAMS ARE FOR THE DELIVERY OF THREE SATELLITES IN TOTAL, INCLUDING TWO THAT LAUNCHED IN 2019 AND ONE THAT LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY 2020. WE HAVE PERIODICALLY REVISED OUR ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THESE DEVELOPMENTAL COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY  $410 MILLION  FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 FORM 10-K, WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING, DEVELOPING AND INSTALLING AN UPGRADED TURRET FOR THE WARRIOR CAPABILITY SUSTAINMENT PROGRAM. IN 2018, WE REVISED OUR ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROGRAM AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PERFORMANCE ISSUES, AND RECORDED CHARGES AT OUR MFC BUSINESS SEGMENT. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, CUMULATIVE LOSSES REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY $140 MILLION ON THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE ISSUES RELATED TO CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS AND OUR PERFORMANCE UNDER THIS CONTRACT AND MAY HAVE TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE LOSSES ALREADY RECORDED AND OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE SALES AND COSTS TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, AT THIS TIME WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT ADDITIONAL LOSSES, IF ANY, WOULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHER MATTERS, INCREASED SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT BY APPROXIMATELY  $465 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  $565 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  AERONAUTICS  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR AERONAUTICS BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  $6,369  $5,584  OPERATING PROFIT  672  585  OPERATING MARGIN  10.6%  10.5%  AERONAUTICS\u2019 NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCREASED  $785 MILLION  , OR  14%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO  HIGHER NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $695 MILLION FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME ON PRODUCTION, SUSTAINMENT, AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS; AND ABOUT $70 MILLION FOR HIGHER VOLUME ON CLASSIFIED DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS.  AERONAUTICS\u2019 OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCREASED  $87 MILLION  , OR  15%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $80 MILLION FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME ON PRODUCTION, SUSTAINMENT, AND DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS. ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS,  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WERE COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT AERONAUTICS\u2019 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUME ON THE F-35 PROGRAM. OPERATING PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-TO-HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS. OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2019 LEVELS.  MISSILES AND FIRE CONTROL  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR MFC BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  $2,619  $2,350  OPERATING PROFIT  396  417  OPERATING MARGIN  15.1%  17.7%  MFC\u2019S NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCREASED  $269 MILLION  , OR  11%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION FOR TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILE PROGRAMS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY HIMARS, GMLRS AND HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS); AND ABOUT $125 MILLION FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME (PRIMARILY THAAD AND PAC-3). THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $40 MILLION AS A RESULT OF LOWER VOLUME ON ENERGY PROGRAMS AND THE DIVESTITURE OF THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IN NOVEMBER 2019.  MFC\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  DECREASED  $21 MILLION  , OR  5%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION FOR INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS ON INTERNATIONAL CONTRACTS (PRIMARILY PAC-3 AND THAAD). THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $20 MILLION FOR SENSORS AND GLOBAL SUSTAINMENT PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER RISK RETIREMENTS  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (PRIMARILY LOW ALTITUDE NAVIGATION AND TARGETING INFRARED FOR NIGHT (LANTIRN\u00ae) AND SNIPER ADVANCED TARGETING POD (SNIPER\u00ae)). ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $30 MILLION LOWER  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  WE CURRENTLY  EXPECT MFC\u2019S 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT TO LOW-DOUBLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE IN 2020 AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUME IN THE TACTICAL AND STRIKE MISSILES AND AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES AS A RESULT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS. OPERATING PROFIT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-TO-HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE IN 2020 AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME. OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN 2019 LEVELS.  ROTARY AND MISSION SYSTEMS  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR RMS BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  $3,746  $3,762  OPERATING PROFIT  376  379  OPERATING MARGIN  10.0%  10.1%  RMS\u2019 NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WERE COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER VOLUME (PRIMARILY COMBAT RESCUE HELICOPTER AND BLACK HAWK PRODUCTION PROGRAMS). THIS DECREASE WAS MOSTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF ABOUT $85 MILLION FOR C6ISR (COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, CYBER, COMBAT SYSTEMS, INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE) PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY UNDERSEA COMBAT SYSTEMS PROGRAMS).  RMS\u2019 OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION FOR SIKORSKY HELICOPTER PROGRAMS DUE TO BETTER COST PERFORMANCE AND HIGHER RISK RETIREMENTS ON INTERNATIONAL MILITARY AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY A $20 MILLION DECREASE FOR IWSS PROGRAMS AS LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHARGES THAT WERE $30 MILLION LOWER ON A GROUND-BASED RADAR PROGRAM. ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $35 MILLION LOWER DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD DURING  2019.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT RMS\u2019 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SIKORSKY. OPERATING PROFIT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT RANGE ABOVE 2019 LEVELS DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME. OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN FOR 2020 IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 2019 LEVELS.  SPACE  SUMMARY OPERATING RESULTS FOR OUR SPACE BUSINESS SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  NET SALES  $2,917  $2,640  OPERATING PROFIT  281  334  OPERATING MARGIN  9.6%  12.7%  SPACE\u2019S NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  INCREASED  $277 MILLION  , OR  10%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION FOR STRATEGIC AND MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY HYPERSONIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND FLEET BALLISTIC MISSILE PROGRAMS); AND ABOUT $100 MILLION FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME (PRIMARILY NEXT GEN OPIR).  SP  ACE\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  DECREASED  $53 MILLION  , OR  16%  , COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION FOR GOVERNMENT SATELLITE PROGRAMS DUE TO LOWER RISK RETIREMENTS (PRIMARILY ADVANCED EXTREMELY HIGH FREQUENCY (AEHF)); AND ABOUT $35 MILLION DUE TO LOWER EQUITY EARNINGS FROM THE CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT IN UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE (ULA). THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCREASE OF $20 MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS FOR CHARGES RECORDED FOR PERFORMANCE MATTERS IN 2019 NOT REPEATED IN 2020. ADJUSTMENTS NOT RELATED TO VOLUME, INCLUDING NET PROFIT BOOKING RATE ADJUSTMENTS, WERE $40 MILLION LOWER  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  TOTAL EQUITY EARNINGS RECOGNIZED BY SPACE (PRIMARILY ULA) REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  $30 MILLION  , OR  11%  OF SPACE\u2019S OPERATING PROFIT DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $65 MILLION  , OR  19%  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT SPACE\u2019S 2020 NET SALES TO INCREASE IN THE MID-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE FROM 2019 LEVELS LARGELY DRIVEN BY HYPERSONICS AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITES (NEXT GEN OPIR). OPERATING PROFIT IN 2020 IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGIT PERCENTAGE RANGE AS COMPARED TO 2019 DRIVEN BY LOWER PROFIT RATE ADJUSTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT SATELLITES AND LOWER EQUITY EARNINGS IN 2020 COMPARED TO 2019. AS A RESULT, OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN IN 2020 IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE FROM 2019 LEVELS.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS  TO DATE, COVID-19 HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE CONTINUED SPREAD OF COVID-19 HAS LED TO DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS, WHICH, DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, COULD IMPACT OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY IN THE FUTURE. FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE USED COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKED BY OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO MANAGE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS. THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WAS TEMPORARILY DISRUPTED IN MARCH 2020 AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, AND WHILE THESE MARKETS ARE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN A NORMAL MANNER, DEPENDING ON FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND VOLATILITY, COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL, OR IN THE CAPACITY DESIRED. AS OF MARCH 29, 2020, WE HAD A CASH BALANCE OF  $2.0 BILLION  AND NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR BORROWINGS IN THE EVENT OF A LACK OF SHORT-TERM COMMERCIAL PAPER AVAILABILITY. COVID-19 HAS ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTED THE EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND OUR RETURNS ON OUR PENSION ASSETS. AS DESCRIBED IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, CHANGES IN RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS MAY AFFECT OUR PLAN FUNDING, CASH FLOWS AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL PLAN ASSET RETURN AND THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS (7.00% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019) IMPACT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR\u2019S FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (FAS) PENSION EXPENSE AND PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  ON MARCH 27, 2020, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW THE CARES ACT, WHICH, ALONG WITH EARLIER ISSUED IRS GUIDANCE, PROVIDES FOR DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN TAXES. THE CARES ACT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALSO CONTAINS NUMEROUS OTHER PROVISIONS WHICH MAY BENEFIT LOCKHEED MARTIN. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE CARES ACT AND ONGOING GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE RELATED TO COVID-19 THAT MAY BE ISSUED.  WE HAVE A BALANCED CASH DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY TO ENHANCE STOCKHOLDER VALUE AND POSITION OURSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHEN THEY ARISE. CONSISTENT WITH THAT STRATEGY, WE HAVE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND SELECTIVE BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS; RETURNED CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES; AND ACTIVELY MANAGED OUR DEBT LEVELS AND MATURITIES, INTEREST RATES, AND PENSION OBLIGATIONS.  WE HAVE GENERATED STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WHICH HAVE BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT SERVICE AND REPAYMENTS, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS. THE TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS  $2.0 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020.  CURRENTLY, WE EXPECT OUR CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS, IF NEEDED, FOR LIQUIDITY OR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND LETTERS OF CREDIT TO SUPPORT CUSTOMER ADVANCE PAYMENTS AND FOR OTHER TRADE FINANCE PURPOSES SUCH AS GUARANTEEING OUR PERFORMANCE ON PARTICULAR CONTRACTS. SEE OUR \u201cCAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d SECTION BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION ON FINANCIAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO US.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOW INFORMATION FOLLOWED BY A DISCUSSION OF THE KEY ELEMENTS (IN MILLIONS).  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29,  2020  MARCH 31,  2019  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT BEGINNING OF YEAR  $1,514  $772  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET EARNINGS  1,717  1,704  NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS  343  263  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL  475  (653  )  OTHER, NET  (221  )  349  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  2,314  1,663  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (295  )  (257  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,545  )  (1,187  )  NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  474  219  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  $1,988  $991  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $651 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IN CASH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH RELATED TO OTHER OPERATING ASSETS DUE TO MARKET DECLINES THAT REDUCED THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENT ASSETS. THE  $1.1 BILLION  IMPROVEMENT IN CASH FLOWS RELATED TO WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS RECEIVABLES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND INVENTORIES LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES) WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TIMING OF CASH PAYMENTS FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE (PRIMARILY AERONAUTICS).  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  WAS COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED  $293 MILLION  AND  $284 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE FOR EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES INFRASTRUCTURE THAT GENERALLY ARE INCURRED TO SUPPORT NEW AND EXISTING PROGRAMS ACROSS ALL OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS. WE ALSO INCUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND GENERAL ENTERPRISE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUSIVE OF COSTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OR PURCHASE OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.5 BILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1.2 BILLION  DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019  . NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WE ALSO MADE NET REPAYMENTS OF $200 MILLION FOR COMMERCIAL PAPER.  DURING THE  QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE PAID DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $693 MILLION  (  $2.40  PER SHARE) AND  $638 MILLION  (  $2.20  PER SHARE). IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED  1.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  FOR  $756 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDES $500 MILLION PAID PURSUANT TO AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT (ASR); COMPARED TO  1.0 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $284 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF SHARES DELIVERED UNDER THE ASR IS BASED ON AN AVERAGE VOLUME-WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE (VWAP) OVER THE PLAN PERIOD AND, BASED ON THE AVERAGE VWAP AS OF APRIL 20, 2020, WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 0.5 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES UPON FINAL SETTLEMENT.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.0 BILLION  THAT WAS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO FUND ORDINARY BUSINESS OPERATIONS WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE ALSO HAD A $2.5 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE CREDIT FACILITY) WITH VARIOUS BANKS THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF AUGUST 24, 2024. THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO SERVES AS A BACKUP FACILITY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY POINT IN TIME UNDER THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE CREDIT FACILITY CANNOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY. WE MAY REQUEST AND THE BANKS MAY GRANT, AT THEIR DISCRETION, AN INCREASE IN THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT  MARCH 29, 2020.  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER CAN FLUCTUATE DAILY AND THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD MAY BE GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN THE AMOUNT REPORTED AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. THERE WERE NO COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . WE MAY, AS CONDITIONS WARRANT, CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER BACKED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO MANAGE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER, AS DESCRIBED UNDER ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, UNDER CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, COMMERCIAL PAPER MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT, NET OF UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND ISSUANCE COSTS, WAS  $12.7 BILLION  AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  AND MAINLY IS IN THE FORM OF PUBLICLY-ISSUED NOTES THAT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  WE HAD  $1.3 BILLION  OF BORROWINGS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN NOVEMBER 2020 WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR DEBT DUE FROM 2021 TO 2052. AS OF  MARCH 29, 2020  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  TO OUR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AS PRESENTED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR  2019  FORM 10\u2010K THAT WERE OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.  ON OCCASION, OUR CUSTOMERS MAY SEEK DEFERRED PAYMENT TERMS TO PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TRANSACTIONS, WE MAY, AT OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S REQUEST, ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE NON-RECOURSE SALE OF CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES TO UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED AND ARE TREATED AS A SALE OF RECEIVABLES AS WE HAVE NO CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT. THE SALE PROCEEDS FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. WE SOLD CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES OF  $146 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 29, 2020  AND  $104 MILLION  DURING THE  QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THERE WERE NO GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES.  OUR TOTAL EQUITY WAS  $3.5 BILLION  AT  MARCH 29, 2020  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $316 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET EARNINGS OF  $1.7 BILLION  AND AMORTIZATION OF  $110 MILLION  IN PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS DECLARED OF  $677 MILLION  AND THE REPURCHASE OF  1.7 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $764 MILLION  , SOME OF WHICH WERE SETTLED SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.  OTHER MATTERS  STATUS OF THE F-35 PROGRAM  THE F-35 PROGRAM PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF PRODUCTION CONTRACTS, SUSTAINMENT ACTIVITIES, AND NEW DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. PRODUCTION OF THE AIRCRAFT IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE FOR MANY YEARS GIVEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT\u2019S CURRENT INVENTORY OBJECTIVE OF 2,456 AIRCRAFT FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE, U.S. MARINE CORPS, AND U.S. NAVY; COMMITMENTS FROM OUR SEVEN INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES AND FIVE INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS; AS WELL AS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST FROM OTHER COUNTRIES.  DURING 2019, THE F-35 PROGRAM COMPLETED SEVERAL MILESTONES BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TESTING THE AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING SHIP TRIALS, MISSION AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS EVALUATIONS, AND THE F-35 FLEET RECENTLY SURPASSED 250,000 FLIGHT HOURS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, POLAND SIGNED A LETTER OF AGREEMENT AND ACCEPTANCE FOR 32 F-35S. SINCE PROGRAM INCEPTION, WE HAVE DELIVERED 513 PRODUCTION F-35 AIRCRAFT, DEMONSTRATING THE F-35 PROGRAM\u2019S CONTINUED PROGRESS AND LONGEVITY. THE FIRST 513 F-35 AIRCRAFT DELIVERED TO U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS INCLUDE 364 F-35A VARIANTS, 111 F-35B VARIANTS, AND 38 F-35C VARIANTS. THE FULL-RATE PRODUCTION DECISION, ALSO KNOWN FORMALLY AS MILESTONE C, IS EXPECTED TO BE DELAYED BY THE DOD UNTIL INITIAL OPERATIONAL TEST AND EVALUATION (IOT&E) ACTIVITIES ARE COMPLETE IN THE NAVAL AIR SYSTEMS COMMAND (NAVAIR)-LED JOINT SIMULATION ENVIRONMENT (JSE). THE JSE IS USED TO CONDUCT SIMULATED EVALUATIONS OF THE F-35 IN A RANGE OF HIGH-THREAT SCENARIOS. TESTING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2020. THE DATA WILL BE UTILIZED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AS PART OF THEIR EVALUATION TO TRANSITION THE F-35 PROGRAM FROM LOW RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION (LRIP) INTO FULL-RATE PRODUCTION.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE DELIVERED 22 PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TO OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES, AND WE HAVE 352 PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT IN BACKLOG, INCLUDING ORDERS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES. WE ARE  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MONITORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON OUR PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE F-35 PROGRAM. DEPENDING ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL. SEE THE DISCUSSION IN BUSINESS OVERVIEW - COVID-19 AND ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS.  ON JULY 17, 2019, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED TURKEY\u2019S PARTICIPATION IN THE F-35 PROGRAM AND INITIATED THE PROCESS TO FORMALLY REMOVE TURKEY FROM THE PROGRAM AS A RESULT OF TURKEY ACCEPTING DELIVERY OF THE RUSSIAN S-400 AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM. TO DATE, THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT IMPOSED SANCTIONS ON TURKISH ENTITIES INVOLVED IN THE S-400 PROCUREMENT, ALTHOUGH SANCTIONS UNDER THE COUNTERING AMERICA\u2019S ADVERSARIES THROUGH SANCTIONS ACT (CAATSA) REMAIN A RISK.  ADDITIONALLY, SANCTIONS COULD BE IMPOSED AGAINST TURKEY AS A RESULT OF FUTURE LEGISLATION, INCLUDING THE \u201cPROMOTING AMERICAN NATIONAL SECURITY AND PREVENTING THE RESURGENCE OF ISIS ACT OF 2019\u201d THAT WAS PASSED OUT OF THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE ON DECEMBER 11, 2019.  THE BILL INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT NEW SANCTION PROVISIONS TARGETED AT TURKEY THAT, IF ENACTED, WOULD DIRECTLY AFFECT LOCKHEED MARTIN PROGRAMS IN TURKEY. TURKEY COULD IMPLEMENT RETALIATORY SANCTIONS IF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IN CONGRESS IN 2020. WE ARE MONITORING THESE DEVELOPMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ANY SANCTIONS AND OTHER ACTIONS REGARDING TURKEY ON THE F-35 PROGRAM AND ON OUR OTHER PROGRAMS INVOLVING TURKEY. DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY OF ANY SANCTIONS OR OTHER ACTIONS, THE IMPACT COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS, OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS. TURKEY PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED TO PURCHASE UP TO 100 F-35 AIRCRAFT, OF WHICH SIX HAVE COMPLETED PRODUCTION.  TURKISH SUPPLIERS ALSO PRODUCE COMPONENT PARTS FOR THE F-35 PROGRAM, MANY OF WHICH ARE SINGLE-SOURCED. TO MINIMIZE THE RISKS OF DISRUPTION OF OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND ENSURE CONTINUITY OF F-35 PRODUCTION, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE DOD AND SUPPORTING ACTIVITIES TO IDENTIFY AND ENGAGE ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS FOR THE COMPONENT PARTS PRODUCED BY TURKISH SUPPLIERS. WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS TOWARD THIS END BUT DUE TO THE PROCEDURE TO QUALIFY NEW PARTS AND SUPPLIERS, THIS COLLABORATIVE PROCESS BETWEEN DOD AND LOCKHEED MARTIN IS ONGOING. WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE TIMELINE FOR THE TRANSITION OF TURKISH SOURCES. WHILE THE TRANSITION TIMELINE IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP, IT IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR REPLACEMENT CAPACITY IS RE-ESTABLISHED SO THAT PRODUCTION IS NOT IMPACTED. EFFORTS TO DATE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED OUR RISK BUT FINAL RESOLUTION ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF REMAINING COMPONENTS COULD AFFECT F-35 DELIVERIES, INCLUDING IN 2020, AND ANY ACCELERATED WORK STOPPAGE WOULD IMPACT COST. INTERNATIONAL SALES OF THE F-35 ARE NEGOTIATED BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE PROCESS THAT FORMALLY REMOVED TURKEY FROM THE F-35 PROGRAM IS A GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT MATTER. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW OFFICIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT GUIDANCE AS IT RELATES TO DELIVERY OF F-35 AIRCRAFT TO TURKEY AND THE EXPORT AND IMPORT OF COMPONENT PARTS FROM THE TURKISH SUPPLY CHAIN.  THE EFFECTS OF POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT SANCTIONS ON TURKEY, AND TURKEY\u2019S REMOVAL FROM THE F-35 PROGRAM DO NOT APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, UNFORESEEN ACTIONS COULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF ORDERS, DISRUPT THE PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT, DELAY DELIVERY OF AIRCRAFT, DISRUPT DELIVERY OF SUSTAINMENT COMPONENTS PRODUCED IN TURKEY AND IMPACT FUNDING ON THE F-35 PROGRAM TO INCLUDE THE RESULT OF ANY REPROGRAMMING OF FUNDS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF ALTERNATE SOURCES FOR COMPONENT PARTS MADE IN TURKEY. WHILE, IN THE CASE OF THE F-35 PROGRAM, WE EXPECT THAT THESE COSTS ULTIMATELY WOULD BE RECOVERED FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE AVAILABILITY OR TIMING OF ANY RECOVERY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION, INCLUDING THE RISK OF SANCTIONS ON OTHER PROGRAMS INVOLVING SALES TO TURKEY OR WORK WITH TURKISH INDUSTRY, SEE ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS OF OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  GIVEN THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE F-35 PROGRAM, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THERE WILL BE CONTINUAL REVIEWS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE, PROGRAM SCHEDULE, COST, AND REQUIREMENTS AS PART OF THE DOD, CONGRESSIONAL, AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNER COUNTRIES\u2019 OVERSIGHT AND BUDGETING PROCESSES. CURRENT PROGRAM CHALLENGES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SUPPLIER AND PARTNER PERFORMANCE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, LEVEL OF COST ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE CYCLE OPERATIONS AND SUSTAINMENT AND WARRANTIES, RECEIVING FUNDING FOR PRODUCTION CONTRACTS ON A TIMELY BASIS, EXECUTING FUTURE FLIGHT TESTS, AND FINDINGS RESULTING FROM TESTING AND OPERATING THE AIRCRAFT.  CONTINGENCIES  SEE \u201c  NOTE 7 \u2013 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES  \u201d INCLUDED IN OUR NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCLOSED IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR  2019  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS  THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR SIKORSKY REPORTING UNIT INCLUDED GOODWILL OF $2.7 BILLION, AN INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET OF $887 MILLION, AND FINITE-LIVED CUSTOMER PROGRAM INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $2.2 BILLION AS OF MARCH 29, 2020. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, WE PERFORMED OUR ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET. WE WERE NOT REQUIRED TO TEST THE FINITE-LIVED PROGRAM INTANGIBLE ASSET BECAUSE THERE WERE NO INDICATORS OF A POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. AS OF THE DATE OF OUR 2019 ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE ESTIMATED THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SIKORSKY REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE FOR GOODWILL BY A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY 40% AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDED ITS CARRYING VALUE BY A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY 10%.  THE FAIR VALUES AND CARRYING VALUES OF OUR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELY-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSET AT OUR SIKORSKY BUSINESS ARE CLOSELY ALIGNED. THEREFORE, ANY BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR TERMINATIONS, OR CHANGES IN EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS COULD CAUSE OUR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS TO DECLINE BELOW CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND COULD CAUSE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO BE IMPAIRED. SIMILARLY, MARKET FACTORS UTILIZED IN THE IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, INCLUDING LONG-TERM GROWTH RATES AND DISCOUNT RATES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT GOODWILL AND INDEFINITELY-LIVED TRADEMARK INTANGIBLE ASSETS AT OUR SIKORSKY BUSINESS ARE AT RISK FOR IMPAIRMENT SHOULD THERE BE DETERIORATION OF PROJECTED CASH FLOWS. WHILE WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS ON OUR ASSETS AS A RESULT OF COVID-19, ANY BUSINESS DETERIORATION, CONTRACT CANCELLATIONS OR TERMINATIONS, OR MARKET PRESSURES COULD CAUSE OUR SALES, EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS TO DECLINE BELOW OUR CURRENT PROJECTIONS AND COULD CAUSE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES TO BE IMPAIRED. SEE ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 ON THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR ASSETS.

OVERVIEW  NEUROMETRIX DEVELOPS AND COMMERCIALIZES HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS THAT UTILIZE NON-INVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION AND DIGITAL MEDICINE. OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING HAS BEEN REFINED OVER TWO DECADES OF DESIGNING, BUILDING AND MARKETING MEDICAL DEVICES THAT STIMULATE NERVES AND ANALYZE NERVE RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. WE CREATED THE MARKET FOR POINT-OF-CARE NERVE TESTING AND WERE FIRST TO MARKET WITH SOPHISTICATED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF OF CHRONIC PAIN. OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH IN-HOUSE CAPABILITIES SPANNING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND COMPLIANCE, SALES AND MARKETING, PRODUCT FULFILLMENT AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE DERIVE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND AFTER-MARKET CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT OVERSEAS MARKETS. THEY ARE CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND REGULATORS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE TWO PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES.  \u2022  POINT-OF-CARE NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  \u2022  WEARABLE NEUROSTIMULATION DEVICES  DIABETES IS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC WITH AN ESTIMATED AFFECTED POPULATION OF OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND ANOTHER 80 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. THE ANNUAL DIRECT COST OF TREATING DIABETES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DANGEROUS ACUTE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES, THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THE DISEASE IS IN ITS LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, NERVE DISEASE AND RESULTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE AMPUTATION, EYE DISEASE LEADING TO BLINDNESS, AND KIDNEY FAILURE. THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM COMPLICATION OF DIABETES, AFFECTING OVER 50% OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION, IS NERVE DISEASE OR NEUROPATHY. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (DPN) IS THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING AMPUTATION. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES HAVE A 15-25% LIFETIME RISK OF FOOT ULCERS AND APPROXIMATELY 15% OF FOOT ULCERS LEAD TO AMPUTATION. FOOT ULCERS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES WITH A TYPICAL COST OF $5,000 TO $50,000 PER EPISODE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 16% AND 26% OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN IN THE FEET AND LOWER LEGS.  EARLY DETECTION OF DPN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS ONCE THE NERVES HAVE DEGENERATED. TODAY\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DPN RANGE FROM A SIMPLE MONOFILAMENT TEST FOR LACK OF SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE FEET TO A NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY PERFORMED BY A SPECIALIST. OUR DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A RAPID, LOW COST, QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE DISEASE, INCLUDING DPN. IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEED AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN SCREENING LARGE POPULATIONS. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES.  12  CHRONIC PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. IT IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) AS PAIN LASTING MORE THAN 12 WEEKS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH ACUTE PAIN WHICH IS A NORMAL BODILY RESPONSE TO INJURY OR TRAUMA. CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDE LOW BACK PAIN, ARTHRITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, NEUROPATHIC PAIN, CANCER PAIN AND MANY OTHERS. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BE TRIGGERED BY AN INJURY OR THERE MAY BE AN ONGOING CAUSE SUCH AS DISEASE OR ILLNESS. THERE MAY ALSO BE NO CLEAR CAUSE. PAIN SIGNALS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THESE CAN INCLUDE FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, DECREASED APPETITE, AND MOOD CHANGES WHICH CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY AND DESPAIR. IN GENERAL, CHRONIC PAIN CANNOT BE CURED. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING FUNCTION. THE GOAL IS EFFECTIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT.  CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS OVER 100 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN ON HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVER $250 BILLION PER YEAR AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $300 BILLION PER YEAR. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IS PAIN MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANALGESICS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS, BOTH NON-OPIOID AND OPIOID. THE APPROACH TO TREATMENT IS INDIVIDUALIZED, DRUG COMBINATIONS MAY BE EMPLOYED, AND THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN INADEQUATE. SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION, ARE SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASINGLY, RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON ACCESS TO PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS. REFLECTING THE COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND THE DIFFICULTY IN TREATING IT, WE BELIEVE THAT INADEQUATE RELIEF LEADS 25% TO 50% OF PAIN SUFFERERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE NUTRACEUTICALS, ACUPUNCTURE, CHIROPRACTIC CARE, NON-PRESCRIPTION ANALGESICS, ELECTRICAL STIMULATORS, BRACES, SLEEVES, PADS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN TOTAL THESE PAIN RELIEF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL OUT-OF-POCKET SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.  NERVE STIMULATION IS A LONG-ESTABLISHED CATEGORY OF TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC PAIN. THIS TREATMENT APPROACH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION REQUIRING SURGERY WITH ITS ATTENDANT RISKS. NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES INVOLVING TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) HAVE ACHIEVED LIMITED EFFICACY IN PRACTICE DUE TO DEVICE LIMITATIONS, INEFFECTIVE DOSING AND LOW PATIENT ADHERENCE. OUR APP-ENABLED QUELL WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL TENS.  OUR LEADING COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, AND THE FOCUS OF OUR STRATEGIC ATTENTION, ARE DPNCHECK AND QUELL.  DPNCHECK IS OUR WELL-ESTABLISHED TESTING TECHNOLOGY FOR DPN. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN DEPLOYED IN MULTIPLE CLINICAL TRIALS. IT CONTRIBUTES ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND HAS POSTED AVERAGE GROWTH RATES EXCEEDING 25% OVER THE FIVE YEARS THROUGH 2018. GROWTH IN 2019, WHICH IS BELOW TREND, REFLECTS THE OFFSETTING EFFECTS OF STRONG U.S. MARKET DEMAND AND A DOWNTURN IN DEMAND IN MEXICO. WE ENTERED 2020 PREPARED TO SUPPORT A GROWTH REBOUND WITH INCREASED PRODUCT SUPPLY AND USER TRAINING RESOURCES. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON 2020 DPNCHECK REVENUES ARE NOT YET CAPABLE OF A CLEAR ASSESSMENT. WE ARE INVESTING R&D RESOURCES IN THE NEXT GENERATION DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE, IMPROVE MANUFACTURING, AND RESTRICT THE POTENTIAL USE OF NON-COMPLIANT BIOSENSORS. RELEASE OF THE NEW DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY, FORECAST FOR LATE 2020, MAY ALSO PROVIDE OPPORTUNITY FOR CUSTOMER UPGRADES, NEW PRICING AND MARGIN-EXPANSION.  QUELL IS OUR APP-ENABLED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN. OVER THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE WORKED TO RESTRUCTURE THE QUELL COMMERCIAL MODEL TO ACHIEVE A POSITIVE NET OPERATING CONTRIBUTION AFTER DIRECT COSTS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS WILL POSITION US TO CROSSOVER TO A NET POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION DURING 2020. MOST OF OUR SALES ARE DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER VIA OUR E-COMMERCE PLATFORM,  WWW.QUELLRELIEF.COM.  WHEN WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE HAVE SECURED THIS CORE COMMERCIAL MODEL, INCLUDING EFFICIENT AD SPENDING, OUR OBJECTIVE WILL TURN TO GROWTH. THIS COULD ENCOMPASS GREATER AD PROMOTION IN ORDER TO MORE RAPIDLY EXPAND THE QUELL USER POPULATION, AND IT COULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND, POTENTIALLY, OTHER MARKETS.  OUR GLAXOSMITHKLINE (GSK) COLLABORATION ON QUELL CONTINUES TO BE PRODUCTIVE AS WE SUPPORT GSK\u2019S PROGRESS TOWARD LAUNCH IN MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THIS COLLABORATION WAS INITIATED IN EARLY 2018 AND HAS DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY $20.5 MILLION TO US IN DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES PLUS ADDITIONAL CO-FUNDED R&D.  BOTH DPNCHECK AND QUELL ARE SOPHISTICATED NEUROTECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS THAT ARE UNIQUE IN THEIR MARKETS. OUR GOAL FOR BOTH PRODUCTS IS THE SAME: TO OPTIMIZE MARKET POSITIONING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

QUELL REVENUES OF  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECLINED FROM  $1.6 MILLION  , IN THE COMPARABLE  2019  PERIOD REFLECTING REDUCED ADVERTISING SPENDING AND AN EMPHASIS ON THE PROFITABILITY OF QUELL SALES. DPNCHECK REVENUES WERE  $1.3 MILLION  AND  $1.2 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. ADVANCE CONTRIBUTED  $0.3 MILLION  OF REVENUE IN THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2020  AND  2019.

THE MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS DUE TO IMPROVED PROFITABILITY OF QUELL SALES AND INCREASED WEIGHTING OF OUR HIGHER MARGIN DPNCHECK BUSINESS WITHIN TOTAL REVENUE.  THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IN 2019 IS DUE IN PART TO A CHARGE OF $0.7 MILLION TO WRITE DOWN QUELL CLASSIC INVENTORY TO NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2020  . FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS LARGELY DEPENDS ON REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. A LOW LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST IN QUELL OR DPNCHECK, A DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLES SALES, UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, AND THE CONTINUING EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, RECEIVABLES INCLUDED EXTENDED TERMS FOR A LARGE DPNCHECK CUSTOMER THAT HAS SINCE BEEN COLLECTED.  THE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE OF  2.1  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 REFLECTED LOWER QUELL SALES. THE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 OF 3.5 INCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF A $0.7 MILLION INVENTORY PROVISION RECORDED IN THAT QUARTER. EXCLUDING THIS PROVISION, THE TURNOVER RATE WAS 2.2 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH INFORMATION RELATING TO OUR SOURCES AND USES OF OUR CASH.

WE HAVE REPORTED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $2.8 MILLION  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  . WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES AND THE CASH TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE PRODUCT SALES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021 AND BEYOND. WE CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY BE CONSUMED MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO (A) DECREASES IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC; (B) THE EFFECT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN PARTS AND MATERIALS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS WHILE CONTINUING TO STAFF CRITICAL PRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT FUNCTIONS, (C) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE TO THE BUSINESS THAT AFFECT ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES; (D) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY; (E) REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS; (F) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING PLANS; AND (G) OTHER ITEMS AFFECTING OUR FORECASTED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES AND USE OF CASH RESOURCES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCING, COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC COVERING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES FOR SALE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDING WHEN NEEDED OR OTHERWISE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AT PRICES AND ON TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERINGS. PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM S-3, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL SHARES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD, IN AN AMOUNT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, EITHER THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR BY OTHER MEANS, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION, AND THE NEW EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE  16  TO US. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY DELAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION GOALS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT IN THE FUTURE  WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS TO FUND OUR NEW BUSINESS. THE FAILURE TO SECURE ADEQUATE  OUTSIDE FUNDING WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PLAN OF OPERATION AND RESULTS THEREFROM AND A CORRESPONDING NEGATIVE IMPACT  ON STOCKHOLDER LIQUIDITY.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED  BY $162,771 FROM $155,029 TO $317,800 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2020, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS INCREASE WAS  PREDOMINANTLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH SPENDING AND MARKETING EXPENSE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $11,660  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 WHILE THE COMPANY HAD NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $1,892 FOR THE COMPARATIVE  PERIOD.  THE DIFFERENCE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PURCHASE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  BY $45,000 FROM $45,000 TO $NIL FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2020, RESPECTIVELY DUE TO A DECREASE OF FUNDING FROM  PRIVATE PLACEMENTS.  GOING CONCERN  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE  BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), WHICH  CONTEMPLATE CONTINUATION OF THE COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE HISTORY OF LOSSES AND THE INABILITY FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE  A PROFIT FROM SELLING A GOOD OR SERVICE HAS RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. IN SPITE  OF THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT CASH OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY ARE RELATIVELY MINIMAL, GIVEN THE CASH POSITION OF THE COMPANY, WE  HAVE VERY LITTLE CASH TO OPERATE. WE INTEND TO FUND THE COMPANY AND ATTEMPT TO MEET CORPORATE OBLIGATIONS BY SELLING COMMON STOCK.  HOWEVER, THE PRICE AND VOLUME OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK IS VOLATILE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  AS A SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY, WE ARE NOT  REQUIRED TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION REQUIRED BY PARAGRAPH (A)(5) OF THIS ITEM.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION  OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE A VARIETY OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT  (I) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, AND (II) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS COVERED BY THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  OUR MANAGEMENT ROUTINELY MAKES JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. AS THE NUMBER OF VARIABLES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING THE FUTURE  RESOLUTION OF THE UNCERTAINTIES INCREASE, THESE JUDGMENTS BECOME EVEN MORE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT OUR  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE REASONABLE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS BASED UPON ACTUAL RESULTS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATION AND/OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q.  WHILE ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE ESTIMATES DERIVED THERE FROM  HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BEING CRITICAL.  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK COMPENSATION  WITH PERSONS CLASSIFIED AS EMPLOYEES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718 \u201cCOMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d,  WHICH RECOGNIZES AWARDS AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD FOR AWARDS EXPECTED  TO VEST. CLIFF VESTING IS USED AND AWARDS VEST ON THE LAST DAY OF THE VESTING PERIOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS DETERMINED  USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMON SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S  STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE.  SHARE-BASED FOR NON-EMPLOYEES IN EXCHANGE FOR  GOODS AND SERVICES USED OR CONSUMED IN AN ENTITY\u2019S OWN OPERATIONS ARE ALSO RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE  AND ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718. THE MEASUREMENT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC ADJUSTMENT AS  THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS VEST. THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL AND  THE COMPENSATION CHARGES ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD.  SALES AND MARKETING  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY NOT SELLING OR MARKETING ANY PRODUCTS.  INFLATION  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT EXPECTS THAT OUR OPERATIONS  WILL BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ProtoKinetix, Inc.", "CIK": 1128189, "Date": "2020-04-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "PKTX", "Name": "Protokinetix Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 7389.0, "Business": "A1", "Incorporated": null, "IRS": 943355026.0, "key": "20200427PKTX", "labelr1": -0.642201834862391, "labelr2": -7.663896583564163, "labelr3": -2.0000000000000018, "labelr4": 12.24489795918367, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.56290406, "prof1": 0.43709597, "return1&2": 1.0835531610290816, "return1&2&3": 1.1052242242496633, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9698906457701127, "return2": 1.0766389658356417, "return1": 1.006422018348624, "return3": 1.02, "return4": 0.8775510204081634, "1_day_return": -0.6422018348623881, "cumulative_return1": 0.018852216933690248, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3866, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0198739658671818, "cumreturn1b": 1.3257747855599635, "cumreturn1c": 1.1321100341108592, "cumreturndow": 1.1590325411859947, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1507885282975263}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3874, "level_0": 3984, "index": 48863, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FILING. THE DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH UNDER PART II, ITEM 1A. \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  GENERAL  WE ARE A LEADING MULTI-NATIONAL HEALTHCARE ENTERPRISE THAT IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PEOPLE LIVE HEALTHIER LIVES. WE TAKE A LOCAL APPROACH - WITH LOCAL BRANDS AND LOCAL TEAMS - TO PROVIDE FULLY INTEGRATED, HIGH-QUALITY, AND COST-EFFECTIVE SERVICES TO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED AND COMMERCIAL HEALTHCARE PROGRAMS, FOCUSING ON UNDER-INSURED AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH BENEFITS (INCLUDING ESTIMATED COSTS INCURRED) AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) COSTS. WE MEASURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE BASED UPON TWO KEY RATIOS. THE HEALTH BENEFITS RATIO (HBR) REPRESENTS MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES, EXCLUDING PREMIUM TAX AND HEALTH INSURER FEE REVENUES THAT ARE SEPARATELY BILLED, AND REFLECTS THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PREMIUMS RECEIVED AND THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED. THE SG&A EXPENSE RATIO REPRESENTS SG&A COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM AND SERVICE REVENUES, EXCLUDING PREMIUM TAX AND HEALTH INSURER FEE REVENUES THAT ARE SEPARATELY BILLED.  OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (ACA) ANNUAL HEALTH INSURER FEE (HIF), ABSENT A HIF MORATORIUM OR REPEAL. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE HIF, INCLUDING THE \u201cGROSS-UP\u201d TO REFLECT THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE HIF. COLLECTIVELY, THIS REVENUE IS RECORDED AS PREMIUM TAX AND HEALTH INSURER FEE REVENUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, PREMIUM TAXES, STATE ASSESSMENTS AND THE HIF ARE NOT PASS-THROUGH PAYMENTS AND ARE RECORDED AS PREMIUM REVENUE AND PREMIUM TAX EXPENSE OR HEALTH INSURER FEE EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. A MORATORIUM SUSPENDED THE HIF FOR THE 2019 CALENDAR YEAR. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE, ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIANCES DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION IS RELATED TO THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HIF IN 2020.  WELLCARE ACQUISITION  ON JANUARY 23, 2020, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF WELLCARE HEALTH PLANS, INC. (WELLCARE) (THE WELLCARE ACQUISITION). THE TRANSACTION WAS VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $19.6 BILLION, INCLUDING THE ASSUMPTION OF $1.95 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT. THE WELLCARE ACQUISITION BRINGS A HIGH-QUALITY MEDICARE PLATFORM AND FURTHER EXTENDS OUR ROBUST MEDICAID OFFERINGS. THE COMBINATION ENABLES US TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED SOLUTIONS ACROSS MORE MARKETS WITH A CONTINUED FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE, HIGH-QUALITY, CULTURALLY-SENSITIVE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE ACQUISITION, ONE OF THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIANCES DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS SECTION IS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF WELLCARE.  COVID-19 TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK HAS CREATED UNIQUE AND UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES. TO SUPPORT OUR MEMBERS, PROVIDERS, EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIONS AND MADE NUMEROUS INVESTMENTS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 CRISIS. WE HAVE EXTENDED COVERAGE OF COVID-19 TESTING AND SCREENING SERVICES FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE AND MARKETPLACE MEMBERS AND ARE WAIVING ALL ASSOCIATED MEMBER COST SHARE AMOUNTS FOR COVID-19 TESTING AND SCREENING. WE ARE DELIVERING NEW CRITICAL SUPPORT TO SAFETY NET PROVIDERS, INCLUDING FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTHCARE CENTERS (FQHCS), BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS, AND LONG-TERM SERVICE AND SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS. WE ARE ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 CRISIS WITH A COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND INVESTMENT IN NON-MEDICAL BARRIERS TO ACHIEVING QUALITY HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE DEVELOPED INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY AFFECTED BY THE PANDEMIC. WE CREATED A PROVIDER SUPPORT PROGRAM TO ASSIST OUR NETWORK PROVIDERS WHO ARE SEEKING BENEFITS FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION (SBA) THROUGH THE CARES ACT. WE ESTABLISHED A MEDICAL RESERVE LEAVE POLICY TO SUPPORT CLINICAL STAFF WHO WANT TO JOIN A MEDICAL RESERVE FORCE AND SERVE THEIR COMMUNITIES DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. WE ARE PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INCLUDING WAIVING COST-SHARING FOR COVID-19 RELATED TREATMENT, EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE, AND ONE-TIME PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES IN A SMALL NUMBER OF CRITICAL OFFICE FUNCTIONS. WE ARE CONVERTING OUR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO A VIRTUAL-ONLY FORMAT.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE HAVE TAKEN SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO SUPPORT OUR EMPLOYEES TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY, WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT OUR BUSINESS CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AND THAT PROVIDER AND MEMBER PAYMENTS CONTINUE WITHOUT DISRUPTION. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANS AND HAVE TAKEN ACTIONS TO SUPPORT OUR WORKFORCE. WE HAVE TRANSITIONED THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES TO WORK FROM HOME, ALLOWING CENTENE TO CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT CLOSE TO FULL CAPACITY, WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL FRAMEWORK.  THE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS IN BOTH THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM IS UNCERTAIN. IT LARGELY DEPENDS ON FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO: THE LENGTH AND SEVERITY OF THE OUTBREAK, EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTAINMENT ACTIONS, AND THE TIMING AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS AND VACCINATIONS. THE PANDEMIC AND THESE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS WILL MOST LIKELY IMPACT OUR MEMBERSHIP AND UTILIZATION TRENDS. WE EXPECT AN INCREASE IN MEMBERSHIP, DRIVEN BY UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, CAUSING AN ESTIMATED INCREASE OF $4.0 BILLION TO OUR ORIGINAL FULL YEAR 2020 REVENUE GUIDANCE. ALSO, WE EXPECT DECREASED UTILIZATION, RELATED TO SHELTER-IN-PLACE AND SIMILAR ORDERS, WHICH COULD CAUSE DELAYED OR AVOIDED COSTS. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DENTAL AND VISION CLAIMS. HOWEVER, THE DEFERRAL OF MEDICAL SERVICES MAY LEAD TO HIGHER COSTS OF TREATMENT ONCE MEMBERS RETURN TO SEEKING MEDICAL CARE, AS THEIR HEALTH ISSUES MAY HAVE BECOME MORE ACUTE. WE EXPECT INCREMENTAL COVID-19 COSTS IN MEDICAL EXPENSES RELATED TO THE WAIVERS FOR TESTS AND TREATMENTS. WE ALSO EXPECT INCREMENTAL COSTS DUE TO INVESTMENTS AND ACTIONS WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN AND CONTINUED EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THE PANDEMIC HAS WIDESPREAD ECONOMIC IMPACT, DRIVING INTEREST RATE DECREASES AND LOWERING OUR INVESTMENT INCOME. WE ALSO EXPECT HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE THE DEFERRAL OF THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF SENIOR NOTES. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, WE DO NOT EXPECT THE IMPACT OF ALL THESE ITEMS TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR BOTTOM LINE, AND AS SUCH, WE HAVE MAINTAINED OUR PREVIOUS ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE.  WE ARE CONFIDENT WE HAVE THE TEAM, SYSTEMS, EXPERTISE AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH TO EFFECTIVELY NAVIGATE THIS CHALLENGING PANDEMIC LANDSCAPE.  REGULATORY TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES  THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT, POLITICIANS, AND HEALTHCARE EXPERTS CONTINUE TO DISCUSS AND DEBATE VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES HEALTHCARE PAYMENT MODEL. FROM THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, TO MEDICARE FOR ALL (SINGLE PAYER), TO PHARMACY PRICING STRUCTURES, ALL AREAS OF HEALTHCARE ARE BEING CHALLENGED TO ASSURE ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE IS DELIVERED TO ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. DURING THIS TIME OF DELIBERATION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON THE PROMISE OF DELIVERING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE TO ALL OF OUR MEMBERS AND BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CHANGING HEALTHCARE LANDSCAPE.  WE HAVE MORE THAN THREE DECADES OF EXPERIENCE, SPANNING SIX PRESIDENTS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE, IN DELIVERING HIGH-QUALITY HEALTHCARE SERVICES ON BEHALF OF STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO UNDER-INSURED AND UNINSURED FAMILIES, COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND MILITARY FAMILIES. THIS EXPERTISE HAS ALLOWED US TO DELIVER COST EFFECTIVE SERVICES TO OUR GOVERNMENT SPONSORS AND OUR MEMBERS. WHILE HEALTHCARE EXPERTS MAINTAIN FOCUS ON PERSONALIZED HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY, WE CONTINUE TO MAKE STRATEGIC DECISIONS TO ACCELERATE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND ANALYTICAL CAPABILITIES. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE BOTH THE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY NAVIGATE INDUSTRY CHANGES TO THE BENEFIT OF OUR MEMBERS, CUSTOMERS AND SHAREHOLDERS.  ON APRIL 27, 2020, THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY HEALTH INSURERS FOR PAYMENTS DUE UNDER THE RISK CORRIDOR PROGRAM, ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. THE COMPANY WILL HAVE A CLAIM FOR RISK CORRIDOR PAYMENTS, WHICH IT INTENDS TO PURSUE. AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY RISK CORRIDOR RECEIVABLES RECORDED ON ITS BALANCE SHEET.

N.M.: NOT MEANINGFUL  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED  41%  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  OVER THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  ,  DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF WELLCARE, GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE BUSINESS, EXPANSIONS AND NEW PROGRAMS IN MANY OF OUR STATES THROUGHOUT 2019 AND 2020, PARTICULARLY IOWA AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE IN 2020, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR ILLINOIS HEALTH PLAN AND THE TIMING OF PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE RECEIVED PREMIUM RATE ADJUSTMENTS THAT YIELDED A NET 1% COMPOSITE CHANGE ACROSS ALL OF OUR MARKETS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  MEDICAL COSTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH BENEFITS AND TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE COSTS INCURRED. THE HEALTH BENEFITS RATIO, OR HBR, REPRESENTS MEDICAL COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM REVENUES (EXCLUDING PREMIUM TAX AND HEALTH INSURER FEE REVENUES THAT ARE SEPARATELY BILLED) AND REFLECTS THE DIRECT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PREMIUM RECEIVED AND THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED.  THE HBR FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , WAS  88.0%  , COMPARED TO  85.7%  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE BUSINESS WHERE MARGINS CONTINUE TO NORMALIZE, AS EXPECTED. THE INCREASE ALSO INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OF WELLCARE AND NEW OR EXPANDED MARKETS, WHICH INITIALLY OPERATE AT A HIGHER HBR. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE.  COST OF SERVICES  COST OF SERVICES  INCREASED  BY  $281 MILLION  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  , PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN SPECIALTY PHARMACY VOLUME, PHARMACY SALES TO OUR RECENTLY DIVESTED ILLINOIS HEALTH PLAN, AND GROWTH FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THE COST OF SERVICE RATIO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , WAS  86.1%  , COMPARED TO  85.7%  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN  2019.  THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF SERVICE RATIO WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER MIX OF SPECIALTY PHARMACY BUSINESS, WHICH CARRIES A HIGHER COST OF SERVICE RATIO.  SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, OR SG&A,  INCREASE  D BY  $775 MILLION  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  . THE SG&A  INCREASE  WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADDITION OF THE WELLCARE BUSINESS AND $295 MILLION OF ACQUISITION RELATED COSTS  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE SG&A EXPENSE RATIO WAS  9.9%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  , COMPARED TO  9.6%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  THE INCREASE TO THE SG&A EXPENSE RATIO WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES DUE TO THE CLOSING OF THE WELLCARE ACQUISITION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ADDITION OF THE WELLCARE BUSINESS, WHICH OPERATES AT A LOWER SG&A RATIO.  THE ADJUSTED SG&A EXPENSE RATIO WAS  8.6%  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  , COMPARED TO  9.5%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  THE ADJUSTED SG&A EXPENSE RATIO BENEFITED FROM THE ADDITION OF THE WELLCARE BUSINESS, WHICH OPERATES AT A LOWER SG&A RATIO, AND THE LEVERAGING OF EXPENSES OVER HIGHER REVENUES.  HEALTH INSURER FEE EXPENSE  HEALTH INSURER FEE EXPENSE WAS  $345 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  . AS A RESULT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE MORATORIUM, WHICH SUSPENDED THE HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDER FEE FOR THE 2019 CALENDAR YEAR, WE DID NOT RECORD HEALTH INSURER FEE EXPENSE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN 2019.  IMPAIRMENT  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE RECORDED  $72 MILLION  OF A  NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT OF OUR THIRD-PARTY CARE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE BUSINESS.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPONENTS OF OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  ($ IN MILLIONS).  2020  2019  INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME  $167  $99  DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COSTS  (44  )  \u2014  INTEREST EXPENSE  (180  )  (99  )  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  $(57  )  $\u2014  INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME.  INVESTMENT AND OTHER INCOME  INCREASED  BY  $68 MILLION  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A  $93 MILLION  GAIN RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS OF OUR ILLINOIS HEALTH PLAN AS PART OF THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WELLCARE ACQUISITION AS WELL AS OVERALL HIGHER INVESTMENT BALANCES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION INVESTMENT FUND PORTFOLIO AND OUR EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS, WHICH BOTH FLUCTUATE WITH THEIR UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.  THE LOSSES FROM OUR DEFERRED COMPENSATION PORTFOLIO WERE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RECORDED IN SG&A EXPENSE.  DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT COSTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2020, WE REDEEMED ALL OF OUR OUTSTANDING $1.0 BILLION 6.125% SENIOR NOTES, DUE FEBRUARY 15, 2024 (THE 2024 NOTES) AND RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF APPROXIMATELY  $44 MILLION  . THE LOSS INCLUDES THE CALL PREMIUM, THE WRITE-OFF OF UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS AND THE LOSS ON THE TERMINATION OF THE $1.0 BILLION INTEREST RATE SWAP ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2024 NOTES.  INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INCREASED  BY  $81 MILLION  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  . THE INCREASE IS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN BORROWINGS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADDITIONAL $7.0 BILLION IN SENIOR NOTES IN DECEMBER 2019 TO FINANCE THE CASH CONSIDERATION OF THE WELLCARE ACQUISITION. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO OUR DECISION TO DEFER THE REDEMPTION OF OUR $1.0 BILLION 2022 SENIOR NOTES AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, BOTH AS MEASURES TO PRESERVE LIQUIDITY DUE TO THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT CREATED BY COVID-19.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $85 MILLION  ON PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF  $131 MILLION  , OR AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  64.9%  , DRIVEN BY THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE IN 2020, THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES, AND THE TAX IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE ILLINOIS DIVESTITURE. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $166 MILLION  ON PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF  $685 MILLION  , OR AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  24.2%  , WHICH REFLECTS THE HEALTH INSURER FEE MORATORIUM.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEGMENT RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS BY SEGMENT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31  , ($ IN MILLIONS).  2020  2019% CHANGE  TOTAL REVENUES  MANAGED CARE  $25,036  $17,722  41%  SPECIALTY SERVICES  3,903  3,206  22%  ELIMINATIONS  (2,914  )  (2,484  )  (17  )%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $26,025  $18,444  41%  EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS  MANAGED CARE  $217  $615  (65  )%  SPECIALTY SERVICES  (29  )  70  (141  )%  CONSOLIDATED TOTAL  $188  $685  (73  )%  MANAGED CARE  TOTAL REVENUES  INCREASED  41%  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  ,  DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF WELLCARE, GROWTH IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE BUSINESS, EXPANSIONS AND NEW PROGRAMS IN MANY OF OUR STATES THROUGHOUT 2019 AND 2020, PARTICULARLY IOWA AND PENNSYLVANIA, AND THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE IN 2020, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR ILLINOIS HEALTH PLAN AND THE TIMING OF PASS THROUGH PAYMENTS FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK.  EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS  DECREASED  $398 MILLION  BETWEEN YEARS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER ACQUISITION RELATED EXPENSES AND NORMALIZED MARGINS IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKETPLACE BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE HEALTH INSURER FEE IN 2020.  SPECIALTY SERVICES  TOTAL REVENUES  INCREASED  22%  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  , RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM INCREASED SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH MEMBERSHIP GROWTH IN THE MANAGED CARE SEGMENT, ACQUISITIONS, INCREASED VOLUME IN OUR SPECIALTY PHARMACY BUSINESS, AND SALES TO OUR RECENTLY DIVESTED ILLINOIS BUSINESS. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED  $99 MILLION  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN  2019  , DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED  $72 MILLION  IMPAIRMENT RELATED TO OUR THIRD-PARTY CARE MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE BUSINESS AND OUR MOVE TO TRANSPARENT PHARMACY PRICING WHICH BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUM AND TRADE RECEIVABLES, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DELAY IN PAYMENT FROM ONE OF OUR STATE CUSTOMERS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS IN EACH YEAR CAN BE IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE FROM OUR STATES. AS WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY, STATES MAY PREPAY THE FOLLOWING MONTH PREMIUM PAYMENT, WHICH WE RECORD AS UNEARNED REVENUE, OR THEY MAY DELAY OUR PREMIUM PAYMENT, WHICH WE RECORD AS A RECEIVABLE. WE TYPICALLY RECEIVE CAPITATION PAYMENTS MONTHLY; HOWEVER, THE STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE MAY DECIDE TO ADJUST THEIR PAYMENT SCHEDULES WHICH COULD POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REPORTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD.  CASH FLOWS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED CASH OF  $3.3 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020  , AND  $373 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN  2019  .

HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ELECT TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR THESE AND OTHER PURPOSES, EITHER THROUGH ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR EQUITY, THE SALE OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES OR OTHERWISE, AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY STRATEGICALLY PURSUE REFINANCING OR REDEMPTION OPPORTUNITIES TO EXTEND MATURITIES AND/OR IMPROVE TERMS OF OUR INDEBTEDNESS IF WE BELIEVE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE FAVORABLE TO US.  BASED ON OUR OPERATING PLAN, WE EXPECT THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS, CASH FROM OUR OPERATIONS AND CASH AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE OUR GENERAL OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM THE DATE OF THIS FILING.  WHILE WE ARE CURRENTLY IN A STRONG LIQUIDITY POSITION AND BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO CAPITAL, WE MAY ELECT TO INCREASE BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND WE HAVE DEFERRED THE INTENDED EARLY REDEMPTION OF THE 2022 NOTES AS A RESULT OF THE SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND THE RELATED DISRUPTION AND VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS.

AS MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, MOST OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM LEVELS OF STATUTORY CAPITAL, AS DEFINED BY EACH STATE, AND RESTRICT THE TIMING, PAYMENT AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID TO US. GENERALLY, THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS THAT MAY BE PAID BY A REGULATED SUBSIDIARY WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL BY STATE REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IS LIMITED BASED ON THE ENTITY\u2019S LEVEL OF STATUTORY NET INCOME AND STATUTORY CAPITAL AND SURPLUS.  OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PRESCRIBED BY VARIOUS REGULATORY AUTHORITIES IN EACH OF THE STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2020  , WE MADE NET CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF  $181 MILLION  TO OUR REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES.

UNDER THE CALIFORNIA KNOX-KEENE HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN ACT OF 1975, AS AMENDED (\u201cKNOX-KEENE\u201d), CERTAIN OF OUR CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIARIES MUST COMPLY WITH TANGIBLE NET EQUITY (TNE) REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THESE KNOX-KEENE TNE REQUIREMENTS, ACTUAL NET WORTH LESS UNSECURED RECEIVABLES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS MUST BE MORE THAN THE GREATER OF (I) A FIXED MINIMUM AMOUNT, (II) A MINIMUM AMOUNT BASED ON PREMIUMS OR (III) A MINIMUM AMOUNT BASED ON HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING CAPITATED AMOUNTS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIARIES HAVE MADE CERTAIN UNDERTAKINGS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTH CARE (DMHC) TO RESTRICT DIVIDENDS AND LOANS TO AFFILIATES, TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PAYMENT OF SUCH WOULD REDUCE SUCH ENTITIES' TNE BELOW THE REQUIRED AMOUNT AS SPECIFIED IN THE UNDERTAKING.  UNDER THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 10, PART 98, OUR NEW YORK SUBSIDIARY MUST COMPLY WITH CONTINGENT RESERVE REQUIREMENTS. UNDER THESE REQUIREMENTS, NET WORTH BASED UPON ADMITTED ASSETS MUST EQUAL OR EXCEED A MINIMUM AMOUNT BASED ON ANNUAL NET PREMIUM INCOME.  THE NAIC HAS ADOPTED RULES WHICH SET MINIMUM RISK BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER ENTITIES BEARING RISK FOR HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2020  , EACH OF OUR HEALTH PLANS WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ENACTED IN THOSE STATES.  AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, LOANS OR OTHER TRANSFERS OF CASH TO THEIR PARENT COMPANIES. SUCH RESTRICTIONS, UNLESS AMENDED OR WAIVED OR UNLESS REGULATORY APPROVAL IS GRANTED, LIMIT THE USE OF ANY CASH GENERATED BY THESE SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY OUR OBLIGATIONS. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID BY OUR INSURANCE COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE APPLICABLE STATE INSURANCE DEPARTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO STATUTORY SURPLUS, STATUTORY INCOME AND UNASSIGNED SURPLUS.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "CENTENE CORP", "CIK": 1071739, "Date": "2020-04-28T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CNC", "Name": "Centene Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 6324.0, "Business": "MO", "Incorporated": null, "IRS": 41406317.0, "key": "20200428CNC", "labelr1": -1.4887598630340926, "labelr2": 0.6196161402448188, "labelr3": -2.4181435866626613, "labelr4": 1.3698630136986312, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5378341999999999, "prof1": 0.46216577, "return1&2": 1.0085991912638843, "return1&2&3": 1.0329885679225634, "return1&2&3&4": 1.018838039594857, "return2": 0.9938038385975518, "return1": 1.014887598630341, "return3": 1.0241814358666266, "return4": 0.9863013698630136, "1_day_return": -1.4887598630340948, "cumulative_return1": 0.016825508923464048, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3874, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0320713505842412, "cumreturn1b": 1.3682941735034042, "cumreturn1c": 1.161994807648877, "cumreturndow": 1.1898441651487552, "cumreturnsp500": 1.1762049269789048}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3905, "level_0": 4015, "index": 80834, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE IDENTIFIED BELOW, AND THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A PROVIDER OF RADIO-FREQUENCY, OR RF, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG, AND MIXED-SIGNAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS-ON-CHIP SOLUTIONS FOR THE CONNECTED HOME, WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET APPLICATIONS. WE ARE A FABLESS INTEGRATED CIRCUIT DESIGN COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS INTEGRATE ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF A BROADBAND COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.  IN MOST CASES, THESE PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED ON A SINGLE SILICON-DIE, USING STANDARD DIGITAL CMOS PROCESSES AND CONVENTIONAL PACKAGING TECHNOLOGIES. WE BELIEVE THIS ENABLES OUR SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE SUPERIOR POWER, PERFORMANCE, AND COST ADVANTAGES RELATIVE TO OUR INDUSTRY COMPETITION.  OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE ELECTRONICS DISTRIBUTORS, MODULE MAKERS, ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS (ODMS), WHO INCORPORATE OUR PRODUCTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES.  EXAMPLES OF SUCH END MARKET ELECTRONIC DEVICES INCORPORATING OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE CABLE DOCSIS BROADBAND MODEMS AND GATEWAYS; WIRELINE CONNECTIVITY DEVICES FOR IN-HOME NETWORKING APPLICATIONS; RF TRANSCEIVERS AND MODEMS FOR WIRELESS CARRIER ACCESS AND BACKHAUL INFRASTRUCTURE; FIBER-OPTIC MODULES FOR DATA CENTER, METRO, AND LONG-HAUL TRANSPORT NETWORKS; VIDEO SET-TOP BOXES AND GATEWAYS; HYBRID ANALOG AND DIGITAL TELEVISIONS, DIRECT BROADCAST SATELLITE OUTDOOR AND INDOOR UNITS; AND POWER MANAGEMENT AND INTERFACE PRODUCTS USED IN THESE AND A RANGE OF OTHER MARKETS.  WE COMBINE OUR HIGH-PERFORMANCE RF AND MIXED-SIGNAL SEMICONDUCTOR DESIGN SKILLS WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG, AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE HIGHLY INTEGRATED SEMICONDUCTOR DEVICES AND PLATFORM-LEVEL SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MANUFACTURED USING A RANGE OF SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES, INCLUDING LOW-COST COMPLEMENTARY METAL OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR, OR CMOS, PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, SILICON GERMANIUM, GALLIUM ARSENIDE, BICMOS AND INDIUM PHOSPHIDE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES. OUR ABILITY TO DESIGN ANALOG AND MIXED-SIGNAL CIRCUITS IN CMOS ALLOWS US TO EFFICIENTLY COMBINE ANALOG AND DIGITAL SIGNAL PROCESSING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE SAME INTEGRATED CIRCUIT. AS A RESULT, OUR SOLUTIONS HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF FUNCTIONAL INTEGRATION AND PERFORMANCE, SMALL SILICON DIE SIZE, AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION. MOREOVER, WE ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO OFFER CUSTOMERS A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY CMOS-BASED RADIO SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES THAT PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF SUPERIOR RF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, ALONG WITH HIGH-PERFORMANCE ANALOG INTERFACE AND POWER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THAT ENABLE SHORTER DESIGN CYCLES, SIGNIFICANT DESIGN FLEXIBILITY, AND LOW SYSTEM COST ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS, WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND MULTIMARKET APPLICATIONS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, REVENUES WERE $62.0 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2019 AND IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, OUR NET REVENUE WAS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF RF RECEIVERS AND RF RECEIVER SYSTEMS-ON-CHIP AND CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS INTO BROADBAND OPERATOR VOICE AND DATA MODEMS AND GATEWAYS AND CONNECTIVITY ADAPTERS, GLOBAL ANALOG AND DIGITAL RF RECEIVER PRODUCTS, RADIO AND MODEM SOLUTIONS INTO WIRELESS CARRIER ACCESS AND BACKHAUL INFRASTRUCTURE PLATFORMS, HIGH-SPEED OPTICAL INTERCONNECT SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO OPTICAL MODULES FOR DATA-CENTER, METRO AND LONG-HAUL NETWORKS, AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE INTERFACE AND POWER MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS INTO A BROAD RANGE OF COMMUNICATIONS, INDUSTRIAL, AUTOMOTIVE AND MULTI-MARKET APPLICATIONS. OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ON OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER PENETRATE EXISTING MARKETS; OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND OUR TARGET ADDRESSABLE MARKETS BY DEVELOPING NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS; CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT TRADE POLICIES; AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN DESIGN WINS WITH DEVICE MANUFACTURERS, IN PARTICULAR MANUFACTURERS OF SET-TOP BOXES, DATA MODEMS, AND GATEWAYS FOR THE BROADBAND SERVICE PROVIDER, STORAGE NETWORKING MARKET, CABLE INFRASTRUCTURE MARKET, INDUSTRIAL AND AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, AND OPTICAL MODULE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS.  PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO ASIA ACCOUNTED FOR 84% AND 85% OF NET REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDING 50% FROM PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO HONG KONG DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 45% FROM PRODUCTS SHIPPED TO HONG KONG AND 22% TO MAINLAND CHINA DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS SHIPPED TO ASIA, WE BELIEVE THAT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THE SYSTEMS DESIGNED BY THESE CUSTOMERS AND INCORPORATING OUR SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS ARE THEN SOLD OUTSIDE ASIA. FOR EXAMPLE, REVENUE GENERATED FROM SALES OF OUR CABLE MODEM PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019 RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO SALES TO ASIAN ODMS AND CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS DELIVERING PRODUCTS INTO EUROPEAN AND NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS. TO DATE, ALL OF OUR SALES HAVE BEEN DENOMINATED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS.  A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET REVENUE HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN GENERATED BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. SALES TO CUSTOMERS COMPRISE BOTH DIRECT SALES TO CUSTOMERS AND INDIRECT SALES THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 18% OF OUR NET REVENUE AND ONE OF OUR DIRECT CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 10% OF OUR NET REVENUE, AND OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS COLLECTIVELY ACCOUNTED FOR 68% OF OUR NET REVENUE, OF WHICH DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 48% OF OUR NET REVENUE. FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS, WE SELL MULTIPLE PRODUCTS INTO DISPARATE END USER APPLICATIONS SUCH AS CABLE MODEMS, SATELLITE SET-TOP BOXES AND BROADBAND GATEWAYS.  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON WINNING COMPETITIVE BID SELECTION PROCESSES, KNOWN AS DESIGN WINS, TO DEVELOP SEMICONDUCTORS FOR USE IN OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS. THESE SELECTION PROCESSES ARE TYPICALLY LENGTHY, AND AS A RESULT, OUR SALES CYCLES WILL VARY BASED ON THE SPECIFIC MARKET SERVED, WHETHER THE DESIGN WIN IS WITH AN EXISTING OR A NEW CUSTOMER AND WHETHER OUR PRODUCT BEING DESIGNED IN OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S DEVICE IS A FIRST GENERATION OR SUBSEQUENT GENERATION PRODUCT. OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS CAN BE COMPLEX AND, IF OUR ENGAGEMENT RESULTS IN A DESIGN WIN, CAN REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT TIME TO DEFINE, DESIGN AND RESULT IN VOLUME PRODUCTION. BECAUSE THE SALES CYCLE FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS LONG, WE CAN INCUR SIGNIFICANT DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE WE DO NOT ULTIMATELY RECOGNIZE ANY REVENUE. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY LONG-TERM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH ANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS, ALL OF WHOM PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS ON A PURCHASE ORDER BASIS. ONCE ONE OF OUR PRODUCTS IS INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\u2019S DESIGN, HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRODUCT IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING THE PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE CHIP. PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES IN OUR TARGET MARKETS WILL VARY BY APPLICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CABLE OPERATOR MODEM AND GATEWAY SECTORS, A DESIGN-IN CAN HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 24 TO 48 MONTHS. IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND WIRED AND WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS, A DESIGN-IN CAN HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 24 TO 60 MONTHS AND BEYOND.  IMPACT OF COVID-19  IN LATE JANUARY 2020 AND EARLY FEBRUARY 2020, IN RESPONSE TO A SEVERE OUTBREAK OF THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, OR COVID-19, THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA INSTITUTED MANDATORY QUARANTINES IN WUHAN, CHINA, EXTENDED LUNAR NEW YEAR HOLIDAY CLOSURES, AND RESTRICTED SHIPMENTS OUT OF THE COUNTRY. THIS RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY DELAY IN OUR PRODUCT SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020. ON MARCH 11, 2020, THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DECLARED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC REGARDING COVID-19. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS REACHED ALL OF THE COUNTRIES AND STATES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, INCLUDING IN CALIFORNIA WHERE OUR HEADQUARTERS AND CENTRAL ENGINEERING TEAM ARE LOCATED, AS WELL AS SPAIN, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, CANADA, FRANCE, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA, WHERE ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING, SALES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL ARE LOCATED.  IN MANY OF THESE JURISDICTIONS, LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO INSTITUTED STAY-AT-HOME OR SHELTER-IN-PLACE ORDERS. TO PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES, WE ADOPTED SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICIES INCLUDING SUSPENDING EMPLOYEE TRAVEL AND IMPLEMENTING REMOTE WORK ARRANGEMENTS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR WORKFORCE WORLDWIDE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SOME IMPACT TO OUR NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFITS IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 DUE TO SEVERAL INDUSTRY-WIDE DYNAMICS RELATED TO COVID-19, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS CERTAIN CUSTOMER PUSH-OUT REQUESTS.  FURTHER, GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE REACTED NEGATIVELY TO THE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COVID-19 PANDEMIC\u2019S IMPACTS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THE STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION OF MANY COMPANIES ACROSS ALL INDUSTRIES. HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED SINCE MARCH 31, 2020 AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR SALES OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS, AND MAY IMPACT THE REST OF OUR BUSINESS TO SOME DEGREE.  HOWEVER, THE MAGNITUDE OF SUCH IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND ITS DURATION IS UNCERTAIN AND CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME.  AS DESCRIBED BELOW, ON APRIL 6, 2020, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUME CERTAIN LIABILITIES FROM INTEL CORPORATION RELATED TO ITS HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION.  THIS BUSINESS ALSO OPERATES IN JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.  IN PARTICULAR, THE INTEL DIVISION HAS MAJOR ENGINEERING, DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL WHOM WE EXPECT TO BECOME OUR EMPLOYEES IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, ISRAEL, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, AND CHINA.  ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE AND INTEGRATE AN ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND NEW PERSONNEL AROUND THE WORLD WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLICATED BY CONTINUING RESTRICTIONS ON TRAVEL AND SOCIAL DISTANCING.  IN ADDITION, ENGAGEMENT WITH AND MAKING OFFERS TO INTEL EMPLOYEES THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO TRANSFER TO THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WILL BE SIMILARLY COMPLICATED AND PRESENTS POTENTIAL EMPLOYEE RETENTION RISKS.  WE ARE TAKING VARIOUS STEPS TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, BUT WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR TO WHAT EXTENT THE PANDEMIC MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF THE ACQUISITION OR OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN EMPLOYEES AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS.  IN ADDITION, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAME FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL RISKS POSED TO MAXLINEAR\u2019S CURRENT BUSINESSES, INCLUDING POTENTIAL DECLINES IN REVENUES, SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS, AND OTHER FACTORS GENERALLY AFFECTING BUSINESSES WORLDWIDE.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF POTENTIAL RISKS ARISING FROM THE ACQUISITION, PLEASE SEE THE DISCUSSION IN PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q CAPTIONED \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  ACQUISITION OF HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION OF INTEL CORPORATION  ON APRIL 5, 2020, WE ENTERED INTO AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH INTEL CORPORATION, OR INTEL, UNDER WHICH WE AND OUR WHOLLY OWNED SINGAPORE SUBSIDIARY AGREED TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUME CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF THE HOME GATEWAY PLATFORM DIVISION OF INTEL, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF $150.0 MILLION IN CASH PAYABLE UPON CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION.  THE TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020. WE INTEND TO FUND THE TRANSACTION PRIMARILY WITH APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION OF NEW TRANSACTION DEBT AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN CASH FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER EFFECTIVE APRIL 5, 2020 WITH CERTAIN INITIAL LENDERS WHO HAVE COMMITTED TO PROVIDE A SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF UP TO $140.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE FACILITIES ARE AVAILABLE TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION AND TO PAY FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THE COMMITMENT LETTER PROVIDES THAT THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WILL HAVE A THREE-YEAR TERM AND THAT TERM LOANS WILL BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER AN ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS A FIXED APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 4.25% PER ANNUM OR AN ADJUSTED BASE RATE PLUS A FIXED APPLICABLE MARGIN OF 3.25% PER ANNUM, AT OUR OPTION. THE INCREMENTAL TERM LOAN FACILITY WILL BE SUBJECT TO A FINANCIAL COVENANT OF AN INITIAL MAXIMUM TOTAL NET LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.5 TO 1 WHICH DECREASES TO 3.0 TO 1 BEGINNING WITH THE SIXTH FULL FISCAL QUARTER ENDING AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE TRANSACTION. THE DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTATION GOVERNING THE DEBT FINANCING HAS NOT BEEN FINALIZED, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE ACTUAL TERMS MAY DIFFER FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF SUCH TERMS IN THE COMMITMENT LETTER.  FOR MORE INFORMATION, PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 14 OF OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, THE MOST CRITICAL OF WHICH ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS VALUATION, INCOME TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE BELIEVE THAT ACCOUNTING POLICIES WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL INVOLVE A GREATER DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND COMPLEXITY THAN OUR OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ARE THE POLICIES WE BELIEVE ARE THE MOST CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, REFER TO MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHICH WE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, OR SEC, ON FEBRUARY 5, 2020, OR OUR ANNUAL REPORT.

THE DECREASE IN CONNECTED HOME NET REVENUE OF $11.2 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLOWDOWN IN THE SATELLITE AND CABLE MARKETS, OWING TO REDUCED OPERATOR SPENDING, THE MARKET TRANSITION FROM DOCSIS 3.0 TO DOCSIS 3.1 AND RELATED CUSTOMER INVENTORY REDUCTIONS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL INDUSTRY-WIDE DYNAMICS RELATED TO CORONAVIRUS DISEASE (COVID-19), INCLUDING SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS EARLY IN THE QUARTER, AND CERTAIN CUSTOMER PUSH-OUT REQUESTS. OUR MOCA SHIPMENTS ALSO DECLINED OWING TO A PAUSE IN A RAMP UP, OR EXPECTED INCREASE IN REVENUE, RELATED TO A NEW PROGRAM AT A LARGE TELECOMMUNICATIONS CUSTOMER. THE DECREASE IN INFRASTRUCTURE REVENUES OF $4.6 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASED HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG, WIRELESS BACKHAUL, AND HIGH-SPEED INTERCONNECT SHIPMENTS IN THIS CATEGORY. THE DECREASE IN INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET REVENUE OF $6.9 MILLION WAS RELATED TO DECREASED SHIPMENTS OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN THIS CATEGORY, WHICH WE ATTRIBUTE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF COVID-19.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT REVENUE WILL FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD, BASED ON EVOLVING CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE PACE OF ADOPTION OF NEWER PRODUCTS, AND MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FURTHER, DUE TO HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES.  WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR SALES OF HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF NET REVENUE AND GROSS PROFIT  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  COST OF NET REVENUE  $31,265  $39,558  $(8,293)  (21)%% OF NET REVENUE  50%  47%  GROSS PROFIT  30,762  45,077  (14,315)  (32)%% OF NET REVENUE  50%  53%  COST OF NET REVENUE DECREASED $8.3 MILLION TO $31.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED TO $39.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES. GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECLINED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, DUE TO PRODUCT MIX.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE WILL FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD, BASED ON CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, AND AVERAGE MANUFACTURING COSTS. FURTHER, DUE TO HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND RESULTING FROM THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED COST OF NET REVENUES RESULTING FROM DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES.  WE BELIEVE SUCH IMPACT MAY IN PARTICULAR AFFECT OUR COSTS OF SALES ON HIGH PERFORMANCE ANALOG PRODUCTS IN OUR INDUSTRIAL AND MULTI-MARKET BUSINESS.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN PROTOTYPE EXPENSES OF $2.0 MILLION DUE TO TIMING OF PROJECTS, PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES OF $0.3 MILLION DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OF $0.2 MILLION AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT REACHING THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIVES, AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES OF $0.2 MILLION FROM TERMINATED LEASES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSES OF $1.1 MILLION MAINLY RELATED TO CONSULTING AND DESIGN TOOLS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EXPANDING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND ENHANCING EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES OF $2.5 MILLION MAINLY RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN PAYROLL-RELATED EXPENSES OF $0.6 MILLION DUE TO LOWER HEADCOUNT, OUTSIDE SERVICES EXPENSES OF $0.4 MILLION DUE TO COMPLETION OF CERTAIN VENDOR SERVICES, TRAVEL EXPENSES OF $0.3 MILLION, AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSES OF $0.2 MILLION MAINLY DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF CERTAIN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENT ASSETS.  WE EXPECT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OTHER THAN ACQUISITION TRANSACTION COSTS TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT IN THE NEAR-TERM; HOWEVER, OUR EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS WE GROW OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO EXPAND INTO EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2020  2019  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES  $86  $\u2014  $86  100%% OF NET REVENUE  \u2014%  \u2014%  IMPAIRMENT LOSSES INCREASED $0.1 MILLION TO $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020, COMPARED TO $0 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.

THE CHANGE IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE OF $0.9 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION PERTAINING TO A LOWER AVERAGE BALANCE OF DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING THE PERIOD.

THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND 2019 EACH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AMONG JURISDICTIONS, EXCESS TAX DEFICIENCIES AND BENEFITS, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND RELEASE OF CERTAIN RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER ASC 740-10. ALSO INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 WAS A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS AID, RELIEF AND ECONOMIC SECURITY ACT, OR CARES ACT, ENACTED EFFECTIVE MARCH 27, 2020.  SUCH TAX BENEFIT RELATES TO OUR ABILITY TO CARRY BACK OUR 2019 NET OPERATING LOSS, ORIGINALLY VALUED AT A 21% FEDERAL TAX RATE, TO OFFSET INCOME TAXES PAID IN PRIOR PERIODS AT THE 35% FEDERAL TAX RATE IN EFFECT AT THAT TIME.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO OFFSET STATE AND CERTAIN FEDERAL AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS REALIZATION OF SUCH ASSETS DOES NOT MEET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD REQUIRED UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDELINES. IN MAKING SUCH DETERMINATION, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE QUARTERLY, INCLUDING SCHEDULED REVERSALS OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, PROJECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, AND RECENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. BASED UPON OUR REVIEW OF ALL POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON STATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, CERTAIN FEDERAL DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND CERTAIN FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE HAVE CUMULATIVE LOSSES OR OTHERWISE ARE NOT EXPECTED TO UTILIZE CERTAIN TAX ATTRIBUTES. WE DO NOT INCUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN CERTAIN TAX-FREE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  OUR SUBSIDIARY IN SINGAPORE OPERATES UNDER CERTAIN TAX INCENTIVES IN SINGAPORE, WHICH ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE THROUGH MARCH 2022 AND MAY BE EXTENDED THROUGH MARCH 2027. UNDER THESE INCENTIVES, QUALIFYING INCOME DERIVED FROM CERTAIN SALES OF OUR INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IS TAXED AT A CONCESSIONARY RATE OVER THE INCENTIVE PERIOD. WE ALSO RECEIVE A REDUCED WITHHOLDING TAX RATE ON CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS MADE BY OUR SINGAPORE SUBSIDIARY DURING THE INCENTIVE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVES ARE CONDITIONAL UPON OUR MEETING CERTAIN MINIMUM EMPLOYMENT AND INVESTMENT THRESHOLDS WITHIN SINGAPORE OVER TIME, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RETURN CERTAIN TAX BENEFITS IN THE EVENT WE DO NOT ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE RELATED TO THAT INCENTIVE PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SATISFY THESE CONDITIONS WITHOUT MATERIAL RISK. PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF OUR SINGAPORE NET OPERATING LOSSES AND OUR FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN SINGAPORE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE INCENTIVES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR INCOME TAX POSITION IN THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2020.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $98.4 MILLION, RESTRICTED CASH OF $0.1 MILLION AND NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $44.8 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF MARCH 31, 2020, OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $118.2 MILLION.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES, PURCHASES OF INVENTORY, PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND FROM TIME TO TIME, THE ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES. WE ALSO USE CASH TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING DEBT. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS WITH APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION OF NEW TRANSACTION DEBT AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN CASH FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET. SUCH TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  HEIGHTENED VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE WORLDWIDE ECONOMY IN GENERAL CONTINUES TO IMPACT BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE DECREASED SALES AND REVENUES IN THE NEAR FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT FROM COVID-19 COULD RESULT IN A NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR INCUR ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS TO FUND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OR OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IF WE PURSUE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS AND OUR EFFORTS TO INTEGRATE THAT BUSINESS, CHANGES IN REVENUE, THE EXPANSION OF OUR ENGINEERING, SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR EXPANSION INTO NEW TERRITORIES, THE TIMING OF INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND POTENTIAL MATERIAL INVESTMENTS IN, OR ACQUISITIONS OF, COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGIES. ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS OR EXECUTE OUR STRATEGIC PLANS.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE TIMING OF WHEN WE PAY EXPENSES AS REFLECTED IN THE CHANGE IN OUR OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES. CASH USED TO FUND OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ITEMS SUCH AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LEASED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LEASED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS. CASH USED TO FUND CAPITAL PURCHASES IS INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. CASH USED TO PAY DOWN OUTSTANDING DEBT IS INCLUDED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH ARE CASH RECEIPTS ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM OUR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS TO DISTRIBUTORS AND DIRECT CUSTOMERS. ASIDE FROM THE AMOUNTS BILLED TO OUR CUSTOMERS, NET CASH COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CASH COLLECTIONS PROCESS, WHICH CAN VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE PAYMENT CYCLES OF OUR MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR CUSTOMERS, AND RELATIVE LINEARITY OF SHIPMENTS PERIOD-TO-PERIOD. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, UNDER WHICH WE ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN TO PARTIALLY FUND OUR ACQUISITION OF EXAR, PERMITS US TO REQUEST INCREMENTAL LOANS IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED THE SUM OF $160.0 MILLION (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR ANY VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS), PLUS AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT THAT IS SUBJECT TO PRO FORMA COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO AND TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO TESTS. WE REQUESTED AN INCREMENTAL LOAN UNDER THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NEW INITIAL LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE PENDING ACQUISITION TRANSACTION.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ALSO EXITED CERTAIN LEASED FACILITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN IMPAIRMENTS OF LEASED RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS OF $2.2 MILLION AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS OF $1.4 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF RELATED LEASE LIABILITIES OF $2.9 MILLION.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2020 AND CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR $98.4 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT MARCH 31, 2020 WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE HAVE REPAID $213.0 MILLION OF DEBT THROUGH MARCH 31, 2020. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REQUEST INCREMENTAL LOANS IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED THE SUM OF $160.0 MILLION (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS FOR ANY VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS), PLUS AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT THAT IS SUBJECT TO PRO FORMA COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO AND TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO TESTS. INCREMENTAL LOANS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING OBTAINING ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM THE LENDERS THEN PARTY TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR NEW LENDERS. THE INITIAL TERM LOAN FACILITY HAS A SEVEN-YEAR TERM EXPIRING IN MAY 2024 AND BEARS INTEREST AT EITHER AN ADJUSTED LIBOR OR AN ADJUSTED BASE RATE, AT OUR OPTION, PLUS A FIXED APPLICABLE MARGIN. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE WIFI AND BROADBAND ASSETS BUSINESS WITH APPROXIMATELY $140.0 MILLION OF NEW TRANSACTION DEBT AND APPROXIMATELY $10.0 MILLION IN CASH FROM OUR BALANCE SHEET. SUCH TRANSACTION IS CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO CLOSE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN RECENT YEARS HAVE BEEN FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EQUITY-BASED BONUS PROGRAM FOR OUR EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING EXECUTIVES. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT BONUS PROGRAM, IN MARCH 2020, WE ISSUED 0.2 MILLION FREELY-TRADABLE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN SETTLEMENT OF BONUS AWARDS FOR THE 2019 PERFORMANCE PERIOD. WE EXPECT TO IMPLEMENT A SIMILAR EQUITY-BASED PLAN FOR FISCAL 2020, BUT OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE RETAINS DISCRETION TO EFFECT PAYMENT IN CASH, STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND STOCK.  WARRANTIES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS  IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF PRODUCTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE OFTEN MAKE REPRESENTATIONS AFFIRMING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT INFRINGE ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, AND AGREE TO INDEMNIFY CUSTOMERS AGAINST THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR SUCH INFRINGEMENT. FURTHER, OUR CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND BYLAWS REQUIRE US TO INDEMNIFY OUR OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AGAINST ANY ACTION THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF THEIR SERVICES IN THAT CAPACITY, AND WE HAVE ALSO ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ALL OF OUR DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN CONTROLLING PERSONS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, OR SPES, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.
