CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION  OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, GARRY MCHENRY, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE  DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES  EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. BASED ON THIS  EVALUATION, GARRY MCHENRY, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT AS OF APRIL 2, 2019, OUR DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE SUCH THAT THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d) REPORTS IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS  SPECIFIED IN SEC RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER  AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.  THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IDENTIFIED  RELATES TO THE LACK OF PROPER SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LACK OF PROPER SEGREGATION OF DUTIES IS DUE  TO THE COMPANY\u2019S LIMITED RESOURCES.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL  OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EVALUATION OF THESE CONTROLS AS OF THE END OF OUR LAST FISCAL QUARTER  AS COVERED BY THIS REPORT ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR  INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT  ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR OR ALL FRAUD AND IS NOT  EFFECTIVE. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT  THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS,  AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL  SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT  ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, WITHIN THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE  REALITIES THAT JUDGMENTS IN DECISION MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS  CAN ALSO BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF  THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS,  AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS.  12  PART II \u2013 OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.

GENERAL  WE DERIVE OUR REVENUES  THROUGH THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, PERSONALIZATION, RENTAL, CLEANING, DELIVERING, AND SELLING OF A WIDE RANGE OF UNIFORMS AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING, INCLUDING SHIRTS, PANTS, JACKETS, COVERALLS, LAB COATS, SMOCKS AND APRONS AND SPECIALIZED PROTECTIVE  WEAR, SUCH AS FLAME RESISTANT AND HIGH VISIBILITY GARMENTS. WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER  NON-GARMENT  ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES  AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE  REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF  REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY  OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES,  NON-OPERATING  ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE  ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF  OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR  ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE  RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED  TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN  OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS  NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT  OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE  COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME  REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE IN FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN  STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2,  2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER  THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND  PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 45,000 SHARES FOR AN AVERAGE  PRICE PER SHARE OF $139.57.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A  PRE-TAX  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON  DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND  QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A  ONE-TIME  CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF  $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED.  THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $6.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE  INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35.0% RATE TO A NEW 21.0% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS  ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED  APPROXIMATELY 7.7% AND 7.8% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR  REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 8.0% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES FOR BOTH THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 2018. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED  INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN  DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN  DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

ORGANIC GROWTH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NEW SALES, PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, AND NET CHANGES IN THE WEARER LEVELS AT OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY LOST ACCOUNTS. DURING THE QUARTER, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH RATE BENEFITED FROM SOLID NEW ACCOUNT SALES,  SLIGHTLY IMPROVED LOST ACCOUNTS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND INCREASES IN MERCHANDISE RECOVERY CHARGES.  SPECIALTY  GARMENTS\u2019 RESULTS ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING AND LENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS\u2019 POWER REACTOR OUTAGES AS WELL AS ITS PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN SPECIALTY GARMENTS REVENUE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POSITIVE  EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS OF 10.8%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S CANADIAN AND EUROPEAN OPERATIONS.

THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND SERVICE AND DELIVERY PAYROLL COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MERCHANDISE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THESE INCREASES  WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS, THE CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL LABOR COSTS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW CRM PROJECT THAT WE INITIATED IN FISCAL 2018, AND THE DEFERRAL OF COMMISSION COSTS UPON THE ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019.

THESE NEW RATES REQUIRED US  TO REMEASURE OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. ALSO, WE WERE SUBJECT TO A  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE  REMEASUREMENT OF OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX RESULTED IN A $20.2 MILLION NET BENEFIT TO OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO INCOME TAXES AND THE ACT, PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON  FORM 10-Q.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  TOTALED $335.3 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $64.8 MILLION FROM AUGUST 25, 2018 WHEN THE AMOUNT TOTALED $270.5 MILLION. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019  INCLUDES $47.7 MILLION IN CASH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $668.9 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019 COMPARED TO $586.3 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 25, 2018. WE GENERATED $128.7 MILLION AND  $230.1 MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND THE FULL FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 25, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH,  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR  LIQUIDITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO FUND MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO USE CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL  AS PROCEEDS FROM LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT, TO FUND GROWTH AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED  FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 24, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS $3.0 MILLION FROM THE SETTLEMENT  OF ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF RECEIVABLES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE  ONE-TIME  BONUS PAID TO OUR EMPLOYEES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019 AND INCREASED MERCHANDISE PLACED IN SERVICE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS RELATED TO BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND TO  AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS PAID BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A  $250 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 11, 2021. UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON,  AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED  FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO  OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS 75 BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTING TO  $71.8 MILLION, LEAVING $178.2 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE  WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWELVE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CAD FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO  CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD  FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY 12.1 MILLION CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.7814 OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE  FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  12.1 MILLION CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF $0.1 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND $0.1 MILLION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $0.1 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED $0.1 MILLION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO  REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS  MATURITY ON FEBRUARY 25, 2022.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, AND THE  GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES. IN PARTICULAR, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES CURRENTLY USE AND MUST DISPOSE OF DETERGENT WASTE WATER AND OTHER RESIDUES, AND, IN THE PAST, USED  PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND OTHER DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS. WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE  SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY  SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND  THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR  CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER  PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES  LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH  HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY  UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS UNDER TERMS OF CONSENT ORDERS NEGOTIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OTHERWISE  WITH RESPECT TO SITES LOCATED IN OR RELATED TO WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS, SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, UVALDE, TEXAS, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, TWO SITES RELATED TO FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT, AS WELL AS SITES  LOCATED IN GOLDSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA AND WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.  WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN  DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE  FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN  AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF  THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS  SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE  EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE  MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR  ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES  (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN  THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY  DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF 3% FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, THE RISK-FREE  INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM 2.7% TO 3.0%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE  EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED  FEBRUARY 23, 2019 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  FEBRUARY 23,  2019  BEGINNING BALANCE AS OF AUGUST 25, 2018  $25,486  COSTS INCURRED FOR WHICH RESERVES HAD BEEN PROVIDED  (456  )  INSURANCE PROCEEDS  87  INTEREST ACCRETION  377  CHANGE IN DISCOUNT RATES  (80  )  BALANCE AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019  $25,414  ANTICIPATED PAYMENTS AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATING TO CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES AS OF  FEBRUARY 23, 2019, FOR THE NEXT FIVE FISCAL YEARS AND THEREAFTER, AS MEASURED IN CURRENT DOLLARS, ARE REFLECTED BELOW.

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR TWO SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT  EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019,  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION. ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE  PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE  STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE  COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A  PRE-TAX  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR  LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS  A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A  ONE-TIME  CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE  CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  FROM TIME TO  TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND  ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT  IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR  CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION  S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE  FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING  START-UP  OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS  IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND  START-UP  OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO  COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE  THE IMPACTS OF MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES THROUGH OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PRICE INCREASES CONSISTENT WITH THE RATE OF INFLATION, AND CONTINUED FOCUS ON IMPROVEMENTS OF OPERATIONAL  PRODUCTIVITY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT WERE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 25, 2018.

SEE  NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HAS ALSO BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO: THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE AND TIMING OF THE SATISFACTION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND THE TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS; THE REALIZATION OF TAX ASSETS AND ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITIES; FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES; ASSETS HELD FOR SALE; INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL VALUATIONS; THE RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THIS LISTING IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THESE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  REVENUE POLICY  OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS OFTEN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY OR IF THEY SHOULD BE COMBINED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FURTHER, WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF ESTIMATION METHODS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (\"SSP\") FOR EACH PRODUCT AND SERVICE. WE USE THE RESIDUAL APPROACH IN ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. AS REQUIRED, WE EVALUATE THE RESIDUAL APPROACH ESTIMATE COMPARED TO ALL AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE DATA IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE THE ESTIMATE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS SSP.  SEE  NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 CONTAINS CERTAIN SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THIS FORM 10-Q, AND OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US OR STATEMENTS MADE BY OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY CONTAIN \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING\u201d STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION, WHICH INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. STATEMENTS INDICATING THAT WE \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cSHOULD,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cPLAN,\u201d \u201cTARGET,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATE\u201d AND \u201cCONTINUE,\u201d ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, AS ARE OTHER STATEMENTS CONCERNING FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS OR FUTURE EVENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: (1) ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. (2) WE MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL FORECASTS DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS DELAYS OR SIZE REDUCTIONS IN TRANSACTIONS, FEWER LARGE TRANSACTIONS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, OR A DECLINE IN OUR RENEWAL RATES FOR CONTRACTS. (3) OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE TRANSITIONS TO NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON A CLOUD AND SUBSCRIPTION STRATEGY, MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. (4) IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW OR SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER TO MEET MARKET DEMAND, PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS MAY NOT PURCHASE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES OR SUBSCRIPTIONS OR PURCHASE OR RENEW SUPPORT CONTRACTS. (5) WE DEPEND UPON OUR EXTENSIVE PARTNER CHANNEL AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN RETAINING OR EXPANDING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHANNEL PARTNERS. (6) OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES. (7) IF THE SECURITY MEASURES FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR OTHER OFFERINGS ARE COMPROMISED OR SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER-ATTACK, OR IF SUCH OFFERINGS CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT CODING OR CONFIGURATION ERRORS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE REPUTATIONAL HARM, LEGAL CLAIMS AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. (8) WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE, AND THOSE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, MAY INVOLVE  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR OTHER INTEGRATION ISSUES OR MAY DISRUPT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. (9) THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 1A (RISK FACTORS) IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, AND IN PART I, ITEM 1A (RISK FACTORS) IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  . ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR TO WHAT EXTENT, ANY OF SUCH RISKS MAY BE REALIZED. WE ALSO CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES WHICH WE MIGHT FACE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT WE MAKE.  USE OF CONSTANT CURRENCY  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES STRENGTHEN, OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS STATED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE POSITIVELY IMPACTED.  AS EXCHANGE RATES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN UNDERSTANDING PERIOD TO PERIOD COMPARISONS, WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH RATES ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR REVENUE RESULTS AND EVALUATION OF OUR PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR PERIODS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION PRESENTED IS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS USING PRIOR PERIOD WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

HOLISTIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION APPROACH  . PURSUANT TO OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE TARGETED TO RETURN APPROXIMATELY 75-80% OF OUR ANNUAL CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND THROUGH DIVIDENDS.  WE  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HAVE ALSO ADOPTED A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO FUTURE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.  BY ADOPTING STRICT FINANCIAL CRITERIA FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, THESE ACQUISITIONS WILL ENABLE US TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDER RETURNS BY PROVIDING SCALE AND INCREASED CASH FLOWS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED A NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE TARGETING TO RETURN APPROXIMATELY 75-80% OF OUR ANNUAL CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND THROUGH DIVIDENDS.  TO THAT END, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED OUR TOTAL SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $250.0 MILLION. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THERE WAS  $75.0 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THIS CURRENT AUTHORIZATION. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, WE INTEND TO SUSPEND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019. WE EXPECT TO RESUME SHARE REPURCHASES IN FISCAL 2020, AT A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH OUR PUBLICLY STATED CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY.  ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN 11% INCREASE TO OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.14 TO $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  WE BEGAN PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OF $0.125 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK TO PROGRESS STOCKHOLDERS IN DECEMBER 2016 AND INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.14 PER SHARE IN SEPTEMBER 2017. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY. HOWEVER, WE MAY TERMINATE OR MODIFY THIS PROGRAM AT ANY TIME. ON MARCH 19, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK THAT WILL BE PAID ON JUNE 17, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JUNE 3, 2019.  ON MARCH 28, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT WITH IPSWITCH, INC. (\u201cIPSWITCH\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF IPSWITCH FOR $225 MILLION IN CASH. WE WILL FUND THE TRANSACTION WITH EXISTING CASH ON HAND AND FUNDS SECURED UNDER A NEW CREDIT FACILITY.  IPSWITCH WILL PROVIDE US WITH LEADING NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND SECURE DATA FILE TRANSFER CAPABILITIES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES AND ENTERPRISES.  FOUNDED IN 1991, IPSWITCH SERVES APPROXIMATELY 24,000 CUSTOMERS IN 170 COUNTRIES.  IPSWITCH HAS APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION IN REVENUE, OF WHICH 75% IS RECURRING.  IPSWITCH HAS BLUE-CHIP CUSTOMERS ACROSS ALL VERTICALS, INCLUDING FINANCE AND BANKING, HEALTHCARE, INSURANCE, RETAIL, GOVERNMENT AND BIOTECH.  THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE APRIL 2019, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY REGULATORY APPROVALS AND CONDITIONS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF IPSWITCH, WE INTEND TO SUSPEND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS DESIGNED TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS.  AS A RESULT, OUR EXPECTED USES OF CASH COULD CHANGE, OUR CASH POSITION COULD BE REDUCED AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT WE COMPLETE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR FORESEEABLE CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES TO PROGRESS STOCKHOLDERS, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY CONDUCTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE DID NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON REVENUE DURING FISCAL YEARS 2018 OR 2017, BUT SINCE APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF OUR REVENUE IS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, FUTURE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

THE DECREASE IN NORTH AMERICA WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN LICENSE REVENUE IN OUR DATA CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION SEGMENT, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE DECREASES IN OUR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT SEGMENT AND A DECLINE IN MAINTENANCE REVENUE IN OUR OPENEDGE SEGMENT. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN EMEA WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LICENSE REVENUE FROM OUR DATA CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION SEGMENT, OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. REVENUE IN LATIN AMERICA DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THE REVENUE GENERATED IN ASIA PACIFIC INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LICENSE REVENUE IN OUR OPENEDGE SEGMENT.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTAL REVENUE GENERATED IN MARKETS OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA REPRESENTED 48% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO 45% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

WE ALSO CONSOLIDATED OFFICES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS DURING FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES RELATED TO FACILITY CLOSURES AS PART OF THIS RESTRUCTURING ACTION THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2019, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO BE MATERIAL.  AS PART OF THIS FISCAL YEAR 2017 RESTRUCTURING, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF  $0.4 MILLION  , WHICH ARE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS SUBLIMITS FOR SWING LINE LOANS UP TO  $25.0 MILLION  AND FOR THE ISSUANCE OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT IN A FACE AMOUNT UP TO  $25.0 MILLION  . WE EXPECT TO USE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES, AND MAY ALSO USE IT FOR WORKING CAPITAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES ON  NOVEMBER 20, 2022  , WHEN ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT REQUIRE AMORTIZATION OF PRINCIPAL. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE TERM LOAN AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  $116.0 MILLION  , WITH  $7.0 MILLION  DUE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THE TERM LOAN REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT AMOUNTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE: (I) EIGHT PAYMENTS OF  $1.5 MILLION  EACH, (II) FOUR PAYMENTS OF  $2.3 MILLION  EACH, (III) FOUR PAYMENTS OF  $3.1 MILLION  EACH, (IV) THREE PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 MILLION  EACH, AND (V) THE LAST PAYMENT IS OF THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN THEREAFTER WOULD BE DUE ON THE MATURITY DATE. THE TERM LOAN MAY BE PREPAID BEFORE MATURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT OUR OPTION WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE TERM LOAN APPROXIMATES THE FAIR VALUE, BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS (OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES IN LESS THAN ACTIVE MARKETS), AS THE INTEREST RATE IS VARIABLE OVER THE SELECTED INTEREST PERIOD AND IS SIMILAR TO CURRENT RATES AT WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS. THE INTEREST RATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  4.00%.  REVOLVING LOANS MAY BE BORROWED, REPAID, AND REBORROWED UNTIL  NOVEMBER 20, 2022  , AT WHICH TIME ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING MUST BE REPAID. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THERE WERE  NO  AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE AND  $1.3 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING COVENANTS THAT LIMIT OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GRANT LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, MAKE ACQUISITIONS, INCUR INDEBTEDNESS, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, DISPOSE OF ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, REPURCHASE STOCK, CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND ENTER INTO BURDENSOME AGREEMENTS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS FOR A CREDIT FACILITY OF THIS SIZE AND TYPE. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, A CONSOLIDATED TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO AND A CONSOLIDATED SENIOR SECURED LEVERAGE RATIO. WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS)  FEBRUARY 28,  2019  FEBRUARY 28,  2018  NET INCOME  $9,402  $13,732  NON-CASH RECONCILING ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME  13,465  16,281  CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  1,577  1,582  NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $24,444  $31,595  THE DECREASE IN CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING INCOME.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CLINICAL  TRIALS UPDATE  PHASE 2B EXTENSION STUDY FOR HIV, AS MONOTHERAPY  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE A TOTAL OF SIX PATIENTS IN THIS ONGOING EXTENSION STUDY AND EACH HAS SURPASSED APPROXIMATELY 4.5 YEARS OF SUPPRESSED VIRAL  LOAD WITH LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) AS A SINGLE AGENT THERAPY. THESE PATIENTS ARE CONTINUING IN EXTENSION STUDIES OF THIS MONOTHERAPY TRIAL BY SELF-ADMINISTERING, SUBCUTANEOUS WEEKLY INJECTION OF LERONLIMAB.  PHASE 2B/3 PIVOTAL TRIAL FOR HIV, AS COMBINATION THERAPY  THIS IS A  PIVOTAL 25-WEEK TRIAL  FOR LERONLIMAB AS A COMBINATION THERAPY TO A HIGHLY ACTIVE  ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (\u201cHAART\u201d) DRUG REGIMENS. THIS TRIAL WAS A DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL. IN LATE FEBRUARY 2018, WE REPORTED THAT WE HAD ENROLLED 52 PATIENTS AND THE TRIAL\u2019S PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ACHIEVED WITH  A P-VALUE OF  0.0032. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR EFFICACY WAS DEFINED AS 0.5LOG REDUCTION IN VIRAL LOAD AFTER ONE WEEK OF THERAPY WITH LERONLIMAB IN COMBINATION WITH THE PATIENT\u2019S FAILING HAART REGIMEN.  FOLLOWING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRIMARY ENDPOINT, THE TRIAL IS CONTINUING TO ENROLL UNDER AN OPEN LABEL FOR SAFETY ANALYSIS. FORTY-SEVEN OUT OF  FIFTY-TWO  PATIENTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THIS TRIAL AND MOST  OF THE PATIENTS HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO AN EXTENSION STUDY, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CONTINUED ACCESS TO LERONLIMAB THERAPY, AT THE REQUEST OF THEIR TREATING PHYSICIAN. MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT THE TOTAL COSTS OF THIS TRIAL,  INCLUDING THE OPEN LABEL PORTION, MAY RANGE FROM $12 MILLION TO $14 MILLION. THE SUCCESSFUL RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OUR BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (\u201cBLA\u201d) FILING, OF WHICH, THE FIRST OF THREE SECTIONS WAS  FILED IN MARCH 2019.  EXTENSION STUDY FOR HIV, AS COMBINATION THERAPY  THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND FOR WHOM THE TREATING PHYSICIANS  REQUEST A CONTINUATION OF LERONLIMAB THERAPY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD. IF THIS STUDY ENROLLS 40 PATIENTS FROM THE PHASE 2B/3 TRIAL AND ALL PATIENTS REMAIN IN THE ROLLOVER STUDY FOR ONE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE COST OF THIS  STUDY TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION TO $4 MILLION.  PHASE 2B/3 INVESTIGATIVE TRIAL FOR HIV, AS LONG-TERM MONOTHERAPY  THIS IS A TRIAL OF OVER 370 PATIENTS THAT ASSESSES USING LERONLIMAB SUBCUTANEOUSLY AS A LONG-ACTING SINGLE-AGENT MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR 48  WEEKS IN PATIENTS WITH SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD  WITH CCR5-TROPIC HIV-1 INFECTION. THE  PRIMARY ENDPOINT IS THE PROPORTION OF PARTICIPANTS WITH A SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD TO THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED  VIROLOGIC FAILURE. THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT IS THE LENGTH OF TIME TO VIROLOGIC FAILURE. ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST SEVERAL PATIENTS WAS ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2016. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING TWO HIGHER-DOSE ARMS, ONE WITH 525 MG DOSE (A 50% INCREASE  FROM THE ORIGINAL DOSAGE OF 350 MG), AS WELL AS A 700 MG DOSE. WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT INTERIM DATA SUGGESTED THAT BOTH THE 525 MG AND THE 700 MG DOSAGES ARE ACHIEVING A RESPONDER RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  90% AFTER THE INITIAL 10 WEEKS. THE ESTIMATES FOR THE TOTAL COST OF THIS TRIAL CURRENTLY RANGE FROM $22 MILLION TO $25 MILLION, WITH AN EXPECTED $8 MILLION TO $9 MILLION  REMAINING IN CONNECTION WITH MAINTAINING PATIENTS TO PROVIDE SAFETY DATA FOR THE BLA FILING. WE EXPECT ENROLLMENT TO BE COMPLETED IN 2019. SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUATION OF A HIGH RESPONDERS\u2019 RATE FROM PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE 525 MG AND 700 MG  DOSE ARMS, THIS TRIAL MAY BE DISCONTINUED, IF AND WHEN WE SUCCESSFULLY FILE A PROTOCOL FOR A PIVOTAL PHASE 3 TRIAL FOR MONOTHERAPY AND INITIATE SUCH A TRIAL.  CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS FOR LERONLIMAB  WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR LERONLIMAB INVOLVING THE CCR5 RECEPTOR, OTHER THAN  HIV-RELATED  TREATMENTS, SUCH AS INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS, AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AND CANCER.  THE TARGET OF  LERONLIMAB IS THE IMPORTANT G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR CCR5. CCR5 IS MORE THAN THE PATHWAY TO HIV REPLICATION; IT IS ALSO A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES AND IS A KEY MEDIATOR IN MANY CANCER METASTASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS OPENS THE  POTENTIAL FOR MULTIPLE PIPELINE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LERONLIMAB. CCR5 IS A PROTEIN LOCATED ON THE SURFACE OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND CANCER EPITHELIAL CELLS THAT SERVES AS A RECEPTOR FOR ATTRACTANTS CALLED CHEMOKINES. CHEMOKINES ARE THE KEY ORCHESTRATORS  OF LEUKOCYTE TRAFFICKING BY ATTRACTING IMMUNE CELLS TO THE SITES OF INFLAMMATION.  AT THE SITE OF AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION, CHEMOKINES ARE  RELEASED. THESE CHEMOKINES ARE SPECIFIC FOR CCR5 AND CAUSE THE MIGRATION OF  T-CELLS  TO THESE SITES PROMOTING FURTHER INFLAMMATION. WE BELIEVE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF LERONLIMAB HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BLOCK  THE MOVEMENT OF  T-CELLS  TO INFLAMMATORY SITES, WHICH COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIMINISHING OR ELIMINATING INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. CCR5 IS ALSO EXPRESSED ON THE SURFACE OF EPITHELIAL CELLS IN CERTAIN CANCERS.  SOME DISEASE PROCESSES THAT WE BELIEVE COULD BENEFIT FROM CCR5 BLOCKADE INCLUDE MANY TYPES OF COMMON CANCERS, GVHD (A REACTION OCCURRING IN SOME PATIENTS AFTER BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION), AUTOIMMUNITY AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, SUCH AS RHEUMATOID  ARTHRITIS AND PSORIASIS. RECENT PUBLISHED DATA BY RICHARD G. PESTELL, M.D., PH.D., OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, HAS SHOWN THAT THE CANCER CELLS WITHIN THE TUMOR CONSIST OF TWO TYPES OF  CELLS-ONE  WITH CCR5 AND  OTHERS WITHOUT THEM. THE PUBLISHED DATA CLEARLY INDICATED THAT CANCER CELLS THAT CAN METASTASIZE  EXPRESS CCR5. METASTASES ARE THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CANCER PATIENTS. MOREOVER,  DR. PESTELL\u2019S PRIOR PUBLICATION INDICATES THAT CCR5 ANTAGONISTS CAN TURN OFF CERTAIN CALCIUM SIGNALING AND REDUCE THE MIGRATION OF CCR5 POSITIVE CANCER CELLS. INHIBITION OF CCR5 SIGNALING BLOCKS THE GUIDED MIGRATION AND REDUCES THE  METASTASIS. LERONLIMAB HAS DEMONSTRATED (IN AN  IN-VITRO  STUDY) THAT IT ALSO TURNS OFF CALCIUM SIGNALING AND BLOCKS BREAST CANCER CELLULAR INVASION. FURTHERMORE, PUBLISHED STUDIES SHOWED CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY  INDUCES CCR5, AND CCR5 ANTAGONISTS ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPIES, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING A REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY, WHICH MAY PROVIDE AN IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS.  DR. PESTELL\u2019S RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THREE KEY PROPERTIES OF THE CCR5\u2019S MECHANISM OF ACTION (MOA). THE FIRST IS THAT THE  CCR5 RECEPTOR ON CANCER CELLS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MIGRATION AND INVASION OF CELLS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM, WHICH LEADS TO METASTASIS OF BREAST, PROSTATE, AND COLON CANCER. THE SECOND IS THAT BLOCKING THE CCR5 ALSO TURNS ON ANTI-TUMOR FIGHTING  PROPERTIES RESTORING IMMUNE FUNCTION. THE THIRD KEY FINDING WAS THAT BLOCKAGE OF THE CCR5/CCL5 INTERACTION HAD A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT WITH CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC THERAPY AND CONTROLLED CANCER PROGRESSION. CHEMOTHERAPY TRADITIONALLY INCREASED EXPRESSION OF  CCR5 SO BLOCKING IT IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF INVASION AND METASTASIS.  DUE TO ITS MECHANISM OF ACTION, WE BELIEVE LERONLIMAB  HAS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER CCR5 ANTAGONISTS. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT LERONLIMAB DOES NOT CAUSE DIRECT ACTIVATION OF  T-CELLS.  WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED ENCOURAGING HUMAN SAFETY DATA FOR  OUR CLINICAL TRIALS WITH LERONLIMAB IN  HIV-INFECTED  PATIENTS.  WE ALSO PREVIOUSLY INITIATED OUR  FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL WITH LERONLIMAB IN AN IMMUNOLOGICAL INDICATION \u2013 A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL WITH LERONLIMAB FOR GVHD IN PATIENTS WITH AML OR MDS WHO ARE UNDERGOING BONE MARROW STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION. AS NOTED BELOW, ENROLLMENT UNDER THE  AMENDED PROTOCOL FOR THE GVHD TRIAL HAS BEEN DELAYED SUBJECT TO INCREASED CAPITAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INTEND TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF  FOLLOW-ON  TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVING THE USE OF LERONLIMAB ALONGSIDE THEIR EXISTING PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY  WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO COMPLETE THE FOREGOING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR HIV AND COMPLETE ITS BLA SUBMISSION, AS WELL AS TO ADVANCE ITS TRIALS FOR GVHD AND CERTAIN CANCER INDICATIONS. SEE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES\u201d BELOW.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL FOR TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER  WE RECENTLY RECEIVED CLEARANCE FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE \u201cFDA\u201d) FOR OUR IND SUBMISSION TO INITIATE A PHASE 1B/2  CLINICAL TRIAL FOR METASTATIC TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FIVE CLINICAL TRIAL SITES AND INTEND TO DOSE ITS FIRST SEVERAL PATIENTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF CALENDAR 2019. THE CHANGE IN CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS)  NUMBER WILL BE EVALUATED EVERY 21 DAYS DURING TREATMENT AND WILL BE USED AS AN INITIAL PROGNOSTIC MARKER FOR EFFICACY. UP TO 48 PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY.  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES FOR MULTIPLE CANCER INDICATIONS  THE COMPANY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INITIATING EIGHT  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES WITH LERONLIMAB FOR  MELANOMA, PANCREATIC, BREAST, PROSTATE COLON, LUNG, LIVER AND STOMACH CANCERS. AN ONGOING  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE COMPANY RECENTLY REPORTED THAT LERONLIMAB REDUCES BY MORE THAN 98% HUMAN BREAST  CANCER METASTASIS IN A MURINE XENOGRAFT MODEL. BASED UPON THESE STRONG RESULTS, THE COMPANY FILED FOR ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR ITS PHASE 1B/2 TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER TRIAL.  PHASE 2 TRIAL FOR GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE  THIS PHASE  2 MULTI-CENTER100-DAY  STUDY WITH 60 PATIENTS IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF  THE USE OF LERONLIMAB AS  AN ADD-ON THERAPY  TO STANDARD GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (\u201cGVHD\u201d) PROPHYLAXIS TREATMENT FOR PREVENTION OF ACUTE GVHD IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA  (\u201cAML\u201d) OR MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME (\u201cMDS\u201d) UNDERGOING ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (\u201cHST\u201d). ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT WAS ANNOUNCED IN MAY OF 2017. ON OCTOBER 5, 2017, THE COMPANY  ANNOUNCED THAT THE FDA HAD GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION TO LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) FOR THE PREVENTION OF GVHD. IN MARCH 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (\u201cIDMC\u201d) FOR LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) PHASE 2 TRIAL  IN GVHD HAD COMPLETED A PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS OF TRIAL DATA ON THE FIRST 10 PATIENTS ENROLLED. FOLLOWING THIS REVIEW OF DATA FROM THE FIRST 10 PATIENTS IN THE PHASE 2 TRIAL, THE COMPANY FILED AMENDMENTS TO THE PROTOCOL WITH THE FDA. THE  AMENDMENTS INCLUDED SWITCHING THE PRETREATMENT CONDITIONING REGIMEN FROM AGGRESSIVE MYELOABLATIVE (\u201cMA\u201d) CONDITIONING TO A REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (\u201cRIC\u201d), AND SWITCHING FROM A  BLINDED ONE-FOR-ONE RANDOMIZED  PLACEBO-CONTROLLED DESIGN TO AN OPEN-LABEL DESIGN UNDER WHICH ALL ENROLLEES RECEIVE LERONLIMAB. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR A 100% INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF  LERONLIMAB, TO 700 MG, TO MORE CLOSELY MIMIC PRECLINICAL DOSING. THE NEXT REVIEW OF DATA BY THE IDMC WILL OCCUR FOLLOWING ENROLLMENT OF 10 PATIENTS UNDER THE AMENDED PROTOCOL AFTER EACH PATIENT HAS BEEN DOSED FOR 30 DAYS. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE  COST OF THIS TRIAL TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.5 TO $4 MILLION. DUE TO THE NECESSARY PRIORITIZATION OF LIMITED CAPITAL, ENROLLMENT UNDER THE AMENDED PROTOCOL HAS BEEN DELAYED.  LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN OUR NOVEMBER 2018 ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE, LLC  (\u201cPROSTAGENE\u201d), INCLUDING POTENTIAL LICENSING OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO MONETIZE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS RELATING TO PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSTICS. AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE, WE ACQUIRED A PROPRIETARY  TECHNOLOGY THAT DEMONSTRATED IN A RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL ASSESSING PATIENTS FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS THAT ITS PROSTATE CANCER PROGNOSTIC TEST (\u201cPCA TEST\u201d) PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIVE DISCRIMINATIVE VALUE FOR PREDICTING OUTCOMES OF  PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER COMPARED TO THE INTERMEDIATE GLEASON SCORE, THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS. THE CLINICAL OBJECTIVE IS TO MORE PRECISELY GUIDE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR MEN THEREBY AVOIDING UNNECESSARY  SURGERY (PROSTATECTOMY) AND RADIATION AND/OR CHEMOTHERAPY WITH ITS ATTENDANT SIDE EFFECTS.  IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO CONDUCT  EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN A LICENSING ARRANGEMENT FOR LERONLIMAB FOR HIV INDICATIONS; SUCH PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS ARE COUNTRY OR REGION SPECIFIC.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD NO ACTIVITIES THAT PRODUCED REVENUES FROM  OPERATIONS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.6 MILLION, AS  COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $18.0 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.3 MILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO REDUCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION  AND A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION, COUPLED WITH A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT IN THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION. THESE FAVORABLE TRENDS WERE  OFFSET IN PART BY AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION. THE LOSS PER SHARE FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND  FEBRUARY 28, 2018 WAS $(0.04) AND $(0.10), WHICH REFLECTS A COMPARATIVELY LOWER NET LOSS COMBINED WITH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, OPERATING EXPENSES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION AND  $14.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND AMORTIZATION AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEPRECIATION. THE REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION, OR 8.9%, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.1 MILLION, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $3.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WERE COMPRISED OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS,  NON-CASH  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE AND VARIOUS OTHER EXPENSES.  THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION, OR 69%, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR NEW EMPLOYEES, AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  FOR ACCELERATION OF VESTING AND STOCK AWARDS RELATED TO AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, COUPLED WITH INCREASES IN OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. . THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION, OR 465% WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN  INTANGIBLES RECOGNIZED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED  APPROXIMATELY $9.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION, OR 25.3%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018 QUARTER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO NEAR COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED EXPENSES IN  CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR BLA FILING. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, R&D EXPENDITURES CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO: (1) INCREASED CMC (CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS) ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BLA FILING AND LERONLIMAB, (2) OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE PHASE 2B/3 MONOTHERAPY TRIAL, AND (3) CONTINUING ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE BLA  FILING WITH THE FDA.  WE EXPECT R&D EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS TO LEVEL OFF MODESTLY TO REFLECT COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES  IN CONNECTION WITH THE CMC PORTION OF OUR BLA FILING IN  MID-2019,  FOLLOWED BY A POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ADVANCEMENT IN CLINICAL PRIORITIES FOR A PIVOTAL MONOTHERAPY TRIAL AND EVALUATION OF SEVERAL CANCER  INDICATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. ANY ACCELERATION IN CLINICAL ACTIVITIES WOULD INCREASE R&D EXPENSES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT  ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO A  NON-CASH  CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.7 IN THE SIMILAR 2018 QUARTER. THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 ALSO INCLUDES TWO INCREMENTAL DERIVATIVES RELATING TO NEWLY ISSUED LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THAT REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION AND ARE NOT COMPARABLE  TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018. THE WARRANTS THAT CONTAIN A PROVISION WHICH GIVES RISE TO A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY ORIGINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE TWO LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION FOR REDEMPTION AT A VARIABLE PRICE AND ORIGINATED IN  JUNE 2018 AND JANUARY 2019. FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND RECORD A CORRESPONDING  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OR  NON-CASH  CHARGE, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A DECREASE OR INCREASE, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CALCULATED DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR QUARTER IN 2018. THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDE INDUCEMENT INTEREST RELATED TO CONVERTIBLE  DEBT, ACCRUED INTEREST ON CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND OFFERING COSTS.  THE FUTURE TRENDS IN ALL  EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE OUTCOMES OF  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AS WELL AS GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL. SEE IN PARTICULAR, \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES\u201d BELOW AND ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR  THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2018 AND IN OUR FORM  10-Q  FOR THE  QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 1A.  RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28,  2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD NO ACTIVITIES THAT PRODUCED REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $41.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $40.5 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION OVER THE 2018 NINE-MONTH  PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $7.3 MILLION INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, OFFSET IN PART BY AN APPROXIMATE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF $2.6 MILLION, RECOGNITION OF A $2.8 MILLION DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFIT AND  COMPARATIVE INCREASE IN A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OF THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $7.3 MILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018  PERIOD, DUE TO INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION, INCREASED R&D EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION. THE CREDIT FOR TAXES ON  INCOME AROSE FROM THE RECOGNITION OF A DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM A REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM RECORDING A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE  ACQUISITION OF ASSETS IN THE PROSTAGENE LLC  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTION. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY REPRESENTS THE TAX EFFECT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND THEIR TAX BASIS AT ACQUISITION. THE LOSS PER SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 WAS $(0.16) AND $(0.25), RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE REDUCTION IN LOSS PER SHARE (DESPITE A SMALL INCREASE IN AGGREGATE NET LOSS) CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING  FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, OPERATING EXPENSES TOTALED  APPROXIMATELY $42.0 MILLION AND $34.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY  $7.3 MILLION, OR 21.7%, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $8.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WERE COMPRISED OF SALARIES AND  BENEFITS, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE AND VARIOUS OTHER EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION, OR 55.3%, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN  NON-CASH  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH COMMON STOCK ISSUED RELATED TO AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AWARDS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $33.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION, OR 13.6%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018 PERIOD PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURING RELATED TO OUR BLA FILING, AND CONTINUING CLINICAL TRIAL ELATED EXPENSES. FOR THE  NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, R&D EXPENDITURES CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO: (1) INCREASED CMC (CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS) ACTIVITIES TO SATISFY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BLA FILING,  (2) OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE PHASE 2B/3 MONOTHERAPY TRIAL, AND (3) CONTINUING ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE BLA FILING WITH THE FDA.  WE EXPECT R&D EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS TO LEVEL OFF MODESTLY TO REFLECT COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH BLA  FILING  MID-2019  FOLLOWED BY A POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ADVANCEMENT IN CLINICAL PRIORITIES FOR A PIVOTAL MONOTHERAPY TRIAL AND EVALUATION OF SEVERAL CANCER INDICATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY  OF SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. ANY ACCELERATION IN CLINICAL ACTIVITIES WOULD INCREASE R&D EXPENSES.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED  A NON-CASH BENEFIT  ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO  A NON-CASH CHARGE  OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 IN THE SIMILAR 2018 PERIOD. THE WARRANTS THAT CONTAIN A PROVISION WHICH GIVES RISE TO A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY ORIGINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE TWO LONG-TERM  CONVERTIBLE NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION FOR REDEMPTION AT A VARIABLE PRICE AND ORIGINATED IN JUNE 2018 AND JANUARY 2019. FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND RECORD A CORRESPONDING  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OR  NON-CASH  CHARGE, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A DECREASE OR INCREASE, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CALCULATED DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $5.5 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDE A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF A LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE, ACCRUED INTEREST ON A CONVERTIBLE NOTE, INDUCEMENT INTEREST RELATED TO WARRANT EXERCISE AND  CONVERTIBLE DEBT, ALONG WITH THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND DEBT ISSUANCE. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2018, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY AMENDED ONE LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE TO INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS THE HOLDER TO  RECEIVE THE REDEMPTION AMOUNT AT THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTION (A) IN CASH OR (B) BY CONVERTING THE REDEMPTION AMOUNT INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE AMENDMENT CAUSED THE EMBEDDED REDEMPTION PROVISION TO REQUIRE BIFURCATION AS A LIABILITY  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 815 (ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815). IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE AMENDMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASC 470, DEBT (TOPIC 470), AND DETERMINED  THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND EXTINGUISHMENT ACCOUNTING APPLIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL DEBT ON THE MODIFICATION DATE IS DERECOGNIZED AND THE NEW DEBT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE DIFFERENCE WAS RECORDED AS AN  EXTINGUISHMENT LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION.  THE FUTURE TRENDS IN ALL EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE  OUTCOMES OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND  OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL. SEE IN PARTICULAR, \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d BELOW AND ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR  THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2018 AND IN OUR FORM  10-Q  FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK  FACTORS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 1A.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION, AS  COMPARED TO A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2018. THE NET INCREASE IN CASH FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $41.3 MILLION, OFFSET IN PART BY CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.0 MILLION.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28,  2019, THE COMPANY HAD SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $17.8 MILLION COMPARED TO NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $13.4 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2018, AN INCREASE IN NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $4.4 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO CASH USED IN OPERATIONS.  CASH FLOWS  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $41.0 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WHICH  REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION, INCREASED STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION, A  NON-CASH  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION, DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 MILLION DUE TO CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES, INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION, MITIGATED IN PART BY A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION, AND A REDUCTION IN  INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND  NON-CASH  DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS IMMATERIAL DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AND THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.3 MILLION DURING THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $15.2 MILLION OVER THE $26.1 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY $26.4 MILLION, COUPLED WITH APPROXIMATELY $14.9 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED REVENUE TO DATE, AND WILL NOT GENERATE PRODUCT REVENUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH REVENUES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE  REALIZED FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BLA. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES AS EXPENSES CONTINUE AS WE PROCEED WITH CLINICAL TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO LERONLIMAB AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IT THROUGH THE REGULATORY  PROCESS TOWARDS ULTIMATE APPROVAL, CONCURRENT WITH EVALUATING MULTIPLE CANCER INDICATIONS. THE FUTURE TRENDS OF ALL EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE OUTCOMES OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ALONG WITH THE INCREASING ACTIVITIES TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING TWO PORTIONS OF OUR BLA FILING FOR LERONLIMAB AS A COMBINATION THERAPY AND WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO COMPLETE  THESE ENDEAVORS.  CONTRACT MANUFACTURING  SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END, ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT AND PRODUCT SPECIFIC AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG  BIOLOGICS CO., LTD. (\u201cSAMSUNG\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH SAMSUNG WILL PERFORM TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, PROCESS VALIDATION, MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY SERVICES FOR THE COMMERCIAL SUPPLY OF LERONLIMAB. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE OBLIGATED  TO MAKE SPECIFIED MINIMUM PURCHASES OF LERONLIMAB FROM SAMSUNG PURSUANT TO OUR FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRST FORECAST WILL BE DELIVERED TO SAMSUNG BY MARCH 31, 2020. WE MUST PROVIDE SAMSUNG WITH A ROLLING FORECAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS  SETTING FORTH THE TOTAL QUANTITY THAT IT EXPECTS TO REQUIRE IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS. WE ESTIMATE THAT INITIAL  RAMP-UP  COSTS TO MANUFACTURE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AT SCALE COULD AGGREGATE APPROXIMATELY  $60 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION PAYABLE OVER THE COURSE OF CALENDAR 2020 AND APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION MORE PAYABLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021. THEREAFTER, WE WILL PAY SAMSUNG PER 15,000L BATCH ACCORDING TO THE PRICING  TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT.  THE AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG HAS AN INITIAL TERM ENDING IN DECEMBER 2027 AND SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY  EXTENDED FOR ADDITIONAL TWO YEAR PERIODS UNLESS EITHER PARTY GIVES NOTICE OF TERMINATION AT LEAST SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE THEN CURRENT TERM. EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF THE OTHER PARTY\u2019S INSOLVENCY OR UNCURED  MATERIAL BREACH, AND WE MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF A VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY COMPLETE MARKET WITHDRAWAL OF LERONLIMAB FROM COMMERCIAL MARKETS, WITH ONE AND HALF YEAR\u2019S PRIOR NOTICE. NEITHER PARTY MAY ASSIGN THE AGREEMENT  WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER, EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF A PARTY TO WHICH THE AGREEMENT RELATES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION TO OUR MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG, WE ALSO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED  INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH ANOTHER THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER TO PROVIDE PROCESS TRANSFER, VALIDATION AND MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR LERONLIMAB. IN THE EVENT THAT WE TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT WITH THIS MANUFACTURER, WE MAY INCUR CERTAIN FINANCIAL  PENALTIES WHICH WOULD BECOME PAYABLE TO THE MANUFACTURER. CONDITIONED ON THE TIMING OF TERMINATION, THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE UP TO AN APPROXIMATE HIGH OF $0.3 MILLION. THESE UNDERTAKINGS ARE ANTICIPATED TO REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY  $5 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OVER THE NEXT  S  EVERAL FISCAL QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FILL, LABEL, AND PACKAGE PRODUCT INTO THE FINAL COMMERCIAL PACKAGE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT TWO CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS MAY BEST SERVE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR THE ANTICIPATED BLA FILING AND, IF APPROVED,  THE LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES FOR LERONLIMAB. MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AS NEW MARKET INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE REGARDING ANTICIPATED DEMAND, SUBJECT TO FDA APPROVAL.  CONTRACT RESEARCH  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO  PROJECT WORK ORDERS FOR EACH OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS WITH OUR CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (\u201cCRO\u201d) AND RELATED LABORATORY VENDORS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS, WE HAVE PREPAID CERTAIN EXECUTION FEES FOR DIRECT SERVICES COSTS. IN  CONNECTION WITH OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE PROJECT WORK ORDERS FOR EACH TRIAL WITH OUR CRO. IN THE EVENT THAT WE TERMINATE ANY TRIAL, WE MAY INCUR CERTAIN FINANCIAL PENALTIES WHICH WOULD BECOME PAYABLE TO THE CRO. CONDITIONED  UPON THE FORM OF TERMINATION OF ANY ONE TRIAL, THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE UP TO $0.3 MILLION. IN THE REMOTE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE TERMINATE ALL CLINICAL TRIALS, THE COLLECTIVE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE FROM AN APPROXIMATE LOW OF  $0.5 MILLION TO AN APPROXIMATE HIGH OF $1.2 MILLION.  LICENSING  UNDER THE PROGENICS PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY PROGENICS THE FOLLOWING ONGOING MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES.  (I) $5.0 MILLION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST U.S. NEW DRUG APPLICATION APPROVAL BY THE FDA OR  OTHER NON-U.S. APPROVAL  FOR THE SALE OF LERONLIMAB (PRO 140); AND (II) ROYALTY PAYMENTS OF UP  TO FIVE PERCENT (5%) ON NET SALES DURING THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE OF THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE OF LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) UNTIL THE LATER OF (A) THE EXPIRATION OF THE LAST TO EXPIRE PATENT INCLUDED IN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, AND (B) 10  YEARS, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED ON  A COUNTRY-BY COUNTRY  BASIS. IN ADDITION, UNDER A DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSE AGREEMENT, DATED APRIL 30, 1999 (THE \u201cPDL LICENSE\u201d), BETWEEN PROTEIN DESIGN  LABS (NOW ABBVIE INC.) AND PROGENICS, WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO US, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY ABBVIE INC. ADDITIONAL MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES AS FOLLOWS: (I) $0.5 MILLION UPON FILING A BLA WITH THE FDA  OR NON-U.S. EQUIVALENT  REGULATORY BODY; (II) $0.5 MILLION UPON FDA APPROVAL OR APPROVAL BY  ANOTHER NON-U.S.  EQUIVALENT REGULATORY BODY; AND  (III) ROYALTIES OF UP TO 3.5% OF NET SALES FOR THE LONGER OF 10 YEARS AND THE DATE OF EXPIRATION OF THE LAST TO EXPIRE LICENSED PATENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE PDL LICENSE PROVIDES FOR AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE OF $150,000 UNTIL ROYALTIES PAID EXCEED  THAT AMOUNT.  AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WHILE WE HAVE COMPLETED AND FILED THE FIRST OF THREE PORTIONS OF OUR BLA, IT REMAINS  UNCERTAIN AS TO WHEN THE REMAINING TWO PORTIONS WILL BE FILED AND WHEN THE BLA IS ACCEPTED BY THE FDA, IT IS MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONCLUSION THAT THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVING THE SUBSEQUENT FUTURE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY MILESTONES IS NOT  REASONABLY DETERMINABLE, THUS THE FUTURE MILESTONE PAYMENTS PAYABLE TO PROGENICS AND  ITS SUB-LICENSORS ARE  DEEMED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AND, THEREFORE, ARE NOT CURRENTLY ACCRUABLE.  GOING CONCERN  AS  REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, WE INCURRED NET LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.3 MILLION AND $40.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE NO  ACTIVITIES THAT PRODUCED REVENUE IN THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND HAVE SUSTAINED OPERATING LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION.  WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE AND  WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATIONS, PAY OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLES, AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, COMMERCIALIZE OUR  PRODUCT AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RAISE SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON A TIMELY BASIS OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, WE MAY NEED TO SCALE BACK OUR OPERATIONS OR SLOW DOWN OR CEASE CERTAIN CLINICAL TRIALS OR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, WHICH  COULD MATERIALLY DELAY THE TIMEFRAME TO BLA SUBMISSION. OUR FAILURE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY VENDORS, DISRUPTING OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. IN EXTREME CASES, WE COULD BE FORCED TO  FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, DISCONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS.  SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR ACTIVITIES  PRINCIPALLY FROM THE SALE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND RELATED PARTY NOTES PAYABLE. WE INTEND TO FINANCE OUR FUTURE OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS LARGELY FROM THE SALE  OF EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, COMBINED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM OTHER TRADITIONAL FINANCING SOURCES. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS FILING, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 70 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED AND AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER OUR  CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, AND APPROXIMATELY $153.2 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE REGISTERED OFFERINGS OF SECURITIES UNDER OUR UNIVERSAL SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON  FORM S-3, WHICH  WAS DECLARED EFFECTIVE ON MARCH 9, 2018 (ASSUMING THE FULL EXERCISE OF OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, AT THE CURRENTLY APPLICABLE EXERCISE PRICES, THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED IN  REGISTERED TRANSACTIONS THEREUNDER).  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY RESULT IN  DILUTION TO STOCKHOLDERS AND THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF COMMON SHARES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK, CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING, THESE ACTIVITIES OR OTHER DEBT  COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS COULD REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED NEEDS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, IF  AVAILABLE, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE  OR NON-DILUTIVE TERMS.  PLEASE REFER TO THE MATTERS DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d ABOVE.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS  AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. WE HAVE INCURRED LOSSES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED AND HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL ACCUMULATED DEFICIT. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THESE FACTORS, AMONG SEVERAL OTHERS, RAISE SUBSTANTIAL  DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO  THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR CONTINUATION AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL OPERATING  CAPITAL, COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE, OBTAIN FDA APPROVAL, OUTSOURCE MANUFACTURING OF OUR PRODUCT, AND ULTIMATELY TO ATTAIN PROFITABILITY. WE INTEND TO SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT OFFERINGS, LICENSING AGREEMENTS  OR STRATEGIC ALLIANCES TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN THESE ENDEAVORS.

THE RECENT SECOND DEFERRAL OF THE POTENTIAL 25% TARIFF RATE ON GOODS IMPORTED BY THE COMPANY AND ITS SUPPLIERS FROM CHINA APPEAR TO HAVE REDUCED NEAR-TERM TARIFF PRESSURES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS PROFIT OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVES AND JANUARY 2019 PRICE INCREASE WILL FULLY OFFSET THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA. FURTHER CONTINGENCY PLANS IN THE AREA OF STRATEGIC SOURCING ARE BEING EVALUATED SHOULD THE TARIFF SITUATION INTENSIFY.

DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  , NET OTHER EXPENSE WAS  $7.8 MILLION  ,  A DECREASE  OF  $1.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS DECREASE RESULTED MAINLY FROM LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUTSTANDING DEBT AND LOWER NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS, OFFSET BY LOWER INVESTMENT GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN IN THE CURRENT YEAR RELATIVE TO THOSE RECORDED IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  INCOME TAXES  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE UNITED STATES. THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT INCLUDED THE REDUCTION OF THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% AND A NEW PARTICIPATION EXEMPTION SYSTEM OF TAXATION ON FOREIGN EARNINGS, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS.  THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SAB 118.

THE YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  WAS THE RESULT OF THE ACT. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  AND  MARCH 3, 2018  IS LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE DUE TO THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD RATES THAT WERE LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, ALONG WITH THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT UNDER THE PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM TAX HIKES (\"PATH\") ACT OF 2015.

SALES  GREYSTONE\u2019S  PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY PLASTIC PALLETS TO ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO BROADEN  ITS CUSTOMER BASE. GREYSTONE\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS. GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING IS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONTRACT DISTRIBUTORS, ITS PRESIDENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.

THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES GROWTH WITH A PALLET LEASING COMPANY, ONE OF GREYSTONE\u2019S  MAJOR CUSTOMERS.  GREYSTONE  HAS THREE MAJOR CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 85% AND 76% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

GREYSTONE IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH  THE ADDITION OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.

THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON PRODUCTION  AND MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. FACTORS AFFECTING  THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES INCLUDE: START-UP COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH; CERTAIN NEWER PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE;  AND GREYSTONE\u2019S REQUIREMENT FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN HAS EXCEEDED ITS CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING MATERIAL RESULTING  IN PURCHASES OF GROUND AND PELLETIZED MATERIAL AT A HIGHER COST THAN IN-HOUSE PROCESSED MATERIAL.  14  MACHINERY  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING PLASTIC RESIN WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE THIRD  QUARTER OF FY2019, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO APRIL 2019.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL  YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $7,728 AND $5,867 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOURCE OF OTHER INCOME IS THE SALE OF SCRAP MATERIAL.

THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEBT AND CAPITALIZED LEASES AND A 1.00% INCREASE  IN THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

TOTAL  LESS  THAN  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  4-5 YEARS  MORE  THAN  5 YEARS  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES  $30,307,827  $4,909,286  $18,610,958  $6,787,583  $-0-  GREYSTONE  HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $(3,230,345) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019. TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNDING TO MEET GREYSTONE\u2019S OPERATING  ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, GREYSTONE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE OPERATING  RESULTS OR EXPLORE VARIOUS OPTIONS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT  GREYSTONE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS OR BE ABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS.  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 10, 2018 AND DECEMBER 28, 2018, GREYSTONE AND IBC ENTERED INTO THE AMENDMENTS TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT DATED JANUARY 31,  2014 WHICH PROVIDED FOR NEW FUNDING IN THE FORM OF AN ADVANCING LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,600,000 TO PURCHASE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT  AND INCREASING THE LINE OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN TO $4,000,000, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019,  PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $4.7 MILLION WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH A CAPITAL LEASING ARRANGEMENT.  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF THE FINANCING THAT GREYSTONE HAS RECEIVED THROUGH THE LAST FEW FISCAL YEARS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM BANK NOTES WHICH ARE  GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF GREYSTONE AND, FORMERLY, FROM LOANS PROVIDED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS  OF GREYSTONE. GREYSTONE CONTINUES TO BE DEPENDENT UPON ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO PROVIDE AND/OR SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING  AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUNDING  WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR GREYSTONE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.  GREYSTONE  HAS 50,000 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CUMULATIVE 2003 PREFERRED STOCK WITH A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $5,000,000 AND A PREFERRED DIVIDEND  RATE OF THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST PLUS 3.25%. GREYSTONE DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL MAKE CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ANY HOLDERS  OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNLESS AND UNTIL THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GREYSTONE IMPROVES THROUGH INCREASED REVENUES, ANOTHER FINANCING  TRANSACTION OR OTHERWISE. PURSUANT TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  GREYSTONE MAY PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS PREFERRED STOCK IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $500,000 PER YEAR.

IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT WILL REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PRESENT ASSETS HELD AT AMORTIZED COST AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES NET OF THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES TO BE BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM PAST EVENTS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS THAT AFFECT COLLECTIBILITY. THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDANCE REQUIRE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION. THIS GUIDANCE DOES NOT APPLY TO RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM OPERATING LEASES. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS LEASE REVENUE (SUCH REVENUE REPRESENTED  78  PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING WHETHER WE WILL EARLY ADOPT THIS GUIDANCE, AND THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHILE LIMITED TO OUR NON-OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES, IS NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE, AS IT WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR FORECAST EXPECTATIONS UPON, AND FOLLOWING, ADOPTION.  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  . IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THE SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. PRIOR GUIDANCE REQUIRED UTILIZING A TWO-STEP PROCESS TO REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. A SECOND STEP WAS REQUIRED IF THERE WAS AN INDICATION THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, AND THE SECOND STEP REQUIRED CALCULATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL (AS IF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING WERE PERFORMED ON THE TESTING DATE) WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE GOODWILL. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE SECOND STEP FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD PERFORM ITS ANNUAL, OR INTERIM, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND THEN RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE (ALTHOUGH THE LOSS SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT). THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION AND WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL OR INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS PERMITTED FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED ON TESTING DATES AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING WHETHER WE WILL EARLY ADOPT. THE GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  GUIDANCE ADOPTED IN 2019  LEASES  . SEE NOTE  8  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR LEASE ACCOUNTING FOLLOWING OUR ADOPTION OF AN UPDATED FASB LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING  . IN 2019, WE PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED GUIDANCE INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER PORTRAY THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF AN ENTITY\u2019S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS ADDITIONALLY INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND NO LONGER REQUIRES SEPARATE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS. FOR CASH FLOW AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES EXISTING AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO APPLY A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO ELIMINATING THE SEPARATE MEASUREMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. OUR USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS LIMITED, AND WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. GIVEN OUR LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  2.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN MAY 2014, AND IN SUBSEQUENT UPDATES, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 606\") TO CLARIFY THE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 606 ON JANUARY 1, 2018. TOPIC 606 INCLUDES THE REQUIRED STEPS TO ACHIEVE THE CORE PRINCIPLE THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 842\"), AS EXPLAINED FURTHER IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019. TOPIC 842 IS AN UPDATE TO TOPIC 840, WHICH WAS THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN PLACE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS REFLECTED BELOW, MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 (TOPIC 840 FOR 2018). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: 1) TOPIC 606 AND 2) TOPIC 842. UNDER TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER, AND EXCLUDES ANY SALES INCENTIVES AND AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER, AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER TOPIC 606. AS REFLECTED BELOW, MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  NATURE OF GOODS AND SERVICES  IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, REVENUE IS SUMMARIZED BY TYPE AND BY THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  TOPIC 842  TOPIC 606  TOTAL  TOPIC 840  TOPIC 606  TOTAL  REVENUES.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN OUR GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT AND IN THE U.S. (FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2019  ,  81  PERCENT AND  91  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY). WE BELIEVE THAT THE DISAGGREGATION OF OUR REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS TO CUSTOMERS AS REFLECTED ABOVE, COUPLED WITH THE FURTHER DISCUSSION BELOW AND THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET DISCLOSURES IN NOTES  4  AND  11  , DEPICTS HOW THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF OUR REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC FACTORS.  LEASE REVENUES (TOPIC 842)  THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TYPES OF REVENUE THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 IS DISCUSSED BELOW.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENT OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT REVENUE TYPE (THEY ACCOUNTED FOR  72  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ) AND ARE GOVERNED BY OUR STANDARD RENTAL CONTRACT. WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH RENTALS AS OPERATING LEASES. THE LEASE TERMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONTRACTS, AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS. OUR LEASE REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE PAYMENTS.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENT REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT THAT WE OWN. WE DO NOT GENERALLY PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR THE LESSEE TO PURCHASE THE RENTED EQUIPMENT AT THE END OF THE LEASE, AND DO NOT GENERATE MATERIAL REVENUE FROM SALES OF EQUIPMENT UNDER SUCH OPTIONS.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. OUR RENTAL CONTRACT PERIODS ARE HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, IF A CUSTOMER WERE TO RENT A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY RENTAL RATES FOR THAT PARTICULAR PIECE WERE (IN ACTUAL DOLLARS) $100, $300 AND $900, RESPECTIVELY, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE OF $32.14 PER DAY. THE DAILY RATE FOR RECOGNITION PURPOSES IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MONTHLY RATE OF $900 BY THE MONTHLY TERM OF 28 DAYS. THIS DAILY RATE ASSUMES THAT THE EQUIPMENT WILL BE ON RENT FOR THE FULL 28 DAYS, AS WE ARE UNSURE OF WHEN THE CUSTOMER WILL RETURN THE EQUIPMENT AND THEREFORE UNSURE OF WHICH RENTAL CONTRACT PERIOD WILL APPLY.  AS PART OF THIS STRAIGHT-LINE METHODOLOGY, WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED, WE RECOGNIZE AS INCREMENTAL REVENUE THE EXCESS, IF ANY, BETWEEN THE AMOUNT THE CUSTOMER IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY, WHICH IS BASED ON THE RENTAL CONTRACT PERIOD APPLICABLE TO THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DAYS THE EQUIPMENT WAS OUT ON RENT, OVER THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED TO DATE. IN ANY GIVEN ACCOUNTING PERIOD, WE WILL HAVE CUSTOMERS RETURN EQUIPMENT AND BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY US MORE THAN THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED TO DATE UNDER THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHODOLOGY. FOR INSTANCE, CONTINUING THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, IF THE CUSTOMER RENTED THE ABOVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ON DECEMBER 29 AND RETURNED IT AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 1, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE INCREMENTAL REVENUE ON JANUARY 1 OF $171.44 (IN ACTUAL DOLLARS, REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT THE CUSTOMER IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY, OR $300 AT THE WEEKLY RATE, AND THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED TO DATE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, OR $128.56, WHICH REPRESENTS FOUR DAYS AT $32.14 PER DAY).  WE RECORD AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCESS OF RECOGNIZABLE REVENUE AS DEFERRED REVENUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. WE HAD DEFERRED REVENUE (ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH TOPIC 842/840 AND TOPIC 606) OF  $54  AND  $56  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS NOTED ABOVE, WE ARE UNSURE OF WHEN THE CUSTOMER WILL RETURN RENTED EQUIPMENT. AS SUCH, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THE CUSTOMER WILL OWE US UPON RETURN OF THE EQUIPMENT AND CANNOT PROVIDE A MATURITY ANALYSIS OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR EQUIPMENT IS GENERALLY RENTED FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. LESSEES DO NOT PROVIDE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON RENTED EQUIPMENT.  WE EXPECT TO DERIVE SIGNIFICANT FUTURE BENEFITS FROM OUR EQUIPMENT FOLLOWING THE END OF THE RENTAL TERM. OUR RENTALS ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND OUR EQUIPMENT IS TYPICALLY RENTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT WE OWN IT. WE ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT WHEN WE DISPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT.  RE-RENT REVENUE.  RE-RENT REVENUE REFLECTS REVENUES FROM EQUIPMENT THAT WE RENT FROM VENDORS AND THEN RENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH RENTALS AS SUBLEASES. THE ACCOUNTING FOR RE-RENT REVENUE IS THE SAME AS THE ACCOUNTING FOR OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  \u201cOTHER\u201d  EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF 1) RENTAL PROTECTION PLAN (OR \"RPP\") REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAMAGE WAIVER CUSTOMERS CAN PURCHASE WHEN THEY RENT OUR EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE, 2) ENVIRONMENTAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RENTAL OF EQUIPMENT, AND 3) CHARGES FOR RENTED EQUIPMENT THAT IS DAMAGED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TYPES OF REVENUE THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 IS DISCUSSED BELOW. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES UNDER TOPIC 606 ARE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME RATHER THAN OVER TIME.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DELIVERY AND PICK-UP.  DELIVERY AND PICK-UP REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RENTING EQUIPMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  \u201cOTHER\u201d  EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL BY OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED BY THE CUSTOMER (AND CONSUMPTION, IF ANY, CAN BE MEASURED).  SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, NEW EQUIPMENT AND CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES  ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY TO, OR PICK-UP BY, THE CUSTOMER AND WHEN COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.  SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUES  PRIMARILY REPRESENT REVENUES EARNED FROM PROVIDING REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FLEET (INCLUDING PARTS SALES). SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AS REFLECTED ABOVE, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 (SUCH REVENUE REPRESENTED  78  PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINING REVENUE THAT IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 ARE GENERALLY THE SAME CUSTOMERS THAT RENT OUR EQUIPMENT. WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AT THE CUSTOMER LEVEL. BECAUSE THE SAME CUSTOMERS GENERATE THE REVENUES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER BOTH TOPIC 606 AND TOPIC 842, THE DISCUSSIONS BELOW ON CREDIT RISK AND OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ADDRESS RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM REVENUES FROM BOTH TOPIC 606 AND TOPIC 842 (TOPIC 840 FOR 2018).  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECEIVABLES IS LIMITED BECAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CUSTOMERS MAKES UP OUR CUSTOMER BASE. OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  ONE  PERCENT  OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FULL YEARS. OUR CUSTOMER WITH THE LARGEST RECEIVABLE BALANCE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  ONE  PERCENT  OF TOTAL RECEIVABLES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK THROUGH CREDIT APPROVALS, CREDIT LIMITS AND OTHER MONITORING PROCEDURES.  OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF OUR RECEIVABLES THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE. OUR ESTIMATE COULD REQUIRE CHANGE BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY OR IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR ALLOWANCES. TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT HAVE CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR OR LESS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE BASED ON THE CRITERIA NECESSARY TO QUALIFY AS A DEDUCTION FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES. WRITE-OFFS OF SUCH RECEIVABLES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT APPROVAL BASED ON SPECIFIED DOLLAR THRESHOLDS. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WE RECOGNIZED TOTAL ADDITIONS, EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, TO OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF  $15  AND  $6  , RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY 1) AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE OR 2) AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  WE DO  NO  T HAVE MATERIAL CONTRACT ASSETS, OR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR MATERIAL CONTRACT LIABILITIES, ASSOCIATED WITH CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS DO NOT GENERALLY RESULT IN MATERIAL AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCESS OF RECOGNIZABLE REVENUE. WE DID  NO  T RECOGNIZE MATERIAL REVENUE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  2018  THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT LIABILITY BALANCE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIODS.  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  MOST OF OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME, RATHER THAN OVER TIME. ACCORDINGLY, IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE DO NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY SATISFIED) IN PREVIOUS PERIODS, AND THE AMOUNTS OF SUCH REVENUE RECOGNIZED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  NO  T MATERIAL. WE ALSO DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE MATERIAL REVENUE IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED) AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  PAYMENT TERMS  OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION. OUR PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF OUR CUSTOMER AND THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED. THE TIME BETWEEN INVOICING AND WHEN PAYMENT IS DUE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT GENERALLY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND CUSTOMER TYPES, WE REQUIRE PAYMENT BEFORE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS DO NOT GENERALLY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNS, REFUNDS OR WARRANTIES. SEE ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACT COSTS  WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE ANY ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER (FOR EXAMPLE, A SALES COMMISSION) THAT WE EXPECT TO RECOVER. MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME OR OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR OR LESS, AND WE USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT AS AN EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED IF THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF THE ASSET THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IS ONE YEAR OR LESS.  CONTRACT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  OUR REVENUES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 GENERALLY DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  \u2022  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS GENERALLY FIXED AND STATED ON OUR CONTRACTS;  \u2022  AS NOTED ABOVE, OUR CONTRACTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND ACCORDINGLY DO NOT GENERALLY REQUIRE ESTIMATES OF THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION;  \u2022  OUR REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, OR RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNS, REFUNDS OR WARRANTIES; AND  \u2022  MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS OF A POINT-IN-TIME AND THE TIMING OF THE SATISFACTION OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IS READILY DETERMINABLE. AS NOTED ABOVE, OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY TO, OR PICK-UP BY, THE CUSTOMER.  WE MONITOR AND REVIEW OUR ESTIMATED STANDALONE SELLING PRICES ON A REGULAR BASIS.  3.  ACQUISITIONS  BAKERCORP ACQUISITION  IN JULY 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP. BAKERCORP WAS A LEADING MULTINATIONAL PROVIDER OF TANK, PUMP, FILTRATION AND TRENCH SHORING RENTAL SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS. BAKERCORP HAD APPROXIMATELY  950  EMPLOYEES, AND ITS OPERATIONS WERE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, WHERE IT HAD  46  LOCATIONS. BAKERCORP ALSO HAD  11  LOCATIONS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. BAKERCORP HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $295  . THE ACQUISITION.  \u2022  AUGMENTED OUR BUNDLED SOLUTIONS FOR FLUID STORAGE, TRANSFER AND TREATMENT;  \u2022  EXPANDED OUR STRATEGIC ACCOUNT BASE; AND  \u2022  PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE REVENUE AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CROSS-SELLING TO OUR BROADER CUSTOMER BASE.  THE AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION PAID WAS APPROXIMATELY  $720  . THE ACQUISITION AND RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH DRAWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DURING THE ACQUISITION MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.

THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCLUDE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN \u201cMERGER RELATED COSTS\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FLEET HAVE BEEN MOVED BETWEEN URI LOCATIONS AND THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS, AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF BAKERCORP SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION ON OUR EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE IS PRIMARILY REFLECTED IN THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC OF  23.7  PERCENT FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . SUCH INCREASE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF VANDER HOLDING CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\u201cBLUELINE\u201d) DISCUSSED BELOW.  BLUELINE ACQUISITION  IN OCTOBER 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BLUELINE. BLUELINE WAS ONE OF THE  TEN  LARGEST EQUIPMENT RENTAL COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND SERVED CUSTOMERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS WITH A FOCUS ON MID-SIZED AND LOCAL ACCOUNTS. BLUELINE HAD  114  LOCATIONS AND OVER  1,700  EMPLOYEES BASED IN  25  U.S. STATES, CANADA AND PUERTO RICO. BLUELINE HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $786  . THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO.  \u2022  EXPAND OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL CAPACITY IN MANY OF THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA, INCLUDING BOTH U.S. COASTS, THE GULF SOUTH AND ONTARIO;  \u2022  PROVIDE A WELL-DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE WITH A BALANCED MIX OF COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL ACCOUNTS;  \u2022  ADD MORE MID-SIZED AND LOCAL ACCOUNTS TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE; AND  \u2022  PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE REVENUE AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CROSS-SELLING TO OUR BROADER CUSTOMER BASE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.

SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FLEET HAVE BEEN MOVED BETWEEN URI LOCATIONS AND THE ACQUIRED BLUELINE LOCATIONS, AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF BLUELINE SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE IMPACT OF THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION ON OUR EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE IS PRIMARILY REFLECTED IN THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC OF  23.7  PERCENT FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . SUCH INCREASE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP DISCUSSED ABOVE.

(2) COST OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT SALES WAS ADJUSTED FOR THE FAIR VALUE MARK-UPS OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT ACQUIRED IN THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION. BAKERCORP DID NOT HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT SALES, AND ACCORDINGLY NO ADJUSTMENT WAS REQUIRED FOR BAKERCORP.  (3) THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS WERE AMORTIZED.  (4) AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WE ISSUED DEBT TO FUND THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES IN OUR DEBT PORTFOLIO.  (5) HISTORIC INTEREST ON DEBT THAT IS NOT PART OF THE COMBINED ENTITY WAS ELIMINATED.  (6) WE EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE COSTS AND BRANCH CLOSURE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITIONS OVER A PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION DATES, WHICH, FOR THE PRO FORMA PRESENTATION, WAS JANUARY 1, 2018.

WE INCUR SEVERANCE COSTS AND BRANCH CLOSURE CHARGES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. WE ONLY INCLUDE SUCH COSTS THAT ARE PART OF A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM AS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. SINCE THE FIRST SUCH RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM WAS INITIATED IN 2008, WE HAVE COMPLETED  FOUR  RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS AND HAVE INCURRED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF  $323.  CLOSED RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS  OUR CLOSED RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS WERE INITIATED EITHER IN RECOGNITION OF A CHALLENGING ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OR FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE TOTAL LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSED RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS WAS  $15.  BAKERCORP/BLUELINE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE WERE IMMATERIAL.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE CATEGORIZED IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY.  LEVEL 1- INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2- OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES INCLUDE.  A)  QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS;  B)  QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS;  C)  INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY;  D)  INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BY CORRELATION OR OTHER MEANS.  IF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAS A SPECIFIED (CONTRACTUAL) TERM, THE LEVEL 2 INPUT MUST BE OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  LEVEL 3- INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE (I.E., SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY) AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASURE.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE TO SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND FINANCE/CAPITAL LEASES (THE CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH LEASES CHANGED UPON ADOPTION OF A NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD, AS EXPLAINED FURTHER IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) APPROXIMATED THEIR BOOK VALUES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

WE HAVE BORROWED THE FULL AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY IS REQUIRED TO BE REPAID IN QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT EQUAL TO  1.0  PERCENT PER ANNUM, WITH THE BALANCE DUE AT THE MATURITY OF THE FACILITY.

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $922  MILLION OF RECEIVABLES, NET OF APPLICABLE RESERVES AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS, IN THE COLLATERAL POOL.  (3)  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE ABL FACILITY WAS AMENDED, PRIMARILY TO INCREASE THE FACILITY SIZE TO  $3.75  BILLION  , EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE TO FEBRUARY 2024 AND MAKE A PORTION OF THE FACILITY AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING IN BRITISH POUNDS AND EUROS BY CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF URNA IN EUROPE.  (4)  URNA SEPARATELY ISSUED 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2017 AND IN SEPTEMBER 2017. FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCES, WE CONSUMMATED AN EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT TO WHICH MOST OF THE 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2017 WERE EXCHANGED FOR ADDITIONAL NOTES FUNGIBLE WITH THE 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN AUGUST 2017.  (5)  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019. UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD, THE LEASES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS CAPITAL LEASES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCE LEASES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNTING UPON THIS CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(CONTINUED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  (6)  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT PRIMARILY REFLECTS $881  OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY.  LOAN COVENANTS AND COMPLIANCE  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE SENIOR NOTES. ANY FAILURE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OR COVENANT OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONS.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY IS THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE ABL FACILITY, THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WILL ONLY APPLY IN THE FUTURE IF SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW  10  PERCENT  OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND BORROWING BASE COLLATERAL IN EXCESS OF THE ABL FACILITY SIZE MAY BE INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY EXCEEDED THE REQUIRED THRESHOLD AND, AS A RESULT, THIS FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT WAS INAPPLICABLE. UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL TESTS RELATING TO: (I) THE DEFAULT RATIO, (II) THE DELINQUENCY RATIO, (III) THE DILUTION RATIO AND (IV) DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING. THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, TO THE EXTENT THE RATIO IS APPLICABLE UNDER THE ABL FACILITY.  8.  LEASES  ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842, \u201cLEASES\u201d  IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 842\") TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY REQUIRING (1) RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND (2) DISCLOSURE OF KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME CHANGES TO THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WERE MADE TO ALIGN BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WITH CERTAIN CHANGES MADE TO THE LESSEE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND (2) KEY ASPECTS OF THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING MODEL WITH REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 AT THE REQUIRED ADOPTION DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2019, USING THE TRANSITION METHOD THAT ALLOWED US TO INITIALLY APPLY TOPIC 842 AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 AND RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. WE USED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWED US TO NOT REASSESS: (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AND (3) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES. WE ADDITIONALLY USED, FOR OUR REAL ESTATE OPERATING LEASES, THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT THAT ALLOWS LESSEES TO TREAT THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS OF LEASES AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE A MATERIAL ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION METHOD WE USED TO ADOPT TOPIC 842, TOPIC 842 WAS NOT APPLIED TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION AND THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUES, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR  85  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 FOLLOWING ADOPTION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. SEE NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING (SUCH DISCUSSION INCLUDES LESSOR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER TOPIC 842).  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (AS NOTED ABOVE, ALTHOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 FOLLOWING ADOPTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION) OR OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT.  LEASE ACCOUNTING  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OUR MATERIAL LEASE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY FOR REAL ESTATE OR VEHICLES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER SUCH CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS. WE LEASE REAL ESTATE AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES. WE LEASE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BRANCH LOCATIONS, AND ALSO LEASE OTHER PREMISES USED FOR PURPOSES SUCH AS DISTRICT AND REGIONAL OFFICES AND SERVICE CENTERS. OUR FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT (PRIMARILY VEHICLES) AND BUILDING LEASES.  OPERATING LEASES RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. ROU ASSETS REPRESENT OUR RIGHT TO USE THE LEASED ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(CONTINUED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AND EXCLUDE LEASE INCENTIVES. OUR LEASE TERMS MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE THAT WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE. THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH OPTIONS REFLECTED IN THE \u201cMATURITY OF LEASE LIABILITIES\u201d TABLE BELOW IS NOT MATERIAL. MOST REAL ESTATE LEASES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OPTIONS TO RENEW, WITH RENEWAL TERMS THAT CAN EXTEND THE LEASE TERM FROM  1  TO  5  YEARS OR MORE. LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. LEASE EXPENSE ON SUCH LEASES IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE PRIMARY LEASES WE ENTER INTO WITH INITIAL TERMS OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE FOR EQUIPMENT THAT WE RENT FROM VENDORS AND THEN RENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE GENERATE SUBLEASE REVENUE FROM SUCH LEASES THAT WE REFER TO AS \"RE-RENT REVENUE\" AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. APART FROM THE RE-RENT REVENUE DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  , WE DO NOT GENERATE MATERIAL SUBLEASE INCOME.  WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, AND, FOR OUR REAL ESTATE OPERATING LEASES, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT. OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY MATERIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.  THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEASES. THIS INFORMATION IS ONLY PRESENTED AS OF, AND FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED,  MARCH 31, 2019  BECAUSE, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 USING A TRANSITION METHOD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION.

OTHER THAN THE GUARANTEE BY CERTAIN CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES OF URNA'S INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, NONE OF URNA\u2019S INDEBTEDNESS IS GUARANTEED BY URNA'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OR THE SPV (TOGETHER, THE \u201cNON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES\u201d). THE RECEIVABLE ASSETS OWNED BY THE SPV HAVE BEEN SOLD OR CONTRIBUTED BY URNA TO THE SPV AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS OF URNA OR PARENT\u2019S OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALL  100 PERCENT  -OWNED AND THE GUARANTEES ARE MADE ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS. THE GUARANTEES ARE NOT FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL BECAUSE A GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED AND RELIEVED OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING SALE OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, THE SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY'S ASSETS, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE UNDER THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE BEING MET, DESIGNATING THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY AS AN UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY FOR PURPOSES OF THE APPLICABLE COVENANTS OR, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO THE GUARANTEES OF THE 5  3  /  4  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024, THE NOTES BEING RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY BOTH STANDARD & POOR\u2019S RATINGS SERVICES AND MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ANOTHER RATING AGENCY SELECTED BY URNA. THE GUARANTEES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO SUBORDINATION PROVISIONS (TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE ISSUER UNDER THE RELEVANT NOTES ARE SUBORDINATED TO OTHER DEBT OF THE ISSUER) AND TO A STANDARD LIMITATION WHICH PROVIDES THAT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT GUARANTEED BY EACH GUARANTOR WILL NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT THAT CAN BE GUARANTEED WITHOUT MAKING THE GUARANTEE VOID UNDER FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCE LAWS. BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RULE 3-10 OF REGULATION S-X (\"RULE 3-10\"), WE BELIEVE THAT THE GUARANTEES OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN RULE 3-10 AND THEREFORE CONTINUE TO UTILIZE RULE 3-10 TO PRESENT CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR HOLDINGS, URNA, THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  WE ARE THE LARGEST EQUIPMENT RENTAL COMPANY IN THE WORLD, WITH AN INTEGRATED NETWORK OF  1,176  RENTAL LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND EUROPE. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN JULY 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP, WHICH ALLOWED FOR OUR ENTRY INTO SELECT EUROPEAN MARKETS. ALTHOUGH THE EQUIPMENT RENTAL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND DIVERSE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE, AS A LARGER COMPANY, WE HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES AND CERTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THESE INCLUDE A FLEET OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT WITH A TOTAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT COST (\u201cOEC\u201d) OF  $14.1 BILLION  , AND A NATIONAL BRANCH NETWORK THAT OPERATES IN 49 U.S. STATES AND EVERY CANADIAN PROVINCE, AND SERVES 99 OF THE LARGEST 100 METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE U.S. THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED ABOVE ADDED  11  EUROPEAN LOCATIONS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS TO OUR BRANCH NETWORK. OUR SIZE ALSO GIVES US GREATER PURCHASING POWER, THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH A BROADER RANGE OF EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE CONSISTENTLY WELL-MAINTAINED AND THEREFORE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND RELIABLE, AND THE ABILITY TO ENHANCE THE EARNING POTENTIAL OF OUR ASSETS BY TRANSFERRING EQUIPMENT AMONG BRANCHES TO SATISFY CUSTOMER NEEDS.  WE OFFER APPROXIMATELY  4,000  CLASSES OF EQUIPMENT FOR RENT TO A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE THAT INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS, UTILITIES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOMEOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: EQUIPMENT RENTALS, SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES SALES AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUES. EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENTED  85  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE EXECUTED A STRATEGY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CORE EQUIPMENT RENTAL BUSINESS THROUGH REVENUE GROWTH, MARGIN EXPANSION AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION, RATE MANAGEMENT, FLEET MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.  IN 2019, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR DISCIPLINED FOCUS ON INCREASING OUR PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. IN PARTICULAR, OUR STRATEGY CALLS FOR.  \u2022  A CONSISTENTLY SUPERIOR STANDARD OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS  , OFTEN PROVIDED THROUGH A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT;  \u2022  THE FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF OUR CUSTOMER MIX AND FLEET MIX,  WITH A DUAL OBJECTIVE: TO ENHANCE OUR PERFORMANCE IN SERVING OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE, AND TO FOCUS ON THE ACCOUNTS AND CUSTOMER TYPES THAT ARE BEST SUITED TO OUR STRATEGY FOR PROFITABLE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THESE EFFORTS WILL LEAD TO EVEN BETTER SERVICE OF OUR TARGET ACCOUNTS, PRIMARILY LARGE CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS SELECT LOCAL CONTRACTORS. OUR FLEET TEAM'S ANALYSES ARE ALIGNED WITH THESE OBJECTIVES TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES AND DEFINE ACTION PLANS THAT CAN GENERATE IMPROVED RETURNS;  \u2022  A CONTINUED FOCUS ON \u201cLEAN\u201d MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING KAIZEN PROCESSES FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  . WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT LEAN KAIZEN PROCESSES ACROSS OUR BRANCH NETWORK, WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF: REDUCING THE CYCLE TIME ASSOCIATED WITH RENTING OUR EQUIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS; IMPROVING INVOICE ACCURACY AND SERVICE QUALITY; REDUCING THE ELAPSED TIME FOR EQUIPMENT PICKUP AND DELIVERY; AND IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS;  \u2022  A CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROJECT XL,  WHICH IS A SET OF EIGHT SPECIFIC WORK STREAMS FOCUSED ON DRIVING PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND GENERATING INCREMENTAL PROFITABILITY THROUGH COST SAVINGS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS;  \u2022  THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS FOOTPRINT, AS WELL AS OUR TOOLS OFFERING, AND THE CROSS-SELLING OF THESE SERVICES THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK,  AS EXHIBITED BY OUR ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPANSION OF OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR TOOLS OFFERING, WILL FURTHER POSITION UNITED RENTALS AS A SINGLE SOURCE PROVIDER OF TOTAL JOBSITE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE PRODUCT AND SERVICE RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS; AND  \u2022  THE PURSUIT OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CORE EQUIPMENT RENTAL BUSINESS  , AS EXHIBITED BY OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OF NES RENTALS HOLDINGS II, INC. (\u201cNES\u201d), NEFF CORPORATION (\"NEFF\") AND BLUELINE (WHICH IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS ALLOW US TO INVEST OUR CAPITAL TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS, FURTHER DRIVING OUR ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH OUR STRATEGIC GOALS.  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW  SINCE JANUARY 1, 2018, WE HAVE TAKEN THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY, AND TO POSITION US TO INVEST THE NECESSARY CAPITAL IN OUR BUSINESS.  \u2022  ISSUED $1.1 BILLION PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6  1  /  2  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE 2026;  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  ENTERED INTO A $1 BILLION TERM LOAN FACILITY;  \u2022  AMENDED AND EXTENDED OUR ABL FACILITY, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE FACILITY SIZE FROM $3.0 BILLION TO $3.75 BILLION; AND  \u2022  AMENDED AND EXTENDED OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE FACILITY SIZE FROM $775 TO $975.

ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA PLUS THE SUM OF THE MERGER RELATED COSTS, RESTRUCTURING CHARGE, STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE, NET AND THE IMPACT OF THE FAIR VALUE MARK-UP OF THE ACQUIRED FLEET. THESE ITEMS ARE EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA INTERNALLY WHEN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND FOR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND FORECASTING PURPOSES, AND ALLOW INVESTORS TO MAKE A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON BETWEEN OUR CORE BUSINESS OPERATING RESULTS OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AS WELL AS WITH THOSE OF OTHER SIMILAR COMPANIES.

THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION INCLUDES THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE.  EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCLUDE OUR REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS REVENUE RELATED TO THE FEES WE CHARGE CUSTOMERS: FOR EQUIPMENT DELIVERY AND PICK-UP; TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMER AGAINST LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE TO OUR EQUIPMENT WHILE ON RENT; FOR FUEL; AND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS. SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT REPRESENT OUR REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF USED RENTAL EQUIPMENT. SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT REPRESENT OUR REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF NEW EQUIPMENT. CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES SALES REPRESENT OUR SALES OF SUPPLIES UTILIZED BY CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION CONSUMABLES, TOOLS, SMALL EQUIPMENT AND SAFETY SUPPLIES. SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT OUR REVENUES EARNED FROM PROVIDING REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FLEET (INCLUDING PARTS SALES). SEE NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , TOTAL REVENUES OF  $2.117 BILLION  INCREASED  22.1  PERCENT COMPARED WITH  2018  . EQUIPMENT RENTALS AND SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT ARE OUR LARGEST REVENUE TYPES (TOGETHER, THEY ACCOUNTED FOR  94  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  23.0  PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  23.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS EXPLAINED FURTHER ABOVE, AND IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF KEY DECISIONS MADE DAILY BY OUR MANAGERS REGARDING RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE. FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS A MEASURE OF THE DECISIONS MADE TO OPTIMIZE THE BALANCE OF RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX TO PRODUCE REVENUE AND DRIVE EFFICIENT GROWTH. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX. SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT INCREASED  6.1  PERCENT PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME, WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION, DRIVEN BY A LARGER FLEET SIZE IN A STRONG USED EQUIPMENT MARKET.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  4  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE GENERAL RENTALS AND TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS. THE GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE RENTAL OF CONSTRUCTION, AERIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND HOMEOWNER EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES.

HISTORICALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN VARIANCES IN THE LEVELS OF EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THESE REGIONS. FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  THREE  OF OUR GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS HAD AN EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN THAT VARIED BY BETWEEN 10 PERCENT AND  15  PERCENT FROM THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS OF THE AGGREGATED GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE RENTAL INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND THERE HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN REGIONS WITH EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS THAT VARIED BY GREATER THAN 10 PERCENT FROM THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS OF THE AGGREGATED GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS, THOUGH THE SPECIFIC REGIONS WITH MARGIN VARIANCES OF OVER 10 PERCENT HAVE FLUCTUATED. WE EXPECT MARGIN CONVERGENCE GOING FORWARD GIVEN THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE RENTAL INDUSTRY, AND MONITOR THE MARGIN VARIANCES AND CONFIRM THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE CONVERGENCE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  WE SIMILARLY MONITOR THE MARGIN VARIANCES FOR THE REGIONS IN THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE LOCATIONS ACQUIRED IN THE JULY 2018 BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, THERE IS NOT A LONG HISTORY OF THE ACQUIRED LOCATIONS' RENTAL MARGINS INCLUDED IN THE TRENCH, POWER AND PUMP SEGMENT. WHEN MONITORING FOR MARGIN CONVERGENCE, WE INCLUDE PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS. WE MONITOR THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT MARGIN VARIANCES AND CONFIRM THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONVERGENCE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THE HISTORIC, PRE-ACQUISITION MARGINS FOR THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE MARGINS ACHIEVED AT THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE SEGMENT. WE EXPECT THAT THE MARGINS AT THE ACQUIRED LOCATIONS WILL INCREASE AS WE REALIZE SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION, AS A RESULT OF WHICH, WE EXPECT FUTURE MARGIN CONVERGENCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE REGIONS THAT ARE AGGREGATED INTO OUR SEGMENTS HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, AS EACH REGION IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE, OFFERS SIMILAR PRODUCTS TO SIMILAR CUSTOMERS, USES SIMILAR METHODS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, AND IS SUBJECT TO SIMILAR COMPETITIVE RISKS. THE AGGREGATION OF OUR REGIONS ALSO REFLECTS THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT WE USE FOR MAKING OPERATING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE AGGREGATING THESE REGIONS INTO OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES IS APPROPRIATE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARGIN VARIANCES THAT DO NOT CONVERGE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DISAGGREGATE THE REGIONS INTO SEPARATE REPORTING SEGMENTS. ANY SUCH DISAGGREGATION WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THESE SEGMENTS ALIGN OUR EXTERNAL SEGMENT REPORTING WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES. WE EVALUATE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE BASED ON SEGMENT EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS PROFIT. OUR REVENUES, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER REFLECTING THE SEASONAL RENTAL PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WITH RENTAL ACTIVITY TENDING TO BE LOWER IN THE WINTER.  REVENUES BY SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT. AS EXPLAINED FURTHER ABOVE (SEE \"FINANCIAL OVERVIEW-REVENUES\"), FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF KEY DECISIONS MADE DAILY BY OUR MANAGERS REGARDING RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  13.8  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  13.4  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC. THE PRO FORMA INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF COLD STARTS AND ACQUISITIONS OTHER THAN BAKERCORP. ADDITIONALLY, PERFORMANCE IN OUR TRENCH SAFETY AND POWER AND HVAC REGIONS IMPROVED. THE TRENCH SAFETY REGION EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM INFRASTRUCTURE, UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC AND GAS DISTRIBUTION CUSTOMERS.  THE POWER AND HVAC REGION EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS.

THE INCREASE IN EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS PROFIT PRIMARILY REFLECTS INCREASED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE ON A LARGER FLEET. YEAR-OVER-YEAR, TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  44.2  PERCENT AND AVERAGE OEC INCREASED  59.6  PERCENT PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS. THE DECREASE IN THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS, AND AN INCREASE IN LOWER-MARGIN RE-RENT REVENUES. THE HISTORIC, PRE-ACQUISITION MARGINS FOR THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE MARGINS ACHIEVED AT THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE SEGMENT, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT THE MARGINS WILL IMPROVE OVER TIME AS WE REALIZE SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SEE NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL) THAT REQUIRES THAT WE RECOGNIZE DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEASE REVENUES AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE WHICH DECREASED THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019.

IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SEE NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL) THAT REQUIRES THAT WE RECOGNIZE DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEASE REVENUES AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE WHICH DECREASED THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019, WITH SUCH DECREASE ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE TOTAL EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN DECREASE. THE GROSS MARGIN DECREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS, AND AN INCREASE IN LOWER-MARGIN RE-RENT REVENUES IN OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS REPORTABLE SEGMENT. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT.

WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE. MERGER RELATED COSTS ONLY INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR ACQUISITIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS. THE HISTORIC ACQUISITIONS THAT HAVE INCLUDED MERGER RELATED COSTS ARE RSC, WHICH HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, AND NATIONAL PUMP, WHICH HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF OVER $200 PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. NES HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $369  AND NEFF HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $413  . AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BAKERCORP HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $295  AND BLUELINE HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $786.  THE  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  PRIMARILY REFLECT SEVERANCE AND BRANCH CLOSURE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION, WHICH IS ALSO DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  . FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE  5  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NON-RENTAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCLUDES I) THE AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND II) DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT OFFERED FOR RENT (SUCH AS COMPUTERS AND OFFICE EQUIPMENT) AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. OUR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS AND TRADE NAMES AND ASSOCIATED TRADEMARKS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NON-RENTAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE DEBT INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE DEBT USED TO FINANCE THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE  2019  AND  2018  EFFECTIVE TAX RATES  DID NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21 PERCENT.  BALANCE SHEET.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT, IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD USING A TRANSITION METHOD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY USING INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO (I) THE POLICIES AND COOPERATION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WE UTILIZE TO MAINTAIN AND PROVIDE CASH MANAGEMENT SERVICES, (II) THE TERMS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE AGREEMENTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY AND (III) THE STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES OF EACH OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SEE \"FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\" ABOVE FOR A SUMMARY OF RECENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE ACTIONS TAKEN TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY.  SINCE 2012, WE HAVE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF $2.45 BILLION OF HOLDINGS' COMMON STOCK UNDER FOUR COMPLETED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, IN APRIL 2018, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED A NEW $1.25 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH COMMENCED IN JULY 2018. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAVE REPURCHASED $630  OF HOLDINGS' COMMON STOCK UNDER THE $1.25 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH WE INTEND TO COMPLETE IN 2019.  OUR PRINCIPAL EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH ARE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FROM THE SALE OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $52  . CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RATED A OR BETTER. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

WE PLAN TO FUND SUCH CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH. IN ADDITION, WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION OF SOME OF OUR REAL ESTATE, THE USE OF ADDITIONAL OPERATING LEASES OR OTHER FINANCING SOURCES AS MARKET CONDITIONS PERMIT.  TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WE RELY ON CREDIT RATING AGENCIES TO ASSIGN RATINGS TO OUR SECURITIES AS AN INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY. LOWER CREDIT RATINGS GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS AND REDUCED ACCESS TO DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. CREDIT RATINGS ALSO AFFECT THE COSTS OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, NEGATIVE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COSTS OF FUNDING. OUR CREDIT RATINGS AS OF  APRIL 15, 2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS.

LOAN COVENANTS AND COMPLIANCE.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE SENIOR NOTES. ANY FAILURE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OR COVENANT OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONS.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY IS THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE ABL FACILITY, THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WILL ONLY APPLY IN THE FUTURE IF SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW  10 PERCENT  OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND BORROWING BASE COLLATERAL IN EXCESS OF THE ABL FACILITY SIZE MAY BE INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY EXCEEDED THE REQUIRED THRESHOLD AND, AS A RESULT, THIS FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT WAS INAPPLICABLE. UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL TESTS RELATING TO: (I) THE DEFAULT RATIO, (II) THE DELINQUENCY RATIO, (III) THE DILUTION RATIO AND (IV) DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING. THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, TO THE EXTENT THE RATIO IS APPLICABLE UNDER THE ABL FACILITY.  URNA\u2019S PAYMENT CAPACITY IS RESTRICTED UNDER THE COVENANTS IN THE ABL AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE INDENTURES GOVERNING ITS OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. ALTHOUGH THIS RESTRICTED CAPACITY LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MOVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO HOLDINGS, BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON HOLDINGS\u2019 ABILITY TO MEET ITS CASH OBLIGATIONS.

THE EQUIPMENT PURCHASES AND PROCEEDS ARE INCLUDED IN CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES USEFUL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING CASH FLOW AVAILABLE TO MEET FUTURE DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP. ACCORDINGLY, FREE CASH FLOW SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME OR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS AN INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY.

SEE PART I\u2014ITEM 1A OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018  AND PART I\u2014ITEM 1A OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING REASONS THAT ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS, DEVELOPMENTS AND BUSINESS DECISIONS CONTEMPLATED BY OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THE REPORT, DOCUMENT, PRESS RELEASE, WEBCAST, CALL, MATERIALS OR OTHER COMMUNICATION IN WHICH THEY ARE MADE.  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS OR OTHERWISE.  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY DIVERSITY, THE COMPANY FACES A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES, INCLUDING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPUTING, AUTOMATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MOBILE CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITIZATION) IN MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVED MARKETS, THE EXPANSION AND EVOLUTION OF OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS, TRENDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A GLOBAL LABOR FORCE, CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPETITORS AND INCREASING REGULATION.  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN MOST MARKETS, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND IN PARTICULAR ON ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS IN HIGH-GROWTH GEOGRAPHIES AND HIGH-GROWTH MARKET SEGMENTS, IDENTIFY, CONSUMMATE AND INTEGRATE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES FORCE, CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY, AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF AN INCREASINGLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT.  THE COMPANY IS MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS, ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, TO ADDRESS THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN ITS SERVED MARKETS AND TO GLOBALIZE ITS MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CUSTOMER-FACING RESOURCES (PARTICULARLY IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS) IN ORDER TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS.  BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND OUTLOOK  DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES INCREASED  4.0%  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  WHILE DIFFERENCES EXIST AMONG THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESSES, ON AN OVERALL BASIS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THIS DEMAND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN SALES GROWTH INITIATIVES AND THE OTHER BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW, CONTRIBUTED TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CORE SALES GROWTH OF  5.5%  (FOR THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCORE SALES\u201d OR \u201cCORE REVENUE\u201d REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d BELOW).  GEOGRAPHICALLY, BOTH HIGH-GROWTH AND DEVELOPED MARKETS CONTRIBUTED TO CORE SALES GROWTH DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS INCREASED AT A HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  LED PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CHINA.  HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  29%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN DEVELOPED MARKETS INCREASED AT A MID-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  LED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OVERALL YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  BUT REMAINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHALLENGES DUE TO MACRO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO TRADE, TARIFFS, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION DURING THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  MARCH 30, 2018  , REFER TO NOTE  2  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  TOTALED  $334 MILLION  OR  $0.46  PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO  $567 MILLION  OR  $0.80  PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 30, 2018  .  THE TAX-RELATED CHARGES DISCUSSED BELOW IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 INCOME TAXES\u201d ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  DECREASE  IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019.  ACQUISITIONS AND PROPOSED DENTAL INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROWTH STRATEGY CONTEMPLATES FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATIONS AND RESULTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE RATE AND EXTENT TO WHICH APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMMATED, ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED AND ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR COST SAVINGS ARE ACHIEVED.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PENDING ACQUISITION OF THE BIOPHARMA BUSINESS OF GE LIFE SCIENCES AND THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING THEREOF, REFER TO NOTE 3 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANTICIPATED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING WITH RESPECT TO ITS DENTAL BUSINESS, REFER TO NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2019 THE COMPANY ACQUIRED  ONE  BUSINESS FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $308 MILLION  IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED COMPLEMENTS AN EXISTING UNIT OF THE LIFE SCIENCES SEGMENT.  THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL SALES OF THIS  BUSINESS AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES FOR ITS LAST COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, WERE  $61 MILLION.  THE COMPANY PRELIMINARILY RECORDED AN AGGREGATE OF  $211 MILLION  OF GOODWILL RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED REPORTED SALES BY APPROXIMATELY  4.0%  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  .  IF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  WERE TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  2019  SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 2.0% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  ANY FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR, AND ANY WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  UK\u2019S REFERENDUM DECISION TO EXIT THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d)  IN A REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS APPROVED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d) TO EXIT THE EU.  THE TIMING OF THE UK\u2019S EXIT FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN; THE EU HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2019.  WITH THE TERMS OF THE UK\u2019S WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU STILL BEING DECIDED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND PLAN FOR ANY IMPACT.  TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF GOODS TO AND FROM THE UK, THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE UK.  FOR GOODS THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES WITHIN THE UK AND EXPORTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED ADDITIONAL GOODS FOR STORAGE IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UK IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN INVENTORY REQUIRED TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTION IN SHIPMENTS FROM THE UK.  THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE \u201cITEM 1A\u2014RISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, REFERENCES TO THE NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CORE SALES (ALSO REFERRED TO AS CORE REVENUES OR SALES/REVENUES FROM EXISTING BUSINESSES) REFER TO SALES CALCULATED ACCORDING TO U.S. GAAP, BUT EXCLUDING.  \u2022  SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  REFERENCES TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES REFER TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES RECORDED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION LESS THE AMOUNT OF SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIVESTED PRODUCT LINES NOT CONSIDERED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE PORTION OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES); AND  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES) AFTER APPLYING CURRENT PERIOD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  CORE SALES GROWTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, SALES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT REPORTING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF CORE SALES GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY HELPING IDENTIFY UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN DANAHER\u2019S BUSINESS AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF DANAHER\u2019S REVENUE PERFORMANCE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR AND FUTURE PERIODS AND TO DANAHER\u2019S PEERS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CORE SALES GROWTH TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND USES IT AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION FROM CORE SALES BECAUSE CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS NOT UNDER MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONTROL, IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE-RELATED ITEMS BECAUSE THE NATURE, SIZE, TIMING AND NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES CAN VARY DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS PEERS AND CAN ALSO OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS AND MAKE COMPARISONS OF LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE DIFFICULT.  THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION, REFERENCES TO SALES VOLUME REFER TO THE IMPACT OF BOTH PRICE AND UNIT SALES AND REFERENCES TO PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS GENERALLY REFER TO IMPROVED COST-EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING APPLICATION OF THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORE REVENUE% CHANGE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2019 VS.

THESE DISCRETE TAX CHARGES INCREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  34.0%  .  THESE PROVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2018 WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21.0% DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE 2018 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF A LOWER U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF 21.0% FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NEW MINIMUM TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2018 ALSO INCLUDES TAX BENEFITS FOR RELEASE OF RESERVES UPON THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WERE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX PROVISIONS AND OTHER MATTERS.

THE NON-U.S. COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE INCLUDE CHINA, DENMARK, GERMANY, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN COUNTRY WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPERSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXING AUTHORITIES.  THE IRS HAS COMPLETED THE EXAMINATIONS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH 2011 AND IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 THROUGH 2015.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE IRS HAS PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2015 WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFERRAL OF TAX ON CERTAIN PREMIUM INCOME RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS.  THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE 2012-2015 PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN ITS U.S. TAX RETURNS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS, INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE POSITIONS AND IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING ALL OF ITS ALTERNATIVES.  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA IN 2017 AND THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FOR YEARS AFTER 2017, THE COMPANY REVALUED ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEFERRED PREMIUM INCOME FROM  35.0%  TO  21.0%.  IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THESE ASSESSMENTS, THE TAXES OWED TO THE IRS MAY BE COMPUTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS  35.0%  STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVALUE THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FROM  21.0%  TO  35.0%  ,  WHICH IN ADDITION TO ANY INTEREST DUE ON THE AMOUNTS ASSESSED, WOULD REQUIRE A CHARGE TO FUTURE EARNINGS.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS CASH FLOWS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  TAX AUTHORITIES IN DENMARK HAVE RAISED SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RELATED TO INTEREST ACCRUED BY CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED ASSESSMENTS FROM  THE DANISH TAX AUTHORITY  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.7 BILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  MARCH 29, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $253 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  ), IMPOSING WITHHOLDING TAX RELATING TO INTEREST ACCRUED IN DENMARK ON BORROWINGS FROM CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE YEARS 2004-2009.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THESE ASSESSMENTS TO THE NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL IN 2014, WHICH APPEAL HAS BEEN PENDING AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF OTHER CASES BROUGHT TO THE CJEU.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SKAT AND ANTICIPATES RECEIVING AN ASSESSMENT FOR SIMILAR WITHHOLDING TAX MATTERS FOR THE YEARS 2010-2012 TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 994 MILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  MARCH 29, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $149 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  ).  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CJEU DECIDED SEVERAL OTHER CASES RELATED TO DANISH WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST.  IN THESE CASES, THE CJEU RULED THAT THE EXEMPTION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM WITHHOLDING TAXES  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE  EU  DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE DENIED WHERE TAXPAYERS USE THE DIRECTIVE FOR ABUSIVE OR FRAUDULENT PURPOSES, AND THAT IT IS UP TO THE NATIONAL COURTS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN DENMARK ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS POSITIONS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON PURSUING THIS MATTER THROUGH THE DANISH HIGH COURT SHOULD THE APPEAL TO THE TAX TRIBUNAL BE UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DECISIONS OF BOTH THE DANISH COURTS AND THE CJEU AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE COURT RULINGS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS IN DENMARK.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS, AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20.0%.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE EXPECTED RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  INCLUDES THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETE INCOME TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE, THOUGH THE ACTUAL BENEFITS (IF ANY) WILL DEPEND ON THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS.  \u2022  THE ACTUAL MIX OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION COULD FLUCTUATE FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTION.  \u2022  THE TAX EFFECTS OF OTHER DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING ACCRUALS RELATED TO TAX CONTINGENCIES, THE RESOLUTION OF WORLDWIDE TAX MATTERS, TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRATIONS AND CHANGES IN TAX REGULATIONS.  \u2022  ANY FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR POTENTIAL TAX REFORM, THE IMPACT OF FUTURE REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTING THE TCJA AND ANY RELATED ADDITIONAL TAX PLANNING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHANGES.  AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING THESE ITEMS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE USED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  DECREASED  $539 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET EARNINGS IN 2019 VERSUS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN 2018 AND DUE TO  LOSS  ES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  GAIN  S FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .

INFLATION  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019.

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATES TO BOTH THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING AND OPERATING FACILITIES AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTATION  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LEASED TO CUSTOMERS UNDER OTL ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT USES AS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING REVENUE, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND WE DESCRIBE THESE ITEMS FURTHER BELOW UNDER THE HEADINGS \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\u201d  20  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME, AS WELL AS ON THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES, AND MAKE CHANGES AS DEEMED NECESSARY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 7, \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d UNDER THE HEADING \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  CREDIT LOSSES  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cMEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH SUPERSEDES CURRENT GUIDANCE REQUIRING RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AT EACH REPORTING DATE. THE NEW STANDARD WILL RESULT IN EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES ON TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO RECEIVE CASH. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT,\u201d THAT ELIMINATES \u201cSTEP 2\u201d FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE NEW GUIDANCE MUST BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cDISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK \u2014 CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT,\u201d WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15, \u201cCUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT,\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS IN CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , REFLECT THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  INCREASED PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE REVENUE RESULTING FROM OVERALL GROWTH IN EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  INCREASED EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE COSTS RESULTING FROM INCREASED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS;  \u2022  INCREASED SELLING COSTS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN TECHNICAL SALES SUPPORT IN RESPONSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INCREASING TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON CREATING AND ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS.  REVENUE  WE PRIMARILY GENERATE REVENUE FROM LICENSING OUR SOFTWARE AND IP, SELLING OR LEASING OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING MAINTENANCE FOR OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP, PROVIDING ENGINEERING SERVICES AND EARNING ROYALTIES GENERATED FROM THE USE OF OUR IP. THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MIX OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS GENERATING REVENUE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AND WHETHER THE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME, UPON COMPLETION OF DELIVERY.  WE EXPECT THAT BETWEEN 85% AND 90% OF OUR REVENUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING FISCAL 2019, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE RESULTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME INCLUDES REVENUE FROM OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS, SERVICES, ROYALTIES FROM CERTAIN IP ARRANGEMENTS, MAINTENANCE ON IP LICENSES AND HARDWARE, AND OPERATING LEASES OF HARDWARE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY OUR SALES OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE AND IP LICENSES. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THIS MIX IN ANY SINGLE FISCAL PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY DELIVERY OF HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUE BY PERIOD  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  AND THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN PERIODS.

THIS DEMAND HAS RESULTED IN REVENUE GROWTH IN EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES. SERVICES REVENUE MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE TIMING OF FULFILLMENT OF OUR SERVICES AND IP PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  NO  ONE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR  10%  OR MORE OF TOTAL REVENUE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  OR  MARCH 31, 2018.  22  REVENUE BY PRODUCT GROUP  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE CONTRIBUTED BY EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SERVICES FOR THE PAST FIVE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS.

CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ALLOW CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO REMIX AMONG SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WITH THE ACTUAL PRODUCT SELECTION AND NUMBER OF LICENSED USERS TO BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE. FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE THE ALLOCATION OF THE REVENUE TO PRODUCT GROUPS BASED UPON THE EXPECTED USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTUAL USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY THESE CUSTOMERS MAY DIFFER AND, IF THAT PROVES TO BE THE CASE, THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IN THE TABLE ABOVE WOULD DIFFER.  REVENUE BY GEOGRAPHY  THREE MONTHS ENDED  CHANGE  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  AMOUNT  PERCENTAGE  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  UNITED STATES  $243.2  $224.8  $18.4  8%  OTHER AMERICAS  8.4  7.7  0.7  9%  CHINA  59.0  45.3  13.7  30%  OTHER ASIA  111.3  94.6  16.7  18%  EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA  103.5  104.7  (1.2  )  (1  )%  JAPAN  51.3  40.2  11.1  28%  TOTAL REVENUE  $576.7  $517.3  $59.4  11%  FOR THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, OTHER ASIA AND JAPAN DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , SEE THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION UNDER \u201cREVENUE BY PERIOD\u201d ABOVE.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE PRODUCTS INCLUDE COMPONENTS, ASSEMBLY, TESTING, APPLICABLE RESERVES AND OVERHEAD. THESE COSTS MAKE OUR COST OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE PRODUCTS HIGHER, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN OUR COST OF SOFTWARE AND IP PRODUCTS.  A SUMMARY OF COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE IS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  CHANGE  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  AMOUNT  PERCENTAGE  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS  $40.6  $31.4  $9.2  29%  AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES  9.9  10.3  (0.4  )  (4  )%  TOTAL COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE  $50.5  $41.7  $8.8  21%  COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON OUR HARDWARE PRODUCT SALES IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY EMPLOYEE SALARY AND BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, RESERVES FOR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND EXTENT TO WHICH WE ACQUIRE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ACQUIRE OR LICENSE THIRD-PARTIES\u2019 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE SUCH ACQUIRED OR LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY.  THE CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WERE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.  CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN MILLIONS)  EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE COSTS  $8.7  OTHER ITEMS  0.5  TOTAL CHANGE IN PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS  $9.2  COSTS OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES VOLUME FOR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE. GROSS MARGINS ON OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE, PRODUCT COMPETITION, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING STRATEGIES.  24  COST OF SERVICES  COST OF SERVICES PRIMARILY INCLUDES EMPLOYEE SALARY, BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS TO PERFORM WORK ON REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS AND COSTS TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MANAGE A SERVICES ORGANIZATION. COST OF SERVICES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON OUR UTILIZATION OF DESIGN SERVICES ENGINEERS ON REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS OR ON INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE MARKETING AND SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FACTORS THAT TEND TO CAUSE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DUE TO HIRING AND ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE IMPACT OF OUR VARIABLE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY OPERATING RESULTS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK BETWEEN GRANT DATES HAVE RESULTED IN HIGHER GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES FOR THE MIX OF STOCK AWARDS EXPENSED IN EACH PERIOD.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE TRANSACTED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE RECOGNIZE LOWER EXPENSES IN PERIODS WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR STRENGTHENS IN VALUE AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AND WE RECOGNIZE HIGHER EXPENSES WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES.

WE EXPECT MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE TO INCREASE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018, DUE TO ADDITIONAL HIRING.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WERE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.

WE EXPECT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018, TO KEEP PACE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND DEMANDS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  THE DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WERE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.

BECAUSE THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND RELATED BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES MADE DURING THE FORMULATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLANS, BASED ON THEN-CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED ON THE TIMETABLE OR AT THE LEVEL CONTEMPLATED. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING FURTHER RESTRUCTURING OF OUR OPERATIONS, MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE REVISED CERTAIN ESTIMATES MADE IN CONNECTION WITH PRIOR RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND RECORDED CREDITS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 MILLION  .

INCOME TAXES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  .  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $7.7  $5.3  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  6.0%  6.8%  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON OUR ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2019 INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $14.4 MILLION  OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO INCREASED OUR TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX BY $1.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 BASED ON ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) AND STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON OUR THEN-ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2018 INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8.7 MILLION OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX BY $2.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 BASED ON OUR CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE EARNINGS AND CASH BALANCES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES.  27  OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY TAX AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS AT RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, RESEARCH CREDITS, THE TAX IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, CLOSURE OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR SETTLEMENT OF TAX AUDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND CHANGES IN TAX LAW. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS IS GENERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND AND HUNGARY. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR EARNINGS WERE TO BE LOWER IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  12%  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WILL VARY FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF RECOGNIZING THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS IN THE PERIODS WHEN THE AWARDS VEST OR ARE SETTLED AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, SEE PART II, ITEM 1A, \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 30,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $538.9  $533.3  $5.6  NET WORKING CAPITAL  286.5  242.1  44.4  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF  $538.9 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS COMPARED TO  $533.3 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WERE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK RESULTING FROM STOCK PURCHASES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WERE PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OPERATING EXPENSES, PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PURCHASES OF NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, PAYMENT OF TAXES ON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK HELD BY EMPLOYEES AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  APPROXIMATELY  84%  OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. WE EXPECT THAT CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, CASH FLOWS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AND OTHER CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  NET WORKING CAPITAL  NET WORKING CAPITAL IS COMPRISED OF CURRENT ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE INCREASE IN OUR NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY BUSINESS LEVELS AND THE PAYMENT TERMS SET FORTH IN OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.  28  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(46.0  )  $(13.1  )  $(32.9  )  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF OTHER ENTITIES AND AN INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PURCHASING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PURCHASING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, PURCHASING SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND MAKING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(134.1  )  $(97.1  )  $(37.0  )  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  AS OF THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PAST PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS. THE FOLLOWING WILL BE DISCUSSED AND ANALYZED.  \u00d8  OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS  \u00d8  OVERVIEW OF 2019 RESULTS  \u00d8  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u00d8  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u00d8  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \u00d8  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  \u00d8  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS  THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVE IS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF PAPER-BASED PACKAGING SOLUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE COMPANY OFFERS CUSTOMERS ITS PAPERBOARD, CARTONS, CUPS, LIDS, FOODSERVICE CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING MACHINES, EITHER AS AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION OR SEPARATELY. CARTONS, CARRIERS AND CONTAINERS ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND HOLD PRODUCTS. PRODUCT OFFERINGS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF LAMINATED, COATED AND PRINTED PACKAGING STRUCTURES THAT ARE PRODUCED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S COATED RECYCLED BOARD (\u201cCRB\u201d), COATED UNBLEACHED KRAFT (\u201cCUK\u201d) AND SOLID BLEACHED SULFATE (\"SBS\"). INNOVATIVE DESIGNS AND COMBINATIONS OF PAPERBOARD, FILMS, FOILS, METALLIZATION, HOLOGRAPHICS AND EMBOSSING ARE CUSTOMIZED TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY IS IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES (I) TO EXPAND MARKET SHARE IN ITS CURRENT MARKETS AND TO IDENTIFY AND PENETRATE NEW MARKETS; (II) TO CAPITALIZE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, BUSINESS COMPETENCIES, AND MILLS AND FOLDING CARTON ASSETS; (III) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS; AND (IV) TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS BY FOCUSING ON OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGIES AND ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS INFLATION OF RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER COSTS, WHICH THE COMPANY CANNOT ALWAYS PASS THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE EFFECT OF OVERCAPACITY IN THE WORLDWIDE PAPERBOARD PACKAGING INDUSTRY.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS  IMPACT OF INFLATION/DEFLATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ENERGY (INCLUDING NATURAL GAS, FUEL OIL AND ELECTRICITY), PINE AND HARDWOOD PULP, CHEMICALS, SECONDARY FIBERS, PURCHASED PAPERBOARD, ALUMINUM FOIL, INK, PLASTIC FILMS AND RESINS, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND LABOR. COSTS INCREASED IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  BY $27.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2018  . THE HIGHER COSTS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WERE DUE TO WOOD ($12.5 MILLION), LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS ($9.0 MILLION), EXTERNAL BOARD ($2.3 MILLION), CORRUGATED ($1.2 MILLION), ENERGY ($0.6 MILLION), FREIGHT ($0.4 MILLION) AND OTHER COSTS, NET ($2.3 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SECONDARY FIBER COST ($1.1 MILLION).  BECAUSE THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO MANAGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO NATURAL GAS SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PRICES FOR A PORTION OF ITS EXPECTED USAGE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  AND ALL OF 2020. SINCE NEGOTIATED SALES CONTRACTS AND THE MARKET LARGELY DETERMINE THE PRICING FOR ITS PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY IS AT TIMES LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES AND PASS THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS ANY INFLATIONARY OR OTHER COST INCREASES THAT THE COMPANY MAY INCUR.  COMMITMENT TO COST REDUCTION  . IN LIGHT OF INCREASING MARGIN PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY HAS PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASE PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GLOBAL CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE THAT USES STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL TO HELP DESIGN AND MANAGE MANY TYPES OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. THIS INCLUDES A SIX SIGMA PROCESS FOCUSED ON REDUCING VARIABLE AND FIXED MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE TO INCLUDE THE DEPLOYMENT OF LEAN SIGMA PRINCIPLES INTO MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN SERVICES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGIC COST REDUCTIONS OR OTHER COST SAVINGS PLANS, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OTHER MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, ANY FAILURE TO GENERATE THE ANTICIPATED EFFICIENCIES AND SAVINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPETITION AND MARKET FACTORS.  AS SOME PRODUCTS CAN BE PACKAGED IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITION FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS\u2019 CRB, CUK, SBS, FOLDING BOX BOARD, AND RECYCLED CLAY-COATED NEWS. ADDITIONAL SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ALSO INCLUDE PLASTIC, SHRINK FILM AND CORRUGATED CONTAINERS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF ITS CUSTOMERS, THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS MAY BE RE-BID OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN RENEWING ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE COMPANY WORKS TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE THROUGH EFFICIENCY, PRODUCT INNOVATION AND STRATEGIC SOURCING TO ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY OCCASIONALLY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES HISTORICALLY ARE DRIVEN BY CONSUMER BUYING HABITS IN THE MARKETS ITS CUSTOMERS SERVE. CHANGES IN CONSUMER DIETARY HABITS AND PREFERENCES, INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF LIVING, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR. NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY BY THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S INTRODUCTION OF NEW PACKAGING PRODUCTS ALSO IMPACT ITS SALES.  DEBT OBLIGATIONS  . THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $3,188.7 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS DEBT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPANY, AS IT REQUIRES A PORTION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO BE USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO THE RISK OF INCREASED INTEREST RATES AND MAY RESTRICT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. COVENANTS IN THE COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND INDENTURES MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS, INCUR GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, PREPAY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, REPURCHASE STOCK, PAY DIVIDENDS, MAKE OTHER RESTRICTED PAYMENTS AND MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO COMPLY IN FUTURE PERIODS WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS WILL DEPEND ON ITS ONGOING FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHICH IN TURN WILL BE SUBJECT TO MANY OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. SEE \"COVENANT RESTRICTIONS\" IN \u201cFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  THE DEBT AND THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE INDENTURES COULD LIMIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THE OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND THE RESTRICTIONS MAY ALSO LEAVE THE COMPANY MORE VULNERABLE TO A DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ITS BUSINESS, OR UNABLE TO CARRY OUT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE NECESSARY OR IMPORTANT TO ITS GROWTH STRATEGY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (UNAUDITED; TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND STORE DATA)  THE 2019 AND 2018 FIRST QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE TWELVE-WEEK PERIODS ENDED MARCH 24, 2019 AND MARCH 25, 2018.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,100 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  FIRST QUARTER  OF 2019  FIRST QUARTER  OF 2018  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH  +4.6%  +16.8%  SAME STORE SALES GROWTH.

OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WAS PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE.  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 200 NET NEW STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. WE OPENED 173 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 27 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  15  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES WORLDWIDE, INCREASED 4.6% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $50.6 MILLION, OR 6.4%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES RESULTING FROM ORDER AND STORE COUNT GROWTH, AS WELL AS HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE, COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES RESULTING FROM STORE COUNT AND SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $10.0 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER STRATEGIC AREAS PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES IN INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $3.9 MILLION, OR 4.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, AS NOTED ABOVE. THIS INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE.

COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND FRANCHISED STORE REVENUES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO CHANGES IN STORE COUNT MIX. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AS WELL AS THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL.

U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES  REVENUES FROM U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.3 MILLION, OR 1.9%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES.

U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES  REVENUES FROM U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $7.2 MILLION, OR 8.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISED STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD.

OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 1.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $6.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDER COUNTS AT THE STORE LEVEL. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $2.2 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.7 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 5.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $22.4 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.

U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET INCREASED $4.6 MILLION, OR 15.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (\u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d) AND THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES DURING THE QUARTER. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, FROM 3.9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED $1.7 MILLION, OR 11.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED TO 15.1% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 14.3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $23.4 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $150.1 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $98.1 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $93.0 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $83.1 MILLION.  18  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF MARCH 24, 2019.  BASED UPON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $113.0 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $150.1 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $34.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.48 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $26.4 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD $25.0 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $101.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 33,549 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $242.74 PER SHARE. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $150.6 MILLION.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 448,008 SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $101.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $225.63 PER SHARE.  DIVIDENDS  ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MARCH 15, 2019 WHICH WAS PAID ON MARCH 29, 2019. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $27.2 MILLION ACCRUED FOR COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AT MARCH 24, 2019.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $12.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $12.2 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS).

SEE NOTE  13  FOR MORE INFORMATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW CONTINUED TO BE STRONG THROUGH THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  . A  DECREASE  IN NET WORKING CAPITAL OF  $686.3 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2018  WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES. CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT  INCREASED  $302.7 MILLION  WHILE CURRENT PORTION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES  INCREASED  $356.5 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF RECORDING OPERATING LEASES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS REQUIRED BY ASC 842 (SEE NOTE 2 AND NOTE 16). THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ARRANGE SUFFICIENT SHORT-TERM BORROWING CAPACITY AT REASONABLE RATES, AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY TO FUND ITS CURRENT OPERATING NEEDS. NET OPERATING CASH FOR THE  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS A CASH  USAGE  OF  $36.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO A CASH  SOURCE  OF  $40.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A NEW CUSTOMER PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN 2018, HIGHER PAINT SALES VOLUME IN NORTH AMERICA, AND SELLING PRICE INCREASES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOFT END MARKET DEMAND OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES  DECREASED  NET SALES BY  2.3%  IN THE QUARTER. CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  INCREASED  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  TO  42.9%  COMPARED TO  42.5%  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2018  .

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)  INCREASED  AS A PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES TO  30.8%  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  FROM  30.6%  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2018  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO NET NEW STORE OPENINGS IN THE AMERICAS GROUP. AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  DECREASED  $6.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  VERSUS  2018  , DUE TO ACQUISITION-RELATED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS. INTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  $0.6 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  VERSUS  2018  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  17.9%  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  17.6%  FOR THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2018  .

FIRST  QUARTER  2019  DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE INCLUDED A  $.71  PER SHARE CHARGE FOR ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND A  $.27  PER SHARE CHARGE FOR PENSION PLAN SETTLEMENT EXPENSE. CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES  DECREASED  DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  BY  $.08  PER SHARE.  FIRST  QUARTER  2018  DILUTED NET INCOME PER SHARE INCLUDED A  $.95  PER SHARE CHARGE FROM ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION AND FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MANAGEMENT. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CONTAIN CERTAIN AMOUNTS THAT WERE BASED UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT WERE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED THE IMPACT OF THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND UTILIZED CERTAIN OUTSIDE SOURCES OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION WHEN DEVELOPING THE BASIS FOR THEIR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT WAS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MANAGEMENT USED ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL RESULTS, CONSIDERING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS TO FORM THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING APPROPRIATE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WERE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. ALSO, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS MAY RESULT UNDER MATERIALLY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ECONOMIC TRENDS OR FROM USING MATERIALLY DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS. HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ANY MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM MATERIALLY DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OR MATERIAL CHANGES IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE UNLIKELY TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE CURRENT VALUATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WERE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES.

BANK OF AMERICA  2  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  THE CORPORATION IS A DELAWARE CORPORATION, A BANK HOLDING COMPANY (BHC) AND A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY. WHEN USED IN THIS REPORT, \u201cTHE CORPORATION\u201d MAY REFER TO BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION INDIVIDUALLY, BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR CERTAIN OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES OR AFFILIATES. OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.

CONSUMER BANKING  ,  GLOBAL WEALTH & INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT (GWIM)  ,  GLOBAL BANKING  AND  GLOBAL MARKETS  , WITH THE REMAINING OPERATIONS RECORDED IN  ALL OTHER  . WE OPERATE OUR BANKING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY UNDER THE BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. OR BANA) CHARTER. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE CORPORATION HAD  $2.4 TRILLION  IN ASSETS AND A HEADCOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  205,000  EMPLOYEES.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SERVED CLIENTS THROUGH OPERATIONS ACROSS THE U.S., ITS TERRITORIES AND APPROXIMATELY  35  COUNTRIES. OUR RETAIL BANKING FOOTPRINT COVERS APPROXIMATELY  86 PERCENT  OF THE U.S. POPULATION, AND WE SERVE APPROXIMATELY  66 MILLION  CONSUMER AND SMALL BUSINESS CLIENTS WITH APPROXIMATELY  4,400  RETAIL FINANCIAL CENTERS,  APPROXIMATELY  16,400  ATMS, AND LEADING DIGITAL BANKING PLATFORMS (WWW.BANKOFAMERICA.COM) WITH MORE THAN  37 MILLION  ACTIVE USERS, INCLUDING OVER  27 MILLION  ACTIVE MOBILE USERS.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REPURCHASED  $6.3 BILLION  OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\u2019 (THE BOARD) REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  ON PAGE  16.  U.K. EXIT FROM THE EU  A REFERENDUM HELD IN THE U.K. IN 2016 RESULTED IN A MAJORITY VOTE IN FAVOR OF EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). IN MARCH 2017, THE U.K. NOTIFIED THE EU OF ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU. IN APRIL 2019, THE DEADLINE FOR THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU WAS EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL COULD OCCUR  SOONER IF THE U.K. PASSES A WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU REGARDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE WITHDRAWAL ARE ONGOING.  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE U.K., IRELAND AND FRANCE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.K.\u2019S INTENTION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO HOW WE OPERATE IN THE REGION, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A BANK AND BROKER-DEALER IN THE EU.  \u25cf  BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH INTERNATIONAL DESIGNATED ACTIVITY COMPANY (BAMLI DAC), OUR MAIN BANKING ENTITY IN IRELAND, WAS ESTABLISHED IN LATE 2018 THROUGH THE MERGER OF TWO ENTITIES. BAMLI DAC PROVIDES BANKING SERVICES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS BRANCH NETWORK. RELIANCE ON THE EU\u2019S CROSS-BORDER MERGER DIRECTIVE ENABLED BAMLI DAC TO MIGRATE CLIENT POSITIONS, WITH DECREASED LEGAL COMPLEXITY AND OPERATIONAL RISK.  \u25cf  BOFA SECURITIES EUROPE SA (BOFASE), A NEWLY FORMED INVESTMENT FIRM IN FRANCE, WAS SET UP TO DELIVER INVESTMENT SERVICES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA EXCLUDING THE U.K. AND IS NOW OPERATIONAL.  \u25cf  MERRILL LYNCH INTERNATIONAL (MLI) CONTINUES TO BE OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT FIRM IN THE U.K.  \u25cf  BANA, INCLUDING ITS LONDON BRANCH, CONTINUES TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN THE EU AND THE U.K.  THESE CHANGES WILL ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE OUR CLIENTS WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTION, RETAIN OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, MINIMIZE TRANSITION RISKS AND MAXIMIZE LEGAL ENTITY EFFICIENCIES, INDEPENDENT OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF THE WITHDRAWAL.  TO FACILITATE CLIENT READINESS AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL RISK, BOFASE AND BAMLI DAC CONTINUE TO EXECUTE INTERNAL AND CLIENT-RELATED TESTING ACTIVITIES ACROSS PRODUCT AND BUSINESS LINES. MIGRATION OF CLIENT ACTIVITY TO BOFASE AND BAMLI DAC BEGAN IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION AND PREPARE FOR VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU, THE PREPAREDNESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE RELEVANT FINANCIAL MARKETS INFRASTRUCTURE REMAIN OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND COULD RESULT IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS. IN PREPARATION FOR THE WITHDRAWAL, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING OPERATIONAL, REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS.  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WE MADE CERTAIN FINANCIAL REPORTING CHANGES AND RECLASSIFICATIONS, WHICH WERE ADOPTED ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE CHANGES AND RECLASSIFICATIONS REFLECT CHANGES TO BOTH THE FORMAT OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME AND SEGMENT ALLOCATIONS.

THE IMPROVEMENT IN NET INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND A DECLINE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NONINTEREST INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  TOTAL ASSETS  INCREASED  $22.7 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  $2.4 TRILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS DUE TO INCREASED CLIENT BALANCES IN THE EQUITIES BUSINESSES IN  GLOBAL MARKETS  AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER AND OTHER RECEIVABLES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY IN  GLOBAL MARKETS.  TOTAL LIABILITIES  INCREASED  $21.0 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  $2.1 TRILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ACCOUNT LIABILITIES DUE TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY IN  GLOBAL MARKETS  AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER LIABILITIES DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS DUE TO LOWER FUNDING NEEDS AS A RESULT OF DEPOSIT GROWTH. SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  INCREASED  $1.7 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME AND MARKET VALUE INCREASES ON DEBT SECURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RETURNS OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.  NET INTEREST INCOME  NET INTEREST INCOME  INCREASED  $606 MILLION  TO  $12.4 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. NET INTEREST YIELD ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS  INCREASED  9  BASIS POINTS (BPS) TO  2.51 PERCENT  . THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES AS WELL AS LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH, MODESTLY OFFSET BY LOAN SPREAD COMPRESSION. WE EXPECT FULL-YEAR 2019 NET INTEREST INCOME TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY THREE PERCENT COMPARED TO FULL-YEAR 2018 ASSUMING THE INTEREST RATE FORWARD CURVE AS OF APRIL 16, 2019 WHEN THE FIRST QUARTER RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED, AND LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

THE FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.  \u25cf  SERVICE CHARGES  DECREASED  $82 MILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER TREASURY SERVICES-RELATED REVENUE AND CREDIT FEES IN  GLOBAL BANKING,  AS WELL AS LOWER OVERDRAFT FEES DUE TO POLICY CHANGES AND LOWER ATM VOLUME IN  CONSUMER BANKING.  \u2022  INVESTMENT AND BROKERAGE SERVICES INCOME  DECREASED  $304 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE MARKET VALUATIONS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND DECLINES IN TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (AUM) PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF AUM FLOWS. THE DECLINE IN TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY RESULTING IN LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY.  \u25cf  INVESTMENT BANKING FEES  DECREASED  $89 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADVISORY FEES.  \u25cf  TRADING ACCOUNT INCOME  DECREASED  $215 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY ACROSS FIXED-INCOME, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  INCREASED  $179 MILLION  TO  $1.0 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SINGLE-NAME UTILITY CLIENT CHARGE-OFF IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD AND ENERGY RESERVE RELEASES IN COMMERCIAL IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, A SLOWER PACE OF PORTFOLIO IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER REAL ESTATE, AND PORTFOLIO SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EFFICIENCY SAVINGS, LOWER FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) EXPENSE AND LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  TABLE 4  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $8,767  $8,394  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  1,456  1,476  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  16.6%  17.6%  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR RECURRING TAX PREFERENCE BENEFITS AND TAX BENEFITS FROM DEDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. WE EXPECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT, ABSENT UNUSUAL ITEMS.  SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA  IN THIS FORM 10-Q, WE PRESENT CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS OR OTHERWISE INCLUDE COMPONENTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE PROVIDED AS ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (INCLUDING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE) OR COMPLIANCE WITH PROSPECTIVE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY NOT BE DEFINED OR CALCULATED THE SAME WAY AS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE VIEW NET INTEREST INCOME AND RELATED RATIOS AND ANALYSES ON AN FTE BASIS, WHICH WHEN PRESENTED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TO DERIVE THE FTE BASIS, NET INTEREST INCOME IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT TAX-EXEMPT INCOME ON AN EQUIVALENT BEFORE-TAX BASIS WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN  INCOME TAX EXPENSE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CALCULATION, WE USE THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21 PERCENT AND A REPRESENTATIVE STATE TAX RATE. NET INTEREST YIELD, WHICH MEASURES THE BASIS POINTS WE EARN OVER THE COST OF FUNDS, UTILIZES NET INTEREST INCOME (AND THUS TOTAL REVENUE) ON AN FTE BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTATION OF THESE ITEMS ON AN FTE BASIS ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON OF AMOUNTS FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES.  WE MAY PRESENT CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RATIOS EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS (E.G., DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (DVA) GAINS (LOSSES)) WHICH RESULT IN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS IS USEFUL BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ASSESS THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND TO ALLOW BETTER COMPARISON OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  WE ALSO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS BASED ON CERTAIN RATIOS THAT UTILIZE TANGIBLE EQUITY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. TANGIBLE EQUITY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AMOUNT WHICH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS)), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE USED TO EVALUATE OUR USE OF EQUITY. IN ADDITION, PROFITABILITY, RELATIONSHIP AND INVESTMENT MODELS USE BOTH RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AND RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS KEY MEASURES TO SUPPORT OUR OVERALL GROWTH GOALS.

FICC REVENUE  DECREASED  $198 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  DUE TO A REDUCTION IN CLIENT ACTIVITY. THE DECLINE IN FICC REVENUE WAS ALSO  IMPACTED BY HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. EQUITIES REVENUE  DECREASED  $333 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , WHICH BENEFITED FROM HIGHER MARKET VOLATILITY RESULTING IN HIGHER CLIENT VOLUMES AND A STRONG TRADING PERFORMANCE IN DERIVATIVES.

RESULTS FOR  ALL OTHER  WERE A NET LOSS OF  $48 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN REVENUE AND A LOWER BENEFIT IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NONINTEREST EXPENSE.  REVENUE  DECREASED  $208 MILLION  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME FROM LOWER LOAN BALANCES, PRIMARILY NON-CORE LOANS, AND A DECREASE IN NONINTEREST INCOME.  THE BENEFIT IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES DECREASED  $98 MILLION  TO  $54 MILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLOWER PACE OF PORTFOLIO IMPROVEMENT.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  $82 MILLION  TO  $418 MILLION  REFLECTING LOWER NON-CORE MORTGAGE COSTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VOLUME, A DECREASE IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND LOWER FDIC EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING EXPENSE.  THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT INCREASED  $173 MILLION  REFLECTING A HIGHER PRETAX LOSS AS WELL AS INCREASED INCOME TAX BENEFIT ADJUSTMENTS TO ELIMINATE THE FTE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TAX CREDITS RECORDED IN  GLOBAL BANKING.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS ON DEBT AND LEASE AGREEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WHEREBY WE COMMIT TO FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM UNAFFILIATED PARTIES.

MANAGING RISK  RISK IS INHERENT IN ALL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE SEVEN KEY TYPES OF RISK FACED BY THE CORPORATION ARE STRATEGIC, CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY, COMPLIANCE, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL. SOUND RISK MANAGEMENT ENABLES US TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND DELIVER FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. IF NOT MANAGED WELL, RISKS CAN RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS, REGULATORY SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, EACH OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES. THE CORPORATION TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT WITH A DEFINED RISK FRAMEWORK AND AN ARTICULATED RISK APPETITE STATEMENT WHICH ARE APPROVED ANNUALLY BY THE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD.  OUR RISK FRAMEWORK IS THE FOUNDATION FOR CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS FACING THE CORPORATION. THE RISK FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH CLEAR ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RISK AND PROVIDES A BLUEPRINT FOR HOW THE BOARD, THROUGH DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, ESTABLISHES RISK APPETITE AND ASSOCIATED LIMITS FOR OUR ACTIVITIES.  OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS AN ACCEPTABLE RISK PROFILE BY PROVIDING A COMMON FRAMEWORK AND A COMPARABLE SET OF MEASURES FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD TO CLEARLY INDICATE THE LEVEL OF RISK THE CORPORATION IS WILLING TO ACCEPT. RISK APPETITE IS SET AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND IS ALIGNED WITH THE CORPORATION\u2019S STRATEGIC, CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL OPERATING PLANS. OUR LINE OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND RISK APPETITE ARE ALSO SIMILARLY ALIGNED.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR RISK FRAMEWORK, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE KEY TYPES OF RISK FACED BY THE CORPORATION, SEE THE  MANAGING RISK  THROUGH REPUTATIONAL RISK SECTIONS IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  THE CORPORATION MANAGES ITS CAPITAL POSITION SO THAT ITS CAPITAL IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ALIGNS WITH RISK, RISK APPETITE AND STRATEGIC PLANNING. ADDITIONALLY, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AT ALL TIMES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE SCENARIOS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, MEET OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES, MAINTAIN READY ACCESS TO FINANCIAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A CREDIT INTERMEDIARY, REMAIN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND SATISFY CURRENT AND FUTURE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR RISK AND GOVERNANCE PROCESSES, AS CAPITAL IS A KEY CONSIDERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, RISK APPETITE AND RISK LIMITS.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND ALLOCATE CAPITAL ANNUALLY DURING THE STRATEGIC AND CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATIONS  ON PAGE  8.  CCAR AND CAPITAL PLANNING  THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE) REQUIRES BHCS TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN AND REQUESTS FOR CAPITAL ACTIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES GOVERNING THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) CAPITAL PLAN.  IN ADDITION TO OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO REPURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REPURCHASED  $6.3 BILLION  OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE BOARD'S REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \u2013 CCAR AND CAPITAL PLANNING IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION\u2019S CAPITAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF CAPITAL, STOCK TRADING PRICE AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. THE REPURCHASES MAY BE EFFECTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING REPURCHASE PLANS THAT SATISFY THE CONDITIONS OF RULE 10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. AS A \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d BHC, WE MAY NOTIFY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OF OUR INTENTION TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS NOT TO EXCEED 0.25 PERCENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL,  BANK OF AMERICA  16  AND WHICH WERE NOT CONTEMPLATED IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN, SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S NON-OBJECTION.  IN APRIL 2019, WE SUBMITTED OUR 2019 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN AND RELATED SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL RELEASE CCAR CAPITAL PLAN SUMMARY RESULTS, INCLUDING SUPERVISORY PROJECTIONS OF CAPITAL RATIOS, LOSSES AND REVENUES UNDER STRESS SCENARIOS, AND PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS CONDUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISORY ADVERSE AND SUPERVISORY SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIOS BY JUNE 30, 2019.  REGULATORY CAPITAL  AS A FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES, INCLUDING BASEL 3, ISSUED BY U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. THE CORPORATION AND ITS PRIMARY AFFILIATED BANKING ENTITY, BANA, ARE ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS UNDER BASEL 3 AND ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS UNDER BOTH THE STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES. THE APPROACH THAT YIELDS THE LOWER RATIO IS USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY INCLUDING UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) FRAMEWORK. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1) AND TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS FOR THE CORPORATION WERE LOWER UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH WHEREAS THE ADVANCED APPROACHES YIELDED A LOWER TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BASEL 3, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED BUFFERS WERE FULLY PHASED IN AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019. THE PCA FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED  CATEGORIES OF CAPITALIZATION, INCLUDING WELL CAPITALIZED, BASED ON THE BASEL 3 REGULATORY RATIO REQUIREMENTS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE CERTAIN MANDATORY ACTIONS DEPENDING ON THE CATEGORY OF CAPITALIZATION, WITH NO MANDATORY ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR WELL-CAPITALIZED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.  IN ORDER TO AVOID RESTRICTIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS, THE CORPORATION MUST MEET RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS THAT INCLUDE A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER GREATER THAN 2.5 PERCENT, PLUS ANY APPLICABLE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AND A GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK (G-SIB) SURCHARGE. THE BUFFERS AND SURCHARGE MUST BE COMPRISED SOLELY OF CET1 CAPITAL.  THE CORPORATION IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (SLR) OF 3.0 PERCENT PLUS A LEVERAGE BUFFER OF 2.0 PERCENT IN ORDER TO AVOID CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS. OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM 6.0 PERCENT SLR TO BE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED UNDER THE PCA FRAMEWORK.

MLPCC\u2019S NET CAPITAL OF $4.9 BILLION EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF $588 MILLION BY $4.3 BILLION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MLPF&S IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION AND TO NOTIFY THE SEC IN THE EVENT ITS TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5.0 BILLION. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , MLPF&S HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.  AS A RESULT OF RESOLUTION PLANNING, THE CURRENT BUSINESS OF MLPF&S IS EXPECTED TO BE REORGANIZED INTO TWO AFFILIATED BROKER-  DEALERS: MLPF&S AND BOFA SECURITIES, INC., A NEWLY FORMED BROKER-DEALER. UNDER THE CONTEMPLATED REORGANIZATION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, BOFA SECURITIES, INC. WOULD BECOME THE LEGAL ENTITY FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE NOW PROVIDED BY MLPF&S. MLPF&S\u2019 RETAIL SERVICES WOULD REMAIN WITH MLPF&S.

MLI, A U.K. INVESTMENT FIRM, IS REGULATED BY THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY, AND IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , MLI\u2019S CAPITAL RESOURCES WERE $35.0 BILLION, WHICH EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM PILLAR 1 REQUIREMENT OF $13.6 BILLION.  LIQUIDITY RISK  FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  OUR PRIMARY LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO MEET EXPECTED OR UNEXPECTED CASH FLOW AND COLLATERAL NEEDS WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AND CUSTOMERS UNDER A RANGE OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE, WE ANALYZE AND MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY RISK UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSED CONDITIONS, MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING OUR STABLE DEPOSIT BASE, AND SEEK TO ALIGN LIQUIDITY-RELATED INCENTIVES AND RISKS.  WE DEFINE LIQUIDITY AS READILY AVAILABLE ASSETS, LIMITED TO CASH AND HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID, UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES THAT WE CAN USE TO MEET OUR CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARISE. WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THROUGH LINE OF BUSINESS AND ALM ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR LEGAL ENTITY FUNDING STRATEGY, ON BOTH A FORWARD AND CURRENT (INCLUDING INTRADAY) BASIS UNDER BOTH EXPECTED AND STRESSED CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT A CENTRALIZED APPROACH TO FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ENHANCES OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, MAXIMIZES ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES, MINIMIZES BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATES TIMELY RESPONSES TO LIQUIDITY EVENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING GLOBAL FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY SOURCES, LIQUIDITY ARRANGEMENTS, CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND CREDIT RATINGS DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE  LIQUIDITY RISK  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  19  BANK OF AMERICA  NB HOLDINGS CORPORATION  WE HAVE INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN KEY SUBSIDIARIES UNDER WHICH WE TRANSFERRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, AS THE PARENT COMPANY, WHICH IS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITY FROM OUR BANKING AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES, AND AGREED TO TRANSFER CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PARENT COMPANY ASSETS NOT NEEDED TO SATISFY ANTICIPATED NEAR-TERM EXPENDITURES, TO NB HOLDINGS CORPORATION, A WHOLLY-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARY (NB HOLDINGS). THE PARENT COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME FLOW OF DIVIDENDS, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS OF CASH NECESSARY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT, PAY DIVIDENDS AND PERFORM OTHER OBLIGATIONS AS IT WOULD HAVE HAD IF IT HAD NOT ENTERED INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND TRANSFERRED ANY ASSETS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS SUPPORT OUR PREFERRED SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY RESOLUTION STRATEGY, UNDER WHICH ONLY THE PARENT COMPANY WOULD BE RESOLVED UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE.  GLOBAL LIQUIDITY SOURCES AND OTHER UNENCUMBERED ASSETS  TABLE 12  PRESENTS AVERAGE GLOBAL LIQUIDITY SOURCES (GLS) FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

TYPICALLY, PARENT COMPANY AND NB HOLDINGS LIQUIDITY IS IN THE FORM OF CASH DEPOSITED WITH BANA.  OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 LIQUIDITY IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DEPOSIT AND LENDING ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS SECURITIES VALUATION AND NET DEBT ACTIVITY. LIQUIDITY AT BANK SUBSIDIARIES EXCLUDES THE CASH DEPOSITED BY THE PARENT COMPANY AND NB HOLDINGS. OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES CAN ALSO GENERATE INCREMENTAL LIQUIDITY BY PLEDGING A RANGE OF UNENCUMBERED LOANS AND SECURITIES TO CERTAIN FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (FHLBS) AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW. THE CASH WE COULD HAVE OBTAINED BY BORROWING AGAINST THIS POOL OF SPECIFICALLY-IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE ASSETS WAS  $354 BILLION  AND  $344 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES TO ENABLE US TO BORROW AGAINST THESE ASSETS, INCLUDING REGULARLY MONITORING OUR TOTAL POOL OF ELIGIBLE LOANS AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL. ELIGIBILITY IS DEFINED IN GUIDELINES FROM THE FHLBS AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT THEIR DISCRETION. DUE TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY GENERATED BY THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES CAN GENERALLY BE USED ONLY TO FUND OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AND TRANSFERS TO THE PARENT COMPANY OR NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.  LIQUIDITY HELD IN OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES, COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, IS PRIMARILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THAT ENTITY AND TRANSFERS TO THE PARENT COMPANY OR TO ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL DUE TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. OUR OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES ALSO HOLD UNENCUMBERED INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES AND EQUITIES THAT WE BELIEVE COULD BE USED TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, HQLA FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING LCR IS NOT REPORTED AT MARKET VALUE, BUT AT A LOWER VALUE THAT INCORPORATES REGULATORY DEDUCTIONS AND THE EXCLUSION OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY HELD AT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. THE LCR IS CALCULATED AS THE AMOUNT OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\u2019S UNENCUMBERED HQLA RELATIVE TO THE ESTIMATED NET CASH OUTFLOWS THE INSTITUTION COULD ENCOUNTER OVER A 30-DAY PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY STRESS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE. OUR AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED HQLA, ON A NET BASIS, WAS  $444 BILLION  AND  $446 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . FOR THE SAME PERIODS, THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED LCR WAS  115 PERCENT  AND  118 PERCENT  . OUR LCR WILL FLUCTUATE DUE TO NORMAL BUSINESS FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER ACTIVITY.  LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS  WE UTILIZE LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS TO ASSIST US IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF LIQUIDITY TO MAINTAIN AT THE PARENT COMPANY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER A RANGE OF SCENARIOS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS, SEE  LIQUIDITY RISK \u2013 LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES  WE FUND OUR ASSETS PRIMARILY WITH A MIX OF DEPOSITS, AND SECURED AND UNSECURED LIABILITIES THROUGH A CENTRALIZED, GLOBALLY COORDINATED FUNDING APPROACH DIVERSIFIED ACROSS PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, MARKETS, CURRENCIES AND INVESTOR GROUPS. WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES THROUGH OUR DEPOSITS, WHICH WERE  $1.38 TRILLION  AT BOTH  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OUR TRADING ACTIVITIES IN OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS THROUGH SECURITIES LENDING AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND THESE AMOUNTS WILL VARY BASED ON CUSTOMER ACTIVITY AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  LONG-TERM DEBT  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ISSUED  $14.7 BILLION  OF LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTING OF  $9.6 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TLAC ELIGIBLE,  $1.5 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. AND  $3.6 BILLION  OF OTHER DEBT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LONG-TERM, TLAC-ELIGIBLE SENIOR NOTES ISSUED BY BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION SINCE LATE 2016 ARE CALLABLE, AT OUR OPTION, AT LEAST ONE YEAR BEFORE EACH STATED MATURITY DATE. THE CALL FEATURES GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO RETIRE LONG-TERM NOTES BEFORE THEIR FINAL YEAR OUTSTANDING, WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO COUNT TOWARD TLAC REQUIREMENTS, AND REPLACE THEM WITH NEW TLAC-ELIGIBLE DEBT, SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO DO SO.  BANK OF AMERICA  20  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT MATURITIES AND REDEMPTIONS IN THE AGGREGATE OF  $14.3 BILLION  CONSISTING OF  $6.2 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION,  $5.6 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA, N.A.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ALM ACTIVITIES, SEE  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  ON PAGE  39.  WE MAY ISSUE UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FORM OF STRUCTURED NOTES FOR CLIENT PURPOSES, CERTAIN OF WHICH QUALIFY AS TLAC-ELIGIBLE DEBT. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ISSUED  $1.8 BILLION  OF STRUCTURED NOTES, WHICH ARE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT PAY INVESTORS RETURNS LINKED TO OTHER DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, INDICES,  CURRENCIES OR COMMODITIES. WE TYPICALLY HEDGE THE RETURNS WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ON THESE LIABILITIES WITH DERIVATIVES AND/OR INVESTMENTS IN THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS, SO THAT FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE, THE COST IS SIMILAR TO OUR OTHER UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTE OBLIGATIONS FOR CASH OR OTHER SECURITIES PRIOR TO MATURITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH WE CONSIDER FOR LIQUIDITY PLANNING PURPOSES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT A PORTION OF SUCH BORROWINGS WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING BEYOND THE EARLIEST PUT OR REDEMPTION DATE.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN NO PROVISIONS THAT COULD TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY REPAYMENT, REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL SUPPORT, RESULT IN CHANGES TO TERMS, ACCELERATE MATURITY OR CREATE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR STOCK PRICE.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO BEGINS WITH INITIAL UNDERWRITING AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT A BORROWER\u2019S CREDIT CYCLE. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXPERIENTIAL JUDGMENT ARE USED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, PRODUCT PRICING, RISK APPETITE, SETTING CREDIT LIMITS, AND ESTABLISHING OPERATING PROCESSES AND METRICS TO QUANTIFY AND BALANCE RISKS AND RETURNS. STATISTICAL MODELS ARE BUILT USING DETAILED BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES SUCH AS CREDIT BUREAUS AND/OR INTERNAL HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ARE A COMPONENT OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THESE MODELS ARE USED IN PART TO ASSIST IN MAKING BOTH NEW AND ONGOING CREDIT DECISIONS, AS WELL AS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING AUTHORIZATIONS AND LINE MANAGEMENT, COLLECTION PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES, AND DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND ALLOCATED CAPITAL FOR CREDIT RISK.  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES CONTINUED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  RESULTING IN IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . ADDITIONALLY, LOWER CREDIT LOSSES IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY AND CONTINUED LOAN BALANCE RUNOFF PRIMARILY IN THE NON-CORE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SEASONING WITHIN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, DROVE A  $46 MILLION  DECREASE  IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  TO  $4.8 BILLION  .

IN ADDITION TO MODIFYING CONSUMER REAL ESTATE LOANS, WE WORK WITH CUSTOMERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY BY MODIFYING CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CONSUMER LOANS. CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CONSUMER LOAN MODIFICATIONS GENERALLY INVOLVE A REDUCTION IN THE CUSTOMER\u2019S INTEREST RATE ON THE ACCOUNT AND PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS, ALL OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TDRS (THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO).  MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE MADE THROUGH RENEGOTIATION PROGRAMS UTILIZING DIRECT CUSTOMER CONTACT, BUT MAY ALSO UTILIZE EXTERNAL RENEGOTIATION PROGRAMS. THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO IS EXCLUDED IN LARGE PART FROM  TABLE 26  AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LOANS REMAIN ON ACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL EITHER CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO WAS  $600 MILLION  AND  $566 MILLION  , OF WHICH  $510 MILLION  AND  $481 MILLION  WERE CURRENT OR LESS THAN 30 DAYS PAST DUE UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE  INCREASE  IN THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW RENEGOTIATED ENROLLMENTS OUTPACING RUNOFF OF EXISTING PORTFOLIOS.  COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK IS EVALUATED AND MANAGED WITH THE GOAL THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE CONTINUE TO BE ALIGNED WITH OUR RISK APPETITE. WE REVIEW, MEASURE AND MANAGE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND LOAN SIZE. WE ALSO REVIEW, MEASURE AND MANAGE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND PROPERTY TYPE. IN ADDITION, WITHIN OUR NON-U.S. PORTFOLIO, WE EVALUATE EXPOSURES BY REGION AND BY COUNTRY. TABLES  32  ,  35  AND  38  SUMMARIZE OUR CONCENTRATIONS. WE ALSO UTILIZE SYNDICATIONS OF EXPOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES, LOAN SALES, HEDGING AND OTHER RISK MITIGATION  TECHNIQUES  TO  MANAGE  THE  SIZE  AND  RISK  PROFILE  OF  THE  COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO.

CREDIT QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BORROWERS IN MOST SECTORS REMAINED STABLE WITH CONSERVATIVE LTV RATIOS. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS EXPERIENCED SLOWING TENANT DEMAND AND DECELERATING RENTAL INCOME.  TOTAL COMMERCIAL UTILIZED CREDIT EXPOSURE  DECREASED  $3.1 BILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  TO  $617.9 BILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER HELD-FOR-SALE LOAN EXPOSURE.

THE OUTLOOK FOR POLICY DIRECTION AND THEREFORE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REDUCED POLITICAL COHESION AMONG EU COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.K.\u2019S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE A FAVORABLE EXIT FROM THE EU WILL FURTHER WEIGH ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE.

OUR LARGEST EU COUNTRY EXPOSURE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS THE U.K. WITH NET EXPOSURE OF  $53.7 BILLION  , WHICH REPRESENTS A  $1.1 BILLION  DECREASE FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN CORPORATE EXPOSURE.  WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR OUR EXPOSURES TO TARIFF-SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES AND OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE, PARTICULARLY TO COUNTRIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF U.S. TRADE, IN LIGHT OF ONGOING TRADE TENSIONS.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  INCREASED  $179 MILLION  TO  $1.0 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS  $22 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , RESULTING IN  AN INCREASE  IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THIS COMPARED TO  A REDUCTION  OF  $77 MILLION  IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE  $991 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $911 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. WE EXPECT NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR EACH OF THE REMAINING QUARTERS IN 2019 TO APPROXIMATE THIS QUARTER\u2019S NET CHARGE-OFFS, ASSUMING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE.  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO  INCREASED  $82 MILLION  TO  $830 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLOWER PACE OF PORTFOLIO IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, AND SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO.  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS,  INCREASED  $97 MILLION  TO  $183 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SINGLE-NAME UTILITY CLIENT CHARGE-OFF AND ENERGY RESERVE RELEASES IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES IS COMPRISED OF TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST COMPONENT COVERS NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS AND TDRS. THE SECOND COMPONENT COVERS LOANS AND LEASES ON WHICH THERE ARE INCURRED LOSSES THAT ARE NOT YET INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE, AS WELL AS INCURRED LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THE LOSS FORECAST MODELS, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. WE EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES BASED ON THE TOTAL OF THESE TWO COMPONENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES EXCLUDES LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE (LHFS) AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AS THE FAIR VALUE REFLECTS A CREDIT RISK COMPONENT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THE FACTORS THAT IMPACTED THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES INCLUDED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS DRIVEN BY CONTINUING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND STRONG LABOR MARKETS, PROACTIVE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND THE IMPACT OF HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ORIGINATIONS. EVIDENCING THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND STRONG LABOR MARKETS ARE LOW LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCREASES IN HOME PRICES. IN ADDITION TO THESE IMPROVEMENTS, IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, NONPERFORMING CONSUMER LOANS  DECREASED  $264 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS RETURNS TO PERFORMING STATUS, PAYDOWNS, CHARGE-OFFS AND LOAN SALES CONTINUED TO OUTPACE NEW NONACCRUAL LOANS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, AS PRESENTED IN  TABLE 40  , WAS  $4.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $46 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO WAS DUE TO IMPROVED HOME PRICES, LOWER NONPERFORMING LOANS AND A DECREASE IN LOAN BALANCES IN OUR NON-CORE PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO WAS DRIVEN BY PORTFOLIO SEASONING.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, AS PRESENTED IN  TABLE 40  , WAS  $4.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $22 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . COMMERCIAL RESERVABLE CRITICIZED UTILIZED EXPOSURE  INCREASED  TO  $11.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $11.1 BILLION  (TO  2.22 PERCENT  FROM  2.08 PERCENT  OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL RESERVABLE UTILIZED EXPOSURE) AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS  INCREASED  TO  $1.3 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $1.1 BILLION  (TO  0.26 PERCENT  FROM  0.22 PERCENT  OF OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL LOANS EXCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION) AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WITH THE INCREASES SPREAD ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES. SEE TABLES  29  ,  30  AND  31  FOR MORE DETAILS ON KEY COMMERCIAL CREDIT STATISTICS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES OUTSTANDING WAS  1.02 PERCENT  AT BOTH  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS  IN ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, WE ALSO ESTIMATE PROBABLE LOSSES RELATED TO UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, UNFUNDED BANKERS\u2019 ACCEPTANCES AND BINDING LOAN COMMITMENTS, EXCLUDING COMMITMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT  TO EVALUATE RISK IN OUR TRADING ACTIVITIES, WE FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF REVENUES GENERATED BY INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS AS WELL AS PORTFOLIOS OF POSITIONS.  VAR IS A COMMON STATISTIC USED TO MEASURE MARKET RISK AS IT ALLOWS THE AGGREGATION OF MARKET RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. A VAR MODEL SIMULATES THE VALUE OF A PORTFOLIO UNDER A RANGE OF SCENARIOS IN ORDER TO GENERATE A DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL GAINS AND LOSSES. VAR REPRESENTS THE LOSS A PORTFOLIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEED MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES PER PERIOD, BASED ON A SPECIFIED HOLDING PERIOD, CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND WINDOW OF HISTORICAL DATA. WE USE ONE VAR MODEL CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS, AND IT USES A HISTORICAL SIMULATION APPROACH BASED ON A THREE-YEAR WINDOW OF HISTORICAL DATA. OUR PRIMARY VAR STATISTIC IS EQUIVALENT TO A 99 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THAT FOR A VAR WITH A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD, THERE SHOULD NOT BE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF VAR, ON AVERAGE, 99 OUT OF 100 TRADING DAYS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  TABLE 41  PRESENTS THE TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO VAR WHICH IS THE COMBINATION OF THE TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS (AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS) PORTFOLIO AND THE FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO.

THE TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO VAR RESULTS IN  TABLE 41  INCLUDE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED FROM ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, EXCLUDING CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), DVA AND RELATED HEDGES. THE MAJORITY OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS WITHIN THE  GLOBAL MARKETS  SEGMENT.

THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN  TABLE 41  AND  TABLE 42  ALIGN TO THE VIEW OF COVERED POSITIONS USED IN THE BASEL 3 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY POSITIONS ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERED COVERED POSITIONS, REGARDLESS OF TRADING OR BANKING TREATMENT FOR THE TRADE, EXCEPT FOR STRUCTURAL FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS THAT ARE EXCLUDED WITH PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS PORTFOLIO VAR INCREASED MODESTLY FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION FROM CHANGES IN THE EQUITY RISK PROFILE IN THE PORTFOLIO.  37  BANK OF AMERICA  TABLE 41  MARKET RISK VAR FOR TRADING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  MARCH 31, 2018  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  $8  $6  $10  $4  $9  $7  $13  $3  $8  $8  $12  $6  INTEREST RATE  38  28  49  17  36  28  45  18  33  23  33  18  CREDIT  21  21  26  18  26  25  29  23  28  27  31  23  EQUITY  26  19  26  14  20  25  40  15  16  19  28  14  COMMODITIES  5  7  13  4  13  9  15  6  10  6  12  3  PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (61  )  (48  )  \u2014  \u2014  (59  )  (60  )  \u2014  \u2014  (57  )  (49  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS PORTFOLIO  37  33  47  25  45  34  45  26  38  34  43  25  IMPACT FROM LESS LIQUID EXPOSURES  4  4  \u2014  \u2014  5  2  \u2014  \u2014  4  6  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS PORTFOLIO  41  37  53  28  50  36  51  26  42  40  51  29  FAIR VALUE OPTION LOANS  7  8  10  7  8  9  12  8  12  10  12  8  FAIR VALUE OPTION HEDGES  4  10  17  4  5  6  7  4  9  8  10  6  FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (6  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  (7  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  (11  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO  5  9  16  5  6  6  8  5  10  9  10  7  PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (4  )  (6  )  \u2014  \u2014  (3  )  (4  )  \u2014  \u2014  (3  )  (4  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO  $42  $40  56  30  $53  $38  54  28  $49  $45  57  33  (1)  THE HIGH AND LOW FOR EACH PORTFOLIO MAY HAVE OCCURRED ON DIFFERENT TRADING DAYS THAN THE HIGH AND LOW FOR THE COMPONENTS.

A BACKTESTING EXCESS OCCURS WHEN A TRADING LOSS EXCEEDS THE VAR FOR THE CORRESPONDING DAY. THESE EXCESSES ARE EVALUATED TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITIONS AND MARKET MOVES THAT PRODUCED THE TRADING LOSS WITH A GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE VAR METHODOLOGY ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THOSE LOSSES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR BACKTESTING PROCESS, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT \u2013 BACKTESTING  IN THE MD&A OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE NO DAYS IN WHICH THERE WAS A BACKTESTING EXCESS FOR OUR TOTAL COVERED PORTFOLIO VAR, UTILIZING A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD.  TOTAL TRADING-RELATED REVENUE  TOTAL TRADING-RELATED REVENUE, EXCLUDING BROKERAGE FEES, AND CVA, DVA AND FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), REPRESENTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT EARNED FROM TRADING POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH ARE TAKEN IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MARKETS.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE, SEE  NOTE 20 \u2013 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  . TRADING-RELATED REVENUE CAN BE VOLATILE AND IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER DEMAND. ALSO, TRADING-RELATED REVENUE IS DEPENDENT ON THE VOLUME AND TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS, THE LEVEL OF RISK ASSUMED, AND THE VOLATILITY OF PRICE AND RATE MOVEMENTS AT ANY GIVEN TIME WITHIN THE EVER-CHANGING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. SIGNIFICANT DAILY REVENUE BY BUSINESS IS MONITORED AND THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THESE ARE REVIEWED.  THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM IS A GRAPHIC DEPICTION OF TRADING VOLATILITY AND ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY LEVEL OF TRADING-RELATED REVENUE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , POSITIVE TRADING-RELATED REVENUE WAS RECORDED FOR 100 PERCENT OF THE TRADING DAYS, OF WHICH 89 PERCENT WERE DAILY TRADING GAINS OF OVER $25 MILLION. THIS COMPARES TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WHERE POSITIVE TRADING-RELATED REVENUE WAS RECORDED FOR 95 PERCENT OF THE TRADING DAYS, OF WHICH 53 PERCENT WERE DAILY TRADING GAINS OF OVER $25 MILLION.  TRADING PORTFOLIO STRESS TESTING  BECAUSE THE VERY NATURE OF A VAR MODEL SUGGESTS RESULTS CAN EXCEED OUR ESTIMATES AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON A LIMITED HISTORICAL WINDOW, WE ALSO STRESS TEST OUR PORTFOLIO USING SCENARIO ANALYSIS. THIS ANALYSIS ESTIMATES THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF OUR TRADING PORTFOLIO THAT MAY RESULT FROM ABNORMAL MARKET MOVEMENTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME FOR BANKING BOOK ACTIVITIES.  INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TO OUR BANKING BOOK BALANCE SHEET. INTEREST RATE RISK IS MEASURED AS THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME CAUSED BY MOVEMENTS IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. CLIENT-FACING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY LENDING AND DEPOSIT-TAKING, CREATE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE POSITIONS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  WE PREPARE FORWARD-LOOKING FORECASTS OF NET INTEREST INCOME. THE BASELINE FORECAST TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH, ALM POSITIONING AND THE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AS IMPLIED BY THE MARKET-BASED FORWARD CURVE. WE THEN MEASURE AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT THAT ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS HAVE ON THE BASELINE FORECAST IN ORDER TO ASSESS INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY UNDER VARIED CONDITIONS. THE NET INTEREST INCOME FORECAST IS FREQUENTLY UPDATED FOR CHANGING ASSUMPTIONS AND DIFFERING OUTLOOKS BASED ON ECONOMIC TRENDS, MARKET  39  BANK OF AMERICA  CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES. THUS, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR OUR BALANCE SHEET POSITION IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS THAT WE ANALYZE INCORPORATE BALANCE SHEET ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH AND PRICING, CHANGES IN FUNDING MIX, PRODUCT REPRICING, MATURITY CHARACTERISTICS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES PREMIUM AMORTIZATION. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK SO THAT MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT EARNINGS AND CAPITAL.  TABLE 43  PRESENTS THE SPOT AND 12-MONTH FORWARD RATES USED IN OUR BASELINE FORECASTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

PERIODICALLY WE EVALUATE THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED SO THAT THEY ARE MEANINGFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT RATE ENVIRONMENT.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THE ASSET SENSITIVITY OF OUR BALANCE SHEET TO RISING RATES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES. WE CONTINUE TO BE ASSET SENSITIVE TO A PARALLEL MOVE IN INTEREST RATES WITH THE MAJORITY OF THAT IMPACT COMING FROM THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE. ADDITIONALLY, HIGHER INTEREST RATES IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND, ACCORDINGLY, FOR DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AFS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ACCUMULATED OCI AND THUS CAPITAL LEVELS UNDER THE BASEL 3 CAPITAL RULES. UNDER INSTANTANEOUS UPWARD PARALLEL SHIFTS, THE NEAR-TERM ADVERSE IMPACT TO BASEL 3 CAPITAL IS REDUCED OVER TIME BY OFFSETTING POSITIVE IMPACTS TO NET INTEREST INCOME.

AS PART OF OUR ALM ACTIVITIES, WE USE SECURITIES, CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AND INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES IN MANAGING INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY.  THE BEHAVIOR OF OUR DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO IN THE BASELINE FORECAST AND IN ALTERNATE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IS A KEY ASSUMPTION IN OUR PROJECTED ESTIMATES OF NET INTEREST INCOME. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN  TABLE 44  ASSUMES NO CHANGE IN DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO SIZE OR MIX FROM THE BASELINE FORECAST IN ALTERNATE RATE ENVIRONMENTS. IN HIGHER RATE SCENARIOS, ANY CUSTOMER ACTIVITY RESULTING IN THE REPLACEMENT OF LOW-COST OR NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH HIGHER YIELDING DEPOSITS OR MARKET-BASED FUNDING WOULD REDUCE OUR BENEFIT IN THOSE SCENARIOS.  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE UTILIZED IN OUR ALM ACTIVITIES AND SERVE AS AN EFFICIENT TOOL TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS OR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE COMPONENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE  NOTE 3 \u2013 DERIVATIVES  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  . FOR MORE INFORMATION ON INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  WE USE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE VARIABILITY IN THE CASH FLOWS OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND OTHER FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS CASH FLOW HEDGES). THE NET LOSSES ON BOTH OPEN AND TERMINATED CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OCI WERE  $1.0 BILLION  AND  $1.3 BILLION  , ON A PRETAX BASIS, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THESE NET LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS AND WILL DECREASE INCOME OR INCREASE EXPENSE ON THE RESPECTIVE HEDGED CASH FLOWS. ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN OPEN CASH FLOW DERIVATIVE HEDGE POSITIONS AND NO CHANGES IN PRICES OR INTEREST RATES BEYOND WHAT IS IMPLIED IN FORWARD YIELD CURVES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE PRETAX NET LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS: 25 PERCENT WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR, 53 PERCENT IN YEARS TWO THROUGH FIVE AND 12 PERCENT IN YEARS SIX THROUGH TEN, WITH THE REMAINING 10 PERCENT THEREAFTER. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, SEE  NOTE 3 \u2013 DERIVATIVES  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MORTGAGE BANKING RISK MANAGEMENT  WE ORIGINATE, FUND AND SERVICE MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH SUBJECT US TO CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, AMONG OTHERS. WE DETERMINE WHETHER LOANS WILL BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT OR HELD FOR SALE AT THE TIME OF COMMITMENT AND MANAGE CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISKS BY SELLING OR SECURITIZING A PORTION OF THE LOANS WE ORIGINATE.  INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS IMPACT THE VOLUME OF MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ALSO IMPACT THE VALUE OF INTEREST RATE LOCK COMMITMENTS (IRLCS) AND THE RELATED RESIDENTIAL FIRST MORTGAGE LHFS BETWEEN THE DATE OF THE IRLC AND THE DATE THE LOANS ARE SOLD TO THE SECONDARY MARKET. AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST  RATES TYPICALLY LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. CONVERSELY, WHEN THERE IS AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, THE VALUE OF THE MSRS WILL INCREASE DRIVEN BY LOWER PREPAYMENT EXPECTATIONS. BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE RISKS OF THESE TWO HEDGED ITEMS OFFSET, WE COMBINE THEM INTO ONE OVERALL HEDGED ITEM WITH ONE COMBINED ECONOMIC HEDGE PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND SECURITIES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , WE RECORDED GAINS OF $61 MILLION AND $69 MILLION RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS, IRLCS AND LHFS, NET OF GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE HEDGE PORTFOLIO.

EXECUTIVE  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING INTERIOR DESIGN COMPANY AND MANUFACTURER AND RETAILER OF QUALITY HOME FURNISHINGS. FOUNDED OVER 85 YEARS AGO, TODAY WE ARE A LEADING INTERNATIONAL HOME FASHION BRAND DOING BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. WE ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED FROM DESIGN THROUGH DELIVERY, AFFORDING OUR CLIENTELE A VALUE PROPOSITION OF STYLE, QUALITY AND PRICE. WE OFFER COMPLEMENTARY INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICE TO OUR CLIENTS AND SELL A FULL RANGE OF FURNITURE PRODUCTS AND DECORATIVE ACCENTS THROUGH ETHANALLEN.COM AND A NETWORK OF APPROXIMATELY 300 DESIGN CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THE DESIGN CENTERS REPRESENT A MIX OF INDEPENDENT LICENSEES AND OUR OWN COMPANY OPERATED RETAIL SEGMENT. WE OWN AND OPERATE NINE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, INCLUDING SIX MANUFACTURING PLANTS AND ONE SAWMILL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ONE MANUFACTURING PLANT IN EACH OF MEXICO AND HONDURAS.  OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUED FOCUS ON (I) COMMUNICATING OUR MESSAGES WITH STRONG ADVERTISING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS, (II) CAPITALIZING ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS AND MANAGEMENT IN OUR RETAIL DESIGN CENTERS, (III) UTILIZING ETHANALLEN.COM AS A KEY MARKETING TOOL TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO A NETWORK OF APPROXIMATELY 200 NORTH AMERICAN DESIGN CENTERS LOCATED NEAR OUR DEMOGRAPHIC BASE, (IV) INVESTING IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS KEY ASPECTS OF OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED BUSINESS, AND (V) LEVERAGING THE BENEFITS OF OUR VERTICAL INTEGRATION BY MAINTAINING OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE WE MANUFACTURE APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR PRODUCTS.  OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARISE FROM.  -  PROVIDING FASHIONABLE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS OF THE FINEST CRAFTSMANSHIP;  -  OFFERING COMPLIMENTARY DESIGN SERVICE THROUGH AN ESTIMATED 2,000 MOTIVATED INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS NETWORK-WIDE;  -  OFFERING A WIDE ARRAY OF CUSTOM PRODUCTS ACROSS OUR UPHOLSTERY, CASE GOODS, AND ACCENT PRODUCT CATEGORIES;  -  ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS; AND  -  LEVERAGING OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE.  WE HAVE COMPLETED A MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, HAVING REFRESHED OVER 70% OF OUR ENTIRE PRODUCT LINE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, WE FURTHER STRENGTHENED OUR OFFERINGS WITH NEW PRODUCTS FEATURING A MODERN PERSPECTIVE ON CLASSIC DESIGNS. OUR CONTRACT SALES, INCLUDING SALES TO GSA, HOSPITALITY AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES, CONTINUE TO GROW AND GSA HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS. OUR INTERNET SALES, WHILE STILL A LOW PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES, ARE GROWING AT A RATE THAT CONTINUES TO OUT-PACE OUR BRICK AND MORTAR DESIGN CENTERS.  WE MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DESIGN CENTERS BASED ON NET SALES AND WRITTEN ORDERS BOOKED ON A COMPARABLE PERIOD BASIS. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTERS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR AT LEAST 15 MONTHS, INCLUDING RELOCATED DESIGN CENTERS PROVIDED THE ORIGINAL AND RELOCATED DESIGN CENTER LOCATION HAD BEEN OPERATING FOR AT LEAST 15 MONTHS ON A COMBINED BASIS. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF OPERATIONS OF NEWLY OPENED DESIGN CENTERS, WRITTEN ORDERS ARE BOOKED, BUT MINIMAL NET SALES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. DESIGN CENTERS WE ACQUIRE FROM INDEPENDENT RETAILERS ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER SALES IN THEIR 13TH FULL MONTH OF ETHAN ALLEN-OWNED OPERATIONS. THE FREQUENCY OF OUR PROMOTIONAL EVENTS AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF THE END OF THOSE EVENTS CAN ALSO AFFECT THE COMPARABILITY OF ORDERS BOOKED DURING A GIVEN PERIOD. OUR INTERNATIONAL NET SALES ARE COMPOSED OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT SALES TO INDEPENDENT RETAILERS AND OUR RETAIL SEGMENT SALES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH THE COMPANY OPERATED INTERNATIONAL DESIGN CENTERS.  FISCAL 2019 THIRD QUARTER IN REVIEW  -  IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, COST CONTAINMENT WITHIN OUR EXPENSES AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE HELPED INCREASE OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 TO $0.30, UP FROM $0.09 IN THE YEAR AGO THIRD QUARTER. AN INCREASE OF 1.5% FOR RETAIL NET SALES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 8.9% FOR WHOLESALE NET SALES. CONSOLIDATED INTERNATIONAL NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED 30.2% PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES IN CHINA AND MADE UP 6.6% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES COMPARED WITH 9.3% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. GROSS PROFIT GREW BY $1.7 MILLION OR 1.7% IN THE CURRENT YEAR THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, DRIVEN BY A 200-BASIS POINT EXPANSION IN OUR GROSS MARGIN. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, GROSS MARGIN WAS 55.3%, UP FROM 53.3% A YEAR AGO, DUE TO IMPROVED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROSS MARGIN COUPLED WITH A CHANGE IN THE RETAIL SALES MIX RELATIVE TO TOTAL SALES, WHICH WAS 78.1% COMPARED WITH 75.5% IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $5.1 MILLION, OR 5.5%, REPRESENTING 49.3% AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES COMPARED WITH 51.2% A YEAR AGO. THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RETAIL OCCUPANCY AND SELLING EXPENSES.

UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, ALL COMPARISONS IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ARE FROM THE THREE- OR NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR THREE- OR NINE-MONTH PERIOD.  THIRD  QUARTER  E  NDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  THIRD  QUARTER  E  NDED  MARCH 31, 2018  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $177.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $181.4 MILLION FOR THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 2.0%. SALES DECREASED BY 8.9% FOR OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A 1.5% INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT. THERE WAS A 30.2% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN OUR COMBINED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE SEGMENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES.  RETAIL NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $138.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $136.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 1.5%. COMPARATIVE RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED 0.5%. THERE WERE 142 COMPANY-OPERATED DESIGN CENTERS DURING THE QUARTER, DOWN FROM 147 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS A 1.9% INCREASE IN SALES IN THE U.S., WHILE SALES FROM THE CANADIAN DESIGN CENTERS DECREASED 9.6%. TOTAL WRITTEN BUSINESS (NEW ORDERS BOOKED) INCREASED 1.4%, WITH AN INCREASE IN THE U.S. AND A DECREASE IN CANADA. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER WRITTEN BUSINESS IN THE QUARTER INCREASED 0.4% IN TOTAL.  WHOLESALE NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $108.4 MILLION COMPARED WITH $118.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 8.9%. THE LOWER NET SALES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL NETWORK. THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER NET SALES BENEFITTED FROM DELAYED SHIPMENTS DURING THE FIRST HALF THAT HAD BEGUN SHIPPING DURING THE QUARTER. CONTRACT SALES INCREASED FOR THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WHILE INTERNATIONAL SALES, ESPECIALLY TO CHINA, DECREASED.  GROSS PROFIT  FOR THE QUARTER OF $98.4 MILLION COMPARED WITH $96.7 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 1.7%, WITH AN INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND A DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. A PRICE INCREASE EARLIER IN FISCAL 2019 IMPROVED GROSS PROFIT, WHILE LOWER WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE QUARTER WAS 55.3% COMPARED WITH 53.3% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. RETAIL SALES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SALES WERE 78.1% FOR THE QUARTER COMPARED WITH 75.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, INCREASING OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.  OPERATING EXPENSES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $87.7 MILLION, OR 49.3% OF NET SALES, DECREASED $5.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $92.8 MILLION, OR 51.2% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE 5.5% DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS OF $6.4 MILLION. THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER ALSO REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN EXPENSES DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF $1.5 MILLION IN ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $10.7 MILLION, OR 6.0% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $3.9 MILLION, OR 2.1% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PRIMARY CAUSES FOR THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER GROSS PROFIT AND A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS.  RETAIL OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER WAS A LOSS OF $1.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $2.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE HIGHER OPERATING INCOME AND IMPROVED MARGIN IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IMPROVED SALES AND GROSS MARGIN IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD.  WHOLESALE OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $13.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH $7.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER GROSS MARGIN AND LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  FOR THE QUARTER TOTALED $2.6 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1.2 MILLION. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.8% IN THE QUARTER COMPARED WITH 31.2%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 24.8% PRIMARILY INCLUDES A PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX ON THE CURRENT QUARTER\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, INCLUDING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, TAX EXPENSE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CANADIAN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PRIMARILY INCLUDES TAX EXPENSE ON THAT QUARTER\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, RE-MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  NET INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $8.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH $2.6 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN $0.30 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED WITH $0.09 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  19  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NINE  MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  NINE  MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $562.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $561.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 0.3%. SALES INCREASED BY 2.6% IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4.1% DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THERE WAS A 28.1% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN OUR COMBINED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE SEGMENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES.  RETAIL NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $442.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $431.5 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 2.6%. COMPARATIVE RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED 1.4%.

THERE WAS A 3.6% INCREASE IN SALES IN THE U.S., WHILE SALES FROM THE CANADIAN DESIGN CENTERS DECREASED 20.0%. TOTAL WRITTEN BUSINESS (NEW ORDERS BOOKED) DECREASED 0.6%, WITH A DECREASE IN BOTH CANADA AND THE U.S. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER WRITTEN BUSINESS YEAR-TO-DATE DECREASED 1.9% IN TOTAL.  WHOLESALE NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $334.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $348.5 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 4.1%. DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR, WHOLESALE SEGMENT SALES WERE AT ELEVATED LEVELS AS THE SHIPPING DELAYS AND THE HIGH BACKLOGS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER WERE MOSTLY CAUGHT UP IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS YEAR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT BACKLOG LEVELS RETURNED TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS. LOWER INTERNATIONAL SALES, ESPECIALLY TO CHINA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CONTRACT SALES, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES DECREASE.  GROSS PROFIT  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $308.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $304.8 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, UP 1.3%, WITH AN INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND A DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN YEAR-TO-DATE WAS 54.9% COMPARED WITH 54.3%. A PRICE INCREASE EARLIER IN FISCAL 2019 IMPROVED GROSS PROFIT, WHILE LOWER WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT. RETAIL SALES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SALES WAS 78.7% YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARED WITH 76.9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, INCREASING OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.  OPERATING EXPENSES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $270.1 MILLION, OR 48.0% OF NET SALES, DECREASED $1.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $271.9 MILLION, OR 48.4% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE $1.8 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6.5 MILLION REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED LOGISTICS (FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE) COSTS OF $2.4 MILLION.  OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $38.6 MILLION, OR 6.9% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $33.0 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PRIMARY CAUSES FOR THE 17.1% INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WERE INCREASED DOMESTIC RETAIL SALES AND LOWER NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SALES IN WHOLESALE AND INCREASED VARIABLE LOGISTICS COSTS.  RETAIL OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $0.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $6.3 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPROVED OPERATING INCOME WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IMPROVED DOMESTIC SALES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL OPERATING INCOME.  WHOLESALE OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $36.2 MILLION COMPARED WITH $37.0 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER THIRD QUARTER NET SALES AND INCREASED DISTRIBUTION COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING EXPENSES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  YEAR-TO-DATE TOTALED $9.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $8.0 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25.0% IN THE PERIOD COMPARED WITH 24.4%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY INCLUDES TAX EXPENSE ON THE FISCAL YEAR\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, INCLUDING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, TAX EXPENSE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CANADIAN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

NET INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $29.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH $24.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 16.5%. THIS RESULTED IN NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE YEAR-TO-DATE OF $1.08 COMPARED WITH $0.90, AN INCREASE OF 20.0%.  20  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  LIQUIDITY  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $25.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $22.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY.  A SUMMARY OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 IS PROVIDED BELOW (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET INCOME PLUS OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS  $44.6  $40.7  CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL  (0.3  )  (5.6  )  TOTAL PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $44.3  $35.1  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $(7.0  )  $(9.1  )  OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES  0.1  0.5  TOTAL (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(6.9  )  $(8.6  )  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  BORROWINGS ON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  $16.0  $-  PAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (8.4  )  (14.3  )  PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS  (41.9  )  (24.3  )  REPURCHASE OF COMPANY STOCK  -  (1.1  )  OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES  0.2  0.2  TOTAL (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(34.1  )  $(39.5  )  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, CASH OF $44.3 MILLION WAS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF $9.2 MILLION. THIS WAS LARGELY DUE HIGHER NET INCOME AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR WORKING CAPITAL COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR AS FISCAL 2018 EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY INCREASE TO SUPPORT THE ORDER BACKLOG. WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS CONSIST OF CURRENT ASSETS (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS) LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES (CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, PAYABLES, AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES).  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, $6.9 MILLION OF CASH WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, A DECREASE OF $1.7 MILLION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $2.1 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND RELATED PRIMARILY TO RETAIL DESIGN CENTER IMPROVEMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2018, AND FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS RESTRICTED CASH AS A COMPONENT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS PRESENTED ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. PREVIOUSLY THE NET CHANGE IN RESTRICTED CASH WAS CONSIDERED AN INVESTING ACTIVITY. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, $34.1 MILLION WAS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH IS $5.4 MILLION LESS CASH USED THAN THE $39.5 MILLION OF CASH USED DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018. THE DECREASE YEAR OVER YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $13.2 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE PREVIOUSLY OUTSTANDING TERM LOAN IN FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET BORROWING ON THE FACILITY OF $8.0 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO DATE PERIOD WE PAID DIVIDENDS OF $41.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $24.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR TO DATE PERIOD. IN NOVEMBER 2018, WE DECLARED A $1.00 PER SHARE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND, WHICH WAS PAID IN JANUARY 2019, IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE, ALSO PAID IN JANUARY 2019. WE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY PAID REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR EVERY QUARTER SINCE 1996 AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY PERMIT.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH OUR OTHER AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDING THE FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MAKE ALL REQUIRED DEBT PAYMENTS, TO PERMIT ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $97.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $93.2 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $4.5 MILLION, OR 4.8%. THE COMPANY HAD A CURRENT RATIO OF 1.77 TO 1 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND 1.77 TO 1 AT JUNE 30, 2018.  21  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  IN ADDITION TO USING AVAILABLE CASH TO FUND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, NECESSARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AGENTS, IN THE OPEN MARKET AT PRICES AND ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES, RESPECTIVELY.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  -  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $2.0 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $4.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.3 MILLION, OR 64%, WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO RETAIL DESIGN CENTER IMPROVEMENTS.  CAPITAL NEEDS  -  DURING DECEMBER 2018 WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR, $165 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING FACILITY. TO PARTIALLY FUND THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS IN JANUARY 2019, WE BORROWED $16.0 MILLION FROM THE FACILITY. BY MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD REPAID $8.0 MILLION OF THE TOTAL BORROWED FROM CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TIMING OF OUR RELATED CASH PAYMENTS SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  LETTERS OF CREDIT -  AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, THERE WAS $6.2 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY.  TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE FACILITY WAS $150.8 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND $108.8 AT JUNE 30, 2018. AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE COVENANTS UNDER THE FACILITY.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE REPURCHASES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PURSUANT TO OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER THE PROGRAM DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD A REMAINING BOARD AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE 2,518,046 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR PROGRAM.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, THE DEGREE OF SUCCESS OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS, THE TIMING OF TAX AND OTHER PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS NECESSARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT GROWTH OF OUR OPERATIONS WILL IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE EFFECT OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FACTORS MENTIONED HERE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, WE HAD TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF $184.2 MILLION, OF WHICH $176.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OF $16.0 MILLION UNDER OUR RENEWED FACILITY, OF WHICH WE HAD REPAID $8.0 MILLION BY MARCH 31, 2019, AS DESCRIBED IN THE  CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2013  CAPITAL NEEDS  SECTION OF THIS MD&A, THERE WERE NO NEW MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  DIVIDENDS  IN JANUARY 2019, WE PAID A $1.00 PER SHARE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND, IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE. ON JANUARY 28, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE. THE CASH DIVIDEND OF $5.1 MILLION WAS PAID ON APRIL 25, 2019, TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 11, 2019. FUTURE CASH DIVIDENDS WILL DEPEND ON OUR EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY US AND IS SUBJECT TO FINAL DETERMINATION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  AND  CONTINGENCIES  EXCEPT AS INDICATED BELOW, WE DO NOT UTILIZE OR EMPLOY ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES, IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY (I) RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTERESTS, (II) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS SPECIFIED BELOW), OR (III) VARIABLE INTERESTS WHICH COULD SERVE AS A SOURCE OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, PROVIDE GUARANTEES ON BEHALF OF SELECTED AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR BECOME CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS AGREEMENTS. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THESE GUARANTEES AND OBLIGATIONS MAY VARY BASED ON OUR UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BENEFITING PARTY AND THE BUSINESS PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE GUARANTEE OR OBLIGATION IS BEING PROVIDED. THE ONLY SUCH PROGRAM IN PLACE AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018 WAS FOR OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.  22  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  ETHAN ALLEN CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM  -  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM, WHICH IS FINANCED AND ADMINISTERED BY A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO ETHAN ALLEN, ARE SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THAT FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER (THE \u201cPROGRAM AGREEMENT\u201d) WHICH WAS LAST AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2014. ANY INDEPENDENT RETAILER CHOOSING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH THAT SAME THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH SETS FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE RETAILER IS TO PERFORM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS OFFERING OF CONSUMER CREDIT TO ITS CUSTOMERS (THE \u201cRETAILER AGREEMENT\u201d). WE HAVE OBLIGATED OURSELVES ON BEHALF OF ANY INDEPENDENT RETAILER CHOOSING TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM BY AGREEING, IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT, BREACH, OR FAILURE OF THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER TO PERFORM UNDER SUCH RETAILER AGREEMENT, TO TAKE ON CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DELIVERY OF GOODS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS. CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY INDEPENDENT RETAILERS REMAIN NON-RECOURSE TO ETHAN ALLEN. THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT WILL TERMINATE ON JULY 31, 2019, AND THE COMPANY WILL UTILIZE A SUBSTITUTE PROGRAM UPON TERMINATION. WHILE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS (UNDISCOUNTED) THAT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THIS OBLIGATION IS INDETERMINABLE, RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO RECOVER, FROM THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER, ANY AMOUNT PAID OR INCURRED BY US RELATED TO OUR PERFORMANCE. BASED ON THE UNDERLYING CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, INCLUDING THEIR HISTORICAL ABILITY TO PERFORM SATISFACTORILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM, WE BELIEVE THIS OBLIGATION WILL EXPIRE WITHOUT REQUIRING FUNDING BY US. TO ENSURE FUNDING FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS SOLD, THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAIN A RIGHT FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDER TO DEMAND FROM US COLLATERAL AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE VOLUME OF PROGRAM SALES IF WE DO NOT MEET A COVENANT REGARDING MINIMUM WORKING CAPITAL OR TANGIBLE NET WORTH. AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH COVENANT.  PRODUCT WARRANTIES  -  OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OUR CASE GOODS, UPHOLSTERY AND HOME ACCENTS, GENERALLY CARRY EXPLICIT PRODUCT WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND UP TO TWELVE YEARS AND ARE PROVIDED BASED ON TERMS THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE INDUSTRY. ALL OUR DOMESTIC INDEPENDENT RETAILERS ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AND PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A WARRANTY SERVICE AGREEMENT. WE RECORD PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED COSTS AT TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL WARRANTY LOSS EXPERIENCE AND MAKE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE PROVISIONS TO REFLECT ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. ON RARE OCCASIONS, CERTAIN WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED CLAIMS INVOLVE MATTERS OF DISPUTE THAT ULTIMATELY ARE RESOLVED BY NEGOTIATION, ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION. IN CERTAIN CASES, A MATERIAL WARRANTY ISSUE MAY ARISE WHICH IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT, FROM TIME TO TIME, ADDITIONAL WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED CLAIMS COULD ARISE FROM DISPUTES OR OTHER MATTERS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY TOTALED $1.4 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH $1.5 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. WE DISCUSS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  WE IMPLEMENTED ASC 606 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER CHANGES IN OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 3,  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  , TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE FROM CONCEPT OF IDEA, TO ENGINEERING, TO MANUFACTURING, TO RETAIL AND LOGISTICS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN STRONG MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES IN NORTH AMERICA, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ADVANCE OUR OBJECTIVES OF MAINTAINING FAST ORDER DELIVERY, EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY AND IMPROVING CAPACITY TO SHIP STOCKED AND CUSTOM MADE-TO-ORDER ITEMS MORE QUICKLY, WHICH IN TURN WILL ALLOW US TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. HAVING REFRESHED OVER 70% OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, OUR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE FRESH AND RELEVANT.  23  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH MESSAGING FOCUSED ON OUR STYLISH PRODUCTS, QUALITY AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A TARGETED ADVERTISING PROGRAM UTILIZING VARIOUS ADVERTISING MEDIUMS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AS WE BROADEN THE REACH OF OUR MESSAGING TO DRIVE MORE TRAFFIC TO OUR DESIGN CENTERS AND TO ETHANALLEN.COM.  OUR NETWORK OF PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS DIFFERENTIATE US SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR COMPETITORS. WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, PROFESSIONALISM, AND INTERIOR DESIGN COMPETENCE, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM (I) CONTINUOUS REPOSITIONING OF OUR RETAIL NETWORK, (II) FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, (III) NEW AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROMOTIONS AND EFFECTIVE USE OF TARGETED ADVERTISING MEDIA, AND (IV) CONTINUED USE OF THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY COMBINED WITH PERSONAL SERVICE FROM OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.  WE EXPECT THE HOME FURNISHINGS INDUSTRY TO REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE SOURCING OF PRODUCTS AND THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SALE OF THOSE PRODUCTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS CONTINUE TO FACE PRICING PRESSURES BECAUSE OF THE LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS ON IMPORTS, PARTICULARLY FROM ASIA. WHILE WE ALSO UTILIZE OVERSEAS SOURCING FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CHOOSE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES BY MAINTAINING A SUBSTANTIAL NORTH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING BASE, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS STRUCTURE ENABLES US TO LEVERAGE OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT A BALANCED APPROACH TO PRODUCT SOURCING, WHICH INCLUDES OUR OWN NORTH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING OF APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS COUPLED WITH THE IMPORT OF OTHER SELECTED PRODUCTS, PROVIDES THE GREATEST DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY AND SHORT LEAD TIMES AND IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF QUALITY AND SERVICE ARE MAINTAINED.  WITH OUR VERTICAL ENTERPRISE WELL POSITIONED, WE MAINTAIN A CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK. OUR RETAIL STRATEGY WILL CONTINUE WITH ITS FOCUS ON (I) PROVIDING RELEVANT PRODUCT OFFERINGS, A WIDE ARRAY OF PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, AND SUPERIOR INTERIOR DESIGN SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR LARGE STAFF OF INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS, (II) CONTINUING STRONG ADVERTISING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO GET OUR MESSAGE ACROSS AND TO CONTINUE BROADENING OUR CUSTOMER BASE, (III) THE OPENING OF NEW OR RELOCATED DESIGN CENTERS IN MORE PROMINENT LOCATIONS, AND ENCOURAGING INDEPENDENT RETAILERS TO DO THE SAME, (IV) LEVERAGING THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND PERSONAL SERVICE WITHIN OUR RETAIL NETWORK AND ONLINE THROUGH WWW.ETHANALLEN.COM, AND (V) FURTHER EXPANSION INTERNATIONALLY. WE BELIEVE THIS STRATEGY PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW OUR BUSINESS.  24  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC.

A REFERENCE TO A \u201cNOTE\u201d RELATES TO A NOTE IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS MD&A REFLECTS OUR OPERATING RESULTS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.  CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS MD&A MAY BE DEEMED TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  SEE \u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORW  ARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  LSB IS HEADQUARTERED IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA AND THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANUFACTURES AND SELLS CHEMICAL PRODUCTS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL, MINING, AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS.  WE OWN AND OPERATE FACILITIES IN CHEROKEE, ALABAMA, EL DORADO, ARKANSAS AND PRYOR, OKLAHOMA, AND OPERATE A FACILITY FOR COVESTRO IN BAYTOWN, TEXAS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND DIRECTLY TO END CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.  KEY OPERATING INITIATIVES FOR 2019  WE BELIEVE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE  FOLLOWING KEY INITIATIVES.  \u2022  IMPROVING THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR CHEMICAL PLANTS.  OVER THE  PAST 24 MONTHS, OUR  FOCUS HAS BEEN ON UPGRADING OUR EXISTING MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THROUGH TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND WORK PROCESSES TO IMPROVE OUR PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AT OUR FACILITIES.  WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE MAINTENANCE EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN EXPEDITING IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERALL USE.  WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION DURING 2018. ADDITIONALLY,  BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF OUR OPERATING AND MAINTENANC  E PROCEDURES AND OUR PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AT ALL OF OUR FACILITIES IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHERE WE MAY HAVE GAPS IN PROCEDURES AND PROGRAMS AND WHERE WE MAY NEED ENHANCEMENTS. BASED ON THE \u201cGAP ANALYSIS\u201d COMPLETED, WE HAVE SEVERAL INITIATIVES UNDERWAY THAT WE BELIEVE WILL IMPROVE THE OVERALL RELIABILITY OF OUR PLANTS AND ALLOW US TO PRODUCE MORE PRODUCTS FOR SALE WHILE LOWERING OUR COST OF PRODUCTION. THOSE INITIATIVES ARE FOCUSED ON OPERATING BEHAVIOR AND PROCEDURE ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDING OPERATOR TRAINING, LEADERSHIP TRAINING, SHIFT CHANGE ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES  \u2022  FOCUS ON THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT OF OUR SAFETY PERFORMANCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH SAFETY STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL AND A PRECURSOR TO IMPROVED PLANT PERFORMANCE.  WITH THAT IN MIND, WE IMPLEMENTED AND ARE CURRENTLY MANAGING ENHANCED SAFETY PROGRAMS AT OUR FACILITIES THAT FOCUS ON REDUCING RISKS AND IMPROVING OUR SAFETY CULTURE.  \u2022  CONTINUE BROADENING OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS.  WE HAVE INCREASED OUR OVERALL SALES VOLUME OF HDAN OVER THE  PAST SEVERAL YEARS  BY APPROXIMATELY 30% THROUGH VARIOUS MARKETING INITIATIVES INCLUDING: (1) STORING AND DISTRIBUTING HDAN AT OUR PRYOR FACILITY WHICH ALLOWS US TO SELL TO NEW MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS OUT OF THAT FACILITY AND; (2) EDUCATING GROWERS ON THE AGRONOMIC BENEFITS AND THE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FOR HDAN.  TO FURTHER LEVERAGE OUR PLANTS CURRENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS BY PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS TO TAKE PRODUCT FURTHER INTO THE WESTERN U.S. AS WELL AS MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH A CURRENT CUSTOMER TO POSITION AN EMULSION EXPLOSIVES PLANT AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING PRODUCT TO THAT FACILITY SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE FURTHER GUEST PLANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AT OUR FACILITIES IN 2019.  IN ADDITION, THROUGH INCREASED MARKETING EFFORTS, WE INCREASED OUR SALES VOLUMES OF NITRIC ACID OVER THE  PAST 24 MONTHS  BY APPROXIMATELY 31%.  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR MARKET FOR OUR NITRIC ACID PRODUCTS IN NORTH AMERICA AND TO FULLY UTILIZE AVAILABLE NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OUR FACILITIES.  \u2022  IMPROVING THE MARGINS ON SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON INCREASING OUR SALES VOLUMES TO PRODUCE AT OPTIMAL ON-STREAM RATES AND LOWER OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS PER TON OF PRODUCT.  IN 2019, WE WILL UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF ALL SALES TO CUSTOMERS TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE MARGINS ON SALES TO THOSE CUSTOMERS AND TO EXPLORE IF THERE ARE FURTHER PRODUCT UPGRADING OPPORTUNITIES.  \u2022  CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROCUREMENT AND LOGISTICS.  IN 2018, WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN CENTRALIZING AND EXPANDING OUR COMPANY-WIDE PROCUREMENT EFFORTS.  WE COMPLETED OUR INITIAL AREAS OF FOCUS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, COMPLETED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHANGES, AND CONTINUE TO SEE BENEFITS SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS, ALONG WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS, WILL RESULT IN AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN EXPENSES AND CAPITAL SPEND IN THE AGGREGATE OF BETWEEN $3 MILLION TO $5 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO REALIZE OVER THE NEXT 12 TO 24 MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND OVERALL COST OF OUR LOGISTICS STRATEGY THROUGH A CENTRALLY MANAGED TEAM FOCUSED ON BUILDING LOGISTICS PARTNERS THAT WILL HELP US FURTHER DRIVE EFFICIENCIES IN 2019.  20  \u2022  FOCUS ON IMPROVING OU  R CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL.  WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND REDUCE OUR OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPROVING END MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH OUR IMPROVED OPERATING PERFORM  ANCE WILL BE A BENEFIT IN ACHIEVING THOSE EFFORTS.  WE  CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE GOING FORWARD.  WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY OR ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES.  EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVES, THEY MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT WE EXPECT OR DESIRE.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  EXPECTATIONS ON INCREASED PLANTED CORN ACREAGE IN THE U.S. FOR THE 2019/2020 SEASON HAVE SUPPORTED NITROGEN FERTILIZER DEMAND OUTLOOKS THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  HOWEVER, CONTINUED ADVERSE WEATHER IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODING THROUGHOUT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER REGION DURING MARCH AND SATURATED FIELDS IN IOWA AND NEBRASKA HAVE DELAYED FERTILIZER APPLICATION AND PLANTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  CHALLENGING WEATHER PATTERNS HAVE CONTINUED INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  WHILE PRICING FOR OUR KEY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAVE IMPROVED COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO, WE EXPECT CURRENT HIGH PRODUCT INVENTORY LEVELS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CHALLENGE PRICING IN THE NEAR TERM.  KEY INDUSTRY FACTORS  SUPPLY AND DEMAND  AGRICULTURAL  SALES OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE  PRICE AT WHICH OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ARE ULTIMATELY SOLD DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NITROGEN FERTILIZERS WHICH, IN TURN, DEPENDS UPON WORLD GRAIN DEMAND AND PRODUCTION LEVELS, THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE, WEATHER CONDITIONS, COMPETITIVE PRICING AND THE AVAILABILITY OF IMPORTS.  ADDITIONALLY, EXPANSIONS OR UPGRADES OF COMPETITORS\u2019 FACILITIES AND INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER INDUSTRY ECONOMICS.  THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, IN ADDITION TO SELLING PRICES, THE LEVEL OF INVENTORIES IN THE MARKET WHICH CAN CAUSE PRICE VOLATILITY AND EFFECT PRODUCT MARGINS.  ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN CORN PRICES AND THOSE OF SOYBEAN, COTTON AND WHEAT PRICES, CAN AFFECT THE NUMBER OF ACRES OF CORN PLANTED IN A GIVEN YEAR, AND THE NUMBER OF ACRES PLANTED WILL DRIVE THE LEVEL OF NITROGEN FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION, LIKELY EFFECTING PRICES.  INDUSTRY REPORTS INDICATED CHINA\u2019S RECENT TARIFFS PLACED ON U.S. SOYBEANS COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT OF 2 TO 4 MILLION ACRES THAT WILL BE ROTATED FROM SOYBEANS TO CORN IN THE NEXT PLANTING SEASON. THE USDA ALSO ESTIMATES AN INCREASE IN 2019 CORN ACRES THAT IS IN LINE WITH OTHER INDUSTRY REPORTS OF APPROXIMATELY 92 MILLION TO 93 MILLION.  SOYBEAN PRICING CONCERNS MAY DRIVE CROP PLANTING SELECTION WHEN FINAL CROP CHOICES ARE MADE AT THE FARM LEVEL.

ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, GIVEN THE LOW PRICE OF NATURAL GAS IN NORTH AMERICA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, NORTH AMERICAN FERTILIZER PRODUCERS HAVE BECOME THE GLOBAL LOW-COST PRODUCERS FOR DELIVERED FERTILIZER PRODUCTS TO THE MIDWEST U.S.  SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THE MARKET BELIEVED THAT LOW NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD CONTINUE.  THAT BELIEF, COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE FERTILIZER PRICING, STIMULATED INVESTMENT IN NUMEROUS EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING NITROGEN CHEMICAL FACILITIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW NITROGEN CHEMICAL FACILITIES.  SINCE THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS, GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER SUPPLY HAS OUTPACED GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER DEMAND CAUSING OVERSUPPLY IN THE GLOBAL AND NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS.  THE INCREASED FERTILIZER SUPPLY LED TO LOWER NITROGEN FERTILIZER SALE PRICES DURING MOST OF 2017.  ALSO, ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF AMMONIA AND OTHER FERTILIZER PRODUCTS CHANGED THE PHYSICAL FLOW OF AMMONIA IN NORTH AMERICA PLACING PRESSURE ON AMMONIA AND OTHER FERTILIZER PRICES UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ACCEPTED THE NEW SUPPLY.  BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN FERTILIZER PRICES AS IMPORTS OF FERTILIZERS HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEW DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF FERTILIZER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.  WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  21  INDUSTRIAL  SALES OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES ARE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PRIMARILY IN THE HOUSING, AUTOMOTIVE, AND PAPER  INDUSTRIES.  ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL, THE U.S. ECONOMIC INDICATORS GENERALLY CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE FOR THESE SECTORS DOMESTICALLY.  OUR  SALES PRICES GENERALLY VARY WITH THE MARKET PRICE OF AMMONIA OR NATURAL GAS, AS APPLICABLE, IN OUR PRICING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  MINING  SALES OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR MINING PRODUCTS ARE LDAN AND AN SOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE PRIMARY USED AS AN FUEL OIL AND SPECIALTY EMULSIONS FOR SURFACE MINING OF COAL AND FOR USAGE IN QUARRIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.  AS REPORTED BY THE EIA, ANNUAL COAL PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 2018 WAS DOWN 2% FROM 2017 DUE TO THIS MARKET\u2019S WEAK COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE ELECTRICAL GENERATION SECTOR COMPARED WITH NATURAL GAS AND TO A LESSER DEGREE LOWER EXPORT DEMAND.  EIA IS FORECASTING ANOTHER 9% DECREASE IN U.S. COAL PRODUCTION IN 2019 FOLLOWED BY A CONTINUED DECLINE OF 6% IN 2020.  THIS ESTIMATED DECLINE IS BASED ON THE CONTINUAL SHIFT IN UTILITY-SCALE ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS.  WE BELIEVE THAT COAL PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FROM COMPETITION FROM NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY.  WHILE WE BELIEVE, OUR PLANTS ARE WELL LOCATED TO SUPPORT THE MORE STABLE COAL-PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE UPCOMING YEARS, OUR CURRENT MINING SALES VOLUMES ARE BEING AFFECTED BY OVERALL LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR LDAN.  AS PART OF OUR CONTINUED EFFORT TO EXPAND SALES OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A CURRENT CUSTOMER, BY WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS LOCATED AN EMULSION PLANT FOR THE MINING BUSINESS AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY.  FARMER ECONOMICS  THE DEMAND FOR FERTILIZER IS AFFECTED BY THE AGGREGATE CROP PLANTING DECISIONS AND FERTILIZER APPLICATION RATE DECISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL FARMERS.  INDIVIDUAL FARMERS MAKE PLANTING DECISIONS BASED LARGELY ON PROSPECTIVE PROFITABILITY OF A HARVEST, WHILE THE SPECIFIC VARIETIES AND AMOUNTS OF FERTILIZER THEY APPLY DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, SOIL CONDITIONS, WEATHER PATTERNS AND THE TYPES OF CROPS PLANTED.  NATURAL GAS PRICES  NATURAL GAS IS THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK USED TO PRODUCE NITROGEN FERTILIZERS AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. NATURAL GAS RESERVES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ADVANCES IN EXTRACTING SHALE GAS, WHICH HAS REDUCED AND STABILIZED NATURAL GAS PRICES, PROVIDING NORTH AMERICA WITH A COST ADVANTAGE OVER CERTAIN IMPORTS.  AS A RESULT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND THAT OF OTHER NORTH AMERICAN NITROGEN FERTILIZER PRODUCERS HAS BEEN POSITIVELY AFFECTED.  WE HISTORICALLY HAVE PURCHASED NATURAL GAS IN THE SPOT MARKET, USING FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS, OR THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BOTH AND HAVE USED FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS TO LOCK IN PRICING FOR A PORTION OF OUR NATURAL GAS REQUIREMENTS.  THESE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY EITHER FIXED-PRICE OR INDEX-PRICE, SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND FOR A FIXED SUPPLY QUANTITY.  WE ARE ABLE TO PURCHASE NATURAL GAS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES DUE TO OUR CONNECTIONS TO LARGE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND THEIR PROXIMITY TO INTERSTATE PIPELINE SYSTEMS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE VOLUME OF NATURAL GAS WE PURCHASED AND THE AVERAGE COST PER MMBTU.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NATURAL GAS VOLUMES (MMBTU IN MILLIONS)  7.4  7.7  NATURAL GAS AVERAGE COST PER MMBTU  $2.91  $2.79  TRANSPORTATION COSTS  COSTS FOR TRANSPORTING NITROGEN-BASED PRODUCTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THEIR SELLING PRICE.  FOR EXAMPLE, AMMONIA IS A HAZARDOUS GAS AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND MUST BE TRANSPORTED IN SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER FORMS OF NITROGEN FERTILIZERS.  IN RECENT YEARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE AMMONIA CONSUMED ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. WAS IMPORTED.  THEREFORE, NITROGEN FERTILIZERS PRICES IN THE U.S. ARE INFLUENCED BY THE COST TO TRANSPORT PRODUCT FROM EXPORTING COUNTRIES, GIVING DOMESTIC PRODUCERS WHO TRANSPORT SHORTER DISTANCES AN ADVANTAGE. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE RECENT RISING COSTS OF RAIL AND TRUCK FREIGHT DOMESTICALLY.  HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS MAY IMPACT OUR MARGINS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THROUGH THESE COSTS.  AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES TO REDUCE OR COUNTER THE IMPACT OF HIGHER LOGISTICS COSTS.  22  KEY OPERATIONAL FACTORS  FACILITY RELIABILITY  CONSISTENT, RELIABLE AND SAFE OPERATIONS AT OUR CHEMICAL PLANTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF PLANNED DOWNTIME AT OUR PLANTS, INCLUDING TURNAROUNDS IS MITIGATED THROUGH A DILIGENT PLANNING PROCESS THAT CONSIDERS THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES TO PERFORM THE NEEDED MAINTENANCE, FEEDSTOCK LOGISTICS AND OTHER FACTORS.  UNPLANNED DOWNTIME OF OUR PLANTS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN LOST CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FROM LOST SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, LOST FIXED COST ABSORPTION FROM LOWER PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.  ALL TURNAROUNDS RESULT IN LOST CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FROM LOST SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, LOST FIXED COST ABSORPTION FROM LOWER PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, WHICH REPAIR, AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  OUR EL DORADO FACILITY PERFORMED A PARTIAL TURNAROUND DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2018.  THE REMAINING PORTION OF THIS TURNAROUND ACTIVITY WILL BE PERFORMED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THIS WORK, WE EXPECT THE EL DORADO FACILITY TO MOVE TO A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE WITH THE NEXT TURNAROUND PLANNED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022.  OUR CHEROKEE FACILITY IS CURRENTLY ON A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE WITH T  HE NEXT TURNAROUND TO BE PERFORMED IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER  O  F 2021.  OUR PRYOR FACILITY TURNAROUND IS SCHEDULED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE WITH A TWO-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE AT THIS FACILITY WITH THE NEXT TURNAROUND PLANNED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2021.  AT THAT TIME, WE WILL SEEK TO MOVE TO A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE.  PREPAY CONTRACTS  WE USE FORWARD SALES OF OUR FERTILIZER PRODUCTS TO OPTIMIZE OUR ASSET UTILIZATION, PLANNING PROCESS AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULING.  THESE SALES ARE MADE BY OFFERING CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE PRODUCT ON A FORWARD BASIS AT PRICES AND DELIVERY DATES THAT ARE AGREED UPON WHICH DATES ARE USUALLY WITHIN 12 MONTHS.  WE USE THIS PROGRAM TO VARYING DEGREES DURING THE YEAR DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR VIEW OF CHANGING PRICE ENVIRONMENTS.  FIXING THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR ULTIMATE DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY CAUSES OUR REPORTED SELLING PRICES AND MARGINS TO DIFFER FROM SPOT MARKET PRICES AND MARGINS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $94.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $100.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WAS $0.1 MILLION COMPARED TO $1.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019.  THE ITEMS IMPACTING OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW AND UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\u201d  ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF THE FIRST QUARTER  ON-STREAM RATES  THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR PLANTS AFFECT OUR PRODUCTION, THE ABSORPTION OF FIXED COSTS OF EACH PLANT AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.  IT IS A KEY OPERATING METRIC THAT WE USE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  IN PARTICULAR, WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR AMMONIA PLANTS AS AMMONIA IS THE BASIC PRODUCT AS USED TO PRODUCE ALL UPGRADED PRODUCTS.  THE ON-STREAM RATES NOTED BELOW EXCLUDE TURNAROUND DAYS, WHEN APPLICABLE.  AT OUR CHEROKEE FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 93% COMPARED TO 85% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, THE CHEROKEE FACILITY\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE WAS IMPACTED BY MAINTENANCE COMPLETED ON ITS PRIMARY REFORMER.  OUR TARGET ON-STREAM RATE FOR THIS AMMONIA PLANT FOR 2019 IS 95%.  AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 96% COMPARED TO 100% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. OUR TARGET ON-STREAM RATE FOR THIS AMMONIA PLANT FOR 2019 IS 95%.  AT OUR PRYOR FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 88% COMPARED TO 91% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  WHILE WE ANTICIPATE BRIEF PERIODS OF UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE LONG-TERM RELIABILITY, WE ARE TARGETING AN AMMONIA PLANT ON-STREAM RATE FOR 2019 OF 90%.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS ON IMPROVING ON-STREAM RATES AS DISCUSSED IN KEY OPERATING INITIATIVES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL ON-STREAM RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  23  SELLING PRICES  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AVERAGE AGRICULTURAL SELLING PRICES FOR  OUR UAN, AMMONIA AND HDAN INCREASED 49%, 14%, AND 7% RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2018 AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR THE SAME PERIOD REFLECTING A MORE FAVORABLE ALIGNMENT OF DEMAND WITH  MARKET CAPACITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.  OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL SELLING PRICES FOR OUR AMMONIA DECREASED COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 15% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WHICH LEAD TO A DECREASE IN INDUSTRIAL SELLING PRICES AS MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTRACTS ARE INDEXED TO THE TAMPA AMMONIA PRICE.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS V  OLUMES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WEATHER-DRIVEN PLANTING DELAYS  AND FLOODING EXPERIENCED DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE 2019 SPRING  APPLICATION SEASON.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASE IN SALES VOLUMES WERE HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR ALL OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.  25  \u2022  INDUSTRIAL ACIDS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL PRODUCTS SALES DECREASED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER INDUSTRIAL AMMONIA SELLING PRICES DUE TO LOWER TAMPA  AMMONIA  INDEX PRICES. A  VERAGE TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  APPROXIMATELY  $50 PER TON LOWER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  THIS DECREASE IN SALES PRICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALES VOLUMES FOR MOST OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.  \u2022  MINING PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES ARE DOWN DUE TO TIMING OF SALES.  WE EXPECT TO MAKE UP THIS VOLUME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  GROSS PROFIT  AS NOTED IN THE TABLES ABOVE, WE RECOGNIZED A GROSS PROFIT $7.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $10.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, OR A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION.  OVERALL, OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECREASED 2% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE INCREASED 5% TO 14% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 AS SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS IMPROVED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DELAYED OR LOST VOLUME RESULTING FROM OVERALL POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FLOODING ACROSS THE U.S. AND PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS, WE TYPICALLY SEE FERTILIZER SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER.  INDUSTRIAL AND MINING PRODUCTS ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECLINED 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 TO 37% FROM 49% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER OVERALL TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING, WHICH AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $280 PER METRIC TON IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $330 PER METRIC TON FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  IN ADDITION TO THE NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GROSS PROFIT FROM THE LOWER SALES DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION OF HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS INCURRED TO MOVE PRODUCT FOR STORAGE AS A RESULT OF THE DELAY IN THE SPRING APPLICATION SEASON AND APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION FROM HIGHER NATURAL GAS COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  OUR SG&A EXPENSES W  ERE $7.2  MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, A DECREASE OF $1.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION-RELATED COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  WAS $11.0 MILLION COMPARED  TO $9.3 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES IN 2018 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5.  NON-OPERATING OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET  NON-OPERATING OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $0.2 MILLION COMPARED TO NON-OPERATING INCOME OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 OR A CHANGE OF $1.1 MILLION. THIS VARIANCE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INCLUDED IN THE SERIES E PREFERRED.  PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR  THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2019  WAS $0.4 MILLION COMPARED TO A BENEFIT OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE RESULTING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018 WAS 4% (PROVISION ON PRE-TAX LOSS) AND 14% (BENEFIT ON PRE-TAX LOSS), RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE FIRST OF 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  ALSO SEE  DISCUSSION  IN NOTE 7.

REDEMPTION OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED  \u2013 AT MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WERE 139,768 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AND THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE (PAR VALUE PLUS ACCRUED DIVIDENDS) WAS $219 MILLION.

ADDITIONALLY, AT OUR OPTION, WE MAY REDEEM THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PER SHARE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF SUCH SHARE AS OF THE REDEMPTION DATE. LASTLY, WITH RECEIPT OF (I) PRIOR CONSENT OF THE ELECTING SERIES E HOLDER OR A MAJORITY OF SHARES OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AND (II) ALL OTHER REQUIRED APPROVALS, INCLUDING UNDER ANY PRINCIPAL U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH OUR COMMON STOCK IS THEN LISTED FOR TRADING, WE CAN REDEEM THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE COMMON STOCK PRICE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF SUCH SHARES BEING REDEEMED IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN LIEU OF CASH AT THE REDEMPTION DATE.

HOWEVER, THIS ACCRETION WILL CHANGE IF THE EXPECTED REDEMPTION DATE CHANGES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \u2013 FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO PP&E WERE $7.1 MILLION  .

SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE UNDER \u201cCAPITALIZATION\u201d FOR OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  28  EXPENSES ASSOCIAT  ED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  WE ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES.  AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF $1.2 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR EXPENSES RANGING FROM $3.4 MILLION TO $3.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.  HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES.  DIVIDENDS  WE HAVE NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IN MANY YEARS, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING  COMMON STOCK IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

EACH SHARE OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A SEMI-ANNUAL DIVIDEND, ONLY WHEN DECLARED BY OUR BOARD. IN ADDITION, DIVIDENDS IN ARREARS AT THE DIVIDEND DATE, UNTIL PAID,  SHALL COMPOUND ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF 14%, BUT SUCH ANNUAL RATE WILL INCREASE BEGINNING ON APRIL 25, 2021. THE CURRENT SEMI-ANNUAL COMPOUNDED DIVIDEND IS APPROXIMATELY $103.83 PER SHARE FOR THE CURRENT AGGREGATE SEMI-ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $14.5 MILLION.  WE ALSO MUST DECLARE A DIVIDEND ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED ON A PRO RATA BASIS WITH OUR COMMON STOCK. AS LONG AS  THE  PURCHASER  HOLDS AT LEAST 10% OF THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED, WE MAY NOT DECLARE DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER PREFERRED STOCKS UNLESS AND UNTIL DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED AND PAID ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED FOR THE THEN CURRENT DIVIDEND PERIOD IN CASH.

ALL SHARES  OF THE SERIES D PREFERRED AND SERIES B PREFERRED ARE OWNED BY THE GOLSEN HOLDERS.  THERE ARE NO OPTIONAL OR MANDATORY REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERIES B PREFERRED OR SERIES D PREFERRED.  SEASONALITY  WE BELIEVE FERTILIZER PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY ARE SEASONAL WHILE SALES INTO THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING SECTORS GENERALLY ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE.  THE SELLING SEASONS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY DURING THE SPRING AND FALL PLANTING SEASONS, WHICH TYPICALLY EXTEND FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE AND FROM SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS WE DISTRIBUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.  AS A RESULT, WE TYPICALLY INCREASE OUR INVENTORY OF FERTILIZER PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH PLANTING SEASON IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SALES TO THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETS DEPEND UPON WEATHER CONDITIONS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS  WE ARE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO SURETIES IN RESPECT OF INSURANCE BONDS ISSUED BY THE SURETIES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BY SUBSIDIARIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THESE INSURANCE BONDS PRIMARILY REPRESENT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE SURETIES FOR PAYMENTS, UP TO $9.7 MILLION, MADE BY THEM IN RESPECT OF SUCH BONDS.  THESE INSURANCE BONDS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPIRE OR BE RENEWED IN 2019.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTES 1 AND 2 FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IT IS ALSO REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 COULD CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM.

RESULTS FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2019  ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF RESULTS THAT MAY BE ATTAINED IN THE FUTURE.  FISCAL  2019  THIRD QUARTER  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  CONAGRA BRANDS, INC. (THE \"COMPANY\", \"CONAGRA BRANDS\", \"WE\", \"US\", OR \"OUR\"), HEADQUARTERED IN CHICAGO, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA'S LEADING BRANDED FOOD COMPANIES. GUIDED BY AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT, THE COMPANY COMBINES A RICH HERITAGE OF MAKING GREAT FOOD WITH A SHARPENED FOCUS ON INNOVATION. THE COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO IS EVOLVING TO SATISFY PEOPLE'S CHANGING FOOD PREFERENCES.

AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, PINNACLE BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED AS OF JUNE 26, 2018 (THE \"MERGER AGREEMENT\"), AMONG CONAGRA BRANDS, PINNACLE, AND PATRIOT MERGER SUB INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF CONAGRA BRANDS THAT CEASED TO EXIST AT THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, EACH SHARE OF PINNACLE COMMON STOCK ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER WAS CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE (I) $43.11 PER SHARE IN CASH AND (II) 0.6494 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $5.00 PER SHARE, OF THE COMPANY (\"COMPANY SHARES\") (TOGETHER, THE \"MERGER CONSIDERATION\"), WITH CASH PAYABLE IN LIEU OF FRACTIONAL SHARES OF COMPANY SHARES. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION WAS APPROXIMATELY $8.03 BILLION AND CONSISTED OF: (1) CASH OF $5.17 BILLION ($5.12 BILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED); (2) 77.5 MILLION COMPANY SHARES, WITH AN APPROXIMATE VALUE OF  $2.82 BILLION  , ISSUED OUT OF THE COMPANY'S TREASURY TO FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF PINNACLE; AND (3) REPLACEMENT AWARDS ISSUED TO FORMER PINNACLE EMPLOYEES REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRE-COMBINATION SERVICE OF  $51.1 MILLION.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, WE INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $8.33 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND RECEIVED CASH PROCEEDS OF $575.0 MILLION ($555.7 MILLION NET OF RELATED FEES) FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING. WE USED SUCH PROCEEDS FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION, THE REPAYMENT OF PINNACLE DEBT ACQUIRED, THE REFINANCING OF CERTAIN CONAGRA BRANDS DEBT, AND THE PAYMENT OF RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES.  THE INTEGRATION OF PINNACLE IS CONTINUING AND ON-TRACK.  WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES IN EXCESS OF $215 MILLION PER YEAR WHEN THE INTEGRATION IS CONCLUDED.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE 2017 U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \"TAX ACT\") WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT REDUCED TAX RATES AND MODIFIED CERTAIN POLICIES, CREDITS, AND DEDUCTIONS AND HAS CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL TAX CONSEQUENCES. THE TAX ACT REDUCED THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM A MAXIMUM OF 35% TO A FLAT 21% RATE. THE TAX ACT'S CORPORATE RATE REDUCTION BECAME EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. GIVEN OUR OFF-CALENDAR FISCAL YEAR-END, OUR FISCAL 2018 FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE WAS A BLENDED RATE. OUR FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE IS 21% IN FISCAL 2019.  IN THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2019  , RESULTS REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF RECENT ACQUISITIONS, WITH ORGANIC (EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND DIVESTED BUSINESSES, AS WELL AS ACQUISITIONS UNTIL THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE ACQUISITION)  INCREASES IN OUR GROCERY & SNACKS AND REFRIGERATED & FROZEN OPERATING SEGMENTS, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. OVERALL GROSS MARGIN INCREASED AS THE ADDITION OF PINNACLE'S GROSS PROFIT, ALONG WITH SUPPLY CHAIN REALIZED PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVED PRICING MORE THAN OFFSET HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS, INFLATION, AND INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN RETAILER MARKETING. OVERALL SEGMENT OPERATING PROFIT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PINNACLE ACQUISITION. CORPORATE EXPENSES WERE LOWER PRIMARILY DUE TO ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PINNACLE. WE INCURRED A DECREASE IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT EARNINGS AND INCREASES IN BOTH INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE, IN EACH CASE COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2018.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $0.50  . DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE  THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2018  WERE  $0.90  , INCLUDING EARNINGS OF  $0.87  PER DILUTED SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND  $0.03  PER DILUTED SHARE FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE AFFECTED BY MORE SHARES OUTSTANDING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT, AND SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS AFFECT THE COMPARABILITY OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS (SEE  \"ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY\"  BELOW).

FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2018 CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES TOTALING  $860.0 MILLION  , NET PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT TOTALING $497.1 MILLION, REPAYMENTS OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $170.1 MILLION  , CASH DIVIDENDS PAID OF  $257.7 MILLION  , AND A NET INCREASE IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF  $324.1 MILLION.  THE COMPANY HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $282.2 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  AND  $128.0 MILLION  AT  MAY 27, 2018  , OF WHICH  $67.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  AND  $121.6 MILLION  AT  MAY 27, 2018  WAS HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED  $113.6 MILLION  OF CASH BALANCES, OF WHICH  $28.3 MILLION  WAS PREVIOUSLY DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE HAVE PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES OF  $0.5 MILLION  ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT NO LONGER MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THE REMAINING UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OR THE EARNINGS WILL BE REMITTED IN A TAX-NEUTRAL TRANSACTION AND THEREFORE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY ADDITIONAL DEFERRED TAXES.  OUR ESTIMATE OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2019  IS APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION, INCLUDING AMOUNTS RELATED TO PINNACLE. FOR THE  FIRST THREE QUARTERS  OF FISCAL  2019  , WE HAVE FUNDED  $236.1 MILLION  OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR REPAYMENT OF DEBT, INCLUDING ANY REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENT OF ANTICIPATED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE USE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS (E.G., LEASES ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES) WHERE SOUND BUSINESS PRINCIPLES WARRANT THEIR USE. WE ALSO PERIODICALLY ENTER INTO GUARANTEES AND OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS AS PART OF TRANSACTIONS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THESE ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN  \"OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\"  BELOW.  VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES NOT CONSOLIDATED  WE LEASE A CERTAIN OFFICE BUILDING FROM AN ENTITY THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. THE LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THIS ENTITY INCLUDES A FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE OPTION FOR THE ASSET BEING LEASED. THE LEASE AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAINS A CONTINGENT PUT OPTION (THE \"LEASE PUT OPTION\") THAT ALLOWS THE LESSOR TO REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE THE BUILDING AT THE GREATER OF ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION COST, OR FAIR MARKET VALUE, WITHOUT A LEASE AGREEMENT IN PLACE (THE \"PUT PRICE\") IN CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. AS A RESULT OF SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO OUR DIVESTED PRIVATE BRANDS OPERATIONS, THIS LEASE PUT OPTION BECAME EXERCISABLE. WE ARE AMORTIZING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PUT PRICE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE (WITHOUT A LEASE AGREEMENT IN PLACE) OF THE PROPERTY OVER THE REMAINING LEASE TERM WITHIN SG&A EXPENSES. AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  AND MAY 27, 2018, THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT BY WHICH THE PUT OPTION PRICE EXCEEDED THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY WAS  $8.2 MILLION  , OF WHICH WE HAD ACCRUED  $1.5 MILLION  AND $1.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS LEASE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN OPERATING LEASE, AND ACCORDINGLY, THERE ARE NO MATERIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OTHER THAN THE ACCRUED PORTION OF THE PUT PRICE, ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THIS ENTITY. IN MAKING THIS DETERMINATION, WE HAVE CONSIDERED, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT, THE EXPECTED REMAINING USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET LEASED, AND THE CAPITAL STRUCTURE OF THE LESSOR ENTITY. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE PURCHASED TWO BUILDINGS THAT WERE SUBJECT TO LEASE PUT OPTIONS AND RECOGNIZED NET LOSSES TOTALING  $48.2 MILLION  FOR THE EARLY EXIT OF UNFAVORABLE LEASE CONTRACTS.  45  OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CONTRACTS SUCH AS LEASE AGREEMENTS, DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS (I.E., OBLIGATIONS TO TRANSFER FUNDS IN THE FUTURE FOR FIXED OR MINIMUM QUANTITIES OF GOODS OR SERVICES AT FIXED OR MINIMUM PRICES, SUCH AS \"TAKE-OR-PAY\" CONTRACTS). THE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATION ARRANGEMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO IN OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ADEQUATE LEVELS OF SOURCED PRODUCT ARE AVAILABLE. OF THESE ITEMS, DEBT, NOTES PAYABLE, AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH TOTALED $11.18 BILLION  AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , WERE RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, WHICH TOTALED $2.04 BILLION  AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , WERE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  WAS AS FOLLOWS.  PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD  (IN MILLIONS)  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  TOTAL  LESS THAN  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  AFTER 5  YEARS  LONG-TERM DEBT  $11,006.6  $\u2014  $3,222.6  $1,262.0  $6,522.0  CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  168.8  19.9  42.2  30.2  76.5  OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS  351.6  56.0  95.5  68.8  131.3  PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  1  AND OTHER CONTRACTS  1,734.8  1,390.9  265.6  68.5  9.8  TOTAL  $13,261.8  $1,466.8  $3,625.9  $1,429.5  $6,739.6  1  AMOUNT INCLUDES OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS AND AGREEMENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING AND/OR MAY BE CANCELLABLE. SUCH AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY SETTLEABLE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  WE ARE ALSO CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COUPON INTEREST RATE OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.7%.  THE OPERATING LEASE OBLIGATIONS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE HAVE NOT BEEN REDUCED BY NON-CANCELLABLE SUBLEASE RENTALS OF $0.1 MILLION.  AS OF  MAY 27, 2018  , WE HAD AGGREGATE UNFUNDED PENSION OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $68.5 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE MADE A VOLUNTARY PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTION IN THE AMOUNT OF $300.0 MILLION. BASED ON CURRENT STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS, WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO FUND ANY AMOUNT TO OUR QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL MAKE PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $11.3 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO FUND OUR NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS. SEE NOTE 14, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND NOTE 19, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES - EMPLOYMENT RELATED BENEFITS CONTAINED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 27, 2018 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OUR PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT ESTIMATES OF THIS LIABILITY.  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, WE ALSO ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT OBLIGATE US TO MAKE FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS ONLY UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF A FUTURE EVENT (E.G., GUARANTEES OF DEBT OR LEASE PAYMENTS OF A THIRD PARTY SHOULD THE THIRD PARTY BE UNABLE TO PERFORM). IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE FOLLOWING COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT. A SUMMARY OF OUR COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  WAS AS FOLLOWS.  AMOUNT OF COMMITMENT EXPIRATION PER PERIOD  (IN MILLIONS)  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  TOTAL  LESS THAN  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  3-5 YEARS  AFTER 5  YEARS  STANDBY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  $0.5  $0.3  $0.2  $\u2014  $\u2014  OTHER COMMITMENTS  3.9  2.2  1.7  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL  $4.4  $2.5  $1.9  $\u2014  $\u2014  IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITMENTS INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , WE HAD $42.5 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED ON OUR BEHALF. THESE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR SELF-INSURED WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS AND ARE NOT REFLECTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.  IN CERTAIN LIMITED SITUATIONS, WE WILL GUARANTEE AN OBLIGATION OF AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY. WE GUARANTEE CERTAIN LEASES RESULTING FROM THE DIVESTITURE OF THE JM SWANK BUSINESS COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017. AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , THE REMAINING TERMS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DID NOT EXCEED FOUR YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $1.4 MILLION. IN  46  ADDITION, WE GUARANTEE A CERTAIN LEASE RESULTING FROM AN EXITED FACILITY. AS OF  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , THE REMAINING TERM OF THIS ARRANGEMENT DID NOT EXCEED EIGHT YEARS AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE HAVE GUARANTEED WAS $19.8 MILLION.  IN CERTAIN LIMITED SITUATIONS, WE ALSO GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS PURSUANT TO GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXISTED PRIOR TO THE SPINOFF OF THE LAMB WESTON BUSINESS (THE \"SPINOFF\") AND REMAINED IN PLACE FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE SPINOFF UNTIL SUCH GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS ARE SUBSTITUTED FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED BY LAMB WESTON. SUCH GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. PURSUANT TO THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT, DATED AS OF NOVEMBER 8, 2016 (THE \"SEPARATION AGREEMENT\"), BETWEEN US AND LAMB WESTON, THESE GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE DEEMED LIABILITIES OF LAMB WESTON THAT WERE TRANSFERRED TO LAMB WESTON AS PART OF THE SPINOFF. ACCORDINGLY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS, LAMB WESTON IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ANY SUCH LIABILITY, REDUCED BY ANY INSURANCE PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY US, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT.  LAMB WESTON IS A PARTY TO AN AGRICULTURAL SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY FOR CERTAIN FARMLAND THROUGH 2020 (SUBJECT, AT LAMB WESTON'S OPTION, TO EXTENSION FOR TWO ADDITIONAL FIVE-YEAR PERIODS). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, LAMB WESTON IS REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN RENTAL PAYMENTS TO THE SUBLESSOR. WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE SUBLESSOR LAMB WESTON'S PERFORMANCE AND THE PAYMENT OF ALL AMOUNTS (INCLUDING INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS) OWED BY LAMB WESTON UNDER THE SUBLEASE AGREEMENT, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF  $75.0 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THE FARMLAND ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SUBLEASE AGREEMENT IS READILY MARKETABLE FOR LEASE TO OTHER AREA FARMING OPERATORS. AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY, IN THE EVENT THAT WE WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM UNDER THE GUARANTEE, WOULD BE LARGELY MITIGATED.  THE OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS TABLES ABOVE DO NOT INCLUDE ANY RESERVES FOR UNCERTAINTIES IN INCOME TAXES, AS WE ARE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF SETTLEMENT OF OUR RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES. THE LIABILITY FOR GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  WAS  $49.4 MILLION  . THE NET AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AT  FEBRUARY 24, 2019  , THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  $42.6 MILLION  . RECOGNITION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD HAVE A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR FISCAL YEAR, WHICH ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF NOVEMBER, PERIODICALLY RESULTS IN A 53-WEEK YEAR INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL 52 WEEKS.  THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 201  9  IS A 53-WEEK YEAR, WITH THE ADDITIONAL WEEK BEING INCLUDED IN OUR FIRST FISCAL QUARTER.  ACCORDINGLY, THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW INCLUDES 14 WEEKS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 2, 201  9  AS COMPARED  TO  13 WEEKS INCLUDED IN THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 2  4  , 201  8.  OVERVIEW  BASSETT IS A LEADING RETAILER, MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BRANDED HOME FURNISHINGS. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED BRANDED STORES UNDER THE BASSETT HOME FURNISHINGS (\u201cBHF\u201d) NAME, WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1902 AND INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF VIRGINIA IN 1930. OUR RICH 117-YEAR HISTORY HAS INSTILLED THE PRINCIPLES OF QUALITY, VALUE, AND INTEGRITY IN EVERYTHING WE DO, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY PROVIDING US WITH THE EXPERTISE TO RESPOND TO EVER-CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND MEET THE DEMANDS OF A GLOBAL ECONOMY.  WITH 102 BHF STORES AT MARCH 2, 2019 WE HAVE LEVERAGED OUR STRONG BRAND NAME IN FURNITURE INTO A NETWORK OF COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSED STORES THAT FOCUS ON PROVIDING CONSUMERS WITH A FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT FOR BUYING FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES.  OUR STORE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A SINGLE SOURCE HOME FURNISHINGS RETAIL STORE THAT PROVIDES A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF STYLISH, QUALITY FURNITURE AND ACCESSORIES WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IN ORDER TO REACH MARKETS THAT CANNOT BE EFFECTIVELY SERVED BY OUR RETAIL STORE NETWORK, WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OTHER WHOLESALE CHANNELS INCLUDING MULTI-LINE FURNITURE STORES, MANY OF WHICH FEATURE BASSETT GALLERIES OR DESIGN CENTERS. WE USE A NETWORK OF OVER 30 INDEPENDENT SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO HAVE STATED GEOGRAPHICAL TERRITORIES. THESE SALES REPRESENTATIVES ARE COMPENSATED BASED ON A STANDARD COMMISSION RATE. WE BELIEVE THIS BLENDED STRATEGY PROVIDES US THE GREATEST ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND ULTIMATELY GAIN MARKET SHARE.  THE BHF STORES FEATURE CUSTOM ORDER FURNITURE, FREE IN-HOME DESIGN VISITS (\u201cHOME MAKEOVERS\u201d), AND COORDINATED DECORATING ACCESSORIES.  OUR PHILOSOPHY IS BASED ON BUILDING STRONG LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH CUSTOMER.  SALES PEOPLE ARE REFERRED TO AS \u201cDESIGN CONSULTANTS\u201d AND ARE TRAINED TO EVALUATE CUSTOMER NEEDS AND PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR HOME DECOR.  UNTIL A RIGOROUS TRAINING AND DESIGN CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IS COMPLETED, DESIGN CONSULTANTS ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM IN-HOME DESIGN SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS.  WE HAVE FACTORIES IN NEWTON, NORTH CAROLINA AND GRAND PRAIRIE, TEXAS THAT MANUFACTURE CUSTOM UPHOLSTERED FURNITURE, A FACTORY IN MARTINSVILLE, VIRGINIA THAT PRIMARILY ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR CUSTOM CASUAL DINING OFFERINGS AND A FACTORY IN BASSETT, VIRGINIA THAT ASSEMBLES AND FINISHES OUR \u201cBENCH MADE\u201d LINE OF CUSTOM, SOLID HARDWOOD FURNITURE. OUR MANUFACTURING TEAM TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN THE BREADTH OF ITS OPTIONS, THE PRECISION OF ITS CRAFTSMANSHIP, AND THE SPEED OF ITS PROCESS, WITH CUSTOM PIECES OFTEN MANUFACTURED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF TAKING THE ORDER IN OUR STORES. OUR LOGISTICS TEAM THEN PROMPTLY SHIPS THE PRODUCT TO ONE OF OUR HOME DELIVERY HUBS OR TO A LOCATION SPECIFIED BY OUR LICENSEES.  IN ADDITION TO THE FURNITURE THAT WE MANUFACTURE DOMESTICALLY, WE SOURCE MOST OF OUR FORMAL BEDROOM AND DINING ROOM FURNITURE (CASEGOODS) AND CERTAIN LEATHER UPHOLSTERY OFFERINGS FROM SEVERAL FOREIGN PLANTS, PRIMARILY IN VIETNAM AND CHINA. OVER 70% OF THE PRODUCTS WE CURRENTLY SELL ARE MANUFACTURED IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ALSO OWN ZENITH FREIGHT LINES, LLC (\u201cZENITH\u201d) WHICH PROVIDES LOGISTICAL SERVICES TO BASSETT ALONG WITH OTHER FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS AND RETAILERS. ZENITH DELIVERS BEST-OF-CLASS SHIPPING AND LOGISTICAL SUPPORT SERVICES THAT ARE UNIQUELY TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF BASSETT AND THE FURNITURE INDUSTRY. OVER 60% OF ZENITH\u2019S REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SERVICES PROVIDED TO NON-BASSETT CUSTOMERS.  ON DECEMBER 21, 2017, WE PURCHASED CERTAIN ASSETS AND ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES OF LANE VENTURE FROM HERITAGE HOME GROUP, LLC FOR $15,556 IN CASH. LANE VENTURE IS A MANUFACTURER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM OUTDOOR FURNITURE, AND IS NOW BEING OPERATED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THIS ACQUISITION MARKED OUR ENTRY INTO THE MARKET FOR OUTDOOR FURNITURE AND WE BELIEVE THAT LANE VENTURE HAS PROVIDED A FOUNDATION FOR US TO BECOME A SIGNIFICANT PARTICIPANT IN THIS CATEGORY. WE PLAN TO DISTRIBUTE THIS BRAND OUTSIDE OF OUR BASSETT STORE NETWORK WITH PLANS TO INTRODUCE A BASSETT-BRANDED LINE IN THE STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. SEE NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THIS ACQUISITION.  23 OF 37  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  MARCH 2, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  AT MARCH 2, 2019, OUR BHF STORE NETWORK INCLUDED 69 COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND 33 LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OPENED NEW STORES IN CORAL GABLES, FLORIDA, COLUMBUS, OHIO, TUCSON, ARIZONA AND ESTERO, FLORIDA, AND A NEW LICENSEE STORE WAS OPENED IN BOISE, IDAHO. WE ALSO COMPLETED THE REPOSITIONING OF OUR STORE IN FRIENDSWOOD, TEXAS TO A NEW LOCATION IN THE BAYBROOK MALL AREA OF FRIENDSWOOD.  WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THE COMPANY THROUGH OPENING NEW STORES, REPOSITIONING STORES TO IMPROVED LOCATIONS WITHIN A MARKET AND CLOSING UNDERPERFORMING STORES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS PLANNED STORE OPENINGS WHERE LEASES HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.  SIZE  PLANNED  LOCATION  TYPE  SQ. FT.  OPENING  NEW STORES.  SARASOTA, FL  CORPORATE  8,000  Q2 2019  PRINCETON, NJ  CORPORATE  13,000  Q4 2019  THORNTON, CO  LICENSEE  23,000  Q1 2020  FOLLOWING THE PLANNED OPENINGS SHOWN ABOVE, WE EXPECT TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE PACE OF THE BHF NETWORK EXPANSION AND FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING PROFITABLE SALES VOLUME THROUGH OUR EXISTING STORES.  AS WITH ANY RETAIL OPERATION, PRIOR TO OPENING A NEW STORE WE INCUR SUCH EXPENSES AS RENT, TRAINING COSTS AND OTHER PAYROLL RELATED COSTS. THESE COSTS GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN $200 TO $400 PER STORE DEPENDING ON THE OVERALL RENT COSTS FOR THE LOCATION AND THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN WE TAKE PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE STORE SPACE AND THE TIME OF THE STORE OPENING. GENERALLY, RENT PAYMENTS DURING A BUILDOUT PERIOD BETWEEN DELIVERY OF POSSESSION AND OPENING OF A NEW STORE ARE DEFERRED AND THEREFORE STRAIGHT LINE RENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED DURING THAT TIME DOES NOT REQUIRE CASH. INHERENT IN OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL, WE ALSO INCUR LOSSES IN THE TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A NEW STORE OPENING. LIKE OTHER FURNITURE RETAILERS, WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A SALE UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO OUR CUSTOMER. BECAUSE OUR RETAIL BUSINESS MODEL GENERALLY DOES NOT INVOLVE MAINTAINING A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR FURNITURE OFFERINGS, DELIVERY TO OUR CUSTOMERS USUALLY OCCURS ABOUT 30 DAYS AFTER AN ORDER IS PLACED. WE GENERALLY REQUIRE A DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF ORDER AND COLLECT THE REMAINING BALANCE WHEN THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED, AT WHICH TIME THE SALE IS RECOGNIZED. COUPLED WITH THE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES CAN RANGE FROM $400 TO $600 PER STORE. WHILE OUR RETAIL EXPANSION IS INITIALLY COSTLY, WE BELIEVE OUR SITE SELECTION AND NEW STORE PRESENTATION WILL GENERALLY RESULT IN LOCATIONS THAT OPERATE AT OR ABOVE A RETAIL BREAK-EVEN LEVEL WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME FOLLOWING STORE OPENING. FACTORS AFFECTING THE LENGTH OF TIME REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS MAY INCLUDE THE LEVEL OF BRAND RECOGNITION, THE DEGREE OF LOCAL COMPETITION AND THE DEPTH OF PENETRATION IN A PARTICULAR MARKET. EVEN AS NEW STORES RAMP UP TO BREAK-EVEN, WE DO REALIZE ADDITIONAL WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME THAT LEVERAGES THE FIXED COSTS IN OUR WHOLESALE BUSINESS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR DIGITAL EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 JOURNEY FROM THE TIME THEY BEGIN ON OUR WEBSITE TO THE FINAL STEP OF DELIVERING THE GOODS TO THEIR HOMES. TODAY\u2019S CUSTOMERS EXPECT THEIR DIGITAL EXPERIENCES AND COMMUNICATIONS TO BE PERSONALIZED, HIGHLY-RELEVANT AND CATERED TO MATCH THEIR SPECIFIC NEEDS AND PREFERENCES. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING A CENTRALIZED CUSTOMER CARE CENTER THAT WILL TRACK EACH CUSTOMER'S PATH FROM INITIAL ENGAGEMENT THROUGH POINT OF SALE AND ULTIMATELY TO THEIR POST-DELIVERY EXPERIENCE WITH THE FURNITURE USING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (CRM) SOFTWARE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE DATA CAPTURED DURING THE CUSTOMER'S JOURNEY WILL PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHTS AND RESULT IN DRIVING OPERATIONAL BEST PRACTICES IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD.  24 OF 37  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  MARCH 2, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013  THREE MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  COMPARED WITH  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  FEBRUARY 24, 2018  .

WHOLESALE.  THE WHOLESALE HOME FURNISHINGS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED PRINCIPALLY IN THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, SOURCING, SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF FURNITURE PRODUCTS TO A NETWORK OF BASSETT STORES (COMPANY-OWNED AND LICENSEE-OWNED RETAIL STORES) AND INDEPENDENT FURNITURE RETAILERS. OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT INCLUDES OUR WOOD AND UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS, WHICH NOW INCLUDE LANE VENTURE, AS WELL AS ALL CORPORATE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING THOSE CORPORATE EXPENSES RELATED TO BOTH COMPANY- AND LICENSEE-OWNED STORES. WE ELIMINATE THE SALES BETWEEN OUR WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SEGMENTS AS WELL AS THE IMBEDDED PROFIT IN THE RETAIL INVENTORY FOR THE CONSOLIDATED PRESENTATION IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT ARE OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND OUR HOLDINGS OF RETAIL REAL ESTATE PREVIOUSLY LEASED AS LICENSEE STORES.

LOGISTICAL SERVICES.  OUR LOGISTICAL SERVICES SEGMENT REFLECTS THE OPERATIONS OF ZENITH.

QUARTERLY ANALYSIS OF RESULTS - WHOLESALE  ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR 14 WEEKS COMPARED TO 13 WEEKS), NET SALES INCREASED $4,482 OR 7.1%. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A $2,063 INCREASE IN LANE VENTURE SHIPMENTS OVER THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WHEN WE WERE THEN IN THE PROCESS OF INTEGRATING THE NEWLY ACQUIRED OPERATIONS INTO THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH A 3.0% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS TO THE BHF NETWORK AND A 4.6% INCREASE IN FURNITURE SHIPMENTS TO THE OPEN MARKET (OUTSIDE THE BHF NETWORK). GROSS MARGIN FOR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT WAS 32.9% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 32.4% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARGINS IN DOMESTIC CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY OPERATIONS AS PRICE INCREASES IMPLEMENTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 OFFSET THE INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS EXPERIENCED LATE IN 2017 AND EARLY 2018. THIS MARGIN IMPROVEMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS IN THE IMPORTED CASEGOODS OPERATION DUE TO A $390 INVENTORY VALUATION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXIT FROM THE JUVENILE LINE OF BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE UPHOLSTERY AND WOOD OPERATIONS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE. THE DECREASE IN SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GREATER LEVERAGE OF FIXED COSTS DUE TO HIGHER SALES VOLUMES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING AND OTHER BRAND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE.

ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS (NORMALIZING FOR THE EXTRA WEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019), COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 6.9%.  WHILE WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE SALES UNTIL GOODS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER, MANAGEMENT TRACKS WRITTEN SALES (THE RETAIL DOLLAR VALUE OF SALES ORDERS TAKEN, RATHER THAN DELIVERED) AS A KEY STORE PERFORMANCE INDICATOR. WRITTEN SALES FOR COMPARABLE STORES DECREASED BY 4.8% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS, COMPARABLE STORE WRITTEN SALES DECREASED 11.6%.  29 OF 37  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  MARCH 2, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE GROSS MARGINS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED CLEARANCE ACTIVITY DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF THE NEW CUSTOM UPHOLSTERY PROGRAM AND THE SELLOFF OF EXISTING FLOOR SAMPLES AND OTHER CLEARANCE PRODUCT AS A RESULT OF THE REPOSITIONING OF TWO STORES IN THE HOUSTON MARKET LATE IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR COMPARABLE STORES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 51.7% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE EXPENSES FROM UNFAVORABLE CLAIM EXPERIENCE AND INCREASED WAREHOUSING AND DELIVERY COSTS DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED TRANSITION OF THE BASSETT FINAL MILE SERVICE FROM ZENITH TO THE CORPORATE RETAIL OPERATION.  THE $104 INCREASE IN THE OPERATING LOSS FROM NON-COMPARABLE STORES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES NEW STORE PRE-OPENING COSTS OF $494 COMPARED TO $702 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE INCUR LOSSES IN THE FIRST TWO TO THREE MONTHS OF OPERATION FOLLOWING A STORE OPENING AS SALES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT UNTIL THE FURNITURE IS DELIVERED TO ITS CUSTOMERS RESULTING IN OPERATING EXPENSES WITHOUT THE NORMAL SALES VOLUME. BECAUSE WE DO NOT MAINTAIN A STOCK OF RETAIL INVENTORY THAT WOULD RESULT IN QUICK DELIVERY, AND BECAUSE OF THE CUSTOM NATURE OF THE FURNITURE OFFERINGS, SUCH DELIVERIES ARE GENERALLY NOT MADE UNTIL AFTER 30 DAYS FROM WHEN THE FURNITURE IS ORDERED BY THE CUSTOMER. COUPLED WITH THE PRE-OPENING COSTS, TOTAL START-UP LOSSES TYPICALLY AMOUNT TO $400 TO $600 PER STORE. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WE INCURRED $828 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUR NEW STORES OPENED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $740 OF POST-OPENING LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER LOCATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  EACH ADDITION TO OUR COMPANY-OWNED STORE NETWORK RESULTS IN INCREMENTAL FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCAL STORE PERSONNEL, OCCUPANCY COSTS AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES. THE INCREMENTAL SG&A EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH NEW STORE WILL BE ONGOING.  RETAIL BACKLOG  THE DOLLAR VALUE OF OUR RETAIL BACKLOG, REPRESENTING ORDERS RECEIVED BUT NOT YET DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, WAS $31,295, OR AN AVERAGE OF $454 PER OPEN STORE, AT MARCH 2, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH A RETAIL BACKLOG OF $34,343, OR AN AVERAGE OF $545 PER OPEN STORE, AT FEBRUARY 24, 2018.

THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DISCONTINUATION OF HOME DELIVERY SERVICES TO THIRD-PARTY CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN ZENITH\u2019S OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED EXPENSES IN THE HOME DELIVERY OPERATION.  30 OF 37  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  MARCH 2, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  OTHER  ITEMS  A  FFECTING  N  ET  INCOME  EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE OFFERED AN EARLY RETIREMENT PACKAGE TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. TWENTY-THREE EMPLOYEES ACCEPTED THE OFFER, WHICH EXPIRED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019. THESE EMPLOYEES ARE TO RECEIVE PAY EQUAL TO ONE-HALF THEIR CURRENT SALARY PLUS BENEFITS OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR FROM THE FINAL DAY OF EACH INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT. ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $835 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2, 2019. THE UNPAID OBLIGATION OF $835 AT MARCH 2, 2019 WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BE PAID OUT WITHIN ONE YEAR.  OTHER  L  OSS,  N  ET  OTHER LOSS, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2, 2019 WAS $123 AS COMPARED TO $627 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 2018. THE DECREASED NET LOSS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $378 IN DEATH BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES COVERING A FORMER EXECUTIVE, INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DUE TO RISING YIELDS ON OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO OVERALL LOWER LEVELS OF DEBT.  INCOME  T  AXES  AND IMPACT OF TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  WE CALCULATE AN ANTICIPATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR BASED ON OUR ANNUAL ESTIMATES OF PRETAX INCOME AND USE THAT EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO RECORD OUR YEAR-TO-DATE INCOME TAX PROVISION.  ANY CHANGE IN ANNUAL PROJECTIONS OF PRETAX INCOME COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE RESPECTIVE QUARTER.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT REDUCED THE FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FOR ALL CORPORATE TAXPAYERS.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 2, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES.  BECAUSE THE ACT SPECIFIED THE NEW 21% TAX RATE BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE WERE ONLY SUBJECT TO THE REDUCED RATE FOR 11 MONTHS OF 2018.  THEREFORE, WE COMPUTED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2018 USING A BLENDED FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 22.2%.  HOWEVER, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 2018 WAS 164.2% PRIMARILY DUE TO A $2,157 DISCRETE CHARGE TO RE-MEASURE OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT THE LOWER STATUTORY RATE.  OTHER ITEMS IMPACTING OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 2018 INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF STATE INCOME TAXES AND VARIOUS PERMANENT DIFFERENCES INCLUDING THE FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $181 AND THE SECTION 199: DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES DEDUCTION, WHICH WAS ELIMINATED BY THE ACT FOR OUR FISCAL 2019 TAX RETURN.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOWS  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $15,734 COMPARED TO $996 USED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF $14,738. THIS INCREASE IN CASH USED IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN INVENTORY IN ANTICIPATION OF POTENTIAL TARIFF INCREASES ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED TO GO INTO EFFECT DECEMBER 31, 2018, OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL DUE IN PART TO THE TIMING IMPACT OF THE SHIFT IN OUR FISCAL QUARTER END RESULTING FROM THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES ON AN AVERAGE WEEKLY BASIS RESULTING IN REDUCED CASH FLOWS.  OUR OVERALL CASH POSITION DECREASED BY $23,482 DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. IN ADDITION TO THE CASH USED IN OPERATIONS, WE USED $5,435 OF CASH IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE EXPANSION AND RELOCATIONS. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $2,313, INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS OF $1,291 AND STOCK REPURCHASES OF $1,012 UNDER OUR EXISTING SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN, OF WHICH $16,973 REMAINS AUTHORIZED AT MARCH 2, 2019. WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING $32,629 ON HAND AT MARCH 2, 2019, EXPECTED FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND EXPECTED REDUCED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FROM FEWER STORE OPENINGS, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  31 OF 37  PART I-FINANCIAL INFORMATION-CONTINUED  BASSETT FURNITURE INDUSTRIES, INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES  MARCH 2, 2019  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE DATA)  DEBT AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  OUR CREDIT FACILITY WITH OUR BANK PROVIDES FOR A LINE OF CREDIT OF UP TO $25,000.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FUEL EXPENSE. PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) WAS  $832 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $149 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE  MARCH 2019  QUARTER WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  REVENUE.  COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER, OUR OPERATING REVENUE  INCREASED  $504 MILLION  , OR  5.1%  , PRIMARILY FROM GROWTH IN ALL COMPONENTS OF PASSENGER REVENUE WITH PREMIUM PRODUCT TICKET REVENUE DRIVING NEARLY HALF OF THE IMPROVEMENT, AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUE FROM OUR AMENDED AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  5.0%  HIGHER  CAPACITY, GENERATED A  0.1%  INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (\"TRASM\") AND A  2.4%  INCREASE IN TRASM, ADJUSTED (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSE.  TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSE  INCREASED  $328 MILLION  , OR  3.6%  . OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING COST PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (\"CASM\")  DECREASED  1.4%  TO  15.14 CENTS  COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG COST CONTROLS AND HIGHER CAPACITY, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FUEL EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN FUEL EXPENSE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM A  3%  INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY AT OUR REFINERY. NON-FUEL UNIT COSTS (\"CASM-EX\" A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  DECREASED  0.2%  TO  11.06 CENTS  COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER.  NON-OPERATING RESULTS.  TOTAL NON-OPERATING EXPENSE WAS  $74 MILLION  IN THE  MARCH 2019  QUARTER,  $38 MILLION  LOWER THAN THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PENSION INCOME.

PASSENGER REVENUE RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS  INCREASED  2.3%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON CAPACITY INCREASES IN ALL REGIONS, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  22  IN THE ATLANTIC, UNIT REVENUE DECREASED DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND AND INCREASED CAPACITY IN THE REGION AS WE INVESTED IN NEW ROUTES TO OUR HUBS IN AMSTERDAM AND PARIS. GROWTH IN PREMIUM PRODUCT DEMAND PARTIALLY MITIGATED THE UNIT REVENUE DECREASE.  UNIT REVENUE INCREASED IN LATIN AMERICA FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE QUARTER AS A RESULT OF YIELD GROWTH, MAINLY IN MEXICO AND THE CARIBBEAN. OUR JOINT COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH AEROME\u0301XICO CONTINUES TO GENERATE REVENUE GROWTH IN BOTH THE BEACH AND BUSINESS MARKETS OF MEXICO, WHILE THE CARIBBEAN CONTINUES TO REBOUND FROM THE 2017 HURRICANES.  UNIT REVENUE DECREASED IN THE PACIFIC REGION PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHALLENGING FARE ENVIRONMENTS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WE AMENDED OUR CO-BRAND AGREEMENT WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND WE ALSO AMENDED OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS DURING THE MARCH QUARTER. THE NEW AGREEMENTS INCREASE THE VALUE WE RECEIVE AND EXTEND THE TERMS TO 2029. UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, WE SELL MILEAGE CREDITS TO AMERICAN EXPRESS AND ALLOW AMERICAN EXPRESS TO MARKET ITS SERVICES OR PRODUCTS USING OUR BRAND AND CUSTOMER DATABASE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD WITH THE MILEAGE CREDITS (SUCH AS AWARD TRAVEL, PRIORITY BOARDING, BAGGAGE FEE WAIVERS, LOUNGE ACCESS AND THE USE OF OUR BRAND) ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS. WE CONTINUE TO USE THE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WITH THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS, THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE BRAND COMPONENT HAS INCREASED, RESULTING IN AN ADDITIONAL $130 MILLION PRIMARILY WITHIN OTHER REVENUE DURING THE MARCH 2019 QUARTER. INCLUDING THIS AMOUNT, WE EXPECT THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION DURING 2019.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY INCLUDES AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES, OUR VACATION WHOLESALE OPERATIONS, OUR PRIVATE JET OPERATIONS AND REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH ARE AT OR NEAR COST, DECREASED  $164 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER. MARCH 2018 QUARTER RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED $60 MILLION OF REVENUE FROM DGS, WHICH WAS SOLD IN DECEMBER 2018 AND IS NO LONGER REFLECTED IN ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN OUR MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL (\"MRO\") REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED $64 MILLION TO $228 MILLION DURING THE MARCH 2019 QUARTER.  MISCELLANEOUS.

FOR THE REASON FUEL EXPENSE IS ADJUSTED FOR MTM ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS, SEE \"SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\" BELOW.  CONTRACTED SERVICES  . THE INCREASE IN CONTRACTED SERVICES EXPENSE PREDOMINANTLY RELATES TO SERVICES PERFORMED BY DGS THAT WERE RECORDED IN SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THAT BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MATERIALS AND OUTSIDE REPAIRS.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MATERIALS AND OUTSIDE REPAIRS CONSIST OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT USED IN OUR OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE IN AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MATERIALS AND OUTSIDE REPAIRS EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATES TO AN INCREASE IN MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SERVICE RELIABILITY OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES, OUR VACATION WHOLESALE OPERATIONS, OUR PRIVATE JET OPERATIONS AND REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH ARE AT OR NEAR COST, DECREASED  $164 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  MARCH 2018  QUARTER. IN ADDITION, COSTS RELATED TO SERVICES PERFORMED BY DGS ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES WERE RECORDED IN ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THAT BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018.  24  NON-OPERATING RESULTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE)  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  $(83  )  $(92  )  $9  UNREALIZED GAIN ON INVESTMENTS, NET  100  18  82  MISCELLANEOUS, NET  (91  )  (38  )  (53  )  TOTAL NON-OPERATING EXPENSE, NET  $(74  )  $(112  )  $38  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON OUR DEBT, DESPITE AN INCREASE IN TOTAL DEBT.  UNREALIZED GAIN ON INVESTMENTS REFLECTS THE UNREALIZED GAINS ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN GOL, CHINA EASTERN AND AIR FRANCE-KLM.  MISCELLANEOUS IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF EARNINGS FROM OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND GRUPO AEROME\u0301XICO, PENSION-RELATED BENEFITS/COSTS, CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES. OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT EARNINGS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES VARY AND IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF MISCELLANEOUS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  INCOME TAXES  WE PROJECT THAT OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2019 WILL BE BETWEEN 23% AND 24%. IN CERTAIN INTERIM PERIODS, WE MAY HAVE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN PRIOR YEAR ESTIMATES AND TAX LAWS ENACTED DURING THE PERIOD, WHICH WILL IMPACT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THAT INTERIM PERIOD.  REFINERY SEGMENT  THE REFINERY PRIMARILY PRODUCES GASOLINE, DIESEL AND JET FUEL. MONROE EXCHANGES THE NON-JET FUEL PRODUCTS THE REFINERY PRODUCES WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR JET FUEL CONSUMED IN OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS. THE JET FUEL PRODUCED AND PROCURED THROUGH EXCHANGING GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL PRODUCED BY THE REFINERY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY  200,000  BARRELS PER DAY FOR USE IN OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE JET FUEL SUPPLY RESULTING FROM THE REFINERY'S OPERATION CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING THE MARKET PRICE OF JET FUEL AND THUS LOWERS OUR COST OF JET FUEL COMPARED TO WHAT IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE.  THE REFINERY RECORDED OPERATING REVENUE OF  $1.3 BILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $1.5 BILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . OPERATING REVENUE IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF  $732 MILLION  OF NON-JET FUEL PRODUCTS EXCHANGED WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PROCURE JET FUEL,  $271 MILLION  OF SALES OF JET FUEL TO THE AIRLINE SEGMENT AND  $232 MILLION  OF NON-JET FUEL PRODUCT SALES. REFINERY REVENUES DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO LOWER COSTS OF CRUDE OIL LEADING TO LOWER PRICING FOR ASSOCIATED REFINED PRODUCTS AND LOWER REFINERY RUN RATES.  THE REFINERY RECORDED AN OPERATING LOSS OF  $34 MILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $44 MILLION  IN  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  A REFINERY IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REQUIREMENTS TO BLEND RENEWABLE FUELS INTO THE GASOLINE AND ON-ROAD DIESEL FUEL IT PRODUCES. ALTERNATIVELY, A REFINERY MAY PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS, CALLED RENEWABLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (\"RINS\"), FROM THIRD PARTIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. THE REFINERY PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF ITS RINS REQUIREMENT IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.

IS A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF DELTA.  27  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR CASH NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $4.9 BILLION  IN UNRESTRICTED LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING OF  $1.9 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND  $3.0 BILLION  IN AVAILABLE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE USED EXISTING CASH, CASH RECEIVED FROM FINANCINGS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $1.4 BILLION  AND RETURN  $1.6 BILLION  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WE GENERATED POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF  $2.0 BILLION  AND  $1.4 BILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE GENERATING POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS ARE IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  SEASONALITY OF ADVANCE TICKET SALES.  WE SELL TICKETS FOR AIR TRAVEL IN ADVANCE OF THE CUSTOMER'S TRAVEL DATE. WHEN WE RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF SALE, WE RECORD THE CASH RECEIVED ON ADVANCE SALES AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY. THE AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY INCREASES DURING THE WINTER AND SPRING AS ADVANCED TICKET SALES GROW PRIOR TO THE SUMMER PEAK TRAVEL SEASON AND DECREASES DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS.  FUEL.  FUEL EXPENSE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  21%  OF OUR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . THE MARKET PRICE FOR JET FUEL IS VOLATILE, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR PERIODIC CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.  WE HAVE NO MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN  2019  . HOWEVER, WE VOLUNTARILY CONTRIBUTED  $250 MILLION  TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS DURING APRIL  2019  , AND WE PLAN TO VOLUNTARILY CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $250 MILLION IN JULY 2019. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE CONTRIBUTED $500 MILLION TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  PROFIT SHARING.  OUR BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM PROVIDES THAT FOR EACH YEAR IN WHICH WE HAVE AN ANNUAL PRE-TAX PROFIT, AS DEFINED BY THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM, WE WILL PAY A SPECIFIED PORTION OF THAT PROFIT TO EMPLOYEES. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT SHARING, THE PROGRAM DEFINES PROFIT AS PRE-TAX PROFIT ADJUSTED FOR PROFIT SHARING AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ACCRUED  $220 MILLION  IN PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE BASED ON THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR  2019  PROFIT.  WE PAID $1.3 BILLION IN PROFIT SHARING IN FEBRUARY  2019  RELATED TO OUR  2018  PRE-TAX PROFIT IN RECOGNITION OF OUR EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD MEETING OUR FINANCIAL GOALS.  28  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $1.4 BILLION  AND  $1.3 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASES OF A350-900, A321-200, B-737-900ER, A220-100 AND CRJ-900 AIRCRAFT, ADVANCED DEPOSIT PAYMENTS ON FUTURE AIRCRAFT ORDER COMMITMENTS AND ENHANCING THE CABINS ON OUR DOMESTIC FLEET.  WE HAVE COMMITTED TO FUTURE AIRCRAFT PURCHASES AND HAVE OBTAINED, BUT ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO USE, LONG-TERM FINANCING COMMITMENTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT. OUR EXPECTED  2019  INVESTMENTS OF  $4.7 BILLION WILL BE PRIMARILY FOR (1) AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING DELIVERIES OF A321-200S, A220-100S, B-737-900ERS, A330-900NEOS, A350-900S AND CRJ-900S, ALONG WITH ADVANCE DEPOSIT PAYMENTS FOR THESE AND A321-200NEOS AND A220-300S AS WELL AS (2) AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH RELATE TO ENHANCING THE CABINS ON OUR DOMESTIC FLEET.  LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (\"LAX\") CONSTRUCTION.  DURING 2016, WE EXECUTED A MODIFIED LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES (\"THE CITY\"), WHICH OWNS AND OPERATES LAX, AND ANNOUNCED PLANS TO MODERNIZE, UPGRADE AND CONNECT TERMINALS 2 AND 3 AT LAX BY 2023. UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT, WE HAVE RELOCATED CERTAIN AIRLINES AND OTHER TENANTS LOCATED IN TERMINALS 2 AND 3 TO TERMINALS 5 AND 6 AND UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS INITIAL PROJECTS TO ENABLE OPERATIONS FROM TERMINALS 2 AND 3 DURING THE PROJECT. WE ARE NOW DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING THE REDEVELOPMENT OF TERMINAL 3 AND ENHANCEMENT OF TERMINAL 2, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES REBUILD OF THE TICKETING AND ARRIVAL HALLS AND SECURITY CHECKPOINT, CONSTRUCTION OF CORE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE CITY'S PLANNED AIRPORT PEOPLE MOVER, RAMP IMPROVEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SECURE CONNECTOR TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TOM BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL.  UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT PROJECT COMPONENT APPROVALS BY THE CITY'S BOARD OF AIRPORT COMMISSIONERS, THE CITY HAS APPROPRIATED TO DATE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION TO PURCHASE COMPLETED PROJECT ASSETS. THE LEASE ALLOWS FOR A MAXIMUM REIMBURSEMENT BY THE CITY OF $1.8 BILLION. COSTS WE INCUR IN EXCESS OF SUCH A MAXIMUM WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE CITY.  A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT COSTS WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL AIRPORTS IMPROVEMENT CORPORATION (\"RAIC\"), A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION, USING AN $800 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED BY A GROUP OF LENDERS. THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXECUTED DURING 2017, AND WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RAIC UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. LOANS MADE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE REPAID WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM THE CITY\u2019S PURCHASE OF COMPLETED PROJECT ASSETS. USING FUNDING PROVIDED BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND/OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $230 MILLION ON THIS PROJECT DURING  2019  , OF WHICH $49 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  NEW YORK-LAGUARDIA REDEVELOPMENT.  AS PART OF THE TERMINAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY (THE \u201cPORT AUTHORITY\u201d) TO REPLACE TERMINALS C AND D WITH A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART TERMINAL FACILITY CONSISTING OF 37 GATES ACROSS FOUR CONCOURSES CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL HEADHOUSE. THE TERMINAL WILL FEATURE A NEW, LARGER DELTA SKY CLUB, WIDER CONCOURSES, MORE GATE SEATING AND 30 PERCENT MORE CONCESSIONS SPACE THAN THE EXISTING TERMINALS. THE FACILITY WILL ALSO OFFER DIRECT ACCESS BETWEEN THE PARKING GARAGE AND TERMINAL AND IMPROVED ROADWAYS AND DROP-OFF/PICK-UP AREAS. THE DESIGN OF THE NEW TERMINAL WILL INTEGRATE SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY. CONSTRUCTION WILL BE PHASED TO LIMIT PASSENGER INCONVENIENCE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY 2026.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE REDEVELOPMENT, DURING 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED TERMINAL LEASE WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY WITH A TERM THROUGH 2050. PURSUANT TO THE LEASE AGREEMENT WE WILL (1) FUND (THROUGH DEBT ISSUANCE AND EXISTING CASH) AND UNDERTAKE THE DESIGN, MANAGEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERMINAL AND CERTAIN OFF-PREMISES SUPPORTING FACILITIES, (2) RECEIVE A PORT AUTHORITY CONTRIBUTION OF $600 MILLION TO FACILITATE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERMINAL AND OTHER SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE, (3) BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE DURING THE TERM OF THE LEASE AND (4) HAVE PREFERENTIAL RIGHTS TO ALL GATES IN THE TERMINAL SUBJECT TO PORT AUTHORITY REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ACCOMMODATION OF DESIGNATED CARRIERS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR NET PROJECT COST TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION AND WE BEAR THE RISKS OF PROJECT CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL COST OVER-RUNS. USING FUNDING PROVIDED BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $530 MILLION ON THIS PROJECT DURING  2019  , OF WHICH $134 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  29  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DEBT AND FINANCE LEASES.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A  $1 BILLION  TERM LOAN ISSUED BY TWO LENDERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID  $300 MILLION  IN MARCH 2019. THIS LOAN, WHICH IS UNSECURED, BEARS INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE EQUAL TO LIBOR PLUS A SPECIFIED MARGIN AND IS DUE IN FEBRUARY 2020. WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN TO ACCELERATE PLANNED 2019 REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  IN MARCH 2019, WE COMPLETED A $500 MILLION OFFERING OF PASS THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2019-1 (\"2019-1 EETC\") THROUGH A PASS THROUGH TRUST. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING TO REFINANCE DEBT MATURING DURING 2019.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT AND FINANCE LEASES WAS  $10.7 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  CAPITAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 26 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF  $1.3 BILLION.  IN THE  MARCH 2019  QUARTER, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AND WE PAID A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF  $0.35  PER SHARE, FOR TOTAL CASH DIVIDENDS OF $233 MILLION.  UNDRAWN LINES OF CREDIT  WE HAVE  $3.0 BILLION  AVAILABLE IN UNDRAWN REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT. THESE CREDIT FACILITIES INCLUDE COVENANTS CUSTOMARY FOR FINANCING OF THIS TYPE. IF WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES OR WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DRAW ON THEM.  COVENANTS  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS IN OUR FINANCINGS AT MARCH 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW, FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE THE \"CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\" SECTION OF \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" IN OUR FORM 10-K.  LOYALTY PROGRAM  OUR SKYMILES LOYALTY PROGRAM GENERATES CUSTOMER LOYALTY BY REWARDING CUSTOMERS WITH INCENTIVES TO TRAVEL ON DELTA. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO EARN MILEAGE CREDITS BY FLYING ON DELTA, DELTA CONNECTION AND OTHER AIRLINES THAT PARTICIPATE IN THE LOYALTY PROGRAM. WHEN TRAVELING, CUSTOMERS EARN REDEEMABLE MILEAGE CREDITS BASED ON THE PASSENGER'S LOYALTY PROGRAM STATUS AND TICKET PRICE. CUSTOMERS CAN ALSO EARN MILEAGE CREDITS THROUGH PARTICIPATING COMPANIES SUCH AS CREDIT CARD COMPANIES, HOTELS AND CAR RENTAL AGENCIES. TO FACILITATE TRANSACTIONS WITH PARTICIPATING COMPANIES, WE SELL MILEAGE CREDITS TO NON-AIRLINE BUSINESSES, CUSTOMERS AND OTHER AIRLINES. MILEAGE CREDITS ARE REDEEMABLE BY CUSTOMERS IN FUTURE PERIODS FOR AIR TRAVEL ON DELTA AND OTHER PARTICIPATING AIRLINES, MEMBERSHIP IN OUR SKY CLUB AND OTHER PROGRAM AWARDS.  OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT TO SELL MILEAGE CREDITS RELATES TO OUR CO-BRAND CREDIT CARD RELATIONSHIP WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS. OUR AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS PROVIDE FOR JOINT MARKETING, GRANT CERTAIN BENEFITS TO DELTA-AMERICAN EXPRESS CO-BRANDED CREDIT CARD HOLDERS (\"CARDHOLDERS\") AND AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, AND ALLOW AMERICAN EXPRESS TO MARKET ITS SERVICES OR PRODUCTS USING OUR CUSTOMER DATABASE. CARDHOLDERS EARN MILEAGE CREDITS FOR MAKING PURCHASES USING CO-BRANDED CARDS, AND CERTAIN CARDHOLDERS MAY ALSO CHECK THEIR FIRST BAG FOR FREE, ARE GRANTED DISCOUNTED ACCESS TO DELTA SKY CLUB LOUNGES AND RECEIVE PRIORITY BOARDING AND OTHER BENEFITS WHILE TRAVELING ON DELTA. ADDITIONALLY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM MAY EXCHANGE THEIR POINTS FOR MILEAGE CREDITS UNDER THE LOYALTY PROGRAM. WE SELL MILEAGE CREDITS AT AGREED-UPON RATES TO AMERICAN EXPRESS WHICH ARE THEN PROVIDED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS UNDER THE CO-BRAND CREDIT CARD PROGRAM AND THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM.  30  WE ACCOUNT FOR MARKETING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS, CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED TO THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DELIVERED. WE ALLOCATE THE VALUE BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH GENERALLY CONSIST OF AWARD TRAVEL, PRIORITY BOARDING, BAGGAGE FEE WAIVERS, LOUNGE ACCESS AND THE USE OF OUR BRAND. WE DETERMINED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICES BY CONSIDERING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING MULTIPLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING: (1) THE EXPECTED NUMBER OF MILES AWARDED AND NUMBER OF MILES REDEEMED, (2)  ETV  FOR THE AWARD TRAVEL OBLIGATION, (3) PUBLISHED RATES ON OUR WEBSITE FOR BAGGAGE FEES, DISCOUNTED ACCESS TO DELTA SKY CLUB LOUNGES AND OTHER BENEFITS WHILE TRAVELING ON DELTA AND (4) BRAND VALUE.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WE AMENDED OUR CO-BRAND AGREEMENT WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS, AND WE ALSO AMENDED OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS DURING THE MARCH QUARTER. THE NEW AGREEMENTS INCREASE THE VALUE WE RECEIVE AND EXTEND THE TERMS TO 2029. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DELIVERED ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS AGREEMENTS, AND WE CONTINUE TO USE THE ACCOUNTING METHOD THAT ALLOCATES THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED BASED ON THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICES OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE DEFER THE AMOUNT FOR AWARD TRAVEL OBLIGATION AS PART OF LOYALTY PROGRAM DEFERRED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZE LOYALTY TRAVEL AWARDS IN PASSENGER REVENUE AS THE MILEAGE CREDITS ARE USED FOR TRAVEL. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO SERVICES PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A PASSENGER\u2019S FLIGHT, SUCH AS BAGGAGE FEE WAIVERS, IS RECOGNIZED AS TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES IN PASSENGER REVENUE WHEN THE RELATED SERVICE IS PERFORMED. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO ACCESS DELTA SKY CLUB LOUNGES IS RECOGNIZED AS MISCELLANEOUS IN OTHER REVENUE AS ACCESS IS PROVIDED. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, PRIMARILY BRAND VALUE, IS RECORDED AS LOYALTY PROGRAM IN OTHER REVENUE OVER TIME AS MILES ARE DELIVERED.  RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  . IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-02, \"INCOME STATEMENT\u2014REPORTING COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (TOPIC 220).\" THIS STANDARD PROVIDES AN OPTION TO RECLASSIFY STRANDED TAX EFFECTS WITHIN AOCI  TO RETAINED EARNINGS DUE TO THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE CHANGE IN THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017. THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 WITH THE ELECTION NOT TO RECLASSIFY  $1.2 BILLION  OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RELATED TO OUR PENSION PLANS FROM AOCI TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  31  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  WE SOMETIMES USE INFORMATION (\"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\") THAT IS DERIVED FROM THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUT THAT IS NOT PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES, NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BUT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO GAAP RESULTS. RECONCILIATIONS BELOW MAY NOT CALCULATE EXACTLY DUE TO ROUNDING.  PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS A RECONCILIATION OF PRE-TAX INCOME (A GAAP MEASURE) TO PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE). WE ADJUST PRE-TAX INCOME FOR MARK-TO-MARKET (\"MTM\") ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS ON FUEL HEDGE CONTRACTS, THE MTM ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED BY OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES, VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND AEROME\u0301XICO, AND UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENTS IN GOL, CHINA EASTERN AND AIR FRANCE-KLM, TO DETERMINE PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED.  \u2022  MTM ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS.  MTM ADJUSTMENTS ARE DEFINED AS FAIR VALUE CHANGES RECORDED IN PERIODS OTHER THAN THE SETTLEMENT PERIOD. SUCH FAIR VALUE CHANGES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE ACTUAL SETTLEMENT VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGE IN THE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT PERIOD. SETTLEMENTS REPRESENT CASH RECEIVED OR PAID ON HEDGE CONTRACTS SETTLED DURING THE PERIOD.  \u2022  EQUITY INVESTMENT MTM ADJUSTMENTS.  WE RECORD OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF EARNINGS/LOSS FROM OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND AEROME\u0301XICO IN NON-OPERATING EXPENSE. WE ADJUST FOR OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES' HEDGE PORTFOLIO MTM ADJUSTMENTS TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PERIODS SHOWN.  \u2022  UNREALIZED GAIN/LOSS ON INVESTMENTS.  WE RECORD THE UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE IN NON-OPERATING EXPENSE. ADJUSTING FOR THESE GAINS/LOSSES ALLOWS INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN THE PERIODS SHOWN.  \u2022  DGS SALE ADJUSTMENT.  BECAUSE WE SOLD DGS IN DECEMBER 2018, WE HAVE EXCLUDED THE IMPACT OF DGS FROM HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR BETTER COMPARABILITY.  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  PRE-TAX INCOME  $946  $732  ADJUSTED FOR.

WE ADJUST TRASM FOR REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES TO DETERMINE TRASM, ADJUSTED BECAUSE THESE REVENUES ARE NOT RELATED TO OUR AIRLINE SEGMENT. TRASM, ADJUSTED THEREFORE PROVIDES A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF REVENUE FROM OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS TO THE REST OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  DGS SALE ADJUSTMENT.  WE ADJUST FOR THE DGS SALE FOR THE SAME REASON DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED.

WE ADJUST CASM FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS TO DETERMINE CASM-EX, FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  AIRCRAFT FUEL AND RELATED TAXES.  THE VOLATILITY IN FUEL PRICES IMPACTS THE COMPARABILITY OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE ADJUSTMENT FOR AIRCRAFT FUEL AND RELATED TAXES ALLOWS INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR NON-FUEL COSTS AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  \u2022  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.  THESE EXPENSES INCLUDE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES, OUR VACATION WHOLESALE OPERATIONS AND REFINERY COST OF SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. 2018 RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE STAFFING SERVICES PERFORMED BY DGS. BECAUSE THESE BUSINESSES ARE NOT RELATED TO THE GENERATION OF A SEAT MILE, WE ADJUST FOR THE COSTS RELATED TO THESE AREAS TO PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF THE COSTS OF OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS TO THE REST OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  PROFIT SHARING.  WE ADJUST FOR PROFIT SHARING BECAUSE THIS ADJUSTMENT ALLOWS INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE OUR RECURRING COST PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR CORE OPERATING COSTS TO THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  1.  ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  UNITED RENTALS, INC. (\u201cHOLDINGS,\u201d \u201cURI\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) IS PRINCIPALLY A HOLDING COMPANY AND CONDUCTS ITS OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, UNITED RENTALS (NORTH AMERICA), INC. (\u201cURNA\u201d), AND SUBSIDIARIES OF URNA. HOLDINGS\u2019 PRIMARY ASSET IS ITS SOLE OWNERSHIP OF ALL ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF URNA. URNA\u2019S VARIOUS CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON ITS ABILITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS TO ITS SHAREHOLDER.  WE RENT EQUIPMENT TO A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE THAT INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS, UTILITIES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOMEOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA AND EUROPE. IN ADDITION TO RENTING EQUIPMENT, WE SELL NEW AND USED RENTAL EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS RELATED CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES, PARTS AND SERVICE.  WE HAVE PREPARED THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  (THE \u201c  2018  FORM 10-K\u201d) AND THE INTERIM REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF FORM 10-Q. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN INFORMATION AND NOTE DISCLOSURES NORMALLY INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) HAVE BEEN CONDENSED OR OMITTED. THESE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE  2018  FORM 10-K.  IN OUR OPINION, ALL ADJUSTMENTS, CONSISTING ONLY OF NORMAL RECURRING ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR A FAIR PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE INTERIM PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN MADE. INTERIM RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF THE FULL YEAR.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  MEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT WILL REQUIRE COMPANIES TO PRESENT ASSETS HELD AT AMORTIZED COST AND AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES NET OF THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES TO BE BASED ON RELEVANT INFORMATION FROM PAST EVENTS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCES, CURRENT CONDITIONS AND REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE FORECASTS THAT AFFECT COLLECTIBILITY. THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THE GUIDANCE REQUIRE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION. THIS GUIDANCE DOES NOT APPLY TO RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM OPERATING LEASES. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS LEASE REVENUE (SUCH REVENUE REPRESENTED  78  PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING WHETHER WE WILL EARLY ADOPT THIS GUIDANCE, AND THE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHILE LIMITED TO OUR NON-OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES, IS NOT CURRENTLY ESTIMABLE, AS IT WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR FORECAST EXPECTATIONS UPON, AND FOLLOWING, ADOPTION.  SIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  . IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY THE SUBSEQUENT ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. PRIOR GUIDANCE REQUIRED UTILIZING A TWO-STEP PROCESS TO REVIEW GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. A SECOND STEP WAS REQUIRED IF THERE WAS AN INDICATION THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST, AND THE SECOND STEP REQUIRED CALCULATING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S GOODWILL (AS IF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING WERE PERFORMED ON THE TESTING DATE) WITH THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE GOODWILL. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE SECOND STEP FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD PERFORM ITS ANNUAL, OR INTERIM, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT WITH ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, AND THEN RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDS THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S FAIR VALUE (ALTHOUGH THE LOSS SHOULD NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GOODWILL ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTING UNIT). THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES PROSPECTIVE ADOPTION AND WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL OR INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. EARLY ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE IS PERMITTED FOR INTERIM OR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS PERFORMED ON TESTING DATES AFTER JANUARY 1, 2017. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING WHETHER WE WILL EARLY ADOPT. THE GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  GUIDANCE ADOPTED IN 2019  LEASES  . SEE NOTE  8  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR LEASE ACCOUNTING FOLLOWING OUR ADOPTION OF AN UPDATED FASB LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING  . IN 2019, WE PROSPECTIVELY ADOPTED GUIDANCE INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER PORTRAY THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF AN ENTITY\u2019S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS ADDITIONALLY INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY HEDGE ACCOUNTING, AND NO LONGER REQUIRES SEPARATE MEASUREMENT AND REPORTING OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS. FOR CASH FLOW AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES EXISTING AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO APPLY A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO ELIMINATING THE SEPARATE MEASUREMENT OF INEFFECTIVENESS TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. OUR USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS LIMITED, AND WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. GIVEN OUR LIMITED USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  2.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  IN MAY 2014, AND IN SUBSEQUENT UPDATES, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 606\") TO CLARIFY THE PRINCIPLES FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 606 ON JANUARY 1, 2018. TOPIC 606 INCLUDES THE REQUIRED STEPS TO ACHIEVE THE CORE PRINCIPLE THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES.  IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 842\"), AS EXPLAINED FURTHER IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 ON JANUARY 1, 2019. TOPIC 842 IS AN UPDATE TO TOPIC 840, WHICH WAS THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN PLACE THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018. AS REFLECTED BELOW, MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 (TOPIC 840 FOR 2018). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH TWO DIFFERENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS: 1) TOPIC 606 AND 2) TOPIC 842. UNDER TOPIC 606, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION SPECIFIED IN THE CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER, AND EXCLUDES ANY SALES INCENTIVES AND AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER, AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER TOPIC 606. AS REFLECTED BELOW, MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN WE SATISFY A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OVER A PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  NATURE OF GOODS AND SERVICES  IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, REVENUE IS SUMMARIZED BY TYPE AND BY THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.

THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN OUR GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT AND IN THE U.S. (FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2019  ,  81  PERCENT AND  91  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, RESPECTIVELY). WE BELIEVE THAT THE DISAGGREGATION OF OUR REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS TO CUSTOMERS AS REFLECTED ABOVE, COUPLED WITH THE FURTHER DISCUSSION BELOW AND THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHICAL MARKET DISCLOSURES IN NOTES  4  AND  11  , DEPICTS HOW THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF OUR REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC FACTORS.  LEASE REVENUES (TOPIC 842)  THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TYPES OF REVENUE THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 IS DISCUSSED BELOW.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENT OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT REVENUE TYPE (THEY ACCOUNTED FOR  72  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ) AND ARE GOVERNED BY OUR STANDARD RENTAL CONTRACT. WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH RENTALS AS OPERATING LEASES. THE LEASE TERMS ARE INCLUDED IN OUR CONTRACTS, AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OUR CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS OR JUDGMENTS. OUR LEASE REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE PAYMENTS.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS.  OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENT REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT THAT WE OWN. WE DO NOT GENERALLY PROVIDE AN OPTION FOR THE LESSEE TO PURCHASE THE RENTED EQUIPMENT AT THE END OF THE LEASE, AND DO NOT GENERATE MATERIAL REVENUE FROM SALES OF EQUIPMENT UNDER SUCH OPTIONS.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. OUR RENTAL CONTRACT PERIODS ARE HOURLY, DAILY, WEEKLY OR MONTHLY. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, IF A CUSTOMER WERE TO RENT A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE DAILY, WEEKLY AND MONTHLY RENTAL RATES FOR THAT PARTICULAR PIECE WERE (IN ACTUAL DOLLARS) $100, $300 AND $900, RESPECTIVELY, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE OF $32.14 PER DAY. THE DAILY RATE FOR RECOGNITION PURPOSES IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE MONTHLY RATE OF $900 BY THE MONTHLY TERM OF 28 DAYS. THIS DAILY RATE ASSUMES THAT THE EQUIPMENT WILL BE ON RENT FOR THE FULL 28 DAYS, AS WE ARE UNSURE OF WHEN THE CUSTOMER WILL RETURN THE EQUIPMENT AND THEREFORE UNSURE OF WHICH RENTAL CONTRACT PERIOD WILL APPLY.  AS PART OF THIS STRAIGHT-LINE METHODOLOGY, WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED, WE RECOGNIZE AS INCREMENTAL REVENUE THE EXCESS, IF ANY, BETWEEN THE AMOUNT THE CUSTOMER IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY, WHICH IS BASED ON THE RENTAL CONTRACT PERIOD APPLICABLE TO THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DAYS THE EQUIPMENT WAS OUT ON RENT, OVER THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED TO DATE. IN ANY GIVEN ACCOUNTING PERIOD, WE WILL HAVE CUSTOMERS RETURN EQUIPMENT AND BE CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY US MORE THAN THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED TO DATE UNDER THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHODOLOGY. FOR INSTANCE, CONTINUING THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, IF THE CUSTOMER RENTED THE ABOVE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT ON DECEMBER 29 AND RETURNED IT AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JANUARY 1, WE WOULD RECOGNIZE INCREMENTAL REVENUE ON JANUARY 1 OF $171.44 (IN ACTUAL DOLLARS, REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNT THE CUSTOMER IS CONTRACTUALLY REQUIRED TO PAY, OR $300 AT THE WEEKLY RATE, AND THE CUMULATIVE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED TO DATE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, OR $128.56, WHICH REPRESENTS FOUR DAYS AT $32.14 PER DAY).  WE RECORD AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCESS OF RECOGNIZABLE REVENUE AS DEFERRED REVENUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. WE HAD DEFERRED REVENUE (ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH TOPIC 842/840 AND TOPIC 606) OF  $54  AND  $56  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS NOTED ABOVE, WE ARE UNSURE OF WHEN THE CUSTOMER WILL RETURN RENTED EQUIPMENT. AS SUCH, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH THE CUSTOMER WILL OWE US UPON RETURN OF THE EQUIPMENT AND CANNOT PROVIDE A MATURITY ANALYSIS OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR EQUIPMENT IS GENERALLY RENTED FOR SHORT PERIODS OF TIME. LESSEES DO NOT PROVIDE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES ON RENTED EQUIPMENT.  WE EXPECT TO DERIVE SIGNIFICANT FUTURE BENEFITS FROM OUR EQUIPMENT FOLLOWING THE END OF THE RENTAL TERM. OUR RENTALS ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM IN NATURE, AND OUR EQUIPMENT IS TYPICALLY RENTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME THAT WE OWN IT. WE ADDITIONALLY RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT WHEN WE DISPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT.  RE-RENT REVENUE.  RE-RENT REVENUE REFLECTS REVENUES FROM EQUIPMENT THAT WE RENT FROM VENDORS AND THEN RENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ACCOUNT FOR SUCH RENTALS AS SUBLEASES. THE ACCOUNTING FOR RE-RENT REVENUE IS THE SAME AS THE ACCOUNTING FOR OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTALS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  \u201cOTHER\u201d  EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF 1) RENTAL PROTECTION PLAN (OR \"RPP\") REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DAMAGE WAIVER CUSTOMERS CAN PURCHASE WHEN THEY RENT OUR EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE, 2) ENVIRONMENTAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RENTAL OF EQUIPMENT, AND 3) CHARGES FOR RENTED EQUIPMENT THAT IS DAMAGED BY OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TYPES OF REVENUE THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 IS DISCUSSED BELOW. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR REVENUES UNDER TOPIC 606 ARE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME RATHER THAN OVER TIME.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DELIVERY AND PICK-UP.  DELIVERY AND PICK-UP REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH RENTING EQUIPMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  \u201cOTHER\u201d  EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONSUMPTION OF FUEL BY OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE EQUIPMENT IS RETURNED BY THE CUSTOMER (AND CONSUMPTION, IF ANY, CAN BE MEASURED).  SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, NEW EQUIPMENT AND CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES  ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY TO, OR PICK-UP BY, THE CUSTOMER AND WHEN COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED.  SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUES  PRIMARILY REPRESENT REVENUES EARNED FROM PROVIDING REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FLEET (INCLUDING PARTS SALES). SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  RECEIVABLES AND CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AS REFLECTED ABOVE, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 (SUCH REVENUE REPRESENTED  78  PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). THE CUSTOMERS THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINING REVENUE THAT IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 ARE GENERALLY THE SAME CUSTOMERS THAT RENT OUR EQUIPMENT. WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AT THE CUSTOMER LEVEL. BECAUSE THE SAME CUSTOMERS GENERATE THE REVENUES THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER BOTH TOPIC 606 AND TOPIC 842, THE DISCUSSIONS BELOW ON CREDIT RISK AND OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ADDRESS RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM REVENUES FROM BOTH TOPIC 606 AND TOPIC 842 (TOPIC 840 FOR 2018).  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO OUR RECEIVABLES IS LIMITED BECAUSE A LARGE NUMBER OF GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE CUSTOMERS MAKES UP OUR CUSTOMER BASE. OUR LARGEST CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  ONE  PERCENT  OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , AND FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FULL YEARS. OUR CUSTOMER WITH THE LARGEST RECEIVABLE BALANCE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  ONE  PERCENT  OF TOTAL RECEIVABLES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK THROUGH CREDIT APPROVALS, CREDIT LIMITS AND OTHER MONITORING PROCEDURES.  OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECT OUR ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF OUR RECEIVABLES THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE. OUR ESTIMATE COULD REQUIRE CHANGE BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY OR IN THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR ALLOWANCES. TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT HAVE CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR OR LESS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE BASED ON THE CRITERIA NECESSARY TO QUALIFY AS A DEDUCTION FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES. WRITE-OFFS OF SUCH RECEIVABLES REQUIRE MANAGEMENT APPROVAL BASED ON SPECIFIED DOLLAR THRESHOLDS. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WE RECOGNIZED TOTAL ADDITIONS, EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, TO OUR ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS OF  $15  AND  $6  , RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY 1) AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE OR 2) AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  WE DO  NO  T HAVE MATERIAL CONTRACT ASSETS, OR IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ASSOCIATED THEREWITH, OR MATERIAL CONTRACT LIABILITIES, ASSOCIATED WITH CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS DO NOT GENERALLY RESULT IN MATERIAL AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCESS OF RECOGNIZABLE REVENUE. WE DID  NO  T RECOGNIZE MATERIAL REVENUE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  OR  2018  THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT LIABILITY BALANCE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIODS.  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  MOST OF OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME, RATHER THAN OVER TIME. ACCORDINGLY, IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE DO NOT GENERALLY RECOGNIZE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF REVENUE FROM PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY SATISFIED) IN PREVIOUS PERIODS, AND THE AMOUNTS OF SUCH REVENUE RECOGNIZED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  NO  T MATERIAL. WE ALSO DO NOT EXPECT TO RECOGNIZE MATERIAL REVENUE IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED (OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED) AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  PAYMENT TERMS  OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION. OUR PAYMENT TERMS VARY BY THE TYPE AND LOCATION OF OUR CUSTOMER AND THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED. THE TIME BETWEEN INVOICING AND WHEN PAYMENT IS DUE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT. OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT GENERALLY INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND CUSTOMER TYPES, WE REQUIRE PAYMENT BEFORE THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES ARE DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS DO NOT GENERALLY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNS, REFUNDS OR WARRANTIES. SEE ABOVE FOR A DISCUSSION OF HOW WE MANAGE CREDIT RISK.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACT COSTS  WE DO NOT RECOGNIZE ANY ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER (FOR EXAMPLE, A SALES COMMISSION) THAT WE EXPECT TO RECOVER. MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT A POINT-IN-TIME OR OVER A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR OR LESS, AND WE USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING A CONTRACT AS AN EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED IF THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF THE ASSET THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED IS ONE YEAR OR LESS.  CONTRACT ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  OUR REVENUES ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606 GENERALLY DO NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS, PRIMARILY FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  \u2022  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS GENERALLY FIXED AND STATED ON OUR CONTRACTS;  \u2022  AS NOTED ABOVE, OUR CONTRACTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND ACCORDINGLY DO NOT GENERALLY REQUIRE ESTIMATES OF THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION;  \u2022  OUR REVENUES DO NOT INCLUDE MATERIAL AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, OR RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNS, REFUNDS OR WARRANTIES; AND  \u2022  MOST OF OUR REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS OF A POINT-IN-TIME AND THE TIMING OF THE SATISFACTION OF THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IS READILY DETERMINABLE. AS NOTED ABOVE, OUR TOPIC 606 REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF DELIVERY TO, OR PICK-UP BY, THE CUSTOMER.  WE MONITOR AND REVIEW OUR ESTIMATED STANDALONE SELLING PRICES ON A REGULAR BASIS.  3.  ACQUISITIONS  BAKERCORP ACQUISITION  IN JULY 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP. BAKERCORP WAS A LEADING MULTINATIONAL PROVIDER OF TANK, PUMP, FILTRATION AND TRENCH SHORING RENTAL SOLUTIONS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF INDUSTRIAL AND CONSTRUCTION APPLICATIONS. BAKERCORP HAD APPROXIMATELY  950  EMPLOYEES, AND ITS OPERATIONS WERE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA, WHERE IT HAD  46  LOCATIONS. BAKERCORP ALSO HAD  11  LOCATIONS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. BAKERCORP HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $295  . THE ACQUISITION.  \u2022  AUGMENTED OUR BUNDLED SOLUTIONS FOR FLUID STORAGE, TRANSFER AND TREATMENT;  \u2022  EXPANDED OUR STRATEGIC ACCOUNT BASE; AND  \u2022  PROVIDED A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE REVENUE AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CROSS-SELLING TO OUR BROADER CUSTOMER BASE.  THE AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION PAID WAS APPROXIMATELY  $720  . THE ACQUISITION AND RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH DRAWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DURING THE ACQUISITION MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.

THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  INCLUDE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN \u201cMERGER RELATED COSTS\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.  SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE, SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF FLEET HAVE BEEN MOVED BETWEEN URI LOCATIONS AND THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS, AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EARNINGS OF BAKERCORP SINCE THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION ON OUR EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE IS PRIMARILY REFLECTED IN THE INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC OF  23.7  PERCENT FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . SUCH INCREASE INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION OF VANDER HOLDING CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\u201cBLUELINE\u201d) DISCUSSED BELOW.  BLUELINE ACQUISITION  IN OCTOBER 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BLUELINE. BLUELINE WAS ONE OF THE  TEN  LARGEST EQUIPMENT RENTAL COMPANIES IN NORTH AMERICA AND SERVED CUSTOMERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL SECTORS WITH A FOCUS ON MID-SIZED AND LOCAL ACCOUNTS. BLUELINE HAD  114  LOCATIONS AND OVER  1,700  EMPLOYEES BASED IN  25  U.S. STATES, CANADA AND PUERTO RICO. BLUELINE HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $786  . THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO.  \u2022  EXPAND OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL CAPACITY IN MANY OF THE LARGEST METROPOLITAN AREAS IN NORTH AMERICA, INCLUDING BOTH U.S. COASTS, THE GULF SOUTH AND ONTARIO;  \u2022  PROVIDE A WELL-DIVERSIFIED CUSTOMER BASE WITH A BALANCED MIX OF COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL ACCOUNTS;  \u2022  ADD MORE MID-SIZED AND LOCAL ACCOUNTS TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE; AND  \u2022  PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE REVENUE AND ENHANCE CUSTOMER SERVICE BY CROSS-SELLING TO OUR BROADER CUSTOMER BASE.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE WERE IMMATERIAL.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ARE CATEGORIZED IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY.  LEVEL 1- INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  LEVEL 2- OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES INCLUDE.  A)  QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS;  B)  QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS;  C)  INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY;  D)  INPUTS THAT ARE DERIVED PRINCIPALLY FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA BY CORRELATION OR OTHER MEANS.  IF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAS A SPECIFIED (CONTRACTUAL) TERM, THE LEVEL 2 INPUT MUST BE OBSERVABLE FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  LEVEL 3- INPUTS TO THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY ARE UNOBSERVABLE (I.E., SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY) AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASURE.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE CARRYING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE IMMEDIATE TO SHORT-TERM MATURITY OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND FINANCE/CAPITAL LEASES (THE CLASSIFICATION OF SUCH LEASES CHANGED UPON ADOPTION OF A NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD, AS EXPLAINED FURTHER IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) APPROXIMATED THEIR BOOK VALUES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

WE HAVE BORROWED THE FULL AVAILABLE AMOUNT UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY IS REQUIRED TO BE REPAID IN QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT EQUAL TO  1.0  PERCENT PER ANNUM, WITH THE BALANCE DUE AT THE MATURITY OF THE FACILITY. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN FACILITY DECREASES SLIGHTLY EACH QUARTER DUE TO THE REQUIREMENT TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE PRINCIPAL OBLIGATION.

AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $922  MILLION OF RECEIVABLES, NET OF APPLICABLE RESERVES AND OTHER DEDUCTIONS, IN THE COLLATERAL POOL.  (3)  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE ABL FACILITY WAS AMENDED, PRIMARILY TO INCREASE THE FACILITY SIZE TO  $3.75  BILLION  , EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE TO FEBRUARY 2024 AND MAKE A PORTION OF THE FACILITY AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING IN BRITISH POUNDS AND EUROS BY CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF URNA IN EUROPE.  (4)  URNA SEPARATELY ISSUED 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES IN AUGUST 2017 AND IN SEPTEMBER 2017. FOLLOWING THE ISSUANCES, WE CONSUMMATED AN EXCHANGE OFFER PURSUANT TO WHICH MOST OF THE 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2017 WERE EXCHANGED FOR ADDITIONAL NOTES FUNGIBLE WITH THE 4  7  /  8  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES ISSUED IN AUGUST 2017.  (5)  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON JANUARY 1, 2019. UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD, THE LEASES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS CAPITAL LEASES THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCE LEASES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE ACCOUNTING UPON THIS CHANGE IN CLASSIFICATION.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(CONTINUED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  (6)  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT PRIMARILY REFLECTS $881  OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY.  LOAN COVENANTS AND COMPLIANCE  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE SENIOR NOTES. ANY FAILURE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OR COVENANT OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONS.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY IS THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE ABL FACILITY, THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WILL ONLY APPLY IN THE FUTURE IF SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW  10  PERCENT  OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND BORROWING BASE COLLATERAL IN EXCESS OF THE ABL FACILITY SIZE MAY BE INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY EXCEEDED THE REQUIRED THRESHOLD AND, AS A RESULT, THIS FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT WAS INAPPLICABLE. UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL TESTS RELATING TO: (I) THE DEFAULT RATIO, (II) THE DELINQUENCY RATIO, (III) THE DILUTION RATIO AND (IV) DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING. THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, TO THE EXTENT THE RATIO IS APPLICABLE UNDER THE ABL FACILITY.  8.  LEASES  ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842, \u201cLEASES\u201d  IN MARCH 2016, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE (\"TOPIC 842\") TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY REQUIRING (1) RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND (2) DISCLOSURE OF KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME CHANGES TO THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WERE MADE TO ALIGN BOTH OF THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE WITH CERTAIN CHANGES MADE TO THE LESSEE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND (2) KEY ASPECTS OF THE LESSOR ACCOUNTING MODEL WITH REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 AT THE REQUIRED ADOPTION DATE OF JANUARY 1, 2019, USING THE TRANSITION METHOD THAT ALLOWED US TO INITIALLY APPLY TOPIC 842 AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 AND RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. WE USED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE THAT ALLOWED US TO NOT REASSESS: (1) WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES, (2) LEASE CLASSIFICATION FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES AND (3) INITIAL DIRECT COSTS FOR ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING LEASES. WE ADDITIONALLY USED, FOR OUR REAL ESTATE OPERATING LEASES, THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT THAT ALLOWS LESSEES TO TREAT THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS OF LEASES AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT. WE DID NOT RECOGNIZE A MATERIAL ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION METHOD WE USED TO ADOPT TOPIC 842, TOPIC 842 WAS NOT APPLIED TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION AND THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, MOST OF OUR EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUES, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR  85  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 FOLLOWING ADOPTION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. SEE NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING (SUCH DISCUSSION INCLUDES LESSOR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER TOPIC 842).  THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (AS NOTED ABOVE, ALTHOUGH A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 842 FOLLOWING ADOPTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE ACCOUNTING UPON ADOPTION) OR OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT.  LEASE ACCOUNTING  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OUR MATERIAL LEASE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY FOR REAL ESTATE OR VEHICLES, AND THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER SUCH CONTRACTS CONTAIN LEASES GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OR JUDGMENTS. WE LEASE REAL ESTATE AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES. WE LEASE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BRANCH LOCATIONS, AND ALSO LEASE OTHER PREMISES USED FOR PURPOSES SUCH AS DISTRICT AND REGIONAL OFFICES AND SERVICE CENTERS. OUR FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT (PRIMARILY VEHICLES) AND BUILDING LEASES.  OPERATING LEASES RESULT IN THE RECOGNITION OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. ROU ASSETS REPRESENT OUR RIGHT TO USE THE LEASED ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNITED RENTALS, INC.  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u2014(CONTINUED)  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA, UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)  OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE TO DETERMINE THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS ALSO INCLUDE ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AND EXCLUDE LEASE INCENTIVES. OUR LEASE TERMS MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE THAT WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE. THE AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH OPTIONS REFLECTED IN THE \u201cMATURITY OF LEASE LIABILITIES\u201d TABLE BELOW IS NOT MATERIAL. MOST REAL ESTATE LEASES INCLUDE ONE OR MORE OPTIONS TO RENEW, WITH RENEWAL TERMS THAT CAN EXTEND THE LEASE TERM FROM  1  TO  5  YEARS OR MORE. LEASE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET. LEASE EXPENSE ON SUCH LEASES IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE PRIMARY LEASES WE ENTER INTO WITH INITIAL TERMS OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE FOR EQUIPMENT THAT WE RENT FROM VENDORS AND THEN RENT TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE GENERATE SUBLEASE REVENUE FROM SUCH LEASES THAT WE REFER TO AS \"RE-RENT REVENUE\" AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. APART FROM THE RE-RENT REVENUE DISCUSSED IN NOTE  2  , WE DO NOT GENERATE MATERIAL SUBLEASE INCOME.  WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, AND, FOR OUR REAL ESTATE OPERATING LEASES, WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT. OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY MATERIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS.  THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT FINANCIAL INFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEASES. THIS INFORMATION IS ONLY PRESENTED AS OF, AND FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED,  MARCH 31, 2019  BECAUSE, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE ADOPTED TOPIC 842 USING A TRANSITION METHOD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION.

OTHER THAN THE GUARANTEE BY CERTAIN CANADIAN SUBSIDIARIES OF URNA'S INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, NONE OF URNA\u2019S INDEBTEDNESS IS GUARANTEED BY URNA'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OR THE SPV (TOGETHER, THE \u201cNON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES\u201d). THE RECEIVABLE ASSETS OWNED BY THE SPV HAVE BEEN SOLD OR CONTRIBUTED BY URNA TO THE SPV AND ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS OF URNA OR PARENT\u2019S OTHER SUBSIDIARIES. THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES ARE ALL  100 PERCENT  -OWNED AND THE GUARANTEES ARE MADE ON A JOINT AND SEVERAL BASIS. THE GUARANTEES ARE NOT FULL AND UNCONDITIONAL BECAUSE A GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY CAN BE AUTOMATICALLY RELEASED AND RELIEVED OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING SALE OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY, THE SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY'S ASSETS, THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LEGAL DEFEASANCE OR COVENANT DEFEASANCE UNDER THE APPLICABLE INDENTURE BEING MET, DESIGNATING THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARY AS AN UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY FOR PURPOSES OF THE APPLICABLE COVENANTS OR, OTHER THAN WITH RESPECT TO THE GUARANTEES OF THE 5  3  /  4  PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024, THE NOTES BEING RATED INVESTMENT GRADE BY BOTH STANDARD & POOR\u2019S RATINGS SERVICES AND MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE, INC., OR, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, ANOTHER RATING AGENCY SELECTED BY URNA.

BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING OF RULE 3-10 OF REGULATION S-X (\"RULE 3-10\"), WE BELIEVE THAT THE GUARANTEES OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES COMPLY WITH THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN RULE 3-10 AND THEREFORE CONTINUE TO UTILIZE RULE 3-10 TO PRESENT CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR HOLDINGS, URNA, THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES. SEPARATE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES HAVE NOT BEEN PRESENTED BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT SUCH INFORMATION WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN JULY 2018, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP, WHICH ALLOWED FOR OUR ENTRY INTO SELECT EUROPEAN MARKETS. ALTHOUGH THE EQUIPMENT RENTAL INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND DIVERSE, WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE, AS A LARGER COMPANY, WE HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE RESOURCES AND CERTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. THESE INCLUDE A FLEET OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT WITH A TOTAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT COST (\u201cOEC\u201d) OF  $14.1 BILLION  , AND A NATIONAL BRANCH NETWORK THAT OPERATES IN 49 U.S. STATES AND EVERY CANADIAN PROVINCE, AND SERVES 99 OF THE LARGEST 100 METROPOLITAN AREAS IN THE U.S. THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED ABOVE ADDED  11  EUROPEAN LOCATIONS IN FRANCE, GERMANY, THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS TO OUR BRANCH NETWORK. OUR SIZE ALSO GIVES US GREATER PURCHASING POWER, THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH A BROADER RANGE OF EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH EQUIPMENT THAT IS MORE CONSISTENTLY WELL-MAINTAINED AND THEREFORE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND RELIABLE, AND THE ABILITY TO ENHANCE THE EARNING POTENTIAL OF OUR ASSETS BY TRANSFERRING EQUIPMENT AMONG BRANCHES TO SATISFY CUSTOMER NEEDS.  WE OFFER APPROXIMATELY  4,000  CLASSES OF EQUIPMENT FOR RENT TO A DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE THAT INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS, UTILITIES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOMEOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: EQUIPMENT RENTALS, SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES SALES AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUES. EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENTED  85  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE EXECUTED A STRATEGY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR CORE EQUIPMENT RENTAL BUSINESS THROUGH REVENUE GROWTH, MARGIN EXPANSION AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES. IN PARTICULAR, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION, CUSTOMER SERVICE DIFFERENTIATION, RATE MANAGEMENT, FLEET MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.  IN 2019, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR DISCIPLINED FOCUS ON INCREASING OUR PROFITABILITY AND RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL. IN PARTICULAR, OUR STRATEGY CALLS FOR.  \u2022  A CONSISTENTLY SUPERIOR STANDARD OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS  , OFTEN PROVIDED THROUGH A SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT;  \u2022  THE FURTHER OPTIMIZATION OF OUR CUSTOMER MIX AND FLEET MIX,  WITH A DUAL OBJECTIVE: TO ENHANCE OUR PERFORMANCE IN SERVING OUR CURRENT CUSTOMER BASE, AND TO FOCUS ON THE ACCOUNTS AND CUSTOMER TYPES THAT ARE BEST SUITED TO OUR STRATEGY FOR PROFITABLE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THESE EFFORTS WILL LEAD TO EVEN BETTER SERVICE OF OUR TARGET ACCOUNTS, PRIMARILY LARGE CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS SELECT LOCAL CONTRACTORS. OUR FLEET TEAM'S ANALYSES ARE ALIGNED WITH THESE OBJECTIVES TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN EQUIPMENT CATEGORIES AND DEFINE ACTION PLANS THAT CAN GENERATE IMPROVED RETURNS;  \u2022  A CONTINUED FOCUS ON \u201cLEAN\u201d MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING KAIZEN PROCESSES FOCUSED ON CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT  . WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT LEAN KAIZEN PROCESSES ACROSS OUR BRANCH NETWORK, WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF: REDUCING THE CYCLE TIME ASSOCIATED WITH RENTING OUR EQUIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS; IMPROVING INVOICE ACCURACY AND SERVICE QUALITY; REDUCING THE ELAPSED TIME FOR EQUIPMENT PICKUP AND DELIVERY; AND IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY OF OUR REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OPERATIONS;  \u2022  A CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROJECT XL,  WHICH IS A SET OF EIGHT SPECIFIC WORK STREAMS FOCUSED ON DRIVING PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES AND GENERATING INCREMENTAL PROFITABILITY THROUGH COST SAVINGS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS;  \u2022  THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS FOOTPRINT, AS WELL AS OUR TOOLS OFFERING, AND THE CROSS-SELLING OF THESE SERVICES THROUGHOUT OUR NETWORK,  AS EXHIBITED BY OUR ACQUISITION OF BAKERCORP DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE EXPANSION OF OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, AS WELL AS OUR TOOLS OFFERING, WILL FURTHER POSITION UNITED RENTALS AS A SINGLE SOURCE PROVIDER OF TOTAL JOBSITE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR EXTENSIVE PRODUCT AND SERVICE RESOURCES AND TECHNOLOGY OFFERINGS; AND  \u2022  THE PURSUIT OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR CORE EQUIPMENT RENTAL BUSINESS  , AS EXHIBITED BY OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITIONS OF NES RENTALS HOLDINGS II, INC.

SEE NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE. RENTAL RATE CHANGES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR VARIANCE IN AVERAGE CONTRACT RATES, WEIGHTED BY THE PRIOR PERIOD REVENUE MIX. TIME UTILIZATION IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE AMOUNT OF TIME AN ASSET IS ON RENT BY THE AMOUNT OF TIME THE ASSET HAS BEEN OWNED DURING THE YEAR. MIX INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER, FLEET, GEOGRAPHIC AND SEGMENT MIX.  (3)  REFLECTS THE COMBINED IMPACT OF CHANGES IN THE OTHER TYPES OF EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE (SEE NOTE  2  FOR FURTHER DETAIL), EXCLUDING OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (4)  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITIONS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE IN JULY 2018 AND OCTOBER 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRO FORMA INFORMATION INCLUDES THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE.  EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCLUDE OUR REVENUES FROM RENTING EQUIPMENT, AS WELL AS REVENUE RELATED TO THE FEES WE CHARGE CUSTOMERS: FOR EQUIPMENT DELIVERY AND PICK-UP; TO PROTECT THE CUSTOMER AGAINST LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE TO OUR EQUIPMENT WHILE ON RENT; FOR FUEL; AND FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS. SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT REPRESENT OUR REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF USED RENTAL EQUIPMENT. SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT REPRESENT OUR REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF NEW EQUIPMENT. CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES SALES REPRESENT OUR SALES OF SUPPLIES UTILIZED BY CONTRACTORS, WHICH INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION CONSUMABLES, TOOLS, SMALL EQUIPMENT AND SAFETY SUPPLIES. SERVICES AND OTHER REVENUES PRIMARILY REPRESENT OUR REVENUES EARNED FROM PROVIDING REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES ON OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 FLEET (INCLUDING PARTS SALES). SEE NOTE  2  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , TOTAL REVENUES OF  $2.117 BILLION  INCREASED  22.1  PERCENT COMPARED WITH  2018  . EQUIPMENT RENTALS AND SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT ARE OUR LARGEST REVENUE TYPES (TOGETHER, THEY ACCOUNTED FOR  94  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ). EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  23.0  PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  23.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS EXPLAINED FURTHER ABOVE, AND IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF KEY DECISIONS MADE DAILY BY OUR MANAGERS REGARDING RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE. FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS A MEASURE OF THE DECISIONS MADE TO OPTIMIZE THE BALANCE OF RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX TO PRODUCE REVENUE AND DRIVE EFFICIENT GROWTH. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX. SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT INCREASED  6.1  PERCENT PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME, WHICH INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION, DRIVEN BY A LARGER FLEET SIZE IN A STRONG USED EQUIPMENT MARKET.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  4  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE GENERAL RENTALS AND TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS. THE GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE RENTAL OF CONSTRUCTION, AERIAL, INDUSTRIAL AND HOMEOWNER EQUIPMENT AND RELATED SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES. THE GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT\u2019S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES, MANUFACTURERS, UTILITIES, MUNICIPALITIES, HOMEOWNERS AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF I) THE TRENCH SAFETY REGION, WHICH RENTS TRENCH SAFETY EQUIPMENT SUCH AS TRENCH SHIELDS, ALUMINUM HYDRAULIC SHORING SYSTEMS, SLIDE RAILS, CROSSING PLATES, CONSTRUCTION LASERS AND LINE TESTING EQUIPMENT FOR UNDERGROUND WORK, II) THE POWER AND HVAC REGION, WHICH RENTS POWER AND HVAC EQUIPMENT SUCH AS PORTABLE DIESEL GENERATORS, ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION EQUIPMENT, AND TEMPERATURE CONTROL EQUIPMENT INCLUDING HEATING AND COOLING EQUIPMENT, AND III) THE FLUID SOLUTIONS AND IV) FLUID SOLUTIONS EUROPE REGIONS, BOTH OF WHICH RENT EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY USED FOR FLUID CONTAINMENT, TRANSFER AND TREATMENT. THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT\u2019S CUSTOMERS INCLUDE CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES INVOLVED IN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS, MUNICIPALITIES AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES. THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT OPERATES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND IN CANADA AND EUROPE.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  4  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE AGGREGATE OUR  11  GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS\u2014CAROLINAS, GULF SOUTH, INDUSTRIAL (WHICH SERVES THE GEOGRAPHIC GULF REGION AND HAS A STRONG INDUSTRIAL PRESENCE), MID-ATLANTIC, MID CENTRAL, MIDWEST, NORTHEAST, PACIFIC WEST, SOUTH, SOUTHEAST AND WESTERN CANADA\u2014INTO OUR GENERAL RENTALS REPORTING SEGMENT. HISTORICALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN VARIANCES IN THE LEVELS OF EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS ACHIEVED BY THESE REGIONS. FOR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  THREE  OF OUR GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS HAD AN EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN THAT VARIED BY BETWEEN 10 PERCENT AND  15  PERCENT FROM THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS OF THE AGGREGATED GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE RENTAL INDUSTRY IS CYCLICAL, AND THERE HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN REGIONS WITH EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS THAT VARIED BY GREATER THAN 10 PERCENT FROM THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGINS OF THE AGGREGATED GENERAL RENTALS' REGIONS, THOUGH THE SPECIFIC REGIONS WITH MARGIN VARIANCES OF OVER 10 PERCENT HAVE FLUCTUATED. WE EXPECT MARGIN CONVERGENCE GOING FORWARD GIVEN THE CYCLICAL NATURE OF THE RENTAL INDUSTRY, AND MONITOR THE MARGIN VARIANCES AND CONFIRM THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE CONVERGENCE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  WE SIMILARLY MONITOR THE MARGIN VARIANCES FOR THE REGIONS IN THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT. THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT INCLUDES THE LOCATIONS ACQUIRED IN THE JULY 2018 BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS SUCH, THERE IS NOT A LONG HISTORY OF THE ACQUIRED LOCATIONS' RENTAL MARGINS INCLUDED IN THE TRENCH, POWER AND PUMP SEGMENT. WHEN MONITORING FOR MARGIN CONVERGENCE, WE INCLUDE PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS. WE MONITOR THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT MARGIN VARIANCES AND CONFIRM THE EXPECTATION OF FUTURE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONVERGENCE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. THE HISTORIC, PRE-ACQUISITION MARGINS FOR THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE MARGINS ACHIEVED AT THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE SEGMENT. WE EXPECT THAT THE MARGINS AT THE ACQUIRED LOCATIONS WILL INCREASE AS WE REALIZE SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION, AS A RESULT OF WHICH, WE EXPECT FUTURE MARGIN CONVERGENCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE REGIONS THAT ARE AGGREGATED INTO OUR SEGMENTS HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS, AS EACH REGION IS CAPITAL INTENSIVE, OFFERS SIMILAR PRODUCTS TO SIMILAR CUSTOMERS, USES SIMILAR METHODS TO DISTRIBUTE ITS PRODUCTS, AND IS SUBJECT TO SIMILAR COMPETITIVE RISKS. THE AGGREGATION OF OUR REGIONS ALSO REFLECTS THE MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE THAT WE USE FOR MAKING OPERATING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE AGGREGATING THESE REGIONS INTO OUR REPORTING SEGMENTS FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES IS APPROPRIATE, TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT MARGIN VARIANCES THAT DO NOT CONVERGE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DISAGGREGATE THE REGIONS INTO SEPARATE REPORTING SEGMENTS. ANY SUCH DISAGGREGATION WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THESE SEGMENTS ALIGN OUR EXTERNAL SEGMENT REPORTING WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES AND ALLOCATES RESOURCES. WE EVALUATE SEGMENT PERFORMANCE BASED ON SEGMENT EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS PROFIT. OUR REVENUES, OPERATING RESULTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER REFLECTING THE SEASONAL RENTAL PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WITH RENTAL ACTIVITY TENDING TO BE LOWER IN THE WINTER.  REVENUES BY SEGMENT WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT. AS EXPLAINED FURTHER ABOVE (SEE \"FINANCIAL OVERVIEW-REVENUES\"), FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF KEY DECISIONS MADE DAILY BY OUR MANAGERS REGARDING RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX. EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENTED  85  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , GENERAL RENTALS EQUIPMENT RENTALS  INCREASED  $222  , OR  18.5  PERCENT, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A  19.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC, WHICH INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  5.6  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  4.8  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  1.2  PERCENT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENTED  83  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE GENERAL RENTALS SEGMENT.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS EQUIPMENT RENTALS  INCREASED  $114  , OR  44.2  PERCENT, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  13.8  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  13.4  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC. THE PRO FORMA INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF COLD STARTS AND ACQUISITIONS OTHER THAN BAKERCORP. ADDITIONALLY, PERFORMANCE IN OUR TRENCH SAFETY AND POWER AND HVAC REGIONS IMPROVED. THE TRENCH SAFETY REGION EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM INFRASTRUCTURE, UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC AND GAS DISTRIBUTION CUSTOMERS.  THE POWER AND HVAC REGION EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN REVENUE FROM NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , EQUIPMENT RENTALS REPRESENTED  91  PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS SEGMENT.  SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT  .

THE INCREASE IN EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS PROFIT PRIMARILY REFLECTS INCREASED EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE ON A LARGER FLEET. YEAR-OVER-YEAR, TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS EQUIPMENT RENTALS INCREASED  44.2  PERCENT AND AVERAGE OEC INCREASED  59.6  PERCENT PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS. THE DECREASE IN THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS, AND AN INCREASE IN LOWER-MARGIN RE-RENT REVENUES. THE HISTORIC, PRE-ACQUISITION MARGINS FOR THE ACQUIRED BAKERCORP LOCATIONS ARE LOWER THAN THE MARGINS ACHIEVED AT THE OTHER LOCATIONS IN THE SEGMENT, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT THE MARGINS WILL IMPROVE OVER TIME AS WE REALIZE SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SEE NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL) THAT REQUIRES THAT WE RECOGNIZE DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEASE REVENUES AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE WHICH DECREASED THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019.  GROSS MARGIN  . GROSS MARGINS BY REVENUE CLASSIFICATION WERE AS FOLLOWS.

EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN  DECREASED  70  BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR. IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SEE NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAIL) THAT REQUIRES THAT WE RECOGNIZE DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH LEASE REVENUES AS A REDUCTION TO EQUIPMENT RENTALS REVENUE WHICH DECREASED THE EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN IN 2019, WITH SUCH DECREASE ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE TOTAL EQUIPMENT RENTALS GROSS MARGIN DECREASE. THE GROSS MARGIN DECREASE ALSO REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BAKERCORP, AND COLD STARTS, AND AN INCREASE IN LOWER-MARGIN RE-RENT REVENUES IN OUR TRENCH, POWER AND FLUID SOLUTIONS REPORTABLE SEGMENT. ON A PRO FORMA BASIS INCLUDING THE STANDALONE, PRE-ACQUISITION RESULTS OF BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE, EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.2  PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO A  5.7  PERCENT INCREASE IN AVERAGE OEC AND A FLEET PRODUCTIVITY  INCREASE  OF  2.2  PERCENT. AS EXPLAINED FURTHER ABOVE (SEE \"FINANCIAL OVERVIEW-REVENUES\"), FLEET PRODUCTIVITY IS A COMPREHENSIVE MEASURE OF THE COMBINED IMPACT OF KEY DECISIONS MADE DAILY BY OUR MANAGERS REGARDING RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX ON THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OWNED EQUIPMENT RENTAL REVENUE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE POSITIVE FLEET PRODUCTIVITY REFLECTS IMPROVING DEMAND IN MANY OF OUR CORE MARKETS AS WELL AS APPROPRIATE DECISIONS MADE TO BALANCE RENTAL RATES, TIME UTILIZATION AND MIX. GROSS MARGIN FROM SALES OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT  DECREASED  600  BASIS POINTS FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGIN SALES OF FLEET ACQUIRED IN THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION. THE GROSS MARGIN FLUCTUATIONS FROM SALES OF NEW EQUIPMENT, CONTRACTOR SUPPLIES SALES AND SERVICE AND OTHER REVENUES GENERALLY REFLECT NORMAL VARIABILITY, AND SUCH MARGINS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON TOTAL GROSS MARGIN (GROSS PROFIT FOR THESE REVENUE TYPES REPRESENTED  5  PERCENT OF TOTAL GROSS PROFIT FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  ).

WE HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE. MERGER RELATED COSTS ONLY INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAJOR ACQUISITIONS THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR OPERATIONS. THE HISTORIC ACQUISITIONS THAT HAVE INCLUDED MERGER RELATED COSTS ARE RSC, WHICH HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, AND NATIONAL PUMP, WHICH HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF OVER $200 PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. NES HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $369  AND NEFF HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $413  . AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BAKERCORP HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $295  AND BLUELINE HAD ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY  $786.  THE  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  PRIMARILY REFLECT SEVERANCE AND BRANCH CLOSURE CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE CLOSING OF THE BAKERCORP ACQUISITION DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ALSO INCLUDES ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE BLUELINE ACQUISITION, WHICH IS ALSO DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  . FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE  5  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NON-RENTAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  INCLUDES I) THE AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND II) DEPRECIATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH EQUIPMENT THAT IS NOT OFFERED FOR RENT (SUCH AS COMPUTERS AND OFFICE EQUIPMENT) AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. OUR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONSIST OF CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, NON-COMPETE AGREEMENTS AND TRADE NAMES AND ASSOCIATED TRADEMARKS. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NON-RENTAL DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  INCREASED YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE DEBT INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE DEBT USED TO FINANCE THE BAKERCORP AND BLUELINE ACQUISITIONS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  3  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE  2019  AND  2018  EFFECTIVE TAX RATES  DID NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21 PERCENT.  BALANCE SHEET.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE  8  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT, IN 2019, WE ADOPTED AN UPDATED LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD THAT RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD USING A TRANSITION METHOD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE APPLICATION TO PERIODS PRIOR TO ADOPTION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY USING INTERNAL CASH MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO (I) THE POLICIES AND COOPERATION OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WE UTILIZE TO MAINTAIN AND PROVIDE CASH MANAGEMENT SERVICES, (II) THE TERMS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF THE AGREEMENTS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY AND (III) THE STATUTES, REGULATIONS AND PRACTICES OF EACH OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SEE \"FINANCIAL OVERVIEW\" ABOVE FOR A SUMMARY OF RECENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE ACTIONS TAKEN TO IMPROVE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY.  SINCE 2012, WE HAVE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF $2.45 BILLION OF HOLDINGS' COMMON STOCK UNDER FOUR COMPLETED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, IN APRIL 2018, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED A NEW $1.25 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH COMMENCED IN JULY 2018. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAVE REPURCHASED $630  OF HOLDINGS' COMMON STOCK UNDER THE $1.25 BILLION SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH WE INTEND TO COMPLETE IN 2019.  OUR PRINCIPAL EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH ARE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FROM THE SALE OF RENTAL EQUIPMENT, AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR ABL FACILITY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $52  . CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  CONSIST OF DIRECT OBLIGATIONS OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS RATED A OR BETTER. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

WE PLAN TO FUND SUCH CASH REQUIREMENTS FROM OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF CASH. IN ADDITION, WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH THE SECURITIZATION OF SOME OF OUR REAL ESTATE, THE USE OF ADDITIONAL OPERATING LEASES OR OTHER FINANCING SOURCES AS MARKET CONDITIONS PERMIT.  TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS, WE RELY ON CREDIT RATING AGENCIES TO ASSIGN RATINGS TO OUR SECURITIES AS AN INDICATOR OF CREDIT QUALITY. LOWER CREDIT RATINGS GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER BORROWING COSTS AND REDUCED ACCESS TO DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS. CREDIT RATINGS ALSO AFFECT THE COSTS OF DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. AS A RESULT, NEGATIVE CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR COSTS OF FUNDING. OUR CREDIT RATINGS AS OF  APRIL 15, 2019  WERE AS FOLLOWS.  CORPORATE RATING  OUTLOOK  MOODY\u2019S  BA2  STABLE  STANDARD & POOR\u2019S  BB  STABLE  A SECURITY RATING IS NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO BUY, SELL OR HOLD SECURITIES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY RATING WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR A GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME OR THAT ANY RATING WILL NOT BE REVISED OR WITHDRAWN BY A RATING AGENCY IN THE FUTURE.  LOAN COVENANTS AND COMPLIANCE.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE ABL, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE SENIOR NOTES. ANY FAILURE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OR COVENANT OF THESE AGREEMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND OPERATIONS.  THE ONLY FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS UNDER THE ABL FACILITY IS THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO. SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITED EXCEPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE ABL FACILITY, THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY WILL ONLY APPLY IN THE FUTURE IF SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY FALLS BELOW  10 PERCENT  OF THE MAXIMUM REVOLVER AMOUNT UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. WHEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND BORROWING BASE COLLATERAL IN EXCESS OF THE ABL FACILITY SIZE MAY BE INCLUDED WHEN CALCULATING SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , SPECIFIED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE ABL FACILITY EXCEEDED THE REQUIRED THRESHOLD AND, AS A RESULT, THIS FINANCIAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT WAS INAPPLICABLE. UNDER OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN FINANCIAL TESTS RELATING TO: (I) THE DEFAULT RATIO, (II) THE DELINQUENCY RATIO, (III) THE DILUTION RATIO AND (IV) DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING. THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION FACILITY ALSO REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE ABL FACILITY, TO THE EXTENT THE RATIO IS APPLICABLE UNDER THE ABL FACILITY.  URNA\u2019S PAYMENT CAPACITY IS RESTRICTED UNDER THE COVENANTS IN THE ABL AND TERM LOAN FACILITIES AND THE INDENTURES GOVERNING ITS OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS. ALTHOUGH THIS RESTRICTED CAPACITY LIMITS OUR ABILITY TO MOVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO HOLDINGS, BECAUSE OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS, WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON HOLDINGS\u2019 ABILITY TO MEET ITS CASH OBLIGATIONS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR TOTAL DEBT, NET OF CASH, WAS $1,126.0 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $924.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE INCREASE IN DEBT IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE ARC ACQUISITION.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, TOTAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  $700 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\u201cTHE FACILITY\u201d)  WERE $414 MILLION. THE FACILITY PERMITS US TO ISSUE LETTERS OF CREDIT UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $40.0 MILLION.  ANY OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT REDUCE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER OUR FACILITY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NOT ISSUED ANY LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY, RESULTING IN UNDRAWN AVAILABILITY UNDER THE FACILITY OF $286 MILLION.  THE FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RESTRICTIONS ON THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT AND THE GRANTING OF LIENS, AS WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE OF AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND A LEVERAGE RATIO.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO OF 3.50 (BASED ON THE RATIO OF EBITDA, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, TO INTEREST EXPENSE) AND MAY NOT EXCEED A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 3.50 (BASED ON THE RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA) THROUGHOUT THE TERM OF THE FACILITY.  IN ADDITION, THE FACILITY CONTAINS OTHER TERMS AND CONDITIONS SUCH AS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT. THE CONDITIONS AND COVENANTS RELATED TO THE SENIOR NOTES ARE LESS RESTRICTIVE THAN THOSE OF OUR FACILITY. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AND EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS (INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES) THROUGH NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, CASH ON HAND AND THE FACILITY.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT REQUIRED DEBT REPAYMENTS UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2021 WHEN THE FACILITY EXPIRES.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $45.9 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, AS COMPARED TO $62.6 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2018. THE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS A USE OF $78.4 MILLION IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO $46.2 MILLION IN 2018, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $219.5 MILLION AND $59.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES $158.4 MILLION FOR THE ARC ACQUISITION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $61.1 MILLION AND $59.5 MILLION IN 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $184.9 MILLION OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, AND WERE A USE OF $15.5 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THIS INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AMOUNTS BORROWED FROM OUR FACILITY TO FUND THE ARC ACQUISITION. WE RETURNED $23.9 MILLION TO STOCKHOLDERS FROM STOCK REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS IN 2019 COMPARED TO $41.3 MILLION IN 2018.  22  FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE CURRENT PORTION OF DEBT INCLUDED $9.  0  MILLION RELATED TO TH  E EURO TERM LOAN. THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT SCHEDULED DEBT MATURITY WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL 2021, WHEN THE FACILITY MATURES.  CERTAIN SALES AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES, DATA PROCESSING EQUIPMENT AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE LEASED UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS, AND APPLY JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES.  WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS TO ENSURE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. S  IGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF OUR FORM 10-K, RELATE  TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842, LEASES, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 1 AND 4 TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.6 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.7 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED, CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE NOTED.  OVERVIEW  ARMOUR IS A MARYLAND CORPORATION FORMED TO INVEST IN AND MANAGE A LEVERAGED PORTFOLIO OF MBS AND MORTGAGE LOANS. WE INVEST IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY A U.S. GSE, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, OR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SUCH AS GINNIE MAE (COLLECTIVELY, AGENCY SECURITIES). THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED RATE HOME LOANS, THE REMAINING ARE EITHER BACKED BY HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE OR ADJUSTABLE RATE HOME LOANS. OTHER SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES IN WHICH WE INVEST, FOR WHICH THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS NOT GUARANTEED BY A GSE OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY MAY BENEFIT FROM CREDIT ENHANCEMENT DERIVED FROM STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, OVER COLLATERALIZATION OR INSURANCE (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cCREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\u201d). WE ALSO INVEST IN INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES, WHICH ARE THE INTEREST PORTION OF AGENCY SECURITIES, THAT IS SEPARATED AND SOLD INDIVIDUALLY FROM THE PRINCIPAL PORTION OF THE SAME PAYMENT (\"INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES\"). (\"AGENCY SECURITIES\" TOGETHER WITH \u201cCREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\u201d AND \"INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES\", COLLECTIVELY, \"MBS\"). FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGISTERED WITH THE SEC (SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE SEEK TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT PRODUCES CURRENT YIELD AND SUPERIOR RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM. OUR FOCUS ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FINANCE SUPPORTS HOME OWNERSHIP FOR A BROAD AND DIVERSE SPECTRUM OF AMERICANS BY BRINGING PRIVATE CAPITAL INTO THE MORTGAGE MARKETS.  WE EARN RETURNS ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND OUR COSTS, INCLUDING THE INTEREST COST OF THE FUNDS WE BORROW, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO OUR HEDGES. WE IDENTIFY AND ACQUIRE MBS, FINANCE OUR ACQUISITIONS WITH BORROWINGS UNDER A SERIES OF SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT THE MOST COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE TO US AND THEN COST-EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR INTEREST RATE AND OTHER RISKS BASED ON OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES AND OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S VIEW OF THE MARKET. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS APPROACH REQUIRES US TO ADDRESS INTEREST RATE RISK, MAINTAIN ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND EFFECTIVELY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET WILL UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMING YEARS AS THE ROLE OF GSES, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, IS DIMINISHED, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CREATE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. WE EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION OF CONTINUING TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE AND AVOIDING REGULATION AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT.  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE. WE WILL GENERALLY NOT BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND AS LONG AS WE SATISFY THE ONGOING REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE INCLUDING MEETING CERTAIN ASSET, INCOME AND STOCK OWNERSHIP TESTS.  FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR SUCH ASSETS. RECENT EVENTS, SUCH AS THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY PRODUCE RESULTS OUTSIDE OF TYPICAL OPERATING VARIANCES. OUR NET INTEREST INCOME VARIES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, BORROWING COSTS AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, THE BEHAVIOR OF WHICH INVOLVES VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE LOOK TO INVEST ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS, FROM AGENCY SECURITIES, FOR WHICH THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY A GSE, TO CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, NON-PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND UNRATED EQUITY TRANCHES OF  37  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  CMBS. AS SUCH, WE EXPECT OUR INVESTMENTS TO BE SUBJECT TO RISKS ARISING FROM DELINQUENCIES AND FORECLOSURES, THEREBY EXPOSING OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGING CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE ACM\u2019S IN-DEPTH INVESTMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET, PRUDENT ASSET SELECTION AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY ENABLE US TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT LOSSES, OUR MARKET VALUE LOSSES AND FINANCING COSTS. PREPAYMENT RATES, AS REFLECTED BY THE RATE OF PRINCIPAL PAY DOWNS AND INTEREST RATES VARY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT, CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS, NONE OF WHICH CAN BE PREDICTED WITH ANY CERTAINTY. IN GENERAL, AS PREPAYMENT RATES ON OUR ASSETS THAT ARE PURCHASED AT A PREMIUM INCREASE, RELATED PURCHASE PREMIUM AMORTIZATION INCREASES, THEREBY REDUCING THE NET YIELD ON SUCH ASSETS. BECAUSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISKS AND PREPAYMENT RISKS EFFECTIVELY WHILE MAINTAINING OUR STATUS AS A REIT.  FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON OUR ASSETS DO NOT COINCIDE WITH INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON OUR BORROWINGS, SUCH ASSETS WILL TEND TO REPRICE MORE SLOWLY THAN THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES. CONSEQUENTLY, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PARTICULARLY SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. WITH THE MATURITIES OF OUR ASSETS GENERALLY OF A LONGER TERM THAN THOSE OF OUR LIABILITIES, INTEREST RATE INCREASES WILL TEND TO DECREASE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS (AND THEREFORE OUR BOOK VALUE). SUCH RATE INCREASES COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN OPERATING LOSSES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  PREPAYMENTS ON MBS AND THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS, POLICY DECISIONS BY REGULATORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD MBS ACQUIRED AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO PAR, OR FACE VALUE, CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT RATES MAY IMPACT OUR ANTICIPATED YIELD. IN PERIODS OF DECLINING INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS ON OUR MBS WILL LIKELY INCREASE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REINVEST THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH PREPAYMENTS AT COMPARABLE YIELDS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME MAY DECLINE. THE CLIMATE OF GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN THE MORTGAGE MARKETS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PREPAYMENTS.  WHILE WE USE STRATEGIES TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE SOME OF OUR INTEREST RATE RISK, WE DO NOT HEDGE ALL OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES, AS THERE ARE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INSULATE OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO FROM ALL POTENTIAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEEK ATTRACTIVE NET SPREADS ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ALSO, SINCE WE HAVE NOT ELECTED TO USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING, EARNINGS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP WILL FLUCTUATE EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE OUR DERIVATIVES ARE OPERATING AS INTENDED. AS A RESULT OF THIS MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE FAR MORE THAN IF WE WERE TO DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. COMPARISONS WITH COMPANIES THAT USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OR PART OF THEIR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES MAY NOT BE MEANINGFUL. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED UNDER THE SECTION CAPTIONED \u201cDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\u201d BELOW, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN ADDITION TO THE USE OF DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE; THESE FACTORS INCLUDE  \u2022  OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE;  \u2022  OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING AND BORROWING CAPACITY;  \u2022  THE REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE; AND  \u2022  THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXCLUSION UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS.  OUR MANAGER  SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  38  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  MARKET AND INTEREST RATE TRENDS AND THE EFFECT ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO  DEVELOPMENTS AT FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC  THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE ON THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST DEPEND UPON A STEADY STREAM OF PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS ON THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AND THE FULFILLMENT OF GUARANTEES BY GSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S INTERVENTION IN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE OR ASSURED FOR THE LONGER-TERM VIABILITY OF THESE GSES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF AND TRADING MARKET FOR AGENCY SECURITIES IN THE LONG TERM. ACCORDINGLY, IF THE GSES DEFAULTED ON THEIR GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS, SUFFERED LOSSES OR CEASED TO EXIST, THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  THE PASSAGE OF ANY NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION AFFECTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC MAY CREATE MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND REDUCE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CREDIT QUALITY OF SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THEM. IF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WERE REFORMED OR WOUND DOWN, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE EXISTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AGENCY SECURITIES. THE FOREGOING COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICING, SUPPLY, LIQUIDITY AND VALUE OF THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST AND OTHERWISE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON JUNE 3, 2019, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC ARE SCHEDULED TO START ISSUING A NEW COMMON SECURITY, THE UNIFORM MBS, IN PLACE OF THEIR CURRENT OFFERINGS OF MBS. THE NEW UNIFORM MBS WILL BE ISSUED USING A NEW COMMON SECURITIZATION PLATFORM (\"CSP\"). THE UNIFORM MBS WILL MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLE CURRENT FANNIE MAE MBS THAN CURRENT FREDDIE MAC MBS AND WILL BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE TBA MBS MARKET PLACE. EXISTING FREDDIE MAC MBS WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR EXCHANGE INTO NEW UNIFORM MBS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW UNIFORM MBS AND CSP WILL HAVE ON OUR EXISTING MBS OR THE MBS MARKET IN THE FUTURE, WE DO NOT EXPECT OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.  SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND FUNDING COSTS  CHANGES IN FED POLICY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, SINCE OUR COST OF FUNDS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SHORT-TERM RATES. AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUR MBS WOULD CAUSE OUR NET INCOME TO DECLINE. BELOW IS THE FED'S TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AT EACH FED MEETING SINCE DECEMBER 2015. ALTHOUGH MEETINGS WERE HELD IN JANUARY 2019 AND MARCH 2019, THE TARGET RANGES DID NOT CHANGE FROM THE DECEMBER 2018 RANGES LISTED BELOW.  MEETING DATE  LOWER RANGE  HIGHER RANGE  DECEMBER 2018  2.25%  2.50%  SEPTEMBER 2018  2.00%  2.25%  JUNE 2018  1.75%  2.00%  MARCH 2018  1.50%  1.75%  JANUARY 2018  1.25%  1.50%  JUNE 2017  1.00%  1.25%  MARCH 2017  0.75%  1.00%  DECEMBER 2016  0.50%  0.75%  DECEMBER 2015  0.25%  0.50%  OUR BORROWINGS IN THE REPURCHASE MARKET HAVE ALSO HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. TRADITIONALLY, A LOWER FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS INDICATED A TIME OF INCREASED NET INTEREST MARGIN AND HIGHER ASSET VALUES. VOLATILITY IN THESE RATES AND DIVERGENCE FROM THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG THESE RATES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. IF RATES WERE TO INCREASE AS A RESULT, OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO MIGHT SUFFER AS A RESULT.  39  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH SHOWS 30-DAY LIBOR AS COMPARED TO THE EFFECTIVE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ON A MONTHLY BASIS FROM  MARCH 31, 2017  TO  MARCH 31, 2019.  LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND MORTGAGE SPREADS  OUR SECURITIES ARE VALUED AT AN INTEREST RATE SPREAD VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES (MORTGAGE SPREAD). THIS MORTGAGE SPREAD VARIES OVER TIME AND CAN BE ABOVE OR BELOW LONG-TERM AVERAGES, DEPENDING UPON MARKET PARTICIPANTS' CURRENT DESIRE TO OWN SECURITIES OVER OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. WHEN THE MORTGAGE SPREAD GETS SMALLER (OR NEGATIVE) VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED. WHEN THIS SPREAD GETS LARGER (OR POSITIVE), OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  MORTGAGE SPREADS CAN VARY DUE TO MOVEMENTS IN SECURITIES VALUATIONS, MOVEMENTS IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE MAINLY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS (INCLUDING SWAPTIONS) TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR SECURITIES. WE DO NOT USE SUCH HEDGING CONTRACTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CONTRACT OR PURCHASED ANY ASSET SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF MORTGAGE SPREADS ON OUR BOOK VALUE.  40  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME (LOSS) SUMMARY  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  DECREASED, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND ASSET YIELDS WERE NOT ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH LED TO THE DECREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME (LOSS) WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE UNREALIZED LOSS ON OUR DERIVATIVES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  41  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  NET INTEREST INCOME  NET INTEREST INCOME IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO SIZE AND NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD.  2019  VS.  2018  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY  5.82%  FROM  $10,309,102  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  TO  $10,909,345  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO YIELDS INCREASED BY  0.60%  AND OUR INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS INCREASED BY  0.9%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  \u2022  THE COMBINATION OF THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE INCREASE IN OUR PORTFOLIO YIELD AND THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON OUR FINANCING CAUSED NET INTEREST INCOME TO DECREASE FROM 2018 TO 2019. OUR NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD WAS  1.62%  AND  1.52%  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WERE CARRIED AT A NET PREMIUM TO PAR VALUE WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZED COST OF  102.6%  AND  103.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON THESE SECURITIES BEING HIGHER THAN PREVAILING MARKET RATES.  42  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPONENTS OF THE YIELD EARNED ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIODS ENDED ON THE DATES SHOWN BELOW.  43  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

NO  OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED DURING 2017, TOTALING  $12,090  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR REMAINING AGENCY SECURITIES AT  MARCH 31, 2018.  \u2022  GAINS ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) ON INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES.  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) ON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF  $57  AND THE SALE OF  $199,445  OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN A REALIZED LOSS OF  $(750)  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  \u2022  GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES RESULTED FROM A COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u25e6  CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND TBA PRICES.  \u25e6  THE INCREASE IN OUR TOTAL INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE FROM  $6,800,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  TO  $9,775,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  \u25e6  THE DECREASE IN OUR TOTAL TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE FROM  $4,300,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  TO  $800,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  46  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  EXPENSES  THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, PURSUANT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ARMOUR AND JAVELIN. THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON GROSS EQUITY RAISED. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT FEES INCREASE WHEN WE RAISE CAPITAL AND DECLINE WHEN WE REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED STOCK AND LIQUIDATE DISTRIBUTIONS AS APPROVED AND SO DESIGNATED BY A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECREASED TO 0.75% PER ANNUM FOR GROSS EQUITY RAISED IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION PURSUANT TO THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE EFFECTIVE AVERAGE MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECLINES AS EQUITY IS RAISED. GROSS EQUITY RAISED WAS  $2,986,934  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  $2,620,693  AT  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  47  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  PROFESSIONAL FEES INCLUDE SECURITIES CLEARING, LEGAL, AUDIT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WE EXECUTE AND THE EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES WE UNDERTAKE ON POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS.  INSURANCE INCLUDES PREMIUMS FOR BOTH GENERAL BUSINESS AND DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY COVERAGE. THE FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS DUE TO CHANGES IN PREMIUMS.  COMPENSATION INCLUDES BOTH NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AS WELL AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDED TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES THROUGH ACM. THE FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS DUE TO A COMBINATION OF THE CHANGE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS VESTING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES.  OTHER EXPENSES INCLUDE FEES FOR MARKET AND PRICING DATA, ANALYTICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PORTFOLIO RELATED DATA PROCESSING COSTS AS WELL AS STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING FEES AND SIMILAR STOCKHOLDER RELATED EXPENSES, NET OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INCLUDES ALL CHANGES IN EQUITY DURING A PERIOD, EXCEPT THOSE RESULTING FROM INVESTMENTS BY OWNERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO OWNERS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AGENCY SECURITIES BACKED BY FIXED RATE HOME LOANS. FROM TIME TO TIME, A PORTION OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES MAY BE BACKED BY HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE AND ADJUSTABLE RATE HOME LOANS AS WELL AS UNSECURED NOTES AND BONDS ISSUED BY GSES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN INCOME TESTS WE MUST SATISFY FOR OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. OUR CHARTER PERMITS US TO INVEST IN THESE ASSET CLASSES.  48  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND TBA AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE TYPICALLY PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT PREMIUM PRICES. THE PREMIUM PRICE PAID OVER PAR VALUE ON THOSE ASSETS IS EXPENSED AS THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES EXPERIENCE REPAYMENT OR PREPAYMENT. THE LOWER THE CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE, THE LOWER THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND EARNINGS ARE HIGHER. IF PREPAYMENT RATES INCREASE, THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD WILL GO UP. THESE INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES WOULD ACT TO DECREASE THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND WOULD DECREASE EARNINGS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IF IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE AGENCY SECURITY UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE CONTRACT. TBA AGENCY SECURITIES ARE FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE (\u201cLONG POSITION\u201d) OR SALE (\u201cSHORT POSITION\u201d) OF AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE, FACE AMOUNT, ISSUER, COUPON AND STATED MATURITY ON AN AGREED-UPON FUTURE DATE. THE SPECIFIC AGENCY SECURITIES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACT UPON THE SETTLEMENT DATE, PUBLISHED EACH MONTH BY THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION, ARE NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION.

RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME COMMENCES ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE PURCHASE TRANSACTION AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE SALE TRANSACTION. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD INVESTMENT RELATED PAYABLES WITH RESPECT TO UNSETTLED PURCHASES OF AGENCY SECURITIES OF  $198,172  AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENT RELATED RECEIVABLES. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD INVESTMENT RELATED PAYABLES WITH RESPECT TO UNSETTLED PURCHASES OF AGENCY SECURITIES OF  $166,052  AND WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENT RELATED RECEIVABLES.  OUR NET INTEREST INCOME IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND THE FINANCING (BORROWING AND HEDGING) COST OF OWNING THOSE ASSETS. SINCE WE TEND TO PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREMIUM TO PAR, THE MAIN ITEM THAT CAN AFFECT THE YIELD ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AFTER THEY ARE PURCHASED IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MORTGAGE BORROWERS REPAY THE LOAN. WHILE THE SCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPAL PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS\u2019 REGULAR MONTHLY PAYMENTS,  52  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  ARE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE, THE UNSCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY REFINANCING OF THE MORTGAGE BUT CAN ALSO RESULT FROM REPURCHASES OF DELINQUENT, DEFAULTED, OR MODIFIED LOANS, ARE LESS SO. BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND MANAGE THESE REPAYMENT RATES IS A CRITICAL PORTION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, NOT ONLY FOR ESTIMATING CURRENT YIELD BUT ALSO FOR CONSIDERING THE RATE OF REINVESTMENT OF THOSE PROCEEDS INTO NEW SECURITIES, THE YIELDS WHICH THOSE NEW SECURITIES MAY ADD TO OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS UNDERLYING OUR AGENCY SECURITIES HAD FIXED-INTEREST RATES FOR AN AVERAGE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY  9 MONTHS  AND  8  MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER WHICH TIME THE INTEREST RATES RESET AND BECOME ADJUSTABLE. AFTER A RESET DATE, INTEREST RATES ON OUR ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE AGENCY SECURITIES FLOAT BASED ON SPREADS OVER VARIOUS INDICES, TYPICALLY LIBOR OR THE ONE-YEAR CONSTANT MATURITY TREASURY RATE. THESE INTEREST RATES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPS THAT LIMIT THE AMOUNT THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE CAN INCREASE DURING ANY YEAR, KNOWN AS AN ANNUAL CAP AND THROUGH THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, KNOWN AS A LIFETIME CAP.  CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES  WE PURCHASE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AT PRICES WHICH INCORPORATE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES.

OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE SECURED BY OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND BEAR INTEREST AT RATES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY MOVED IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BORROWING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NUMEROUS INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS AND OTHER LENDERS,  23  AND  23  OF WHICH HAD OPEN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH US AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE HAIRCUT PERCENTAGE REFLECTS BETTER FINANCING OF SOME OF OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AS THE CREDIT RATING HAS INCREASED FROM NON-INVESTMENT GRADE TO INVESTMENT GRADE ON THOSE SECURITIES.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  WE USE VARIOUS INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK AS WE DEEM PRUDENT IN LIGHT OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A HIGH QUALITY CREDIT RATING AND WITH FUTURES EXCHANGES. WE GENERALLY PAY A FIXED RATE AND RECEIVE A FLOATING RATE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FIXING A PORTION OF OUR BORROWING COSTS AND HEDGING THE CHANGE IN OUR BOOK VALUE TO SOME DEGREE. THE FLOATING RATE WE RECEIVE IS GENERALLY THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR LIBOR. OUR POLICIES DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE PERCENTAGES OR AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE RISK THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HEDGE. FOR INTEREST RATE RISK MITIGATION PURPOSES, WE CONSIDER AGENCY SECURITIES TO BE ARMS IF THEIR INTEREST RATE IS EITHER CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT ACCORDING TO PREVAILING RATES OR IF THEY ARE WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF THE PERIOD WHERE SUCH ADJUSTMENTS WILL OCCUR. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAVE NOT ELECTED CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AS ALLOWED BY GAAP. SINCE WE DO NOT DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, REALIZED AS WELL AS UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL IMPACT OUR GAAP EARNINGS.  USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  AVAILABLE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK FOR WHICH PROTECTION IS SOUGHT (E.G., THE DIFFERENCE IN INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS FOR LONG-TERM U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES COMPARED TO AGENCY SECURITIES);  \u2022  THE DURATION OF THE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT MATCH THE DURATION OF THE RELATED LIABILITY;  \u2022  THE COUNTERPARTY TO A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT WITH US MAY DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY OR NOT PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE COLLATERAL POSTED MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS;  \u2022  WE MAY LOSE COLLATERAL WE HAVE PLEDGED TO SECURE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT IF THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY;  \u2022  WE MAY EXPERIENCE A TERMINATION EVENT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO OUR REIT STATUS, EQUITY LEVELS AND PERFORMANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A PAYOUT TO THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY AND A TAXABLE LOSS TO US;  \u2022  THE CREDIT-QUALITY OF THE PARTY OWING MONEY ON THE DERIVATIVES MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR ASSIGN OUR SIDE OF THE HEDGING TRANSACTION; AND  \u2022  THE VALUE OF DERIVATIVES MAY BE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP TO REFLECT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE; DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS, OR \u201cMARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES,\u201d WOULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME OR INCREASE ANY NET LOSS.  55  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS PRESENT THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS BY YEAR OF MATURITY.  56  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD DERIVATIVES WITH A NET FAIR VALUE OF  $(8,388)  AND  $87,408  , RESPECTIVELY. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $9,775,000  AND  $7,350,000  . WE ALSO HAD TBA AGENCY SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $800,000  AND  $900,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. COUNTERPARTY RISK OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS ARE LIMITED TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE OF DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO LOCK IN A PORTION OF FUNDING COSTS FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO HELP ASSURE THE REALIZATION OF ATTRACTIVE NET INTEREST MARGINS AND TO VARY INVERSELY IN VALUE WITH OUR MBS. SUCH CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PREPAYMENTS WHICH, IF NOT REALIZED, WILL CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM EXPECTATIONS.  ALTHOUGH WE ATTEMPT TO STRUCTURE OUR DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN ASSET PRICES, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PRE-PAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES RELATIVE TO U.S. TREASURY AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT RATES MAKES ACHIEVING HIGH LEVELS OF OFF-SET DIFFICULT. WE RECOGNIZED NET LOSSES OF  $(135,198)  RELATED TO OUR DERIVATIVES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND NET GAINS OF  $58,597  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES INCREASED BY  $184,248  . FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES DECREASED BY  $(145,410)  . THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON AGENCY SECURITIES IS DUE TO MARKET PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.  AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO BE CLEARED THROUGH A DERIVATIVES CLEARING ORGANIZATION. WE ARE REQUIRED TO CLEAR CERTAIN NEW INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS MAY HAVE HIGHER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS THAN UN-CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WE PREVIOUSLY HAD. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ACCOUNT WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVES WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE TBA AGENCY SECURITIES PRIMARILY TO EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISH PORTFOLIO POSITIONS. SEE THE SECTION, \"AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND TBA AGENCY SECURITIES\" ABOVE.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  .

(3)  REPRESENTS COMPENSATION TO BE PAID TO THE BOARD IN THE FORM OF CASH AND COMMON EQUITY.  57  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  WE HAD CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS UNDER DERIVATIVES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $9,775,000  , A WEIGHTED AVERAGE SWAP RATE OF  2.05%  AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE TERM OF  62 MONTHS  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  . WE ALSO HAD TBA AGENCY SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $800,000  AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , OUR LIQUIDITY TOTALED  $713,108  , CONSISTING OF  $167,372  OF CASH PLUS  $545,736  OF UNPLEDGED AGENCY SECURITIES (INCLUDING SECURITIES RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL). OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS, MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING RESULTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS MAY INCLUDE PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY AND DEBT OFFERINGS AND ASSET SALES (SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY TO PAY DOWN BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS AND OTHERWISE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CAPITAL. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF OUR BORROWINGS CAN BE ADJUSTED ON A DAILY BASIS, THE LEVEL OF CASH CARRIED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN OUR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE TO PURCHASE MBS, PAY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUR BORROWINGS, FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND PAY DIVIDENDS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE PURCHASE OR SELL ASSETS FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT UP TO 90 DAYS IN THE FUTURE TO LOCK IN PURCHASE PRICES OR SALES PROCEEDS. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO BORROW (ON A RECOURSE BASIS) BETWEEN SIX AND TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE FINANCED OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH  $12,143,274  AND  $7,037,651  OF BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIOS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WERE  8.17  :1 AND  6.25:1  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT PERIOD END BY TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT PERIOD END.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE PURCHASED  $6,907,777  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $152,112  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $5,105,623  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $98,627  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE PURCHASED  $895,529  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $176,817  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $(702,202)  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $53,651  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018.  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL LENDING COUNTERPARTIES IN ORDER TO HELP INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO WITHSTAND PERIODS OF CONTRACTING LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.  CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $11,334  AND  $607  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN NET GAIN (LOSS) ON OUR DERIVATIVES AND REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES OF AGENCY SECURITIES. OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS  $10,909,345  AND  $10,309,102  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE SOLD  16,064  OF COMMON SHARES UNDER TWO UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND OUR COMMON STOCK ATM SALES AGREEMENT, FOR AN INCREASE IN EQUITY OF  $321,992.  IN ADDITION TO THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING DISCUSSED ABOVE, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER A TYPICAL REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM A BORROWER IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH AND AGREE TO SELL THE SAME SECURITIES BACK IN THE FUTURE. WE THEN SELL SUCH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY TO RETURN THE SECURITIES TO THE ORIGINAL BORROWER. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RECEIVABLES AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENT LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED NET WHEN THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING BEING WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, BEING GOVERNED BY THE SAME MRA, SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE SAME BROKERAGE OR CLEARING ACCOUNT AND MATURING ON THE SAME DAY. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS IS TO  58  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  REPLACE A PORTION OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HELPS TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE RISK, AND THEREFORE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. BOTH PARTIES TO THE REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DAILY MARGIN CALLS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL OBTAINED AND/OR PLEDGED. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, REPAYMENTS ON REPURCHASE BORROWINGS, REACQUISITION OF SECURITIES TO BE RETURNED TO BORROWERS AND THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AS REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CAN TRIGGER MARGIN CALLS BY OUR LENDERS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OR TERMINATION EVENT UNDER THE STANDARD MRA WOULD GIVE OUR COUNTERPARTY THE OPTION TO TERMINATE ALL REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXISTING WITH US AND REQUIRE ANY AMOUNT DUE TO BE PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY.  CHANGING CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE OUR LENDERS TO EXIT THE REPURCHASE MARKET, INCREASE FINANCING RATES, TIGHTEN LENDING STANDARDS OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED EQUITY CAPITAL OR HAIRCUT WE POST, ANY OF WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING.  FINANCIAL SECTOR VOLATILITY CAN ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND AND PRICES FOR HIGH QUALITY DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING AGENCY SECURITIES. WHILE INCREASED PRICES MAY INCREASE THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES, HIGHER VALUES MAY ALSO REDUCE THE RETURN ON REINVESTMENT OF CAPITAL, THEREBY LOWERING OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BEFORE THE EFFECT OF NETTING REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), WHICH FINANCE MOST OF OUR MBS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS BALANCE WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR CHANGE IN CAPITAL, LEVERAGE TARGETS AND THE MARKET PRICES OF OUR ASSETS. THE BALANCE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING WILL FLUCTUATE WITHIN ANY GIVEN MONTH BASED ON CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PARTICULAR MBS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL (INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PRINCIPAL PAYDOWNS) AND THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF INVESTMENT AND REINVESTMENT ACTIVITY.  59  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  SEE  NOTE 9  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  EFFECTS OF MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, LEVERAGE AND CREDIT SPREADS  OUR MBS HAVE VALUES THAT FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MBS WILL DECREASE AS PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS INCREASE. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES PLEDGED TO SECURE A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT DECREASES TO THE POINT WHERE THE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLLATERAL VALUE AND THE LOAN AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE HAIRCUT, OUR LENDERS MAY ISSUE A MARGIN CALL, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LENDER WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY THE MARGIN CALL IN CASH OR PLEDGE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO MEET THAT MARGIN CALL. UNDER OUR REPURCHASE FACILITIES, OUR LENDERS HAVE FULL DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE MBS WE PLEDGE TO THEM. MOST OF OUR LENDERS WILL VALUE SECURITIES BASED ON RECENT TRADES IN THE MARKET. LENDERS ALSO ISSUE MARGIN CALLS AS THE PUBLISHED CURRENT PRINCIPAL BALANCE FACTORS CHANGE ON THE POOL OF MORTGAGES UNDERLYING THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL WHEN SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ARE ANNOUNCED MONTHLY.  WE EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DURING A PERIOD OF DECLINING MARKET VALUE FOR MBS AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS AS FREQUENTLY AS DAILY. IN SEEKING TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY OUR LENDERS, WE MAINTAIN A POSITION OF CASH AND UNPLEDGED SECURITIES. WE REFER TO THIS POSITION AS OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MEET MARGIN CALLS IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY OUR LEVERAGE LEVELS, OUR HAIRCUTS AND THE PRICE CHANGES ON OUR SECURITIES. IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A YIELD CURVE SHIFT OR FOR ANOTHER REASON OR IF CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN, THE PRICES OF OUR COLLATERAL (AND OUR UNPLEDGED ASSETS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR LIQUIDITY) WILL DECLINE AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS. WE WILL USE OUR LIQUIDITY TO MEET SUCH MARGIN CALLS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MARGIN CALLS. IF OUR HAIRCUTS INCREASE, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL PROPORTIONATELY DECREASE. IF WE INCREASE OUR BORROWINGS, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL DECREASE BY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL HAIRCUT ON THE INCREASED LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR MRAS CONTAIN A RESTRICTION THAT PROHIBITS OUR LEVERAGE FROM EXCEEDING TWELVE TIMES OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS WELL AS TERMINATION EVENTS IN THE CASE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EQUITY CAPITAL.  60  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN RELATION TO OUR ASSETS THAT ENABLES US TO MEET REASONABLY ANTICIPATED MARGIN CALLS BUT THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY INVESTED IN MBS. WE MAY MISJUDGE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF OUR LIQUIDITY BY MAINTAINING EXCESSIVE LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS, OR BY MAINTAINING INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD FORCE US TO INVOLUNTARILY LIQUIDATE ASSETS INTO UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  ,WE FINANCED OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH  $12,143,274  AND  $7,037,651  , RESPECTIVELY, OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. OUR LEVERAGE RATIOS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WERE  8.17  :1 AND  6.25:1  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT PERIOD END BY TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT PERIOD END.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING LIQUIDITY  BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO, LEVERAGE RATE AND AVAILABLE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO MEET ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM (ONE YEAR OR LESS) LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TO FUND OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, MEET OUR FINANCING OBLIGATIONS, PAY FEES UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND FUND OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND PAY GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  WE MAY INCREASE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES BY OBTAINING LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OR MAKING PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING CLASSES OF PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK AND SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED NOTES TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM (GREATER THAN ONE YEAR) LIQUIDITY. SUCH FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS FOR CAPITAL RAISES AND FOR THE INVESTMENT OF ANY PROCEEDS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN ANY SUCH FINANCING.  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT MAINTAINED ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHERMORE, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT OR INTENT TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH BUCKLER ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  SEE  NOTE 3  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. SEE  NOTE 4  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED CHANGES.  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR MBS AND DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE. OUR AGENCY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AND THEREFORE UNREALIZED CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED DIRECTLY IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS. OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS INCOME OR LOSS. WE DO NOT USE HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR DERIVATIVES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT FAIR VALUE CHANGES ON DERIVATIVES OFFSET FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN OUR MBS, THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WILL BE LOWER. FOR EXAMPLE, RISING INTEREST RATES MAY TEND TO RESULT IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OUR REPORTED NET INCOME EVEN WHILE OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DECLINES.  61  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  FAIR VALUE FOR THE AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES USE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE PRICING MODELS THAT MAY INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COUPONS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, SPREAD TO THE TREASURY CURVES AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CURVES, DURATION, PERIODIC AND LIFE CAPS AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR AGENCY SECURITIES.

THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES THAT INCORPORATE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE CURRENT INTEREST RATE CURVES, FORWARD INTEREST RATE CURVES AND MARKET SPREADS TO INTEREST RATE CURVES. MANAGEMENT COMPARES PRICING INFORMATION RECEIVED TO DEALER QUOTES TO ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COLLATERAL TYPE, BOND STRUCTURE AND PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS, COUPONS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES.

FAIR VALUE FOR THE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES.  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE REALIZE GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES UPON THEIR SALE. AT THAT TIME, PREVIOUSLY UNREALIZED AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE RECLASSIFIED AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SELL AGENCY SECURITIES IN LATER PERIODS AFTER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AGENCY SECURITIES HAVE OCCURRED, WE MAY REPORT SIGNIFICANT NET INCOME OR NET LOSS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.  DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES THAT REPRESENT OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS ARE ALSO TREATED AS REALIZED LOSSES AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER LOSS. WE EVALUATE AGENCY SECURITIES FOR OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. WE CONSIDER AN IMPAIRMENT TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IF WE (1) HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL THE AGENCY SECURITIES, (2) BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY (FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS), OR (3) A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED ESTABLISH A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE RELATED AGENCY SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SUBSEQUENT SALES ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO SUCH NEW COST BASIS.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND REFLECT CHANGES IN THOSE FAIR VALUES IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES.

OVERVIEW  ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE COMPLETED OUR MERGER WITH LASALLE HOTEL PROPERTIES.  THE COMBINED COMPANY, HEADQUARTERED IN BETHESDA, MARYLAND, CONTINUES TO BE LED BY THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM LEADING US IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE MERGER.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED  61  HOTELS WITH A TOTAL OF  14,575  GUEST ROOMS.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR FIRST QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS EXCEEDED OUR OUTLOOK DUE TO HEALTHY REVPAR GROWTH, STRONG GROWTH IN OTHER REVENUES, INCLUDING FOOD AND BEVERAGE REVENUES, AND SLIGHTLY BETTER MARGINS THAN FORECASTED. ALTHOUGH MARCH 2019 DEMAND TRENDS WERE WEAKER THAN EXPECTED FOR THE HOTEL INDUSTRY AND OUR PORTFOLIO, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SOLID GROUP AND TRANSIENT BUSINESS AND LEISURE TRAVEL DEMAND AS OUR GROUP AND TRANSIENT PACE ADVANTAGES OVER 2018 REMAIN FAVORABLE.  OUR 2019 OUTLOOK FOR THE HOTEL INDUSTRY AND PEBBLEBROOK REMAINS POSITIVE, AS THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO GROW DESPITE GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY, EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES CONTINUE TO INCREASE, INFLATION REMAINS LOW AND CONSUMER AND BUSINESS CONFIDENCE REMAIN STRONG.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD THE FOLLOWING  TRANSACTIONS.  \u2022  ON  FEBRUARY 14, 2019  , WE SOLD  THE LIAISON CAPITOL HILL  FOR  $111.0 MILLION.  \u2022  ON  FEBRUARY 22, 2019  , WE SOLD  HOTEL PALOMAR WASHINGTON DC  FOR  $141.5 MILLION.  \u2022  WE REPAID  $70.0 MILLION  OF A PORTION OF THE TRANCHE MATURING IN 2020 OF OUR SIXTH TERM LOAN.  \u2022  WE ACQUIRED THE GROUND LEASE UNDERLYING THE LAND OF THE  SOLAMAR HOTEL.  WHILE WE DO NOT OPERATE OUR HOTEL PROPERTIES, BOTH OUR ASSET MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OUR EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT TEAM MONITOR AND WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH OUR HOTEL MANAGERS BY ADVISING AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR HOTELS\u2019 OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PROPERTY POSITIONING AND REPOSITIONING, REVENUE AND EXPENSE MANAGEMENT, OPERATIONS ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL DESIGN, RENOVATION AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, GUEST EXPERIENCE AND OVERALL STRATEGIC DIRECTION. THROUGH THESE EFFORTS, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE PROPERTY EFFICIENCIES, LOWER COSTS, MAXIMIZE REVENUES AND ENHANCE PROPERTY OPERATING MARGINS, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL ENHANCE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  KEY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE  WE MEASURE HOTEL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS BY EVALUATING FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL METRICS SUCH AS ROOM REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM (\"REVPAR\"); TOTAL REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM (\"TOTAL REVPAR\"); AVERAGE DAILY RATE (\"ADR\"); OCCUPANCY RATE (\"OCCUPANCY\"); FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\"); EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\"EBITDA\"); AND EBITDA FOR REAL ESTATE (\"EBITDA  RE\")  . WE EVALUATE INDIVIDUAL HOTEL AND COMPANY-WIDE PERFORMANCE WITH COMPARISONS TO BUDGETS, PRIOR PERIODS AND COMPETING PROPERTIES. ADR, OCCUPANCY AND REVPAR MAY BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND LOCAL ECONOMIES AND EVENTS. SEE \"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MATTERS\" FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF FFO, EBITDA AND EBIDTA  RE.  HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS THE KEY SAME-PROPERTY HOTEL OPERATING STATISTICS FOR OUR HOTELS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  SAME-PROPERTY OCCUPANCY  75.4%  76.1%  SAME-PROPERTY ADR  $249.00  $236.40  SAME-PROPERTY REVPAR  $187.76  $179.98  SAME-PROPERTY TOTAL REVPAR  $276.76  $265.20  THIS SCHEDULE OF HOTEL RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31  INCLUDES INFORMATION FROM ALL OF THE HOTELS WE OWNED AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THESE HOTEL RESULTS FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIODS MAY INCLUDE INFORMATION REFLECTING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE PRIOR TO THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP OF THE HOTELS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE MEASURES OF OUR HISTORICAL OR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. WE REPORT FFO, EBITDA AND EBITDA  RE  , WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS KEY MEASURES OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  WE CALCULATE FFO IN ACCORDANCE WITH STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY NAREIT, FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME (CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP), EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM SALES OF REAL ESTATE, IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS (INCLUDING IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE RELATED JOINT VENTURES), THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES INSTEAD HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MOST INDUSTRY INVESTORS CONSIDER PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT USE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING TO BE INSUFFICIENT BY THEMSELVES. BY EXCLUDING THE EFFECT OF REAL ESTATE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF THE JOINT VENTURE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM SALES OF REAL ESTATE AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS (INCLUDING IMPAIRMENT OF REAL ESTATE RELATED JOINT VENTURES), ALL OF WHICH ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND WHICH MAY BE OF LESSER SIGNIFICANCE IN EVALUATING CURRENT PERFORMANCE, WE BELIEVE THAT FFO PROVIDES INVESTORS A USEFUL FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NET INCOME (LOSS) TO FFO AND FFO AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHARE AND UNIT HOLDERS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NET INCOME (LOSS)  $5,655  $24,516  ADJUSTMENTS.

THE WHITE PAPER ISSUED BY NAREIT ENTITLED \u201cEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION FOR REAL ESTATE\u201d DEFINES EBITDA  RE  AS NET INCOME OR LOSS (COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP), EXCLUDING INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DISPOSITION OF DEPRECIATED PROPERTY (INCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES ON CHANGE OF CONTROL), IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS OF DEPRECIATED PROPERTY AND OF INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES CAUSED BY A DECREASE IN VALUE OF DEPRECIATED PROPERTY IN THE AFFILIATE, AND AFTER COMPARABLE ADJUSTMENTS FOR OUR PORTION OF THESE ITEMS RELATED TO UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES.  WE BELIEVE THAT EBITDA AND EBITDA  RE  PROVIDE INVESTORS USEFUL FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE (PRIMARILY INTEREST EXPENSE) AND OUR ASSET BASE (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION).  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES NET INCOME (LOSS) TO EBITDA AND EBITDA  RE  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GAAP, WHICH REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WHILE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REPORTED AMOUNTS WOULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT, APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES INVOLVES THE EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT AND THE USE OF ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ARE DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS THROUGH NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, EXISTING CASH BALANCES AND, IF NECESSARY, SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. WE EXPECT OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WILL BE ADEQUATE TO FUND OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, SERVICE DEBT AND FUND DIVIDENDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REIT REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX LAWS.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS HOTEL PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS, PROPERTY REDEVELOPMENT, INVESTMENTS IN NEW JOINT VENTURES, AND DEBT PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS AND DEBT MATURITIES, THROUGH THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF COMMON SHARES, ADDITIONAL ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED SHARES, ISSUANCES OF UNITS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN OUR OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, SECURED AND UNSECURED BORROWINGS, HOTEL PROPERTY SALES AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY MAY DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS.  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN PRUDENT DEBT LEVERAGE AND INTEND TO OPPORTUNISTICALLY ENHANCE OUR CAPITAL POSITION.  AS A RESULT OF THE APPROXIMATELY 61.5 MILLION COMMON SHARES AND UNITS ISSUED ON NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH OUR MERGER WITH LASALLE, WE ANTICIPATE AN INCREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS DUE TO THE INCREASED DIVIDEND PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THE DIVIDENDS FROM INCREASED CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM THE HOTEL PROPERTIES ACQUIRED IN THE MERGERS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR DEBT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

ESSEX IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , HAD AN APPROXIMATELY  96.6%  GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS TWO COMPONENTS: CONSTANT MONITORING OF EXISTING MARKETS, AND EVALUATION OF NEW MARKETS TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT UNDERLIE RENTAL GROWTH. THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION SUPPORTS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY BY ENHANCING ITS ABILITY TO QUICKLY SHIFT ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT, AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES TO MARKETS THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  THE COMPANY\u2019S AVERAGE FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S STABILIZED APARTMENT COMMUNITIES OR \"SAME-PROPERTY\" (STABILIZED PROPERTIES CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  ) WAS  96.9%  AND  97.1%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS DEFINED AS THE PERCENTAGE RESULTING FROM DIVIDING ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME BY TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME. ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL RENTAL INCOME PURSUANT TO LEASES WITHOUT CONSIDERING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES, WITH OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT CONTRACTUAL RENTAL RATES PURSUANT TO LEASES AND VACANT APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF OCCUPANCY BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THE VALUE OF EACH VACANT APARTMENT HOME AT ITS ESTIMATED MARKET RATE.  33  MARKET RATES ARE DETERMINED USING THE RECENTLY SIGNED EFFECTIVE RATES ON NEW LEASES AT THE PROPERTY AND ARE USED AS THE STARTING POINT IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE MARKET RATES OF VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THESE RATES BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERALL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR HOUSING, CONCENTRATION OF NEW APARTMENT DELIVERIES WITHIN THE SAME SUBMARKET WHICH CAN CAUSE PERIODIC DISRUPTION DUE TO GREATER RENTAL CONCESSIONS TO INCREASE LEASING VELOCITY, AND RENTAL AFFORDABILITY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT COMPLETELY REFLECT SHORT-TERM TRENDS IN PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY AND FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY DISCLOSED BY OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS TO CALCULATE ACTUAL RENT FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES AND MARKET RENTS FOR VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY COMPARES CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES TO ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS FOR UNOCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES, AND THUS THE CALCULATION COMPARES THE GROSS VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES EXCLUDING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. FOR APARTMENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES IN LEASE-UP WITHOUT STABILIZED OCCUPANCY FIGURES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY RATE IS THE APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE METRIC. WHILE AN APARTMENT COMMUNITY IS IN THE LEASE-UP PHASE, THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS TO STABILIZE THE PROPERTY WHICH MAY ENTAIL THE USE OF RENT CONCESSIONS AND OTHER INCENTIVES, AND THUS FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY, WHICH IS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL INCOME, IS NOT CONSIDERED THE BEST METRIC TO QUANTIFY OCCUPANCY.  THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SAME-PROPERTY PORTFOLIO FOR FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE OF 3.3% IN AVERAGE RENTAL RATES FROM $2,208 PER APARTMENT HOME IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  TO $2,280 PER APARTMENT HOME IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  NON-SAME PROPERTY REVENUES  DECREASED BY  $1.1 MILLION  OR  6.5%  TO  $16.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  FROM  $17.7 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES OF DOMAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND OF 8TH & HOPE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, OFFSET BY REVENUES GENERATED FROM MARQUIS, WHICH WAS CONSOLIDATED IN DECEMBER 2018, STATION PARK GREEN - PHASE I, A DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, THAT BEGAN PRODUCING RENTAL INCOME DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, AND ONE SOUTH MARKET, WHICH WAS CONSOLIDATED IN MARCH 2019.  MANAGEMENT AND OTHER FEES FROM AFFILIATES  REMAINED FLAT AT  $2.3 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE TAXES  INCREASED  $1.6 MILLION  OR  2.8%  TO  $58.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $57.3 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $0.9 MILLION IN UTILITIES EXPENSES, AN INCREASE OF $0.5 MILLION IN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND AN INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION IN MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSES. SAME-PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE TAXES, INCREASED BY $1.6 MILLION OR 2.9% TO $57.2 MILLION IN THE  FIRST  34  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO $55.6 MILLION IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $1.1 MILLION IN UTILITIES EXPENSES AND AN INCREASE OF $0.3 MILLION IN ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SAME-PROPERTY REAL ESTATE TAXES INCREASED BY $2.0 MILLION OR 5.7% TO $37.3 MILLION IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $35.3 MILLION IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN TAX RATES AND PROPERTY VALUATIONS.  CORPORATE-LEVEL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT EXPENSES  INCREASED  $0.4 MILLION  OR  5.1%  TO  $8.2 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $7.8 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CORPORATE-LEVEL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING COSTS SUPPORTING THE COMMUNITIES.

THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET DUE TO THE SALES OF DOMAIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 AND OF 8TH & HOPE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  INTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  $1.3 MILLION  OR  2.4%  TO  $53.6 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $54.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO DEBT THAT WAS PAID OFF OR MATURED, AS WELL AS REGULAR PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION DURING AND AFTER THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , WHICH RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF $4.5 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A $1.7 MILLION INCREASE IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THESE DECREASES TO INTEREST EXPENSE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING DEBT PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE ISSUANCE OF $300.0 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 15, 2048 IN MARCH 2018 AND OF $500.0 MILLION SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE MARCH 1, 2029 IN MARCH 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF $4.9 MILLION INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  TOTAL RETURN SWAP INCOME  OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  CONSISTS OF MONTHLY SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S TOTAL RETURN SWAP CONTRACTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO DURING 2015 IN CONNECTION WITH ISSUING FIXED RATE TAX-EXEMPT MORTGAGE NOTES. THE DECREASE OF  $0.3 MILLION  OR 13.0% FROM $2.3 MILLION FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  WAS DUE TO LESS FAVORABLE INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME  INCREASED BY  $6.4 MILLION  OR  108.5%  TO  $12.3 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $5.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $5.4 MILLION IN UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES RECOGNIZED THROUGH INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OTHER INCOME OF $1.5 MILLION IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  EQUITY INCOME FROM CO-INVESTMENTS  DECREASED  $16.5 MILLION  OR  50.3%  TO  $16.3 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $32.8 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROMOTE INCOME. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $0.8 MILLION OF PROMOTE INCOME FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ONE SOUTH MARKET COMPARED TO $20.5 MILLION IN FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, FROM THE BEXEAEW JOINT VENTURE, RESULTING IN A DECREASE OF $19.7 MILLION IN PROMOTE INCOME. THE DECREASE WAS SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $2.1 MILLION IN INCOME FROM PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  GAIN ON REMEASUREMENT OF CO-INVESTMENT  OF  $31.5 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  RESULTED FROM THE PURCHASE OF THE COMPANY'S JOINT VENTURE PARTNER'S 45.0% MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN THE ONE SOUTH MARKET CO-INVESTMENT IN MARCH 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD  $107.0 MILLION  OF UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND  $211.0 MILLION  IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, OF WHICH  $78.5 MILLION  WERE EQUITY SECURITIES OR AVAILABLE FOR SALE DEBT SECURITIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY ITS OPERATIONS, EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES, AVAILABILITY UNDER EXISTING LINES OF CREDIT, ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND THE ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM THE DISPOSITION OF REAL ESTATE ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ALL OF ITS REASONABLY ANTICIPATED CASH NEEDS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE TIMING, SOURCE AND AMOUNTS OF CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH CAN AFFECT THE COMPANY'S PLANS FOR ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS, DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  35  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , FITCH RATINGS (\"FITCH\"), MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICE (\"MOODY'S\"), AND STANDARD AND POOR'S (\"S&P\") CREDIT AGENCIES RATE THE COMPANY AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, BBB+/POSITIVE, BAA1/STABLE, AND BBB+/STABLE, RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD TWO UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AGGREGATING $1.24 BILLION. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON THE COMPANY'S $1.2 BILLION UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT. THE UNDERLYING INTEREST RATE IS BASED ON A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE TIED TO THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS AND WAS LIBOR PLUS 0.825% AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN DECEMBER 2022, WITH ONE 18-MONTH EXTENSION, EXERCISABLE AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WAS NO AMOUNT OUTSTANDING ON THE COMPANY'S $35.0 MILLION WORKING CAPITAL UNSECURED LINE OF CREDIT. THE UNDERLYING INTEREST RATE ON THE $35.0 MILLION LINE IS BASED ON A TIERED RATE STRUCTURE TIED TO THE COMPANY'S CREDIT RATINGS AND WAS LIBOR PLUS 0.825% AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN FEBRUARY 2021.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED $350.0 MILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES DUE ON MARCH 1, 2029, WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.000% (THE \"2029 NOTES\"), WHICH ARE PAYABLE ON MARCH 1 AND SEPTEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE 2029 NOTES WERE OFFERED TO INVESTORS AT A PRICE OF 99.188% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEREOF. THE 2029 NOTES ARE GENERAL UNSECURED SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, RANK EQUALLY IN RIGHT OF PAYMENT WITH ALL OTHER SENIOR UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND ARE UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY. IN MARCH 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $150.0 MILLION OF THE 2029 NOTES AT A PRICE OF 100.717% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT THEREOF. THESE ADDITIONAL NOTES HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TERMS AS THE 2029 NOTES ISSUED IN FEBRUARY 2019. THE COMPANY USED THE NET PROCEEDS OF THESE OFFERINGS TO REPAY INDEBTEDNESS UNDER ITS UNSECURED LINES OF CREDIT AND FOR OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE AND WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $290.0 MILLION IN SECURED MORTGAGE NOTES PAYABLE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 5.57% AND A STATED MATURITY DATE OF MAY 2019.  IN SEPTEMBER 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF UP TO $900.0 MILLION (THE \"2018 ATM PROGRAM\"). IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RELATED FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS WHEREBY, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, IT MAY SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM UNDER FORWARD SALES AGREEMENTS. THE USE OF A FORWARD SALES AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW THE COMPANY TO LOCK IN A SHARE PRICE ON THE SALE OF SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED, BUT DEFER RECEIVING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES UNTIL A LATER DATE. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT SELL ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THERE ARE NO OUTSTANDING FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND $900.0 MILLION OF SHARES REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BE SOLD UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  IN DECEMBER 2015, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO  ACQUIRE SHARES IN AN AGGREGATE OF UP TO $250.0 MILLION. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 234,061 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TOTALING $57.0 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $243.48 PER SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPLENISHMENT OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN SUCH THAT, AS OF SUCH DATE, THE COMPANY HAD $250.0 MILLION OF PURCHASE AUTHORITY REMAINING UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN.  ESSEX PAYS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FROM CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. UNTIL IT IS DISTRIBUTED, CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS INVESTED BY THE COMPANY PRIMARILY IN INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES HELD AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR IS USED BY THE COMPANY TO REDUCE BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS LINE OF CREDIT.  DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED, OR ARE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND ARE IN A PHASE OF LEASE-UP AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WAS COMPRISED OF  FOUR  CONSOLIDATED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  TWO  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND VARIOUS CONSOLIDATED PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AGGREGATING  1,861  APARTMENT HOMES, WITH TOTAL INCURRED COSTS OF  $0.9 BILLION  , AND ESTIMATED REMAINING PROJECT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.3 BILLION  , $0.2 BILLION OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS, FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS OF  $1.2 BILLION.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE BY USING A COMBINATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: ITS WORKING CAPITAL, AMOUNTS AVAILABLE ON ITS LINES OF CREDIT, CONSTRUCTION LOANS, NET PROCEEDS FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, IF ANY.  36  REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AS EXISTING PROPERTIES OWNED OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED, WHICH HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY WITH THE EXPECTATION OF INCREASED FINANCIAL RETURNS THROUGH PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT. DURING REDEVELOPMENT, APARTMENT HOMES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR RENT AND, AS A RESULT, MAY HAVE LESS THAN STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  FIVE  MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AGGREGATING  1,727  APARTMENT HOMES WITH ESTIMATED REDEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $140.1 MILLION  , OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY  $25.2 MILLION  REMAINS TO BE EXPENDED. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CEASE FUNDING OF THE REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AS NEEDED.  DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY  THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE CAPS, AND TOTAL RETURN SWAP CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED USING WIDELY ACCEPTED VALUATION TECHNIQUES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF EACH DERIVATIVE. THIS ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND USES OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE DETERMINED USING THE MARKET STANDARD METHODOLOGY OF NETTING THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE FIXED CASH RECEIPTS (OR PAYMENTS) AND THE DISCOUNTED EXPECTED VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS). THE VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS) ARE BASED ON AN EXPECTATION OF FUTURE INTEREST RATES (FORWARD CURVES) DERIVED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT BOTH ITS OWN NONPERFORMANCE RISK AND THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S NONPERFORMANCE RISK IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL SOURCES  THE COMPANY UTILIZES CO-INVESTMENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE  SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR ACQUISITIONS OF BOTH OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 814 APARTMENT HOMES IN COMMUNITIES ACTIVELY UNDER DEVELOPMENT WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS O  F $0.6 BILLION. TOTAL ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $0.2 BILLION, OF WHICH THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN THESE DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $0.1 BILLION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 10,301 APARTMENT HOMES OF OPERATING COMMUNITIES WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR A TOTAL BOOK VALUE OF $0.8 BILLION AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS UNCONSOLIDATED INTERESTS IN CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS HAVE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON ITS LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL RESOURCES, CREDIT OR MARKET RISK THAN ITS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 4, CO-INVESTMENTS, IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CARRYING VALUES AND COMBINED SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO EXERCISE THEIR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO THE FOLLOWING KEY AREAS: (I) ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE; AND (II) ASSESSING AND MEASURING THE IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANY'S REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES AND AFFILIATES. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED MATERIALLY FROM THE INFORMATION REPORTED IN NOTE 2, SUMMARY OF CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  CERTAIN STATEMENTS IN THIS \"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\" AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q WHICH ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS MAY BE CONSIDERED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE \"SECURITIES ACT\"), AND SECTION 21E OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, INCLUDING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS, HOPES, INTENTIONS, BELIEFS  37  AND STRATEGIES REGARDING THE FUTURE.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING ITS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE COMPANY TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CANNOT ASSURE THE FUTURE RESULTS OR OUTCOME OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THESE STATEMENTS; RATHER, THESE STATEMENTS MERELY REFLECT THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF THE APPROXIMATE OUTCOMES OF THE MATTERS DISCUSSED. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING: THE COMPANY MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE ITS BUSINESS OBJECTIVES; THE ACTUAL COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO DELAYS; THE STABILIZATION DATES OF SUCH PROJECTS MAY BE DELAYED; THE COMPANY MAY ABANDON OR DEFER DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN LOCAL MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH MAKE DEVELOPMENT LESS DESIRABLE, INCREASES IN COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT, INCREASES IN THE COST OF CAPITAL OR LACK OF CAPITAL AVAILABILITY, RESULTING IN LOSSES; THE TOTAL PROJECTED COSTS OF CURRENT DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY EXCEED EXPECTATIONS; SUCH DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS MAY NOT BE COMPLETED; DEVELOPMENT AND REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND ACQUISITIONS MAY FAIL TO MEET EXPECTATIONS; ESTIMATES OF FUTURE INCOME FROM AN ACQUIRED PROPERTY MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE; OCCUPANCY RATES AND RENTAL DEMAND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY COMPETITION AND LOCAL ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS; THERE MAY BE INCREASED INTEREST RATES AND OPERATING COSTS; THE COMPANY MAY BE UNSUCCESSFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS CO-INVESTMENT PARTNERS; FUTURE CASH FLOWS MAY BE INADEQUATE TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE FOR DIVIDEND PAYMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH REIT REQUIREMENTS; THERE MAY BE A DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY, AND THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE COMPANY'S COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED; THE TERMS OF ANY REFINANCING MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE AS THE TERMS OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS; AND THOSE RISKS, SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS REFERRED TO IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, AND IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \"SEC\"). ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR SUPPLEMENT THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY REASON, AND THEREFORE, THEY MAY NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS (\"FFO\") IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN THE REIT INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY PRESENTS FFO AND FFO EXCLUDING NON-CORE ITEMS (REFERRED TO AS \"CORE FFO\") AS SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT USED BY THE COMPANY AS, NOR SHOULD THEY BE CONSIDERED TO BE, ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR AS ALTERNATIVES TO CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FUND ITS CASH NEEDS.  FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT MEANT TO REPRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DO NOT PRESENT, NOR DO THEY INTEND TO PRESENT, A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE AND THAT FFO AND CORE FFO ARE ONLY MEANINGFUL WHEN THEY ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET INCOME.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FFO AND CORE FFO TO BE USEFUL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS OF AN EQUITY REIT BECAUSE, TOGETHER WITH NET INCOME AND CASH FLOWS, FFO AND CORE FFO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL BASES TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY OF A REIT TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT AND TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. BY EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO SALES OF DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION (WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITION BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND  38  USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES), FFO CAN HELP INVESTORS COMPARE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A REAL ESTATE COMPANY BETWEEN PERIODS OR AS COMPARED TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. BY FURTHER ADJUSTING FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CORE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CORE FFO ALLOWS INVESTORS TO COMPARE THE CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY TO ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR REPORTING PERIODS AND TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF ITEMS THAT BY THEIR NATURE ARE NOT COMPARABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND TEND TO OBSCURE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, PROVIDE THE MOST MEANINGFUL PICTURE OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE DEFINITION FOR THIS MEASURE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\"NAREIT\"), WHICH IS THE LEADING REIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, UNDER THE NAREIT FFO DEFINITION, THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO NET INCOME ARE (I) THE EXCLUSION OF HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION AND (II) THE EXCLUSION OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY AGREES THAT THESE TWO NAREIT ADJUSTMENTS ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  (A)  HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP ASSUMES, THROUGH DEPRECIATION CHARGES, THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. NAREIT STATED IN ITS WHITE PAPER ON FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS \"SINCE REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANY INDUSTRY INVESTORS HAVE CONSIDERED PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT USE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING TO BE INSUFFICIENT BY THEMSELVES.\" CONSEQUENTLY, NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO REFLECTS THE FACT THAT REAL ESTATE, AS AN ASSET CLASS, GENERALLY APPRECIATES OVER TIME AND DEPRECIATION CHARGES REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP DO NOT REFLECT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC REALITIES.  (B)  REITS WERE CREATED AS A LEGAL FORM OF ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE AS AN ASSET CLASS THROUGH INVESTMENT IN FIRMS THAT WERE IN THE BUSINESS OF LONG-TERM OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.  THE EXCLUSION, IN NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO, OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS ALLOWS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO READILY IDENTIFY THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LONG-TERM ASSETS THAT FORM THE CORE OF A REIT\u2019S ACTIVITY AND ASSISTS IN COMPARING THOSE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS.

NET OPERATING INCOME  NET OPERATING INCOME (\"NOI\") AND SAME-PROPERTY NOI ARE CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE TO EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE PRESENTATION OF SAME-PROPERTY NOI ASSISTS WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THE ALLOCATION OF DEPRECIATION AND ANY CORPORATE-LEVEL OR FINANCING-RELATED COSTS. NOI REFLECTS THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A COMMUNITY AND ALLOWS FOR AN EASY COMPARISON OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES OR GROUPS OF COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS OF REAL ESTATE HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCING AND OVERHEAD STRUCTURES, WITH  40  VARYING MARGINAL IMPACTS TO OVERHEAD BY ACQUIRING REAL ESTATE, NOI IS CONSIDERED BY MANY IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY TO BE A USEFUL MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. THE COMPANY DEFINES SAME-PROPERTY NOI AS SAME-PROPERTY REVENUES LESS SAME-PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PROPERTY TAXES.

AS ANTICIPATED, OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS IN FIRST QUARTER 2018.  OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 NET SALES INCREASED BY 1.9%, WITH INCREASES IN EACH OF OUR THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN OUR HEALTH, BEAUTY AND HOME CARE END MARKET WITHIN OUR PACKAGING REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND INCREASED VOLUME OF STEEL CYLINDER AND OIL AND GAS-RELATED PRODUCTS WITHIN OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  WE BELIEVE GENERAL INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO BE AT A HIGH LEVEL IN 2019, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES.  DURING 2018, MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OIL AND METAL-BASED COMMODITIES.  WE TOOK SWIFT ACTION TO MITIGATE SUCH COST INCREASES, INCLUDING IMPLEMENTING COMMERCIAL PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, RESOURCING TO ALTERNATE SUPPLIERS AND INSOURCING OF SOURCED-PRODUCT TO BETTER LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT.  AS A RESULT OF THESE ACTIONS, AS WELL AS SOFTENING OF CERTAIN UNDERLYING COMMODITY COSTS, WE HAVE NOW BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT TO WHERE MATERIAL COSTS WERE NOT A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR PROFIT CHANGE.  THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT DRIVERS OF NET INCOME CHANGE COMPARED WITH FIRST QUARTER 2018 RELATED TO OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND THE REVERSAL OF A LEGACY LIABILITY IN FIRST QUARTER 2018 THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN 2019.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 WAS 12.1%, COMPARED TO 21.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE RATE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS THAT OCCURRED DURING FIRST QUARTER 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE REVERSAL OF UNCERTAIN TAX BENEFITS DUE TO STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRATIONS, EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO SHARE BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED IN THE QUARTER, AND A REDUCTION IN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STATE TAX PLANNING INITIATIVES.  IN FIRST QUARTER 2018, WE TERMINATED A LEGACY LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $8.2 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH REDUCTION TO CORPORATE OFFICE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. PRIOR TO 2002, WE WERE WHOLLY-OWNED BY METALDYNE CORPORATION (\"METALDYNE\"). IN CONNECTION WITH THE REORGANIZATION BETWEEN TRIMAS AND METALDYNE IN JUNE 2002, WE ASSUMED CERTAIN LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF METALDYNE, MAINLY COMPRISED OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO FORMER TRIMAS EMPLOYEES, TAX-RELATED MATTERS, BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND REIMBURSEMENTS TO METALDYNE OF NORMAL COURSE PAYMENTS TO BE MADE ON TRIMAS' BEHALF. METALDYNE AND ITS U.S. SUBSIDIARIES FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE IN 2009. IN JANUARY 2018, THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY COURT ENTERED A FINAL DECREE TO CLOSE ALL REMAINING CASES AND FINALIZE THE METALDYNE BANKRUPTCY DISTRIBUTION TRUST, EFFECTIVELY TERMINATING ANY POTENTIAL OBLIGATION BY TRIMAS TO METALDYNE.  IN ADDITION TO THESE TWO ITEMS, DURING FIRST QUARTER 2019 WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF PLASTIC SRL, A MANUFACTURER OF SINGLE-BODIED AND ASSEMBLED POLYMERIC CAPS AND CLOSURES FOR USE IN HOME CARE PRODUCT APPLICATIONS, FOR AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $22.3 MILLION  , NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  PLASTIC SRL SERVES THE HOME CARE MARKET IN ITALY AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AND CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION OF NET SALES DURING THE QUARTER WITHIN OUR PACKAGING REPORTABLE SEGMENT.  WE INCURRED PURCHASE ACCOUNTING-RELATED EXPENSES DURING FIRST QUARTER 2019 OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY  $0.9 MILLION  WAS RECOGNIZED WITHIN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF THE TRADE NAME ACQUIRED THAT WILL NOT BE USED, AND APPROXIMATELY  $0.1 MILLION  WAS RECOGNIZED WITHIN COST OF SALES RELATED TO THE STEP-UP IN VALUE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF INVENTORY..  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONAL KEY RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS  CRITICAL FACTORS AFFECTING OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED INCLUDE: OUR ABILITY TO CREATE ORGANIC GROWTH THROUGH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CROSS-SELLING AND EXTENDING PRODUCT-LINE OFFERINGS, AND OUR ABILITY TO QUICKLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS; OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE AND INTEGRATE COMPANIES OR PRODUCTS THAT SUPPLEMENT EXISTING PRODUCT LINES, ADD NEW DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS OR CUSTOMERS, EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC COVERAGE OR ENABLE BETTER ABSORPTION OF OVERHEAD COSTS; OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE MORE EFFICIENTLY VIA SUPPLY BASE MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL SOURCING AND/OR PURCHASING OF MATERIALS, SELECTIVE OUTSOURCING AND/OR PURCHASING OF SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, AND GREATER LEVERAGE OF OUR ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS.  OUR OVERALL BUSINESS DOES NOT EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT SEASONAL FLUCTUATION, OTHER THAN OUR FOURTH QUARTER, WHICH HAS TENDED TO BE THE LOWEST NET SALES QUARTER OF THE YEAR DUE TO HOLIDAY SHUTDOWNS AT CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OR OTHER CUSTOMERS DEFERRING CAPITAL SPENDING TO THE FOLLOWING YEAR. GIVEN THE SHORT-CYCLE NATURE OF MOST OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE DO NOT CONSIDER SALES ORDER BACKLOG TO BE A MATERIAL FACTOR. A GROWING AMOUNT OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, WHICH EXPOSES US TO CERTAIN RISKS, INCLUDING CURRENCY RISKS.  WE ARE SENSITIVE TO PRICE MOVEMENTS IN OUR RAW MATERIALS SUPPLY BASE. OUR LARGEST MATERIAL PURCHASES ARE FOR RESINS (SUCH AS POLYPROPYLENE AND POLYETHYLENE), STEEL, ALUMINUM AND OTHER OIL AND METAL-BASED PURCHASED COMPONENTS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE GENERALLY ABLE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL MATERIAL COSTS AND DISRUPTIONS IN SUPPLY IN THE FUTURE AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS ALONG HIGHER COSTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE FORM OF PRICE INCREASES.  CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES IN OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REPORTABLE SEGMENT ARE SENSITIVE TO THE DEMAND FOR NATURAL GAS AND CRUDE OIL IN NORTH AMERICA. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR ARROW ENGINE BUSINESS IS MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THESE FACTORS, AS ITS ENGINE, PUMP JACK AND COMPRESSOR PRODUCTS ARE IMPACTED BY OIL AND GAS RIG COUNTS AND WELL COMPLETION ACTIVITIES. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR LAMONS BUSINESS SERVES UPSTREAM CUSTOMERS AT OIL WELL SITES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATING OIL PRICES. THE MAJORITY OF THIS BUSINESS PROVIDES PARTS FOR OIL REFINERIES AND PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT DECIDE TO INCUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THEIR PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE OR CAPACITY EXPANSION ACTIVITIES, BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE USE OF OUR GASKETS AND BOLTS, IN TIMES OF FLUCTUATING OIL PRICES. SEPARATELY, OIL-BASED COMMODITY COSTS ARE A SIGNIFICANT DRIVER OF RAW MATERIALS AND PURCHASED COMPONENTS USED WITHIN OUR PACKAGING REPORTABLE SEGMENT. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ESCALATOR/DE-ESCALATOR CLAUSES IN COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS, OR CAN MODIFY PRICES BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS TO RECOVER HIGHER COSTS, WE CANNOT BE ASSURED OF FULL COST RECOVERY IN THE OPEN MARKET.  EACH YEAR, AS A CORE TENET OF THE TRIMAS BUSINESS MODEL (\"TBM\"), OUR BUSINESSES TARGET COST SAVINGS FROM KAIZEN AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES IN AN EFFORT TO LOWER INPUT COSTS OR INCREASE THROUGHPUT AND YIELD RATES WITH A GOAL OF AT LEAST COVERING INFLATIONARY AND MARKET COST INCREASES. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUOUSLY REVIEW OUR COSTS TO ENSURE ALIGNMENT WITH CURRENT MARKET DEMAND.  WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE STRATEGIES TO REDEPLOY THE CASH GENERATED BY OUR BUSINESSES, WHICH, AMONG OTHER ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDES RETURNING CAPITAL TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND ACQUIRING STRATEGIC BOLT-ON BUSINESSES. IN NOVEMBER 2015, WE ANNOUNCED OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD AUTHORIZED US TO PURCHASE UP TO $50 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE OF OUR COMMON STOCK. IN 2018, WE PURCHASED 442,632 SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $12.1 MILLION. THE 2018 SHARE PURCHASES REPRESENT THE FIRST STOCK BUYBACK ACTIVITY UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.  ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THIS AUTHORIZATION TO $75 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE VALUE OF SHARES ALREADY PURCHASED UNDER THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION. IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE PURCHASED  24,900  SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 MILLION  .  WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL ANALYSIS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).

(4)  SENIOR SECURED INDEBTEDNESS IS NEGATIVE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  DUE TO THE DEDUCTION OF CERTAIN UNRESTRICTED CASH AND UNRESTRICTED PERMITTED INVESTMENTS AS ALLOWED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE TERMINATED OUR  $75.0 MILLION  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FACILITY, UNDER WHICH WE HAD THE ABILITY TO SELL ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO A THIRD-PARTY MULTI-SELLER RECEIVABLES FUNDING COMPANY.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD  NO  AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND HAD APPROXIMATELY  $284.9 MILLION  POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO APPROXIMATELY  $15.1 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.  THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE USED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES, INCLUDING SUPPORT OF CERTAIN OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS, VENDOR PAYMENT TERMS AND OTHER SUBSIDIARY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND TO MEET VARIOUS STATES' REQUIREMENTS TO SELF-INSURE WORKERS' COMPENSATION CLAIMS, INCLUDING INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED CLAIMS. AFTER CONSIDERATION OF LEVERAGE RESTRICTIONS CONTAINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  $284.9 MILLION  , OF BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  WE RELY UPON OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND OUR DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS.  AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER, WE USE CASH ON HAND FROM OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DOWN AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AS APPLICABLE.  OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  2019  APPROXIMATED  $320.7 MILLION  , COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $338.7 MILLION  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  2018  . THE OVERALL DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO REPAYMENTS USING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  CASH MANAGEMENT RELATED TO OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS CENTRALIZED. WE MONITOR OUR CASH POSITION AND AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY ON A DAILY BASIS AND FORECAST OUR CASH NEEDS ON A WEEKLY BASIS WITHIN THE CURRENT QUARTER AND ON A MONTHLY BASIS OUTSIDE THE CURRENT QUARTER OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. OUR BUSINESS AND RELATED CASH FORECASTS ARE UPDATED MONTHLY. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH ON HAND AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  IS RECORDED AS A CORPORATE ASSET AND IS LOCATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE AGGREGATE AVAILABLE FUNDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY OF  $284.9 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  (AFTER CONSIDERATION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LEVERAGE RESTRICTIONS) AND BASED ON FORECASTED CASH SOURCES AND REQUIREMENTS INHERENT IN OUR BUSINESS PLANS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DEBT SERVICE, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND OTHER SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIABLE INTEREST RATES ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , 1-MONTH LIBOR APPROXIMATED  2.49%  .  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THEREFORE NO VARIABLE RATE-BASED BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING.  IN ADDITION TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, WE HAVE OTHER CASH COMMITMENTS RELATED TO LEASES. WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE LEASE TRANSACTIONS AS OPERATING LEASES, AND ANNUAL RENT EXPENSE FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS RELATED THERETO APPROXIMATED  $12.3 MILLION  IN 2018. WE EXPECT LEASING WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN AVAILABLE FINANCING OPTION TO FUND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ANNOUNCED OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD AUTHORIZED US TO INCREASE THE PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK UP TO  $75 MILLION  IN THE AGGREGATE.  THE PREVIOUS AUTHORIZATION, APPROVED IN NOVEMBER 2015, AUTHORIZED UP TO  $50 MILLION  IN SHARE REPURCHASES.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WE PURCHASED  24,900  SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 MILLION  .  WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO RETURN CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MARKET RISK  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET RISK DUE TO CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE PRIMARILY THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE COUNTRY OF DOMICILE. WE MANAGE THESE OPERATING ACTIVITIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND REVENUES AND COSTS ARE GENERALLY DENOMINATED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES; HOWEVER, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN SUCH LOCAL CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISKS, ALBEIT IN IMMATERIAL NOTIONAL CONTRACTS, AS WE EXPLORED THE PREDICTABILITY OF OUR PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY RATE VOLATILITY ON OUR EARNINGS. WE USE CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MITIGATE CURRENCY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET INVESTMENT IN CERTAIN OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. SEE NOTE  9  , \"  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  ,\" INCLUDED IN PART 1, ITEM 1, \"  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ,\" WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INTEREST RISK AS IT RELATES TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY USED INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO FIX THE VARIABLE PORTION OF OUR DEBT TO MANAGE THIS RISK.  SEE NOTE  9  , \"  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  ,\" INCLUDED IN PART 1, ITEM 1, \"  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ,\" WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  COMMON STOCK  TRIMAS IS LISTED IN THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET  SM  . OUR STOCK TRADES UNDER THE SYMBOL \"TRS.\"  CREDIT RATING  WE AND CERTAIN OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS ARE RATED BY STANDARD & POOR'S AND MOODY'S. ON JUNE 7, 2018, MOODY'S UPGRADED OUR SENIOR NOTES RATING TO BA3 FROM B1, AS PRESENTED IN NOTE  8  ,  \"LONG-TERM DEBT\"  INCLUDED IN PART I,  ITEM 1  ,  \"NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\"  WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. MOODY'S ALSO UPGRADED OUR CORPORATE FAMILY RATING TO BA2 FROM BA3 AND MAINTAINED ITS OUTLOOK AS STABLE. ON JANUARY 30, 2019, STANDARD & POOR'S AFFIRMED A BB- RATING TO OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, AFFIRMED A BB CORPORATE CREDIT RATING AND MAINTAINED ITS OUTLOOK AS STABLE. IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE TO DECLINE, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CERTAIN FINANCIAL MARKETS MAY BECOME LIMITED, OUR COST OF BORROWINGS MAY INCREASE, THE PERCEPTION OF US IN THE VIEW OF OUR CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND SECURITY HOLDERS MAY WORSEN AND AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  OUTLOOK  OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 RESULTS CONTINUED OUR RECENT POSITIVE MOMENTUM, AS WE FURTHER IMPROVE OUR OPERATING EFFICACY UNDER THE TRIMAS BUSINESS MODEL, WHICH PROVIDES THE STANDARDIZED SET OF PROCESSES THAT WE FOLLOW TO DRIVE RESULTS ACROSS OUR MULTI-INDUSTRY SET OF BUSINESSES.  WE EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN SALES IN EACH OF OUR THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, ACHIEVING ANTICIPATED  FIRST QUARTER 2019 PROFIT LEVELS IN ADDITION TO A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN OUR POSITIVE MOMENTUM THROUGHOUT 2019, AND BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED TO CAPITALIZE ON GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS HAVE INSTILLED A CULTURE OF KAIZEN AND CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, COST SAVINGS AND LEVERAGE AVAILABLE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. WE REMAIN CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR GROWTH AND EARNINGS EXPANSION PROSPECTS FOR 2019, AND WE ARE NOT COUNTING ON SIGNIFICANT  END MARKET IMPROVEMENT, PARTICULARLY GIVEN ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AROUND DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS OF FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES. WE WILL CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF EXTERNAL FACTORS, WHILE FOCUSING ON THOSE AREAS WE CAN CONTROL.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE AND PURSUE GROWTH PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY IN OUR PACKAGING AND AEROSPACE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, WHERE WE HAVE MANY INITIATIVES UNDERWAY THAT WE EXPECT WILL BENEFIT US IN 2019. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ENSURE OUR COST STRUCTURES REMAIN ALIGNED WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE END MARKETS WE SERVE, MOST NOTABLY IN OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REPORTABLE SEGMENT. WE EXPECT TO LEVERAGE THE TENETS OF THE TRIMAS BUSINESS MODEL TO ACHIEVE OUR GROWTH PLANS, EXECUTE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES TO OFFSET INFLATIONARY PRESSURES, AND SEEK LOWER-COST SOURCES FOR INPUT COSTS, ALL WHILE CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSING OUR MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT, PRODUCTIVITY AND FIXED-COST STRUCTURE.  IMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE  2  , \"  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  ,\" INCLUDED IN PART 1, ITEM 1, \"  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  ,\" WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CERTAIN OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT IN SELECTING THE APPROPRIATE ASSUMPTIONS FOR CALCULATING FINANCIAL ESTIMATES. BY THEIR NATURE, THESE JUDGMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN INHERENT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY. THESE JUDGMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, OUR EVALUATION OF BUSINESS AND MACROECONOMIC TRENDS, AND INFORMATION FROM OTHER OUTSIDE SOURCES, AS APPROPRIATE.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION  OF OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, GARRY MCHENRY, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE  DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES  EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. BASED ON THIS  EVALUATION, GARRY MCHENRY, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT AS OF APRIL 2, 2019, OUR DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE SUCH THAT THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND  EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d) REPORTS IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS  SPECIFIED IN SEC RULES AND FORMS, AND IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER  AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.  THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IDENTIFIED  RELATES TO THE LACK OF PROPER SEGREGATION OF DUTIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LACK OF PROPER SEGREGATION OF DUTIES IS DUE  TO THE COMPANY\u2019S LIMITED RESOURCES.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL  REPORTING  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL  OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EVALUATION OF THESE CONTROLS AS OF THE END OF OUR LAST FISCAL QUARTER  AS COVERED BY THIS REPORT ON FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR  INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THAT  ITS DISCLOSURE CONTROLS OR ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERROR OR ALL FRAUD AND IS NOT  EFFECTIVE. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT  THE CONTROL SYSTEM'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS,  AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL  SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT  ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, WITHIN THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THESE INHERENT LIMITATIONS INCLUDE THE  REALITIES THAT JUDGMENTS IN DECISION MAKING CAN BE FAULTY AND THAT BREAKDOWNS CAN OCCUR BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ERROR OR MISTAKE. CONTROLS  CAN ALSO BE CIRCUMVENTED BY THE INDIVIDUAL ACTS OF SOME PERSONS, BY COLLUSION OF TWO OR MORE PEOPLE, OR MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF  THE CONTROLS. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS,  AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS.  12  PART II \u2013 OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.

WE ALSO RENT INDUSTRIAL WIPING PRODUCTS, FLOOR MATS, FACILITY SERVICE PRODUCTS, OTHER  NON-GARMENT  ITEMS, AND PROVIDE RESTROOM AND CLEANING SUPPLIES  AND FIRST AID CABINET SERVICES AND OTHER SAFETY SUPPLIES, TO A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS AND SERVICE COMPANIES. WE HAVE FIVE REPORTING SEGMENTS, U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, SPECIALTY GARMENTS, FIRST AID AND CORPORATE. WE  REFER TO THE U.S. AND CANADIAN RENTAL AND CLEANING, MFG, AND CORPORATE REPORTING SEGMENTS COMBINED AS OUR \u201cCORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS.\u201d  COST OF  REVENUES INCLUDE THE AMORTIZATION OF RENTAL MERCHANDISE IN SERVICE AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO DIRECT SALES AS WELL AS LABOR AND OTHER PRODUCTION, SERVICE AND DELIVERY COSTS, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING OUR CORE LAUNDRY  OPERATIONS, SPECIALTY GARMENTS FACILITIES, AND FIRST AID LOCATIONS. SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CORPORATE OFFICES,  NON-OPERATING  ENVIRONMENTAL SITES AND OPERATING LOCATIONS INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, MANUFACTURING PLANNING, FINANCE, BUDGETING, AND HUMAN RESOURCES.  WE HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF PLANTS AND CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN ENERGY PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. IN GENERAL, WE  ARE RELATIVELY MORE DEPENDENT ON BUSINESS IN THESE REGIONS THAN ARE MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES BEGINNING IN 2014 DIRECTLY AFFECTED OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE OIL INDUSTRY AS THEY CURTAILED THEIR LEVEL OF  OPERATIONS, WHICH ALSO HAD A CORRESPONDING EFFECT ON OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUSINESSES WHICH SERVICE OR SUPPLY THE OIL INDUSTRY AS WELL AS OUR  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CUSTOMERS IN UNRELATED BUSINESSES LOCATED IN AREAS WHICH HAD BENEFITED FROM THE ECONOMIC EXPANSION GENERATED BY THE ROBUST GROWTH DRIVEN BY THE HIGHER OIL PRICES IN PRIOR YEARS. AS A RESULT, OUR  ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERIODS FOLLOWING THIS DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OIL PRICES WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ELEVATED HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS IN OUR WEARER BASE AS WELL AS INCREASED LOST ACCOUNTS. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT INCREASED ENERGY PRICES HAVE  RESULTED IN STABILIZED OR IMPROVED WEARER LEVELS AT EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OUR NORTH AMERICAN ENERGY-DEPENDENT MARKETS. OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE ALSO DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY THE COSTS OF THE GASOLINE USED TO FUEL OUR VEHICLES AND THE NATURAL GAS USED  TO OPERATE OUR PLANTS. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN ENERGY PRICES, IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD HAVE AN  OVERALL NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS DUE TO CUTBACKS BY OUR CUSTOMERS BOTH IN, AND DEPENDENT UPON, THE OIL AND NATURAL GAS INDUSTRIES, WHICH WOULD OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS IN OUR OPERATING COSTS FROM LOWER ENERGY COSTS.  THE COST OF HEALTHCARE THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR EMPLOYEES HAS GROWN OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AT A RATE IN EXCESS OF OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND AS A RESULT, HAS  NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS. MOREOVER, IT IS GENERALLY EXPECTED THAT HEALTHCARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES WILL INCREASE OVER THE COMING YEARS AT RATES IN EXCESS OF INFLATION. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, AND DEPENDING ON THE EFFECT  OF ANY MODIFICATIONS WE HAVE MADE, AND MAY MAKE IN THE FUTURE, TO OUR EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE PLANS AND ENROLLMENT LEVELS IN THOSE PLANS, WE EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FURTHER ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING HEALTHCARE  COSTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS, OVERTIME  REQUIREMENTS, WORKING CONDITION REQUIREMENTS, CITIZENSHIP REQUIREMENTS, HEALTHCARE INSURANCE MANDATES AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT OUR LABOR COSTS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR LABOR COSTS WILL RISE IN FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN  STATE AND LOCAL MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AS WELL AS THE OVERALL IMPACT OF WAGE PRESSURE AS THE RESULT OF A LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ENVIRONMENT.  ON JANUARY 2,  2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING US TO REPURCHASE FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $100.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. REPURCHASES MADE UNDER THE PROGRAM, IF ANY, WILL BE MADE IN EITHER  THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR STOCK PRICE, CORPORATE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND  PRIORITIES, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH OR CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  DURING THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 45,000 SHARES FOR AN AVERAGE  PRICE PER SHARE OF $139.57.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A  PRE-TAX  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON  DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND  QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A  ONE-TIME  CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF  $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A MULTIYEAR CRM PROJECT TO FURTHER DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT AND DEPLOY A THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION WE LICENSED.  THIS NEW SOLUTION IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, CAPABILITY AND INFORMATION FLOW AS WELL AS INCREASE AUTOMATION IN SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAVE CAPITALIZED $6.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR NEW CRM PROJECT.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS ENACTED, WHICH, AMONG OTHER PROVISIONS, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE  INCOME TAX RATE EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 FROM A 35.0% RATE TO A NEW 21.0% CORPORATE RATE AND IMPOSED A  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX ON EARNINGS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED ITS  ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT (SEE NOTE 13, \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q).  A PORTION OF OUR SALES IS DERIVED FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, INCLUDING CANADA. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR REPRESENTED  APPROXIMATELY 7.7% AND 7.8% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR  REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 8.0% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUES FOR BOTH THE THIRTEEN AND  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 24, 2018. THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED  INTO U.S. DOLLARS AND SUCH RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CANADIAN DOLLAR MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE MARGINS OF OUR CANADIAN BUSINESS BECAUSE A WEAKER CANADIAN  DOLLAR WILL INCREASE THE COST OF MERCHANDISE AND OTHER OPERATIONAL INPUTS THAT ARE SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF CANADA. OUR OPERATING RESULTS IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY ANY DEVALUATION, AS COMPARED TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, OF THE CANADIAN  DOLLAR OR ANY OF THE CURRENCIES OF THE OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

EXCLUDING THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF  ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE ESTIMATE INCREASED OUR REVENUES IN CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 0.5%, AS WELL AS A SLIGHTLY WEAKER CANADIAN DOLLAR, WHICH UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED OUR GROWTH BY 0.4%, ORGANIC GROWTH FOR OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS WAS  4.0%. ORGANIC GROWTH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NEW SALES, PRICING ADJUSTMENTS, AND NET CHANGES IN THE WEARER LEVELS AT OUR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, OFFSET BY LOST ACCOUNTS. DURING THE QUARTER, OUR ORGANIC GROWTH RATE BENEFITED FROM SOLID NEW ACCOUNT SALES,  SLIGHTLY IMPROVED LOST ACCOUNTS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND INCREASES IN MERCHANDISE RECOVERY CHARGES.  SPECIALTY  GARMENTS\u2019 RESULTS ARE OFTEN AFFECTED BY SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING AND LENGTH OF ITS CUSTOMERS\u2019 POWER REACTOR OUTAGES AS WELL AS ITS PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN SPECIALTY GARMENTS REVENUE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE POSITIVE  EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS OF 10.8%, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S CANADIAN AND EUROPEAN OPERATIONS.

OUR CORE LAUNDRY OPERATIONS COST OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED TO 63.9% IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS  ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 FROM 63.0% IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND SERVICE AND DELIVERY PAYROLL COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MERCHANDISE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES. THESE INCREASES  WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS.  OUR SPECIALTY GARMENTS COSTS OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS 68.8% IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS  ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 65.4% IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AS WELL AS  HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND AUTO CLAIMS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WERE LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS, THE CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL LABOR COSTS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW CRM PROJECT THAT WE INITIATED IN FISCAL 2018, AND THE DEFERRAL OF COMMISSION COSTS UPON THE ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019. THESE DECREASES TO  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCY ACCRUALS.

THESE NEW RATES REQUIRED US TO REMEASURE OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX  LIABILITIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.

THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND SERVICE AND DELIVERY PAYROLL COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MERCHANDISE  COSTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS.  OUR SPECIALTY GARMENTS COSTS OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WAS 67.3%  IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED TO 63.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN COST OF REVENUES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PRODUCTION AND MERCHANDISE COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018 AS  WELL AS HIGHER EXPENSES RELATED TO WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND AUTO CLAIMS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECREASE WAS A GAIN OF $3.0 MILLION FROM  THE SETTLEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, LOWER HEALTHCARE CLAIMS, THE CAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL LABOR COSTS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW CRM PROJECT WE  INITIATED IN FISCAL 2018, AND THE DEFERRAL OF COMMISSION COSTS UPON THE ADOPTION OF NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019. THESE DECREASES TO SELLING AND  ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EFFECT OF INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCY ACCRUALS AS WELL AS INCREASES IN ADVERTISING COSTS, SALES INCENTIVE COSTS AND RECRUITMENT COSTS.

THESE NEW RATES REQUIRED US  TO REMEASURE OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. ALSO, WE WERE SUBJECT TO A  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX FOR THE DEEMED REPATRIATION OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE  REMEASUREMENT OF OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND THE  ONE-TIME  TRANSITION TAX RESULTED IN A $20.2 MILLION NET BENEFIT TO OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  TOTALED $335.3 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, AN INCREASE OF $64.8 MILLION FROM AUGUST 25, 2018 WHEN THE AMOUNT TOTALED $270.5 MILLION. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019  INCLUDES $47.7 MILLION IN CASH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL WAS $668.9 MILLION AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019 COMPARED TO $586.3 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 25, 2018. WE GENERATED $128.7 MILLION AND  $230.1 MILLION IN CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND THE FULL FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 25, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH,  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS BALANCES, OUR CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR  LIQUIDITY. WE GENERALLY USE THESE CASH FLOWS TO FUND MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF OUR OPERATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES AS WELL AS DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE MAY ALSO USE CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL  AS PROCEEDS FROM LOANS PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT, TO FUND GROWTH AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES, AS WELL AS OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED  FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 24, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE WAS $3.0 MILLION FROM THE SETTLEMENT  OF ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND IMPROVED COLLECTIONS OF RECEIVABLES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE  ONE-TIME  BONUS PAID TO OUR EMPLOYEES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019 AND INCREASED MERCHANDISE PLACED IN SERVICE.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN CASH OUTFLOWS RELATED TO BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE INCREASE IN CASH  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 AND TO  AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS PAID AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS PAID BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND BORROWING CAPACITY  WE HAVE A  $250 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 11, 2021. UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WE ARE ABLE TO BORROW FUNDS AT VARIABLE INTEREST RATES BASED ON,  AT OUR ELECTION, THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR A BASE RATE, PLUS IN EACH CASE A SPREAD BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT RATIO. AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT REQUIRES COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED  FUNDED DEBT RATIO AND MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE TEST OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ON A FISCAL QUARTERLY BASIS. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, THE INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO  OUR BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WOULD BE CALCULATED AS LIBOR PLUS 75 BASIS POINTS AT THE TIME OF THE RESPECTIVE BORROWING. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AND HAD OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AMOUNTING TO  $71.8 MILLION, LEAVING $178.2 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE  WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO TWELVE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO EXCHANGE CAD FOR U.S. DOLLARS AT FIXED EXCHANGE RATES IN ORDER TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE RELATED TO  CERTAIN FORECASTED CAD DENOMINATED SALES OF ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE SPECIFIED AS THE FIRST AMOUNT OF CAD DENOMINATED REVENUES INVOICED BY ONE OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING IN THE THIRD  FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2022. IN TOTAL, WE WILL SELL APPROXIMATELY 12.1 MILLION CAD AT AN AVERAGE CANADIAN-DOLLAR EXCHANGE RATE OF 0.7814 OVER THESE QUARTERLY PERIODS. WE CONCLUDED THAT THE  FORWARD CONTRACTS MET THE CRITERIA TO QUALIFY AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE UNDER U.S. GAAP.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE HAD FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY  12.1 MILLION CAD OUTSTANDING AND RECORDED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACTS OF $0.1 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS AND $0.1 MILLION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER  COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $0.1 MILLION, WHICH WAS RECORDED NET OF TAX. DURING THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE RECLASSIFIED $0.1 MILLION FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO  REVENUE, RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE GAIN ON THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUES PRIOR TO ITS  MATURITY ON FEBRUARY 25, 2022.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, AND THE  GENERATION, HANDLING, STORAGE, TRANSPORTATION, TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS WASTES AND OTHER SUBSTANCES. IN PARTICULAR, INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRIES CURRENTLY USE AND MUST DISPOSE OF DETERGENT WASTE WATER AND OTHER RESIDUES, AND, IN THE PAST, USED  PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND OTHER DRY CLEANING SOLVENTS. WE ARE ATTENTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE DISPOSAL OF THESE MATERIALS AND HAVE, THROUGH THE YEARS, TAKEN MEASURES TO AVOID THEIR IMPROPER DISPOSAL. OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE  SETTLED, OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF, ACTIONS OR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US RELATING TO THE DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE TO EXPEND MATERIAL AMOUNTS TO REMEDIATE THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY  SUCH DISPOSAL IN THE FUTURE.  U.S. GAAP REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR CONTINGENCIES BE RECORDED WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND  THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF A LIABILITY, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT TO BE RECORDED. WE REGULARLY CONSULT WITH ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS IN OUR  CONSIDERATION OF THE RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES BEFORE RECORDING A CONTINGENT LIABILITY. CHANGES IN ENACTED LAWS, REGULATORY ORDERS OR DECREES, OUR ESTIMATES OF COSTS, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, INSURANCE PROCEEDS, PARTICIPATION BY OTHER  PARTIES, THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS, THE INPUT OF OUR ATTORNEYS AND OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS OR OTHER FACTUAL CIRCUMSTANCES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE AMOUNTS RECORDED FOR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES.  UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, AN OWNER OR LESSEE OF REAL ESTATE MAY BE LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF REMOVAL OR REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES  LOCATED ON, OR IN, OR EMANATING FROM SUCH PROPERTY, AS WELL AS RELATED COSTS OF INVESTIGATION AND PROPERTY DAMAGE. SUCH LAWS OFTEN IMPOSE LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE OWNER OR LESSEE KNEW OF, OR WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR, THE PRESENCE OF SUCH  HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC SUBSTANCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ACQUIRED OR LEASED LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THAT FUTURE USES OR CONDITIONS WILL NOT RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF LIABILITY  UPON OUR COMPANY UNDER SUCH LAWS OR EXPOSE OUR COMPANY TO THIRD PARTY ACTIONS SUCH AS TORT SUITS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS UNDER TERMS OF CONSENT ORDERS NEGOTIATED WITH THE APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AUTHORITIES OR OTHERWISE  WITH RESPECT TO SITES LOCATED IN OR RELATED TO WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS, SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS, SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS, UVALDE, TEXAS, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, TWO SITES RELATED TO FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT, AS WELL AS SITES  LOCATED IN GOLDSBORO, NORTH CAROLINA AND WILMINGTON, NORTH CAROLINA.  WE HAVE ACCRUED CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO THE SITES DESCRIBED ABOVE AS IT HAS BEEN  DETERMINED THAT THE COSTS ARE PROBABLE AND CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE HAVE POTENTIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO A PARCEL OF LAND (THE \u201cCENTRAL AREA\u201d) RELATED TO THE WOBURN, MASSACHUSETTS SITE MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE CONSENT DECREE  FOR THE WOBURN SITE DOES NOT DEFINE OR REQUIRE ANY REMEDIATION WORK IN THE CENTRAL AREA. THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (THE \u201cEPA\u201d) HAS PROVIDED US AND OTHER SIGNATORIES TO THE CONSENT DECREE WITH COMMENTS ON THE DESIGN  AND IMPLEMENTATION OF GROUNDWATER AND SOIL REMEDIES AT THE WOBURN SITE AND INVESTIGATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA. WE, AND OTHER SIGNATORIES, HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND PROPOSED TO DO ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE WOBURN SITE BUT MANY OF  THE EPA\u2019S COMMENTS REMAIN TO BE RESOLVED. WE HAVE ACCRUED COSTS TO PERFORM CERTAIN WORK RESPONSIVE TO EPA\u2019S COMMENTS. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AT THE SOMERVILLE, MASSACHUSETTS  SITE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RECEIVED DEMANDS FROM THE LOCAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW MUNICIPAL TRANSIT STATION IN THE AREA OF THE SOMERVILLE SITE. THIS STATION IS PART OF THE  EXTENSION OF THE TRANSIT SYSTEM. WE HAVE RESERVED FOR COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS MATTER; HOWEVER, IN LIGHT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MATTER, THESE COSTS AND THE RELATED RESERVE MAY CHANGE. WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED NOTICE THAT THE  MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION WORK WITH RESPECT TO THE SOMERVILLE SITE.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW AND EVALUATE SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE REMEDIATION AND MONITORING AND DETERMINE OUR  ESTIMATED COSTS BASED ON VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES ARE DEVELOPED USING OUR INTERNAL SOURCES OR BY THIRD PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS OR OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. INTERNALLY DEVELOPED ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON.  \u2022  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT AND EXPERIENCE IN REMEDIATING AND MONITORING OUR SITES;  \u2022  INFORMATION AVAILABLE FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES AS TO COSTS OF REMEDIATION AND MONITORING;  \u2022  THE NUMBER, FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND RELATIVE DEGREE OF RESPONSIBILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES  (\u201cPRPS\u201d) WHO MAY BE LIABLE FOR REMEDIATION AND MONITORING OF A SPECIFIC SITE; AND  \u2022  THE TYPICAL ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG PRPS.  THERE IS USUALLY A RANGE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH SITE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, OUR ACCRUALS REFLECT THE AMOUNT WITHIN  THE RANGE THAT WE BELIEVE IS THE BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF ESTIMATES IF NO POINT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE. WHERE WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE AMOUNT OF A PARTICULAR LIABILITY AND THE TIMING OF THE PAYMENTS ARE RELIABLY  DETERMINABLE, WE ADJUST THE COST IN CURRENT DOLLARS USING A RATE OF 3% FOR INFLATION UNTIL THE TIME OF EXPECTED PAYMENT AND DISCOUNT THE COST TO PRESENT VALUE USING CURRENT RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, THE RISK-FREE  INTEREST RATES WE UTILIZED RANGED FROM 2.7% TO 3.0%.  FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOUNTED, WE INCLUDE INTEREST ACCRETION, BASED ON THE  EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE CHANGES TO THE AMOUNTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR THE  TWENTY-SIX  WEEKS ENDED  FEBRUARY 23, 2019 WERE AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).

ANNUAL PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION ARE DEPOSITED INTO AN ESCROW ACCOUNT WHICH FUNDS REMEDIATION AND MONITORING COSTS FOR TWO SITES RELATED TO OUR FORMER OPERATIONS IN WILLIAMSTOWN, VERMONT. ANNUAL PROCEEDS RECEIVED BUT NOT  EXPENDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR ACCUMULATE IN THIS ACCOUNT AND MAY BE USED IN FUTURE YEARS FOR COSTS RELATED TO THIS SITE THROUGH THE YEAR 2027. AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019,  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE BALANCE IN THIS ESCROW ACCOUNT, WHICH IS HELD IN A TRUST AND IS NOT RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION. ALSO INCLUDED IN ESTIMATED INSURANCE  PROCEEDS ARE AMOUNTS WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PURSUANT TO LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AS REIMBURSEMENTS FROM THREE INSURANCE COMPANIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS AT THE SITE IN UVALDE, TEXAS.  OUR NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES ARE LICENSED BY THE NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION (\u201cNRC\u201d), OR, IN CERTAIN CASES, BY THE APPLICABLE  STATE AGENCY, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATION BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ALSO HAVE NUCLEAR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION FACILITIES IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND THE NETHERLANDS. THESE FACILITIES ARE LICENSED AND REGULATED BY THE RESPECTIVE  COUNTRY\u2019S APPLICABLE FEDERAL AGENCY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH REGULATION WILL NOT LEAD TO MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR GARMENT DECONTAMINATION BUSINESS.  DURING FISCAL 2017, WE RECORDED A  PRE-TAX  NON-CASH  IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF  $55.8 MILLION ONCE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NOT PROBABLE THAT THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM THAT WAS BEING DEVELOPED WOULD BE COMPLETED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE. ON DECEMBER 28, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH OUR  LEAD CONTRACTOR FOR THE VERSION OF THE CRM SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO WHICH WE RECORDED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, WE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 23, 2019 A TOTAL GAIN OF $21.1 MILLION AS  A REDUCTION OF SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR RECEIPT OF A  ONE-TIME  CASH PAYMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $13.0 MILLION AS WELL AS THE FORGIVENESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY DUE THE  CONTRACTOR. WE ALSO RECEIVED HARDWARE AND RELATED MAINTENANCE SERVICE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $0.8 MILLION AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT.  FROM TIME TO  TIME, WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS, CUSTOMER CONTRACT MATTERS, EMPLOYMENT CLAIMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ASCERTAIN THE ULTIMATE LEGAL AND FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING LAWSUITS AND  ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, WE BELIEVE THAT THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF SUCH LIABILITIES, IF ANY, IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS COVERED BY INSURANCE HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ACCRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. IT  IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT THE FUTURE FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR FUTURE PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES OR CHANGES OUT OF OUR  CONTROL.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF FEBRUARY 23, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGULATION  S-K.  SEASONALITY  HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE VARIED FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE. THESE  FLUCTUATIONS HAVE BEEN DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; THE TIMING OF ACQUISITIONS AND OF COMMENCING  START-UP  OPERATIONS AND RELATED COSTS; OUR EFFECTIVENESS  IN INTEGRATING ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND  START-UP  OPERATIONS; THE TIMING OF NUCLEAR PLANT OUTAGES; CAPITAL EXPENDITURES; SEASONAL RENTAL AND PURCHASING PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS; AND PRICE CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO  COMPETITIVE FACTORS. IN ADDITION, OUR OPERATING RESULTS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN LOWER DURING THE SECOND AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS THAN DURING THE OTHER QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR ANY HISTORICAL QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY  INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR AN ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR OR ANY OTHER INTERIM PERIODS.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION  IN GENERAL, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON MODERATE CHANGES IN THE INFLATION RATE.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  WE ADOPTED THE NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION (\"ASC 606\") EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2018, USING THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH REQUIRED US TO RESTATE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS.  SEE  NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  HAS ALSO BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE FULL RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES RELATE TO: THE TIMING AND AMOUNTS OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE NATURE AND TIMING OF THE SATISFACTION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND THE TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS; THE REALIZATION OF TAX ASSETS AND ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITIES; FAIR VALUES OF INVESTMENTS IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES; ASSETS HELD FOR SALE; INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL VALUATIONS; THE RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THIS LISTING IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THESE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  REVENUE POLICY  OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS OFTEN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY OR IF THEY SHOULD BE COMBINED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. FURTHER, WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF ESTIMATION METHODS TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (\"SSP\") FOR EACH PRODUCT AND SERVICE. WE USE THE RESIDUAL APPROACH IN ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. AS REQUIRED, WE EVALUATE THE RESIDUAL APPROACH ESTIMATE COMPARED TO ALL AVAILABLE OBSERVABLE DATA IN ORDER TO CONCLUDE THE ESTIMATE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS SSP.  SEE  NOTE 1. NATURE OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 CONTAINS CERTAIN SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THIS FORM 10-Q, AND OTHER INFORMATION PROVIDED BY US OR STATEMENTS MADE BY OUR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS OR EMPLOYEES FROM TIME TO TIME, MAY CONTAIN \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING\u201d STATEMENTS AND INFORMATION, WHICH INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. STATEMENTS INDICATING THAT WE \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cMAY,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cMIGHT,\u201d \u201cSHOULD,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cPLAN,\u201d \u201cTARGET,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATE\u201d AND \u201cCONTINUE,\u201d ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, AS ARE OTHER STATEMENTS CONCERNING FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS, PRODUCT OFFERINGS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS OR FUTURE EVENTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION: (1) ECONOMIC, GEOPOLITICAL AND MARKET CONDITIONS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, INCLUDING OUR REVENUE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY, WHICH IN TURN COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCK PRICE. (2) WE MAY FAIL TO ACHIEVE OUR FINANCIAL FORECASTS DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS DELAYS OR SIZE REDUCTIONS IN TRANSACTIONS, FEWER LARGE TRANSACTIONS IN A PARTICULAR QUARTER, FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, OR A DECLINE IN OUR RENEWAL RATES FOR CONTRACTS. (3) OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE TRANSITIONS TO NEW BUSINESS MODELS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON A CLOUD AND SUBSCRIPTION STRATEGY, MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. (4) IF WE ARE UNABLE TO DEVELOP NEW OR SUFFICIENTLY DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, OR TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN A TIMELY MANNER TO MEET MARKET DEMAND, PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS MAY NOT PURCHASE NEW SOFTWARE LICENSES OR SUBSCRIPTIONS OR PURCHASE OR RENEW SUPPORT CONTRACTS. (5) WE DEPEND UPON OUR EXTENSIVE PARTNER CHANNEL AND WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN RETAINING OR EXPANDING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHANNEL PARTNERS. (6) OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES AND OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, INCLUDING RISKS RELATING TO FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES. (7) IF THE SECURITY MEASURES FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES OR OTHER OFFERINGS ARE COMPROMISED OR SUBJECT TO A SUCCESSFUL CYBER-ATTACK, OR IF SUCH OFFERINGS CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT CODING OR CONFIGURATION ERRORS, WE MAY EXPERIENCE REPUTATIONAL HARM, LEGAL CLAIMS AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. (8) WE HAVE MADE ACQUISITIONS, AND MAY MAKE ACQUISITIONS IN THE FUTURE, AND THOSE ACQUISITIONS MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, MAY INVOLVE  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNANTICIPATED COSTS OR OTHER INTEGRATION ISSUES OR MAY DISRUPT OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS. (9) THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 1A (RISK FACTORS) IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, AND IN PART I, ITEM 1A (RISK FACTORS) IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2018  . ALTHOUGH WE HAVE SOUGHT TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER, OR TO WHAT EXTENT, ANY OF SUCH RISKS MAY BE REALIZED. WE ALSO CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ALL POSSIBLE ISSUES WHICH WE MIGHT FACE. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT WE MAKE.  USE OF CONSTANT CURRENCY  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE RESULTS HAVE BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES STRENGTHEN, OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS STATED IN U.S. DOLLARS ARE POSITIVELY IMPACTED.  AS EXCHANGE RATES ARE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN UNDERSTANDING PERIOD TO PERIOD COMPARISONS, WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF REVENUE GROWTH RATES ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS ENHANCES THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR REVENUE RESULTS AND EVALUATION OF OUR PERFORMANCE IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR PERIODS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY INFORMATION PRESENTED IS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS USING PRIOR PERIOD WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

WE OPERATE AS THREE DISTINCT SEGMENTS: OPENEDGE, DATA CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION, AND APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT.  THE KEY TENETS OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN AND OPERATING MODEL ARE AS FOLLOWS.  ALIGN RESOURCES TO DRIVE PROFITABILITY  . OUR ORGANIZATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND OPERATING PRINCIPLES FOCUS PRIMARILY ON CUSTOMER AND PARTNER RETENTION AND SUCCESS FOR OUR CORE PRODUCTS AND A STREAMLINED OPERATING APPROACH IN ORDER TO MORE EFFICIENTLY DRIVE REVENUE.  PROTECT AND STRENGTHEN OUR CORE BUSINESS  . A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON PROVIDING THE PLATFORM AND TOOLS ENTERPRISES NEED TO BUILD \u201cCOGNITIVE APPLICATIONS,\u201d WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE FUTURE OF APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT.

HOLISTIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION APPROACH  . PURSUANT TO OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY, WE HAVE TARGETED TO RETURN APPROXIMATELY 75-80% OF OUR ANNUAL CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND THROUGH DIVIDENDS.  WE  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HAVE ALSO ADOPTED A DISCIPLINED APPROACH TO FUTURE MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.  BY ADOPTING STRICT FINANCIAL CRITERIA FOR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, THESE ACQUISITIONS WILL ENABLE US TO DRIVE SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDER RETURNS BY PROVIDING SCALE AND INCREASED CASH FLOWS.  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED A NEW CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE TARGETING TO RETURN APPROXIMATELY 75-80% OF OUR ANNUAL CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND THROUGH DIVIDENDS.  TO THAT END, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED OUR TOTAL SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $250.0 MILLION. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THERE WAS  $75.0 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THIS CURRENT AUTHORIZATION. AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, WE INTEND TO SUSPEND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019. WE EXPECT TO RESUME SHARE REPURCHASES IN FISCAL 2020, AT A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH OUR PUBLICLY STATED CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY.  ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN 11% INCREASE TO OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.14 TO $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  WE BEGAN PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OF $0.125 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK TO PROGRESS STOCKHOLDERS IN DECEMBER 2016 AND INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.14 PER SHARE IN SEPTEMBER 2017. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY. HOWEVER, WE MAY TERMINATE OR MODIFY THIS PROGRAM AT ANY TIME. ON MARCH 19, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK THAT WILL BE PAID ON JUNE 17, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JUNE 3, 2019.  ON MARCH 28, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN ACQUISITION AGREEMENT WITH IPSWITCH, INC. (\u201cIPSWITCH\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE WILL ACQUIRE ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF IPSWITCH FOR $225 MILLION IN CASH. WE WILL FUND THE TRANSACTION WITH EXISTING CASH ON HAND AND FUNDS SECURED UNDER A NEW CREDIT FACILITY.  IPSWITCH WILL PROVIDE US WITH LEADING NETWORK MANAGEMENT AND SECURE DATA FILE TRANSFER CAPABILITIES FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES AND ENTERPRISES.  FOUNDED IN 1991, IPSWITCH SERVES APPROXIMATELY 24,000 CUSTOMERS IN 170 COUNTRIES.  IPSWITCH HAS APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION IN REVENUE, OF WHICH 75% IS RECURRING.  IPSWITCH HAS BLUE-CHIP CUSTOMERS ACROSS ALL VERTICALS, INCLUDING FINANCE AND BANKING, HEALTHCARE, INSURANCE, RETAIL, GOVERNMENT AND BIOTECH.  THE TRANSACTION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE APRIL 2019, SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY REGULATORY APPROVALS AND CONDITIONS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF IPSWITCH, WE INTEND TO SUSPEND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019.  WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS DESIGNED TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS.  AS A RESULT, OUR EXPECTED USES OF CASH COULD CHANGE, OUR CASH POSITION COULD BE REDUCED AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT WE COMPLETE ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR FORESEEABLE CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES TO PROGRESS STOCKHOLDERS, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY CONDUCTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE DID NOT RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON REVENUE DURING FISCAL YEARS 2018 OR 2017, BUT SINCE APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF OUR REVENUE IS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCY, FUTURE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

THE DECREASE IN NORTH AMERICA WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN LICENSE REVENUE IN OUR DATA CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION SEGMENT, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE DECREASES IN OUR APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT SEGMENT AND A DECLINE IN MAINTENANCE REVENUE IN OUR OPENEDGE SEGMENT. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN EMEA WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LICENSE REVENUE FROM OUR DATA CONNECTIVITY AND INTEGRATION SEGMENT, OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. REVENUE IN LATIN AMERICA DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THE REVENUE GENERATED IN ASIA PACIFIC INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER LICENSE REVENUE IN OUR OPENEDGE SEGMENT.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTAL REVENUE GENERATED IN MARKETS OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA REPRESENTED 48% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO 45% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A PROVISIONAL TAX BENEFIT AMOUNT OF $1.4 MILLION RECORDED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018 RELATED TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX BALANCE DUE TO ENACTMENT OF TAX REFORM IN THE U.S. THAT LOWERED THE FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE.

THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH INFLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF $24.4 MILLION, $1.9 MILLION IN CASH RECEIVED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, AND THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH OF $1.4 MILLION. EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, $38.1 MILLION OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. FOREIGN CASH INCLUDES UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, WHICH ARE INVESTED INDEFINITELY OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. AS SUCH, IT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. IF WE WERE TO REPATRIATE THESE EARNINGS, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING IN CERTAIN TAX JURISDICTIONS AND A PORTION OF THE REPATRIATED EARNINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THIS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED OUR TOTAL SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $250.0 MILLION. IN FISCAL YEAR 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 2.9 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $120.0 MILLION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED  0.7 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR  $25.0 MILLION  . AS OF  FEBRUARY 28,  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2019  , THERE IS  $75.0 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THIS CURRENT AUTHORIZATION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ANNOUNCED ACQUISITION OF IPSWITCH, WE INTEND TO SUSPEND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019. WE EXPECT TO RESUME SHARE REPURCHASES IN FISCAL 2020, AT A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH OUR PUBLICLY STATED CAPITAL ALLOCATION POLICY.  DIVIDENDS  ON SEPTEMBER 21, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN 11% INCREASE TO OUR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND FROM $0.14 TO $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  WE BEGAN PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS OF $0.125 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK TO PROGRESS STOCKHOLDERS IN DECEMBER 2016 AND INCREASED THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO $0.14 PER SHARE IN SEPTEMBER 2017. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE PAYING QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDENDS IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY. HOWEVER, WE MAY TERMINATE OR MODIFY THIS PROGRAM AT ANY TIME. ON MARCH 19, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.155 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK THAT WILL BE PAID ON JUNE 17, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JUNE 3, 2019.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES  DURING FISCAL YEAR 2017, WE UNDERTOOK CERTAIN OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES INTENDED TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ANNUAL COSTS. AS PART OF THIS ACTION, MANAGEMENT COMMITTED TO A NEW STRATEGIC PLAN HIGHLIGHTED BY A NEW PRODUCT STRATEGY AND A STREAMLINED OPERATING APPROACH. TO EXECUTE THESE OPERATIONAL RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES, WE REDUCED OUR GLOBAL WORKFORCE BY OVER 20%. THESE WORKFORCE REDUCTIONS OCCURRED IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL FUNCTIONAL UNITS AND ACROSS ALL GEOGRAPHIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE ALSO CONSOLIDATED OFFICES IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS DURING FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL EXPENSES RELATED TO FACILITY CLOSURES AS PART OF THIS RESTRUCTURING ACTION THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2019, BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS TO BE MATERIAL.  AS PART OF THIS FISCAL YEAR 2017 RESTRUCTURING, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF  $0.4 MILLION  , WHICH ARE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  CREDIT FACILITY  OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A  $123.8 MILLION  SECURED TERM LOAN AND A  $150.0 MILLION  SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE IN U.S. DOLLARS AND CERTAIN OTHER CURRENCIES AND MAY BE INCREASED BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $125.0 MILLION  IF THE EXISTING OR ADDITIONAL LENDERS ARE WILLING TO MAKE SUCH INCREASED COMMITMENTS. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS SUBLIMITS FOR SWING LINE LOANS UP TO  $25.0 MILLION  AND FOR THE ISSUANCE OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT IN A FACE AMOUNT UP TO  $25.0 MILLION  . WE EXPECT TO USE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS OF OTHER BUSINESSES, AND MAY ALSO USE IT FOR WORKING CAPITAL.  THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES ON  NOVEMBER 20, 2022  , WHEN ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING WILL BE DUE AND PAYABLE IN FULL. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DOES NOT REQUIRE AMORTIZATION OF PRINCIPAL. THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE TERM LOAN AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  $116.0 MILLION  , WITH  $7.0 MILLION  DUE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THE TERM LOAN REQUIRES REPAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENT AMOUNTS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE: (I) EIGHT PAYMENTS OF  $1.5 MILLION  EACH, (II) FOUR PAYMENTS OF  $2.3 MILLION  EACH, (III) FOUR PAYMENTS OF  $3.1 MILLION  EACH, (IV) THREE PAYMENTS OF  $3.9 MILLION  EACH, AND (V) THE LAST PAYMENT IS OF THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN THEREAFTER WOULD BE DUE ON THE MATURITY DATE. THE TERM LOAN MAY BE PREPAID BEFORE MATURITY IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT OUR OPTION WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE TERM LOAN APPROXIMATES THE FAIR VALUE, BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS (OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES IN LESS THAN ACTIVE MARKETS), AS THE INTEREST RATE IS VARIABLE OVER THE SELECTED INTEREST PERIOD AND IS SIMILAR TO CURRENT RATES AT WHICH WE CAN BORROW FUNDS. THE INTEREST RATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  4.00%.  REVOLVING LOANS MAY BE BORROWED, REPAID, AND REBORROWED UNTIL  NOVEMBER 20, 2022  , AT WHICH TIME ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING MUST BE REPAID. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THERE WERE  NO  AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING LINE AND  $1.3 MILLION  OF LETTERS OF CREDIT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING COVENANTS THAT LIMIT OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, GRANT LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, MAKE ACQUISITIONS, INCUR INDEBTEDNESS, MERGE OR CONSOLIDATE, DISPOSE OF ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS, REPURCHASE STOCK, CHANGE THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS, ENTER INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND ENTER INTO BURDENSOME AGREEMENTS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY EXCEPTIONS FOR A CREDIT FACILITY OF THIS SIZE AND TYPE.

OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATION FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES BY US OR OUR SUBCONTRACTORS. HISTORICALLY, OUR COSTS TO DEFEND LAWSUITS OR SETTLE CLAIMS RELATING TO SUCH INDEMNITY AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT. ACCORDINGLY, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IS IMMATERIAL.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CLINICAL  TRIALS UPDATE  PHASE 2B EXTENSION STUDY FOR HIV, AS MONOTHERAPY  CURRENTLY, THERE ARE A TOTAL OF SIX PATIENTS IN THIS ONGOING EXTENSION STUDY AND EACH HAS SURPASSED APPROXIMATELY 4.5 YEARS OF SUPPRESSED VIRAL  LOAD WITH LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) AS A SINGLE AGENT THERAPY. THESE PATIENTS ARE CONTINUING IN EXTENSION STUDIES OF THIS MONOTHERAPY TRIAL BY SELF-ADMINISTERING, SUBCUTANEOUS WEEKLY INJECTION OF LERONLIMAB.  PHASE 2B/3 PIVOTAL TRIAL FOR HIV, AS COMBINATION THERAPY  THIS IS A  PIVOTAL 25-WEEK TRIAL  FOR LERONLIMAB AS A COMBINATION THERAPY TO A HIGHLY ACTIVE  ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (\u201cHAART\u201d) DRUG REGIMENS. THIS TRIAL WAS A DOUBLE BLIND, PLACEBO CONTROLLED TRIAL. IN LATE FEBRUARY 2018, WE REPORTED THAT WE HAD ENROLLED 52 PATIENTS AND THE TRIAL\u2019S PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ACHIEVED WITH  A P-VALUE OF  0.0032. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT FOR EFFICACY WAS DEFINED AS 0.5LOG REDUCTION IN VIRAL LOAD AFTER ONE WEEK OF THERAPY WITH LERONLIMAB IN COMBINATION WITH THE PATIENT\u2019S FAILING HAART REGIMEN.  FOLLOWING THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PRIMARY ENDPOINT, THE TRIAL IS CONTINUING TO ENROLL UNDER AN OPEN LABEL FOR SAFETY ANALYSIS. FORTY-SEVEN OUT OF  FIFTY-TWO  PATIENTS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED THIS TRIAL AND MOST  OF THE PATIENTS HAVE TRANSITIONED INTO AN EXTENSION STUDY, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE CONTINUED ACCESS TO LERONLIMAB THERAPY, AT THE REQUEST OF THEIR TREATING PHYSICIAN. MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THAT THE TOTAL COSTS OF THIS TRIAL,  INCLUDING THE OPEN LABEL PORTION, MAY RANGE FROM $12 MILLION TO $14 MILLION. THE SUCCESSFUL RESULTS OF THIS TRIAL WILL SERVE AS THE BASIS OUR BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION (\u201cBLA\u201d) FILING, OF WHICH, THE FIRST OF THREE SECTIONS WAS  FILED IN MARCH 2019.  EXTENSION STUDY FOR HIV, AS COMBINATION THERAPY  THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS WHO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND FOR WHOM THE TREATING PHYSICIANS  REQUEST A CONTINUATION OF LERONLIMAB THERAPY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD. IF THIS STUDY ENROLLS 40 PATIENTS FROM THE PHASE 2B/3 TRIAL AND ALL PATIENTS REMAIN IN THE ROLLOVER STUDY FOR ONE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE COST OF THIS  STUDY TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION TO $4 MILLION.  PHASE 2B/3 INVESTIGATIVE TRIAL FOR HIV, AS LONG-TERM MONOTHERAPY  THIS IS A TRIAL OF OVER 370 PATIENTS THAT ASSESSES USING LERONLIMAB SUBCUTANEOUSLY AS A LONG-ACTING SINGLE-AGENT MAINTENANCE THERAPY FOR 48  WEEKS IN PATIENTS WITH SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD  WITH CCR5-TROPIC HIV-1 INFECTION. THE  PRIMARY ENDPOINT IS THE PROPORTION OF PARTICIPANTS WITH A SUPPRESSED VIRAL LOAD TO THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED  VIROLOGIC FAILURE. THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT IS THE LENGTH OF TIME TO VIROLOGIC FAILURE. ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST SEVERAL PATIENTS WAS ANNOUNCED IN DECEMBER 2016. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING TWO HIGHER-DOSE ARMS, ONE WITH 525 MG DOSE (A 50% INCREASE  FROM THE ORIGINAL DOSAGE OF 350 MG), AS WELL AS A 700 MG DOSE. WE RECENTLY REPORTED THAT INTERIM DATA SUGGESTED THAT BOTH THE 525 MG AND THE 700 MG DOSAGES ARE ACHIEVING A RESPONDER RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  90% AFTER THE INITIAL 10 WEEKS. THE ESTIMATES FOR THE TOTAL COST OF THIS TRIAL CURRENTLY RANGE FROM $22 MILLION TO $25 MILLION, WITH AN EXPECTED $8 MILLION TO $9 MILLION  REMAINING IN CONNECTION WITH MAINTAINING PATIENTS TO PROVIDE SAFETY DATA FOR THE BLA FILING. WE EXPECT ENROLLMENT TO BE COMPLETED IN 2019. SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUATION OF A HIGH RESPONDERS\u2019 RATE FROM PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE 525 MG AND 700 MG  DOSE ARMS, THIS TRIAL MAY BE DISCONTINUED, IF AND WHEN WE SUCCESSFULLY FILE A PROTOCOL FOR A PIVOTAL PHASE 3 TRIAL FOR MONOTHERAPY AND INITIATE SUCH A TRIAL.  CANCER AND IMMUNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS FOR LERONLIMAB  WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS FOR LERONLIMAB INVOLVING THE CCR5 RECEPTOR, OTHER THAN  HIV-RELATED  TREATMENTS, SUCH AS INFLAMMATORY CONDITIONS, AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES AND CANCER.  THE TARGET OF  LERONLIMAB IS THE IMPORTANT G PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTOR CCR5. CCR5 IS MORE THAN THE PATHWAY TO HIV REPLICATION; IT IS ALSO A CRUCIAL COMPONENT OF INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES AND IS A KEY MEDIATOR IN MANY CANCER METASTASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS OPENS THE  POTENTIAL FOR MULTIPLE PIPELINE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LERONLIMAB. CCR5 IS A PROTEIN LOCATED ON THE SURFACE OF WHITE BLOOD CELLS AND CANCER EPITHELIAL CELLS THAT SERVES AS A RECEPTOR FOR ATTRACTANTS CALLED CHEMOKINES. CHEMOKINES ARE THE KEY ORCHESTRATORS  OF LEUKOCYTE TRAFFICKING BY ATTRACTING IMMUNE CELLS TO THE SITES OF INFLAMMATION.  AT THE SITE OF AN INFLAMMATORY REACTION, CHEMOKINES ARE  RELEASED. THESE CHEMOKINES ARE SPECIFIC FOR CCR5 AND CAUSE THE MIGRATION OF  T-CELLS  TO THESE SITES PROMOTING FURTHER INFLAMMATION. WE BELIEVE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF LERONLIMAB HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BLOCK  THE MOVEMENT OF  T-CELLS  TO INFLAMMATORY SITES, WHICH COULD BE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIMINISHING OR ELIMINATING INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES. CCR5 IS ALSO EXPRESSED ON THE SURFACE OF EPITHELIAL CELLS IN CERTAIN CANCERS.  SOME DISEASE PROCESSES THAT WE BELIEVE COULD BENEFIT FROM CCR5 BLOCKADE INCLUDE MANY TYPES OF COMMON CANCERS, GVHD (A REACTION OCCURRING IN SOME PATIENTS AFTER BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION), AUTOIMMUNITY AND CHRONIC INFLAMMATION, SUCH AS RHEUMATOID  ARTHRITIS AND PSORIASIS. RECENT PUBLISHED DATA BY RICHARD G. PESTELL, M.D., PH.D., OUR CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER, HAS SHOWN THAT THE CANCER CELLS WITHIN THE TUMOR CONSIST OF TWO TYPES OF  CELLS-ONE  WITH CCR5 AND  OTHERS WITHOUT THEM. THE PUBLISHED DATA CLEARLY INDICATED THAT CANCER CELLS THAT CAN METASTASIZE  EXPRESS CCR5. METASTASES ARE THE CAUSE OF DEATH IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CANCER PATIENTS. MOREOVER,  DR. PESTELL\u2019S PRIOR PUBLICATION INDICATES THAT CCR5 ANTAGONISTS CAN TURN OFF CERTAIN CALCIUM SIGNALING AND REDUCE THE MIGRATION OF CCR5 POSITIVE CANCER CELLS. INHIBITION OF CCR5 SIGNALING BLOCKS THE GUIDED MIGRATION AND REDUCES THE  METASTASIS. LERONLIMAB HAS DEMONSTRATED (IN AN  IN-VITRO  STUDY) THAT IT ALSO TURNS OFF CALCIUM SIGNALING AND BLOCKS BREAST CANCER CELLULAR INVASION. FURTHERMORE, PUBLISHED STUDIES SHOWED CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY  INDUCES CCR5, AND CCR5 ANTAGONISTS ENHANCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPIES, POTENTIALLY ALLOWING A REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY, WHICH MAY PROVIDE AN IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS.  DR. PESTELL\u2019S RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THREE KEY PROPERTIES OF THE CCR5\u2019S MECHANISM OF ACTION (MOA). THE FIRST IS THAT THE  CCR5 RECEPTOR ON CANCER CELLS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE MIGRATION AND INVASION OF CELLS INTO THE BLOOD STREAM, WHICH LEADS TO METASTASIS OF BREAST, PROSTATE, AND COLON CANCER. THE SECOND IS THAT BLOCKING THE CCR5 ALSO TURNS ON ANTI-TUMOR FIGHTING  PROPERTIES RESTORING IMMUNE FUNCTION. THE THIRD KEY FINDING WAS THAT BLOCKAGE OF THE CCR5/CCL5 INTERACTION HAD A SYNERGISTIC EFFECT WITH CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC THERAPY AND CONTROLLED CANCER PROGRESSION. CHEMOTHERAPY TRADITIONALLY INCREASED EXPRESSION OF  CCR5 SO BLOCKING IT IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF INVASION AND METASTASIS.  DUE TO ITS MECHANISM OF ACTION, WE BELIEVE LERONLIMAB  HAS SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER CCR5 ANTAGONISTS. PRIOR STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT LERONLIMAB DOES NOT CAUSE DIRECT ACTIVATION OF  T-CELLS.  WE HAVE ALREADY REPORTED ENCOURAGING HUMAN SAFETY DATA FOR  OUR CLINICAL TRIALS WITH LERONLIMAB IN  HIV-INFECTED  PATIENTS.  WE ALSO PREVIOUSLY INITIATED OUR  FIRST CLINICAL TRIAL WITH LERONLIMAB IN AN IMMUNOLOGICAL INDICATION \u2013 A PHASE 2 CLINICAL TRIAL WITH LERONLIMAB FOR GVHD IN PATIENTS WITH AML OR MDS WHO ARE UNDERGOING BONE MARROW STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION. AS NOTED BELOW, ENROLLMENT UNDER THE  AMENDED PROTOCOL FOR THE GVHD TRIAL HAS BEEN DELAYED SUBJECT TO INCREASED CAPITAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INTEND TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH CERTAIN PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES, INCLUDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF  FOLLOW-ON  TECHNOLOGIES INVOLVING THE USE OF LERONLIMAB ALONGSIDE THEIR EXISTING PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY  WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO COMPLETE THE FOREGOING CLINICAL TRIALS FOR HIV AND COMPLETE ITS BLA SUBMISSION, AS WELL AS TO ADVANCE ITS TRIALS FOR GVHD AND CERTAIN CANCER INDICATIONS. SEE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES\u201d BELOW.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PHASE 1B/2 TRIAL FOR TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER  WE RECENTLY RECEIVED CLEARANCE FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (THE \u201cFDA\u201d) FOR OUR IND SUBMISSION TO INITIATE A PHASE 1B/2  CLINICAL TRIAL FOR METASTATIC TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED FIVE CLINICAL TRIAL SITES AND INTEND TO DOSE ITS FIRST SEVERAL PATIENTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF CALENDAR 2019. THE CHANGE IN CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS (CTCS)  NUMBER WILL BE EVALUATED EVERY 21 DAYS DURING TREATMENT AND WILL BE USED AS AN INITIAL PROGNOSTIC MARKER FOR EFFICACY. UP TO 48 PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY.  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES FOR MULTIPLE CANCER INDICATIONS  THE COMPANY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS INITIATING EIGHT  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES WITH LERONLIMAB FOR  MELANOMA, PANCREATIC, BREAST, PROSTATE COLON, LUNG, LIVER AND STOMACH CANCERS. AN ONGOING  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE COMPANY RECENTLY REPORTED THAT LERONLIMAB REDUCES BY MORE THAN 98% HUMAN BREAST  CANCER METASTASIS IN A MURINE XENOGRAFT MODEL. BASED UPON THESE STRONG RESULTS, THE COMPANY FILED FOR ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR ITS PHASE 1B/2 TRIPLE NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER TRIAL.  PHASE 2 TRIAL FOR GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE  THIS PHASE  2 MULTI-CENTER100-DAY  STUDY WITH 60 PATIENTS IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF  THE USE OF LERONLIMAB AS  AN ADD-ON THERAPY  TO STANDARD GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE (\u201cGVHD\u201d) PROPHYLAXIS TREATMENT FOR PREVENTION OF ACUTE GVHD IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA  (\u201cAML\u201d) OR MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME (\u201cMDS\u201d) UNDERGOING ALLOGENEIC HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (\u201cHST\u201d). ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT WAS ANNOUNCED IN MAY OF 2017. ON OCTOBER 5, 2017, THE COMPANY  ANNOUNCED THAT THE FDA HAD GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION TO LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) FOR THE PREVENTION OF GVHD. IN MARCH 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE (\u201cIDMC\u201d) FOR LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) PHASE 2 TRIAL  IN GVHD HAD COMPLETED A PLANNED INTERIM ANALYSIS OF TRIAL DATA ON THE FIRST 10 PATIENTS ENROLLED. FOLLOWING THIS REVIEW OF DATA FROM THE FIRST 10 PATIENTS IN THE PHASE 2 TRIAL, THE COMPANY FILED AMENDMENTS TO THE PROTOCOL WITH THE FDA. THE  AMENDMENTS INCLUDED SWITCHING THE PRETREATMENT CONDITIONING REGIMEN FROM AGGRESSIVE MYELOABLATIVE (\u201cMA\u201d) CONDITIONING TO A REDUCED INTENSITY CONDITIONING (\u201cRIC\u201d), AND SWITCHING FROM A  BLINDED ONE-FOR-ONE RANDOMIZED  PLACEBO-CONTROLLED DESIGN TO AN OPEN-LABEL DESIGN UNDER WHICH ALL ENROLLEES RECEIVE LERONLIMAB. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO PROVIDE FOR A 100% INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF  LERONLIMAB, TO 700 MG, TO MORE CLOSELY MIMIC PRECLINICAL DOSING. THE NEXT REVIEW OF DATA BY THE IDMC WILL OCCUR FOLLOWING ENROLLMENT OF 10 PATIENTS UNDER THE AMENDED PROTOCOL AFTER EACH PATIENT HAS BEEN DOSED FOR 30 DAYS. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE  COST OF THIS TRIAL TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.5 TO $4 MILLION. DUE TO THE NECESSARY PRIORITIZATION OF LIMITED CAPITAL, ENROLLMENT UNDER THE AMENDED PROTOCOL HAS BEEN DELAYED.  LICENSING OPPORTUNITIES  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN OUR NOVEMBER 2018 ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE, LLC  (\u201cPROSTAGENE\u201d), INCLUDING POTENTIAL LICENSING OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO MONETIZE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ASSETS RELATING TO PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSTICS. AS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE, WE ACQUIRED A PROPRIETARY  TECHNOLOGY THAT DEMONSTRATED IN A RETROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL ASSESSING PATIENTS FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS THAT ITS PROSTATE CANCER PROGNOSTIC TEST (\u201cPCA TEST\u201d) PROVIDES SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIVE DISCRIMINATIVE VALUE FOR PREDICTING OUTCOMES OF  PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER COMPARED TO THE INTERMEDIATE GLEASON SCORE, THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS. THE CLINICAL OBJECTIVE IS TO MORE PRECISELY GUIDE THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS FOR MEN THEREBY AVOIDING UNNECESSARY  SURGERY (PROSTATECTOMY) AND RADIATION AND/OR CHEMOTHERAPY WITH ITS ATTENDANT SIDE EFFECTS.  IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO CONDUCT  EXPLORATORY DISCUSSIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES WHO HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST IN A LICENSING ARRANGEMENT FOR LERONLIMAB FOR HIV INDICATIONS; SUCH PROPOSED ARRANGEMENTS ARE COUNTRY OR REGION SPECIFIC.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD NO ACTIVITIES THAT PRODUCED REVENUES FROM  OPERATIONS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $12.6 MILLION, AS  COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $18.0 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.3 MILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO REDUCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION  AND A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 MILLION, COUPLED WITH A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT IN THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION. THESE FAVORABLE TRENDS WERE  OFFSET IN PART BY AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION. THE LOSS PER SHARE FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND  FEBRUARY 28, 2018 WAS $(0.04) AND $(0.10), WHICH REFLECTS A COMPARATIVELY LOWER NET LOSS COMBINED WITH A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, OPERATING EXPENSES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION AND  $14.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND AMORTIZATION AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEPRECIATION. THE REDUCTION IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION, OR 8.9%, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCTIONS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.1 MILLION, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $3.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WERE COMPRISED OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS,  NON-CASH  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE AND VARIOUS OTHER EXPENSES.  THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION, OR 69%, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WAS DUE TO INCREASED SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR NEW EMPLOYEES, AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  FOR ACCELERATION OF VESTING AND STOCK AWARDS RELATED TO AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, COUPLED WITH INCREASES IN OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. . THE INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION, OR 465% WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN  INTANGIBLES RECOGNIZED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PROSTAGENE.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED  APPROXIMATELY $9.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, DECREASED APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION, OR 25.3%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018 QUARTER PRINCIPALLY DUE TO NEAR COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED EXPENSES IN  CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR BLA FILING. FOR THE QUARTER ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, R&D EXPENDITURES CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO: (1) INCREASED CMC (CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS) ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS  REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BLA FILING AND LERONLIMAB, (2) OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE PHASE 2B/3 MONOTHERAPY TRIAL, AND (3) CONTINUING ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE BLA  FILING WITH THE FDA.  WE EXPECT R&D EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS TO LEVEL OFF MODESTLY TO REFLECT COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES  IN CONNECTION WITH THE CMC PORTION OF OUR BLA FILING IN  MID-2019,  FOLLOWED BY A POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ADVANCEMENT IN CLINICAL PRIORITIES FOR A PIVOTAL MONOTHERAPY TRIAL AND EVALUATION OF SEVERAL CANCER  INDICATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. ANY ACCELERATION IN CLINICAL ACTIVITIES WOULD INCREASE R&D EXPENSES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT  ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO A  NON-CASH  CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.7 IN THE SIMILAR 2018 QUARTER. THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 ALSO INCLUDES TWO INCREMENTAL DERIVATIVES RELATING TO NEWLY ISSUED LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THAT REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION AND ARE NOT COMPARABLE  TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018. THE WARRANTS THAT CONTAIN A PROVISION WHICH GIVES RISE TO A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY ORIGINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE TWO LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION FOR REDEMPTION AT A VARIABLE PRICE AND ORIGINATED IN  JUNE 2018 AND JANUARY 2019. FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND RECORD A CORRESPONDING  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OR  NON-CASH  CHARGE, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A DECREASE OR INCREASE, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CALCULATED DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.1 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR QUARTER IN 2018. THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDE INDUCEMENT INTEREST RELATED TO CONVERTIBLE  DEBT, ACCRUED INTEREST ON CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND OFFERING COSTS.  THE FUTURE TRENDS IN ALL  EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE OUTCOMES OF  PRE-CLINICAL  STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AS WELL AS GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL. SEE IN PARTICULAR, \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL  RESOURCES\u201d BELOW AND ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR  THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2018 AND IN OUR FORM  10-Q  FOR THE  QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 1A.  RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 2018 ARE AS FOLLOWS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28,  2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, THE COMPANY HAD NO ACTIVITIES THAT PRODUCED REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $41.3 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $40.5 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION OVER THE 2018 NINE-MONTH  PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A $7.3 MILLION INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, OFFSET IN PART BY AN APPROXIMATE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF $2.6 MILLION, RECOGNITION OF A $2.8 MILLION DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFIT AND  COMPARATIVE INCREASE IN A  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OF THE CHANGE IN DERIVATIVE LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $7.3 MILLION OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018  PERIOD, DUE TO INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION, INCREASED R&D EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION. THE CREDIT FOR TAXES ON  INCOME AROSE FROM THE RECOGNITION OF A DEFERRED INCOME TAX BENEFIT FROM A REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM RECORDING A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE  ACQUISITION OF ASSETS IN THE PROSTAGENE LLC  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTION. THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY REPRESENTS THE TAX EFFECT OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND THEIR TAX BASIS AT ACQUISITION. THE LOSS PER SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018 WAS $(0.16) AND $(0.25), RESPECTIVELY, WITH THE REDUCTION IN LOSS PER SHARE (DESPITE A SMALL INCREASE IN AGGREGATE NET LOSS) CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING  FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2018, OPERATING EXPENSES TOTALED  APPROXIMATELY $42.0 MILLION AND $34.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTING OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY  $7.3 MILLION, OR 21.7%, WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASES IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $8.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WERE COMPRISED OF SALARIES AND  BENEFITS, NON-CASH STOCK-BASED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE, PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE AND VARIOUS OTHER EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION, OR 55.3%, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN  NON-CASH  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH COMMON STOCK ISSUED RELATED TO AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AWARDS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d) EXPENSES, WHICH TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $33.3 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION, OR 13.6%, OVER THE COMPARABLE 2018 PERIOD PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF PRODUCT MANUFACTURING RELATED TO OUR BLA FILING, AND CONTINUING CLINICAL TRIAL ELATED EXPENSES. FOR THE  NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, R&D EXPENDITURES CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY DEVOTED TO: (1) INCREASED CMC (CHEMISTRY, MANUFACTURING AND CONTROLS) ACTIVITIES TO SATISFY REGULATORY COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR BLA FILING,  (2) OUR PIVOTAL PHASE 2B/3 COMBINATION THERAPY TRIAL AND OUR INVESTIGATIVE PHASE 2B/3 MONOTHERAPY TRIAL, AND (3) CONTINUING ACTIVITIES NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE BLA FILING WITH THE FDA.  WE EXPECT R&D EXPENSES IN FUTURE PERIODS TO LEVEL OFF MODESTLY TO REFLECT COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH BLA  FILING  MID-2019  FOLLOWED BY A POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ADVANCEMENT IN CLINICAL PRIORITIES FOR A PIVOTAL MONOTHERAPY TRIAL AND EVALUATION OF SEVERAL CANCER INDICATIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY  OF SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. ANY ACCELERATION IN CLINICAL ACTIVITIES WOULD INCREASE R&D EXPENSES.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED  A NON-CASH BENEFIT  ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO  A NON-CASH CHARGE  OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 IN THE SIMILAR 2018 PERIOD. THE WARRANTS THAT CONTAIN A PROVISION WHICH GIVES RISE TO A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY ORIGINATED IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE TWO LONG-TERM  CONVERTIBLE NOTES CONTAIN A PROVISION FOR REDEMPTION AT A VARIABLE PRICE AND ORIGINATED IN JUNE 2018 AND JANUARY 2019. FOR EACH REPORTING PERIOD, WE DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND RECORD A CORRESPONDING  NON-CASH  BENEFIT OR  NON-CASH  CHARGE, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A DECREASE OR INCREASE, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE CALCULATED DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $5.5 MILLION FOR THE SIMILAR PERIOD IN 2018. THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCLUDE A LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF A LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE, ACCRUED INTEREST ON A CONVERTIBLE NOTE, INDUCEMENT INTEREST RELATED TO WARRANT EXERCISE AND  CONVERTIBLE DEBT, ALONG WITH THE AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND DEBT ISSUANCE. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2018, AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY AMENDED ONE LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTE TO INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS THE HOLDER TO  RECEIVE THE REDEMPTION AMOUNT AT THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTION (A) IN CASH OR (B) BY CONVERTING THE REDEMPTION AMOUNT INTO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE AMENDMENT CAUSED THE EMBEDDED REDEMPTION PROVISION TO REQUIRE BIFURCATION AS A LIABILITY  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 815 (ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815). IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT ALSO CONSIDERED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE AMENDMENT UNDER THE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASC 470, DEBT (TOPIC 470), AND DETERMINED  THAT THE AMENDMENT WAS SUBSTANTIVE AND EXTINGUISHMENT ACCOUNTING APPLIED. ACCORDINGLY, THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL DEBT ON THE MODIFICATION DATE IS DERECOGNIZED AND THE NEW DEBT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE DIFFERENCE WAS RECORDED AS AN  EXTINGUISHMENT LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION.  THE FUTURE TRENDS IN ALL EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE  OUTCOMES OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, AS WELL AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE COMPANY REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND  OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH CAPITAL. SEE IN PARTICULAR, \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d BELOW AND ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR  THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2018 AND IN OUR FORM  10-Q  FOR THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cRISK  FACTORS\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 1A.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH POSITION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION, AS  COMPARED TO A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2018. THE NET INCREASE IN CASH FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY  $41.3 MILLION, OFFSET IN PART BY CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.0 MILLION.  AS OF FEBRUARY 28,  2019, THE COMPANY HAD SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $17.8 MILLION COMPARED TO NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $13.4 MILLION AT MAY 31, 2018, AN INCREASE IN NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $4.4 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO CASH USED IN OPERATIONS.  CASH FLOWS  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $41.0 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WHICH  REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OVER THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET LOSS OF  APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION, INCREASED STOCK BASED COMPENSATION OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION, A  NON-CASH  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION, DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.2 MILLION DUE TO CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES, INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION, MITIGATED IN PART BY A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION, AND A REDUCTION IN  INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.9 MILLION AND  NON-CASH  DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS IMMATERIAL DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AND THERE WAS NO ACTIVITY DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $41.3 MILLION DURING THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $15.2 MILLION OVER THE $26.1 MILLION OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NET PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS OF APPROXIMATELY $26.4 MILLION, COUPLED WITH APPROXIMATELY $14.9 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS FROM CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE.  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  WE HAVE NOT GENERATED REVENUE TO DATE, AND WILL NOT GENERATE PRODUCT REVENUE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH REVENUES ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE  REALIZED FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BLA. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES AS EXPENSES CONTINUE AS WE PROCEED WITH CLINICAL TRIALS WITH RESPECT TO LERONLIMAB AND CONTINUE TO ADVANCE IT THROUGH THE REGULATORY  PROCESS TOWARDS ULTIMATE APPROVAL, CONCURRENT WITH EVALUATING MULTIPLE CANCER INDICATIONS. THE FUTURE TRENDS OF ALL EXPENSES WILL BE DRIVEN, IN LARGE PART, BY THE FUTURE OUTCOMES OF THE CLINICAL TRIALS AND THEIR CORRELATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL AND  ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ALONG WITH THE INCREASING ACTIVITIES TO COMPLETE THE REMAINING TWO PORTIONS OF OUR BLA FILING FOR LERONLIMAB AS A COMBINATION THERAPY AND WILL REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE TO COMPLETE  THESE ENDEAVORS.  CONTRACT MANUFACTURING  SUBSEQUENT TO QUARTER END, ON APRIL 1, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT AND PRODUCT SPECIFIC AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG  BIOLOGICS CO., LTD. (\u201cSAMSUNG\u201d), PURSUANT TO WHICH SAMSUNG WILL PERFORM TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, PROCESS VALIDATION, MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY SERVICES FOR THE COMMERCIAL SUPPLY OF LERONLIMAB. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WE ARE OBLIGATED  TO MAKE SPECIFIED MINIMUM PURCHASES OF LERONLIMAB FROM SAMSUNG PURSUANT TO OUR FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS. THE FIRST FORECAST WILL BE DELIVERED TO SAMSUNG BY MARCH 31, 2020. WE MUST PROVIDE SAMSUNG WITH A ROLLING FORECAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS  SETTING FORTH THE TOTAL QUANTITY THAT IT EXPECTS TO REQUIRE IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS. WE ESTIMATE THAT INITIAL  RAMP-UP  COSTS TO MANUFACTURE COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AT SCALE COULD AGGREGATE APPROXIMATELY  $60 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION PAYABLE OVER THE COURSE OF CALENDAR 2020 AND APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION MORE PAYABLE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2021. THEREAFTER, WE WILL PAY SAMSUNG PER 15,000L BATCH ACCORDING TO THE PRICING  TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT.  THE AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG HAS AN INITIAL TERM ENDING IN DECEMBER 2027 AND SHALL BE AUTOMATICALLY  EXTENDED FOR ADDITIONAL TWO YEAR PERIODS UNLESS EITHER PARTY GIVES NOTICE OF TERMINATION AT LEAST SIX MONTHS PRIOR TO THE THEN CURRENT TERM. EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF THE OTHER PARTY\u2019S INSOLVENCY OR UNCURED  MATERIAL BREACH, AND WE MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IN THE EVENT OF A VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY COMPLETE MARKET WITHDRAWAL OF LERONLIMAB FROM COMMERCIAL MARKETS, WITH ONE AND HALF YEAR\u2019S PRIOR NOTICE. NEITHER PARTY MAY ASSIGN THE AGREEMENT  WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE OTHER, EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF A PARTY TO WHICH THE AGREEMENT RELATES.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN ADDITION TO OUR MANUFACTURING AGREEMENT WITH SAMSUNG, WE ALSO HAVE PREVIOUSLY ENTERED  INTO AN ARRANGEMENT WITH ANOTHER THIRD PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURER TO PROVIDE PROCESS TRANSFER, VALIDATION AND MANUFACTURING SERVICES FOR LERONLIMAB. IN THE EVENT THAT WE TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT WITH THIS MANUFACTURER, WE MAY INCUR CERTAIN FINANCIAL  PENALTIES WHICH WOULD BECOME PAYABLE TO THE MANUFACTURER. CONDITIONED ON THE TIMING OF TERMINATION, THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE UP TO AN APPROXIMATE HIGH OF $0.3 MILLION. THESE UNDERTAKINGS ARE ANTICIPATED TO REQUIRE APPROXIMATELY  $5 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OVER THE NEXT  S  EVERAL FISCAL QUARTERS, INCLUDING THE ESTIMATED COSTS TO FILL, LABEL, AND PACKAGE PRODUCT INTO THE FINAL COMMERCIAL PACKAGE FOR COMMERCIAL SALE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT TWO CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS MAY BEST SERVE OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES FOR THE ANTICIPATED BLA FILING AND, IF APPROVED,  THE LONG-TERM COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES FOR LERONLIMAB. MANAGEMENT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS MANUFACTURING CAPACITY REQUIREMENTS AS NEW MARKET INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE REGARDING ANTICIPATED DEMAND, SUBJECT TO FDA APPROVAL.  CONTRACT RESEARCH  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO  PROJECT WORK ORDERS FOR EACH OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS WITH OUR CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATION (\u201cCRO\u201d) AND RELATED LABORATORY VENDORS. UNDER THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS, WE HAVE PREPAID CERTAIN EXECUTION FEES FOR DIRECT SERVICES COSTS. IN  CONNECTION WITH OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE PROJECT WORK ORDERS FOR EACH TRIAL WITH OUR CRO. IN THE EVENT THAT WE TERMINATE ANY TRIAL, WE MAY INCUR CERTAIN FINANCIAL PENALTIES WHICH WOULD BECOME PAYABLE TO THE CRO. CONDITIONED  UPON THE FORM OF TERMINATION OF ANY ONE TRIAL, THE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE UP TO $0.3 MILLION. IN THE REMOTE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WE TERMINATE ALL CLINICAL TRIALS, THE COLLECTIVE FINANCIAL PENALTIES MAY RANGE FROM AN APPROXIMATE LOW OF  $0.5 MILLION TO AN APPROXIMATE HIGH OF $1.2 MILLION.  LICENSING  UNDER THE PROGENICS PURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY PROGENICS THE FOLLOWING ONGOING MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES.  (I) $5.0 MILLION AT THE TIME OF THE FIRST U.S. NEW DRUG APPLICATION APPROVAL BY THE FDA OR  OTHER NON-U.S. APPROVAL  FOR THE SALE OF LERONLIMAB (PRO 140); AND (II) ROYALTY PAYMENTS OF UP  TO FIVE PERCENT (5%) ON NET SALES DURING THE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE OF THE FIRST COMMERCIAL SALE OF LERONLIMAB (PRO 140) UNTIL THE LATER OF (A) THE EXPIRATION OF THE LAST TO EXPIRE PATENT INCLUDED IN THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, AND (B) 10  YEARS, IN EACH CASE DETERMINED ON  A COUNTRY-BY COUNTRY  BASIS.

WE CURRENTLY REQUIRE AND  WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATIONS, PAY OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLES, AND OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, COMMERCIALIZE OUR  PRODUCT AND ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RAISE SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON A TIMELY BASIS OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, WE MAY NEED TO SCALE BACK OUR OPERATIONS OR SLOW DOWN OR CEASE CERTAIN CLINICAL TRIALS OR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, WHICH  COULD MATERIALLY DELAY THE TIMEFRAME TO BLA SUBMISSION. OUR FAILURE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL COULD ALSO AFFECT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY VENDORS, DISRUPTING OUR ABILITY TO TIMELY EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. IN EXTREME CASES, WE COULD BE FORCED TO  FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, DISCONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS OR LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS.  SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR ACTIVITIES  PRINCIPALLY FROM THE SALE OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY SECURITIES AND PROCEEDS FROM CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND RELATED PARTY NOTES PAYABLE. WE INTEND TO FINANCE OUR FUTURE OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS LARGELY FROM THE SALE  OF EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, COMBINED WITH ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM OTHER TRADITIONAL FINANCING SOURCES.

IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK, CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING, THESE ACTIVITIES OR OTHER DEBT  COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS COULD REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED NEEDS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, IF  AVAILABLE, MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON REASONABLE  OR NON-DILUTIVE TERMS.  PLEASE REFER TO THE MATTERS DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d ABOVE.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY RESEARCHES, DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, SELLS, AND DISTRIBUTES FURNISHINGS AND ACCESSORIES, FOR USE IN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDING OFFICE, HEALTHCARE, EDUCATIONAL, AND RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS, AND PROVIDES RELATED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS AS WELL AS THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OWNED CONTRACT OFFICE FURNITURE DEALERS, DIRECT CUSTOMER SALES, INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, OWNED RETAIL STUDIOS, DIRECT-MAIL CATALOGS AND THE COMPANY'S E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  .  \u2022  NET SALES WERE  $619.0 MILLION  AND ORDERS WERE  $610.7 MILLION  , REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  7.0%  AND  8.4%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG PERFORMANCE WITHIN THE ELA AND CONSUMER SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS A RECLASSIFICATION RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD (ASC 606). ON AN ORGANIC BASIS, NET SALES WERE  $624.4 MILLION  (*)  AND ORDERS WERE  $615.1 MILLION  , REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF  6.3%  (*)  AND  7.6%  , RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN WAS  35.7%  AS COMPARED TO  35.6%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  EXCLUDING THE RECLASSIFICATION IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC 606, GROSS MARGIN IMPROVED BY 70-BASIS POINTS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  \u2022  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $6.1 MILLION  OR  3.7%  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED SPECIAL CHARGES, TOTALING  $0.5 MILLION  , RELATED MAINLY TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CEO TRANSITION AND EXTERNAL CONSULTING FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S PROFIT ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF  $0.3 MILLION  RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN FACILITIES IN CHINA AND THE UNITED KINGDOM THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  \u2022  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  16.0%  COMPARED TO  19.0%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE RATE IN THE CURRENT QUARTER INCLUDED THE FINAL ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  \u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED  $0.17  TO $0.66  , A 35% INCREASE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE FOLLOWING SUMMARY INCLUDES THE COMPANY'S VIEW ON THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH IT OPERATES.  \u2022  NORTH AMERICA REMAINS GENERALLY CONDUCIVE TO CONTINUED GROWTH DUE TO RECENT POSITIVE INDUSTRY ORDER TRENDS AS REPORTED BY BIFMA,  GDP GROWTH, SERVICE SECTOR EMPLOYMENT AND ARCHITECTURAL BILLINGS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS MONITORING THE RESOLUTION OF TRADE POLICY NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND KEY TRADING PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS CONCERNING THE U.K. REFERENDUM TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION.  \u2022  THE COMPANY IS ALSO CLOSELY MONITORING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF GLOBAL TARIFFS. THE RECENT SECOND DEFERRAL OF THE POTENTIAL 25% TARIFF RATE ON GOODS IMPORTED BY THE COMPANY AND ITS SUPPLIERS FROM CHINA APPEAR TO HAVE REDUCED NEAR-TERM TARIFF PRESSURES.  \u2022  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT ITS PROFIT OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVES AND JANUARY 2019 PRICE INCREASE WILL FULLY OFFSET THE CURRENT LEVEL OF TARIFFS IMPOSED ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA. FURTHER CONTINGENCY PLANS IN THE AREA OF STRATEGIC SOURCING ARE BEING EVALUATED SHOULD THE TARIFF SITUATION INTENSIFY.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  INCREASED  $40.6 MILLION  OR  7.0%  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2018  . THE FOLLOWING ITEMS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CHANGE.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE ELA SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY BROAD-BASED GROWTH ACROSS THE ASIA PACIFIC, LATIN AMERICA, MIDDLE EAST AND MAINLAND EUROPE REGIONS.  \u2022  ADOPTION OF  ASC 606 - REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019 LED TO THE  RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRICING ELEMENTS FROM NET SALES TO COST OF SALES  , WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF $9.3 MILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR IN WHICH REVENUE WAS RECORDED UNDER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING RULES.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE CONSUMER SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH ACROSS THE DWR CONTRACT AND E-COMMERCE CHANNELS, AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION OF HAY PRODUCTS.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH WITHIN THE HERMAN MILLER COLLECTION, MAHARAM AND NEMSCHOFF BUSINESSES.  \u2022  INCREMENTAL LIST PRICE INCREASES, NET OF DEEPER CONTRACT PRICE DISCOUNTING, OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION.  \u2022  LOWER SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE NORTH AMERICAN SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION DUE PARTIALLY TO IMPACTS RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  \u2022  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION.  (*) NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS; SEE ACCOMPANYING RECONCILIATIONS AND EXPLANATIONS.  31  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  INCREASED  $133.0 MILLION  OR  7.5%  IN THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2018  . THE FOLLOWING ITEMS LED TO THE CHANGE.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE ELA SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY BROAD-BASED GROWTH ACROSS ALL REGIONS.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE NORTH AMERICAN SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND.  \u2022  ADOPTION OF  ASC 606 - REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019 LED TO THE  RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN PRICING ELEMENTS FROM NET SALES TO COST OF SALES  , WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF $28.9 MILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR IN WHICH REVENUE WAS RECORDED UNDER PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING RULES.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE CONSUMER SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE INTRODUCTION OF HAY PRODUCTS AND  GROWTH ACROSS THE DWR STUDIO, E-COMMERCE, AND CONTRACT CHANNELS.  \u2022  INCREASED SALES VOLUMES WITHIN THE SPECIALTY SEGMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH WITHIN THE  HERMAN MILLER COLLECTION, MAHARAM AND NEMSCHOFF BUSINESSES.  \u2022  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION.  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN WAS  35.7%  FOR THE  THREE MONTH PERIOD  ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  35.6%  FOR THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SUMMARIZE THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.  \u2022  PROFIT OPTIMIZATION INITIATIVES INCREASED GROSS MARGIN BY APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS AS COMPARED TO LAST FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  LOWER MATERIAL COSTS WITHIN THE NORTH AMERICAN SEGMENT, DUE PRIMARILY TO REDUCED OUTSOURCING, AND THE ELA SEGMENT, DUE PRIMARILY TO CHANNEL MIX, INCREASED GROSS MARGIN BY APPROXIMATELY 50 BASIS POINTS AS COMPARED TO LAST FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD (ASC 606) AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED GROSS MARGIN BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS. THIS ADOPTION REQUIRES RECORDING CERTAIN PRODUCT PRICING ELEMENTS AS EXPENSES WITHIN COST OF GOODS SOLD THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED ON A NET BASIS WITHIN SALES.

DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  , NET OTHER EXPENSE WAS  $7.8 MILLION  ,  A DECREASE  OF  $1.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

INCOME TAXES  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE UNITED STATES.

THE YEAR OVER YEAR DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  WAS THE RESULT OF THE ACT. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  AND  MARCH 3, 2018  IS LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE DUE TO THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN TAXING JURISDICTIONS THAT HAD RATES THAT WERE LOWER THAN THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, ALONG WITH THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT UNDER THE PROTECTING AMERICANS FROM TAX HIKES (\"PATH\") ACT OF 2015.

CERTAIN MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS IN A SUBSIDIARY HAVE THE RIGHT, AT CERTAIN TIMES, TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A PORTION OF THEIR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THOSE ENTITIES AT FAIR VALUE. DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 2, 2019  , THE COMPANY PURCHASED  $10.1 MILLION  OF MINORITY OWNERSHIP SHARES AS COMPARED TO  $1.0 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE THE MAJORITY OF THE BALANCE OF THEIR OWNERSHIP INTEREST.

(\u201cGSM\u201d) AND PLASTIC PALLET PRODUCTION, INC. (\u201cPPP\u201d). GREYSTONE ALSO CONSOLIDATES ITS VARIABLE INTEREST  ENTITY, GREYSTONE REAL ESTATE, L.L.C. (\u201cGRE\u201d). ALL MATERIAL INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.  REFERENCES  TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 REFER TO THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. REFERENCES TO FISCAL YEAR 2018 REFER TO  THE NINE MONTHS AND THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  SALES  GREYSTONE\u2019S  PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY PLASTIC PALLETS TO ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO BROADEN  ITS CUSTOMER BASE. GREYSTONE\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS. GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING IS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONTRACT DISTRIBUTORS, ITS PRESIDENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.  PERSONNEL  GREYSTONE  HAD APPROXIMATELY 220 AND 197 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  NINE  MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $50,163,707 COMPARED TO $32,073,828 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $18,089,879. THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES GROWTH WITH A PALLET LEASING COMPANY, ONE OF GREYSTONE\u2019S  MAJOR CUSTOMERS.  GREYSTONE  HAS THREE MAJOR CUSTOMERS WHO ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 85% AND 76% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. PALLET  SALES TO GREYSTONE\u2019S MAJOR CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 NEEDS WHICH MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  GREYSTONE IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH  THE ADDITION OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $44,257,438, OR 88% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $27,325,588, OR 85% OF SALES, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON PRODUCTION  AND MATERIAL COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. FACTORS AFFECTING  THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES INCLUDE: START-UP COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH; CERTAIN NEWER PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE;  AND GREYSTONE\u2019S REQUIREMENT FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN HAS EXCEEDED ITS CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING MATERIAL RESULTING  IN PURCHASES OF GROUND AND PELLETIZED MATERIAL AT A HIGHER COST THAN IN-HOUSE PROCESSED MATERIAL.  14  MACHINERY  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING PLASTIC RESIN WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE THIRD  QUARTER OF FY2019, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO APRIL 2019. ADDITIONALLY, MACHINERY TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN PRODUCTION LINES WHICH  WILL IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION LABOR AS WELL AS REDUCE LABOR COSTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED BY MAY 31, 2019.  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $2,752,029, OR 5% OF SALES, IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $2,177,164, OR 7%  OF SALES, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $574,865, OR APPROXIMATELY 26%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL  YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $7,728 AND $5,867 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE SOURCE OF OTHER INCOME IS THE SALE OF SCRAP MATERIAL.  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $1,348,285 AND $997,944 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $350,341. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE  IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DEBT AND CAPITALIZED LEASES AND A 1.00% INCREASE  IN THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 28, 2018 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $520,400 AND $889,100 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. A CHANGE IN FEDERAL CORPORATE  TAX RATES ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 RESULTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX  RETURNS OF GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME OF THE ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $1,293,283 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $679,899 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED  ABOVE.  15  NET  INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  NET  INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $789,399, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, COMPARED TO $210,817, OR $0.01  PER SHARE, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  THREE  MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  SALES  SALES  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE $17,224,467 COMPARED TO $12,064,651 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $5,159,816. THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES GROWTH WITH THE PALLET LEASING COMPANY AND SALES  TO THE LATEST ADDITION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER.  SALES  TO GREYSTONE\u2019S THREE LARGEST CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 86% AND 80% OF SALES IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  GREYSTONE IS NOT ABLE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE NEEDS OF THESE MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND WILL CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO GROW SALES THROUGH  THE ADDITION OF NEW CUSTOMERS DEVELOPED THROUGH GREYSTONE\u2019S MARKETING EFFORTS.  COST  OF SALES  COST  OF SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $15,455,920, OR 90% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $10,349,347, OR 86% OF SALES, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME THAT GREYSTONE HAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAS HAD A DIRECT EFFECT ON PRODUCTION  COSTS RESULTING IN THE INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF COST OF SALES TO SALES FROM FISCAL YEAR 2018 TO 2019. FACTORS AFFECTING THE RATIO  OF COST OF SALES TO SALES INCLUDE: START-UP COSTS TO ACCOMMODATE THE GROWTH; CERTAIN NEWER PRODUCTS ARE MORE LABOR INTENSIVE;  AND GREYSTONE\u2019S REQUIREMENT FOR REFINED PLASTIC RESIN HAS EXCEEDED ITS CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING MATERIAL RESULTING  IN PURCHASES OF GROUND AND PELLETIZED MATERIAL AT A HIGHER COST THAN IN-HOUSE PROCESSED MATERIAL.  MACHINERY  TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CAPACITY FOR GRINDING AND PELLETIZING PLASTIC RESIN WAS ANTICIPATED ON BEING INSTALLED DURING THE THIRD  QUARTER OF FY2019, BUT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED TO ABOUT APRIL 2019. ADDITIONALLY, MACHINERY TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN PRODUCTION LINES  WHICH WILL IMPROVE WORKING CONDITIONS FOR PRODUCTION LABOR AS WELL AS REDUCE LABOR COSTS IS EXPECTED TO BE INSTALLED BY MAY 31,  2019.  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL,  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $959,288, OR 6% OF SALES, IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $724,748, OR 6% OF SALES, IN  FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $234,540 OR 32%. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER FISCAL YEAR 2018 RESULTS PRINCIPALLY  FROM INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSES)  OTHER  INCOME WAS $2,438 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $(6,202) IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  16  INTEREST  EXPENSE WAS $499,967 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $339,208 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR AN INCREASE OF $160,759. THE INCREASE IN  INTEREST EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 OVER 2018 IS DUE PRINCIPALLY TO INCREASES IN THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST, 5.5% AT FEBRUARY  28, 2019 COMPARED TO 4.5% AT FEBRUARY 28, 2018 AND INCREASES IN AMOUNT OF DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES.  PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES  THE  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES WAS $80,300 AND $639,600 IN FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. A CHANGE IN FEDERAL CORPORATE  TAX RATES ENACTED IN DECEMBER 2017 RESULTED IN AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE PROVISION  FOR INCOME TAXES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INCOME FROM THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AS THE ENTITY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX  RETURNS OF GREYSTONE AND THE TAXABLE INCOME FROM THIS ENTITY IS PASSED-THROUGH TO THE RESPECTIVE OWNERS.  BASED  UPON A REVIEW OF ITS INCOME TAX FILING POSITIONS, GREYSTONE BELIEVES THAT ITS POSITIONS WOULD BE SUSTAINED UPON AN AUDIT BY THE  INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT WOULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHANGE TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.  THEREFORE, NO RESERVES FOR UNCERTAIN INCOME TAX POSITIONS HAVE BEEN RECORDED.  NET  INCOME  GREYSTONE  RECORDED NET INCOME OF $231,430 IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO $5,546 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED  ABOVE.  NET  INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS  THE  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WAS $59,118, OR $0.00 PER SHARE, COMPARED A NET LOSS TO COMMON  STOCKHOLDERS OF $(152,554), OR $(0.01) PER SHARE, IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 PRIMARILY FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A  SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 IS AS FOLLOWS.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $4,961,761  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(5,412,322  )  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $1,165,824  17  THE  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF GREYSTONE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  TOTAL  LESS  THAN  1 YEAR  1-3 YEARS  4-5 YEARS  MORE  THAN  5 YEARS  LONG-TERM DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASES  $30,307,827  $4,909,286  $18,610,958  $6,787,583  $-0-  GREYSTONE  HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $(3,230,345) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019. TO PROVIDE FOR THE FUNDING TO MEET GREYSTONE\u2019S OPERATING  ACTIVITIES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, GREYSTONE WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO PRODUCE POSITIVE OPERATING  RESULTS OR EXPLORE VARIOUS OPTIONS INCLUDING ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT AND EQUITY FINANCING. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT  GREYSTONE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS OR BE ABLE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO MEET THESE OBLIGATIONS.  EFFECTIVE  AUGUST 10, 2018 AND DECEMBER 28, 2018, GREYSTONE AND IBC ENTERED INTO THE AMENDMENTS TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT DATED JANUARY 31,  2014 WHICH PROVIDED FOR NEW FUNDING IN THE FORM OF AN ADVANCING LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $3,600,000 TO PURCHASE PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT  AND INCREASING THE LINE OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING LOAN TO $4,000,000, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019,  PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $4.7 MILLION WAS ACQUIRED THROUGH A CAPITAL LEASING ARRANGEMENT.  SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF THE FINANCING THAT GREYSTONE HAS RECEIVED THROUGH THE LAST FEW FISCAL YEARS RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM BANK NOTES WHICH ARE  GUARANTEED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS OF GREYSTONE AND, FORMERLY, FROM LOANS PROVIDED BY CERTAIN OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS  OF GREYSTONE. GREYSTONE CONTINUES TO BE DEPENDENT UPON ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS TO PROVIDE AND/OR SECURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING  AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. AS SUCH, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT FUNDING  WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR GREYSTONE TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS.  GREYSTONE  HAS 50,000 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF CUMULATIVE 2003 PREFERRED STOCK WITH A LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF $5,000,000 AND A PREFERRED DIVIDEND  RATE OF THE PRIME RATE OF INTEREST PLUS 3.25%. GREYSTONE DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL MAKE CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO ANY HOLDERS  OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNLESS AND UNTIL THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF GREYSTONE IMPROVES THROUGH INCREASED REVENUES, ANOTHER FINANCING  TRANSACTION OR OTHERWISE. PURSUANT TO THE IBC LOAN AGREEMENT, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  GREYSTONE MAY PAY DIVIDENDS ON ITS PREFERRED STOCK IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $500,000 PER YEAR.

OVERVIEW  GENERAL  AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY DIVERSITY, THE COMPANY FACES A VARIETY OF OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES, INCLUDING RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT (PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO COMPUTING, AUTOMATION, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, MOBILE CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATIONS AND DIGITIZATION) IN MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SERVED MARKETS, THE EXPANSION AND EVOLUTION OF OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS, TRENDS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A GLOBAL LABOR FORCE, CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMPETITORS AND INCREASING REGULATION.  THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN MOST MARKETS, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY WILL DEPEND IN PARTICULAR ON ITS ABILITY TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS IN HIGH-GROWTH GEOGRAPHIES AND HIGH-GROWTH MARKET SEGMENTS, IDENTIFY, CONSUMMATE AND INTEGRATE APPROPRIATE ACQUISITIONS, DEVELOP INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGINS, EXPAND AND IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES FORCE, CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS AND IMPROVE OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY, AND EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF AN INCREASINGLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT.

WHILE DIFFERENCES EXIST AMONG THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESSES, ON AN OVERALL BASIS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  THIS DEMAND, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN SALES GROWTH INITIATIVES AND THE OTHER BUSINESS-SPECIFIC FACTORS DISCUSSED BELOW, CONTRIBUTED TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR CORE SALES GROWTH OF  5.5%  (FOR THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCORE SALES\u201d OR \u201cCORE REVENUE\u201d REFER TO \u201c\u2014RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d BELOW).  GEOGRAPHICALLY, BOTH HIGH-GROWTH AND DEVELOPED MARKETS CONTRIBUTED TO CORE SALES GROWTH DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS INCREASED AT A HIGH-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  LED PRIMARILY BY CONTINUED STRENGTH IN CHINA.  HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  29%  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  .  CORE REVENUES IN DEVELOPED MARKETS INCREASED AT A MID-SINGLE DIGIT RATE DURING THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  LED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND WESTERN EUROPE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS OVERALL YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES GROWTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  BUT REMAINS CAUTIOUS ABOUT CHALLENGES DUE TO MACRO-ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO TRADE, TARIFFS, MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICIES.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION DURING THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  AND  MARCH 30, 2018  , REFER TO NOTE  2  TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE TAX-RELATED CHARGES DISCUSSED BELOW IN \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 INCOME TAXES\u201d ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  DECREASE  IN NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019.  ACQUISITIONS AND PROPOSED DENTAL INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING  THE COMPANY\u2019S GROWTH STRATEGY CONTEMPLATES FUTURE ACQUISITIONS.  OPERATIONS AND RESULTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE RATE AND EXTENT TO WHICH APPROPRIATE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND SUCCESSFULLY CONSUMMATED, ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATED AND ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR COST SAVINGS ARE ACHIEVED.

FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANTICIPATED INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING WITH RESPECT TO ITS DENTAL BUSINESS, REFER TO NOTE 4 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2019 THE COMPANY ACQUIRED  ONE  BUSINESS FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $308 MILLION  IN CASH, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  THE BUSINESS ACQUIRED COMPLEMENTS AN EXISTING UNIT OF THE LIFE SCIENCES SEGMENT.  THE AGGREGATE ANNUAL SALES OF THIS  BUSINESS AT THE TIME OF ITS ACQUISITION, BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES FOR ITS LAST COMPLETED FISCAL YEAR PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, WERE  $61 MILLION.  THE COMPANY PRELIMINARILY RECORDED AN AGGREGATE OF  $211 MILLION  OF GOODWILL RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  NEGATIVELY  IMPACTED REPORTED SALES BY APPROXIMATELY  4.0%  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  .  IF THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  WERE TO PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF  2019  , CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES WOULD REDUCE THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATED FULL YEAR  2019  SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 2.0% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  ANY FUTURE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR, AND ANY WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES WOULD POSITIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  UK\u2019S REFERENDUM DECISION TO EXIT THE EU (\u201cBREXIT\u201d)  IN A REFERENDUM ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS APPROVED FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM (\u201cUK\u201d) TO EXIT THE EU.  THE TIMING OF THE UK\u2019S EXIT FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN; THE EU HAS EXTENDED THE DEADLINE FOR THE UK TO EXIT THE EU UNTIL OCTOBER 31, 2019.  WITH THE TERMS OF THE UK\u2019S WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE EU STILL BEING DECIDED, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE NEGOTIATIONS AND PLAN FOR ANY IMPACT.  TO MITIGATE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT OF GOODS TO AND FROM THE UK, THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED ITS WAREHOUSE CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY WITHIN THE UK.  FOR GOODS THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES WITHIN THE UK AND EXPORTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURED AND SHIPPED ADDITIONAL GOODS FOR STORAGE IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE UK IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN INVENTORY REQUIRED TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND IN THE EVENT OF DISRUPTION IN SHIPMENTS FROM THE UK.  THE ULTIMATE IMPACT OF BREXIT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS IS UNCERTAIN.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, REFER TO THE \u201cITEM 1A\u2014RISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2019.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NON-GAAP MEASURES  IN THIS REPORT, REFERENCES TO THE NON-GAAP MEASURE OF CORE SALES (ALSO REFERRED TO AS CORE REVENUES OR SALES/REVENUES FROM EXISTING BUSINESSES) REFER TO SALES CALCULATED ACCORDING TO U.S. GAAP, BUT EXCLUDING.  \u2022  SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES; AND  \u2022  THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  REFERENCES TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITIONS OR ACQUIRED BUSINESSES REFER TO SALES OR OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES RECORDED PRIOR TO THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION LESS THE AMOUNT OF SALES AND OPERATING PROFIT, AS APPLICABLE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIVESTED PRODUCT LINES NOT CONSIDERED DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  THE PORTION OF REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN.  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES); AND  \u2022  THE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGE IN REVENUE (EXCLUDING SALES FROM ACQUIRED BUSINESSES) AFTER APPLYING CURRENT PERIOD FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  CORE SALES GROWTH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR OR SUPERIOR TO, SALES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT REPORTING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF CORE SALES GROWTH PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BY HELPING IDENTIFY UNDERLYING GROWTH TRENDS IN DANAHER\u2019S BUSINESS AND FACILITATING COMPARISONS OF DANAHER\u2019S REVENUE PERFORMANCE WITH ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR AND FUTURE PERIODS AND TO DANAHER\u2019S PEERS.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES CORE SALES GROWTH TO MEASURE THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND USES IT AS ONE OF THE PERFORMANCE MEASURES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S EXECUTIVE SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION FROM CORE SALES BECAUSE CURRENCY TRANSLATION IS NOT UNDER MANAGEMENT\u2019S CONTROL, IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AND CAN OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS.  THE COMPANY EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE-RELATED ITEMS BECAUSE THE NATURE, SIZE, TIMING AND NUMBER OF ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES CAN VARY DRAMATICALLY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AND BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS PEERS AND CAN ALSO OBSCURE UNDERLYING BUSINESS TRENDS AND MAKE COMPARISONS OF LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE DIFFICULT.  THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION, REFERENCES TO SALES VOLUME REFER TO THE IMPACT OF BOTH PRICE AND UNIT SALES AND REFERENCES TO PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS GENERALLY REFER TO IMPROVED COST-EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM THE ONGOING APPLICATION OF THE DANAHER BUSINESS SYSTEM.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORE REVENUE% CHANGE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 29, 2019 VS.

INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $23 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , WAS  $16 MILLION  LOWER  THAN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP DERIVATIVES.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO APPROXIMATELY  $1.9 BILLION  OF CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON ITS U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE COMPANY\u2019S U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED BONDS TO OBLIGATIONS DENOMINATED IN DANISH KRONER, JAPANESE YEN, EURO AND SWISS FRANC.  INTEREST INCOME OF  $16 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , WAS  $14 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES DURING 2019 FROM THE ADDITIONAL CASH RECEIVED FROM THE COMMON STOCK AND MCPS OFFERINGS COMPLETED IN PREPARATION FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INCOME TAXES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  MARCH 30, 2018  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  53.7%  20.5%  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  2019  DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF  21.0%  PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NET DISCRETE TAX CHARGES OF  $242 MILLION  (  $0.34  PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED PRIMARILY TO CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, NET OF THE RELEASE OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, TAX BENEFITS RESULTING FROM A CHANGE IN TAX LAW, AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  THESE DISCRETE TAX CHARGES INCREASED THE REPORTED TAX RATE BY  34.0%  .  THESE PROVISIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM THE IMPACT OF EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2018 WAS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21.0% DUE PRINCIPALLY TO THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES WHICH GENERALLY ARE TAXED AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL RATE.  THE 2018 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDES THE BENEFIT OF A LOWER U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE OF 21.0% FROM THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NEW MINIMUM TAX ON CERTAIN NON-U.S. EARNINGS.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 30, 2018 ALSO INCLUDES TAX BENEFITS FOR RELEASE OF RESERVES UPON THE EXPIRATION OF STATUTES OF LIMITATION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION WHICH WERE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ASSOCIATED WITH PRIOR PERIOD UNCERTAIN TAX PROVISIONS AND OTHER MATTERS.  THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY, AND FILES NUMEROUS CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE INCOME TAX RETURNS IN FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  THE NON-U.S. COUNTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT PRESENCE INCLUDE CHINA, DENMARK, GERMANY, SINGAPORE, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A CHANGE IN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF ANY INDIVIDUAL FOREIGN COUNTRY WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GIVEN THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISPERSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ROUTINELY EXAMINED BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXING AUTHORITIES.  THE IRS HAS COMPLETED THE EXAMINATIONS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH 2011 AND IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2012 THROUGH 2015.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSIDIARIES IN AUSTRIA, BELGIUM, CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, FRANCE, GERMANY, INDIA, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, SWEDEN, SWITZERLAND AND THE UNITED KINGDOM AND VARIOUS OTHER COUNTRIES, STATES AND PROVINCES THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT FOR YEARS RANGING FROM 2004 THROUGH 2016.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE IRS HAS PROPOSED SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME FOR THE YEARS 2012 THROUGH 2015 WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFERRAL OF TAX ON CERTAIN PREMIUM INCOME RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF-INSURANCE PROGRAMS.  THE PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS WOULD INCREASE THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME OVER THE 2012-2015 PERIOD BY APPROXIMATELY  $2.7 BILLION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN ITS U.S. TAX RETURNS ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS, INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE POSITIONS AND IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING ALL OF ITS ALTERNATIVES.  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA IN 2017 AND THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN THE U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATE FOR YEARS AFTER 2017, THE COMPANY REVALUED ITS DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEFERRED PREMIUM INCOME FROM  35.0%  TO  21.0%.  IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING THESE ASSESSMENTS, THE TAXES OWED TO THE IRS MAY BE COMPUTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS  35.0%  STATUTORY TAX RATE AND THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVALUE THE RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FROM  21.0%  TO  35.0%  ,  WHICH IN ADDITION TO ANY INTEREST DUE ON THE AMOUNTS ASSESSED, WOULD REQUIRE A CHARGE TO FUTURE EARNINGS.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS CASH FLOWS AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  TAX AUTHORITIES IN DENMARK HAVE RAISED SIGNIFICANT ISSUES RELATED TO INTEREST ACCRUED BY CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES.  ON DECEMBER 10, 2013, THE COMPANY RECEIVED ASSESSMENTS FROM  THE DANISH TAX AUTHORITY  TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 1.7 BILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  MARCH 29, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $253 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  ), IMPOSING WITHHOLDING TAX RELATING TO INTEREST ACCRUED IN DENMARK ON BORROWINGS FROM CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES FOR THE YEARS 2004-2009.  THE COMPANY APPEALED THESE ASSESSMENTS TO THE NATIONAL TAX TRIBUNAL IN 2014, WHICH APPEAL HAS BEEN PENDING AWAITING THE OUTCOME OF OTHER CASES BROUGHT TO THE CJEU.  THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH SKAT AND ANTICIPATES RECEIVING AN ASSESSMENT FOR SIMILAR WITHHOLDING TAX MATTERS FOR THE YEARS 2010-2012 TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  DKK 994 MILLION  INCLUDING INTEREST THROUGH  MARCH 29, 2019  (APPROXIMATELY  $149 MILLION  BASED ON THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF  MARCH 29, 2019  ).  IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE CJEU DECIDED SEVERAL OTHER CASES RELATED TO DANISH WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST.  IN THESE CASES, THE CJEU RULED THAT THE EXEMPTION OF INTEREST PAYMENTS FROM WITHHOLDING TAXES  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROVIDED IN THE APPLICABLE  EU  DIRECTIVE SHOULD BE DENIED WHERE TAXPAYERS USE THE DIRECTIVE FOR ABUSIVE OR FRAUDULENT PURPOSES, AND THAT IT IS UP TO THE NATIONAL COURTS TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE POSITIONS THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN IN DENMARK ARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAX LAWS AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ITS POSITIONS.  THE COMPANY INTENDS ON PURSUING THIS MATTER THROUGH THE DANISH HIGH COURT SHOULD THE APPEAL TO THE TAX TRIBUNAL BE UNSUCCESSFUL.  THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR DECISIONS OF BOTH THE DANISH COURTS AND THE CJEU AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THESE COURT RULINGS ON THE COMPANY\u2019S TAX POSITIONS IN DENMARK.  THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER IS UNCERTAIN, COULD TAKE MANY YEARS, AND COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 20.0%.  THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD VARY AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE EXPECTED RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  INCLUDES THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETE INCOME TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION IN TAX EXPENSE, THOUGH THE ACTUAL BENEFITS (IF ANY) WILL DEPEND ON THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCK PRICE AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PATTERNS.  \u2022  THE ACTUAL MIX OF EARNINGS BY JURISDICTION COULD FLUCTUATE FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECTION.  \u2022  THE TAX EFFECTS OF OTHER DISCRETE ITEMS, INCLUDING ACCRUALS RELATED TO TAX CONTINGENCIES, THE RESOLUTION OF WORLDWIDE TAX MATTERS, TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS EXPIRATIONS AND CHANGES IN TAX REGULATIONS.  \u2022  ANY FUTURE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES OR POTENTIAL TAX REFORM, THE IMPACT OF FUTURE REGULATIONS AND GUIDANCE IMPLEMENTING THE TCJA AND ANY RELATED ADDITIONAL TAX PLANNING EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE CHANGES.  AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTING THESE ITEMS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE USED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS.  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  FOR THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  , COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  DECREASED  $539 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET EARNINGS IN 2019 VERSUS THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD IN 2018 AND DUE TO  LOSS  ES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS IN THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  GAIN  S FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .

INFLATION  THE EFFECT OF INFLATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 29, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE COMPANY\u2019S LIQUIDITY IN TERMS OF ITS ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO FUND ITS OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND FORECASTS THAT ITS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED FINANCING FOR THE GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION) WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES, CONSUMMATING STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THE ANTICIPATED GE BIOPHARMA ACQUISITION), PAYING INTEREST AND SERVICING DEBT AND MANAGING ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE ON A SHORT AND LONG-TERM BASIS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING IS AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY ($ IN MILLIONS).

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS FROM  2018  TO  2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  \u2022  2019  OPERATING CASH FLOWS REFLECTED  A DECREASE  OF  $233 MILLION  IN NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN  2018.  \u2022  NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF  2019  REFLECTED  AN INCREASE  OF  $8 MILLION  OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AS COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF  2018  .  AMORTIZATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS AND INCREASED DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATES TO BOTH THE COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING AND OPERATING FACILITIES AS WELL AS INSTRUMENTATION  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LEASED TO CUSTOMERS UNDER OTL ARRANGEMENTS AND INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF INCREASED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ARE MADE ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. WE DO NOT INTEND, AND UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION, TO UPDATE THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DESIGN ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO GIVE OUR CUSTOMERS A COMPETITIVE EDGE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS, INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (\u201cICS\u201d), ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DO THIS BY OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE, MINIMIZING POWER CONSUMPTION, SHORTENING THE TIME TO BRING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS TO MARKET AND REDUCING THEIR DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING COSTS. WE OFFER SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, SERVICES AND REUSABLE IC DESIGN BLOCKS, WHICH ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (\u201cIP\u201d).  OUR STRATEGY, WHICH WE CALL SYSTEM DESIGN ENABLEMENT (\u201cSDE\u201d), IS TO PROVIDE THE TECHNOLOGIES NECESSARY FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP A COMPLETE AND FUNCTIONAL ELECTRONIC PRODUCT. OUR SDE STRATEGY ENABLES US TO ADDRESS THE GROWING TRENDS OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS COMPANIES DEVELOPING THEIR OWN ICS AS PART OF THEIR END PRODUCT SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES DELIVERING GREATER PORTIONS OF THE SYSTEMS INTO WHICH THEIR IC PRODUCTS ARE INTEGRATED. OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DESIGN COMPLEX AND INNOVATIVE ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, SO DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS DRIVEN BY OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INVESTMENT IN NEW DESIGNS AND PRODUCTS. HISTORICALLY, THE INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDED THE TOOLS USED BY IC ENGINEERS WAS REFERRED TO AS ELECTRONIC DESIGN AUTOMATION (\u201cEDA\u201d). TODAY, OUR OFFERINGS INCLUDE AND EXTEND BEYOND EDA TOOLS TO INCLUDE SDE.  WE COMBINE OUR PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES INTO CATEGORIES RELATED TO MAJOR DESIGN ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION, INCLUDING EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE;  \u2022  DIGITAL IC DESIGN AND SIGNOFF;  \u2022  CUSTOM IC DESIGN AND SIMULATION;  \u2022  SYSTEM INTERCONNECT AND ANALYSIS; AND  \u2022  IP.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 1, \u201cBUSINESS,\u201d UNDER THE HEADING \u201cPRODUCTS AND PRODUCT STRATEGY,\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  WE HAVE IDENTIFIED CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT USES AS PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING REVENUE, CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF OPERATING EXPENSES AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND WE DESCRIBE THESE ITEMS FURTHER BELOW UNDER THE HEADINGS \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d AND \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\u201d  20  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  IN PREPARING OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE MAKE ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR REVENUE, OPERATING INCOME AND NET INCOME, AS WELL AS ON THE VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. AT LEAST QUARTERLY, WE EVALUATE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES, AND MAKE CHANGES AS DEEMED NECESSARY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN ITEM 7, \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d UNDER THE HEADING \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED  CREDIT LOSSES  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-13, \u201cMEASUREMENT OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,\u201d WHICH SUPERSEDES CURRENT GUIDANCE REQUIRING RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL ASSETS, INCLUDING TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AT EACH REPORTING DATE. THE NEW STANDARD WILL RESULT IN EARLIER RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES ON TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS TO RECEIVE CASH. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT  IN JANUARY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-04, \u201cSIMPLIFYING THE TEST FOR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT,\u201d THAT ELIMINATES \u201cSTEP 2\u201d FROM THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE NEW GUIDANCE MUST BE APPLIED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR THE RELATED DISCLOSURES.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, \u201cDISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK \u2014 CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT,\u201d WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-15, \u201cCUSTOMER\u2019S ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT,\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR IMPLEMENTATION COSTS IN CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR US IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. WE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEWING THIS STANDARD TO ASSESS THE IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  21  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , REFLECT THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  INCREASED PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE REVENUE RESULTING FROM OVERALL GROWTH IN EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  INCREASED EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE COSTS RESULTING FROM INCREASED SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS;  \u2022  INCREASED SELLING COSTS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN TECHNICAL SALES SUPPORT IN RESPONSE TO OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 INCREASING TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON CREATING AND ENHANCING OUR PRODUCTS.  REVENUE  WE PRIMARILY GENERATE REVENUE FROM LICENSING OUR SOFTWARE AND IP, SELLING OR LEASING OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE TECHNOLOGY, PROVIDING MAINTENANCE FOR OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP, PROVIDING ENGINEERING SERVICES AND EARNING ROYALTIES GENERATED FROM THE USE OF OUR IP. THE TIMING OF OUR REVENUE IS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY THE MIX OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS GENERATING REVENUE IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AND WHETHER THE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME, UPON COMPLETION OF DELIVERY.  WE EXPECT THAT BETWEEN 85% AND 90% OF OUR REVENUE WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME DURING FISCAL 2019, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE RESULTING REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME THAT CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME INCLUDES REVENUE FROM OUR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS, SERVICES, ROYALTIES FROM CERTAIN IP ARRANGEMENTS, MAINTENANCE ON IP LICENSES AND HARDWARE, AND OPERATING LEASES OF HARDWARE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY OUR SALES OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE AND IP LICENSES. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THIS MIX IN ANY SINGLE FISCAL PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY DELIVERY OF HARDWARE AND IP PRODUCTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  REVENUE BY PERIOD  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR REVENUE FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  AND THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN PERIODS.

THIS DEMAND HAS RESULTED IN REVENUE GROWTH IN EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES. SERVICES REVENUE MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE TIMING OF FULFILLMENT OF OUR SERVICES AND IP PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  NO  ONE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR  10%  OR MORE OF TOTAL REVENUE DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  OR  MARCH 31, 2018.  22  REVENUE BY PRODUCT GROUP  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE CONTRIBUTED BY EACH OF OUR FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SERVICES FOR THE PAST FIVE CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS.

CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ALLOW CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO REMIX AMONG SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS THAT INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WITH THE ACTUAL PRODUCT SELECTION AND NUMBER OF LICENSED USERS TO BE DETERMINED AT A LATER DATE. FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ESTIMATE THE ALLOCATION OF THE REVENUE TO PRODUCT GROUPS BASED UPON THE EXPECTED USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE ACTUAL USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS BY THESE CUSTOMERS MAY DIFFER AND, IF THAT PROVES TO BE THE CASE, THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IN THE TABLE ABOVE WOULD DIFFER.

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE PRODUCTS INCLUDE COMPONENTS, ASSEMBLY, TESTING, APPLICABLE RESERVES AND OVERHEAD. THESE COSTS MAKE OUR COST OF EMULATION AND PROTOTYPING HARDWARE PRODUCTS HIGHER, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN OUR COST OF SOFTWARE AND IP PRODUCTS.  A SUMMARY OF COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE IS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  CHANGE  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  AMOUNT  PERCENTAGE  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS  $40.6  $31.4  $9.2  29%  AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES  9.9  10.3  (0.4  )  (4  )%  TOTAL COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE  $50.5  $41.7  $8.8  21%  COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON OUR HARDWARE PRODUCT SALES IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD. COST OF PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY EMPLOYEE SALARY AND BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS, RESERVES FOR INVENTORY, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND EXTENT TO WHICH WE ACQUIRE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, ACQUIRE OR LICENSE THIRD-PARTIES\u2019 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY AND SELL OUR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE SUCH ACQUIRED OR LICENSED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR TECHNOLOGY.  THE CHANGES IN PRODUCT AND MAINTENANCE-RELATED COSTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WERE DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.

GROSS MARGINS ON OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE, PRODUCT COMPETITION, PRODUCT MIX AND PRICING STRATEGIES.  24  COST OF SERVICES  COST OF SERVICES PRIMARILY INCLUDES EMPLOYEE SALARY, BENEFITS AND OTHER EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS TO PERFORM WORK ON REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS AND COSTS TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO MANAGE A SERVICES ORGANIZATION. COST OF SERVICES MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON OUR UTILIZATION OF DESIGN SERVICES ENGINEERS ON REVENUE-GENERATING PROJECTS OR ON INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE MARKETING AND SALES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. FACTORS THAT TEND TO CAUSE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES DUE TO HIRING AND ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE IMPACT OF OUR VARIABLE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS THAT ARE DRIVEN BY OPERATING RESULTS.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY BECAUSE SUCCESSIVE INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK BETWEEN GRANT DATES HAVE RESULTED IN HIGHER GRANT DATE FAIR VALUES FOR THE MIX OF STOCK AWARDS EXPENSED IN EACH PERIOD.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE TRANSACTED IN VARIOUS FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE RECOGNIZE LOWER EXPENSES IN PERIODS WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR STRENGTHENS IN VALUE AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES AND WE RECOGNIZE HIGHER EXPENSES WHEN THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES.

BECAUSE THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND RELATED BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES MADE DURING THE FORMULATION OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLANS, BASED ON THEN-CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, OUR RESTRUCTURING PLANS MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE BENEFITS ANTICIPATED ON THE TIMETABLE OR AT THE LEVEL CONTEMPLATED. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS, INCLUDING FURTHER RESTRUCTURING OF OUR OPERATIONS, MAY BE REQUIRED IN THE FUTURE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , WE REVISED CERTAIN ESTIMATES MADE IN CONNECTION WITH PRIOR RESTRUCTURING PLANS AND RECORDED CREDITS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.7 MILLION  .

THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $7.7  $5.3  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  6.0%  6.8%  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON OUR ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2019 INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $14.4 MILLION  OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO INCREASED OUR TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX BY $1.0 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 30, 2019 BASED ON ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201cTAX ACT\u201d) AND STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ON OUR THEN-ANTICIPATED FISCAL 2018 INCOME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $8.7 MILLION OF TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION THAT VESTED OR WAS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD. WE ALSO REDUCED OUR PROVISIONAL ESTIMATE FOR THE FISCAL 2017 DEEMED REPATRIATION TRANSITION TAX BY $2.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 BASED ON OUR CONTINUING ANALYSIS OF THE EARNINGS AND CASH BALANCES OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES.  27  OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY TAX AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS AT RATES DIFFERENT FROM THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE, RESEARCH CREDITS, THE TAX IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, CLOSURE OF STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS OR SETTLEMENT OF TAX AUDITS, CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND CHANGES IN TAX LAW. A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS IS GENERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND AND HUNGARY. OUR FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF OUR EARNINGS WERE TO BE LOWER IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE HAVE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  12%  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR QUARTERLY EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WILL VARY FROM OUR FISCAL 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AS A RESULT OF RECOGNIZING THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS IN THE PERIODS WHEN THE AWARDS VEST OR ARE SETTLED AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS THAT WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS RISKS, SEE PART II, ITEM 1A, \u201cRISK FACTORS.\u201d  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  MARCH 30,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $538.9  $533.3  $5.6  NET WORKING CAPITAL  286.5  242.1  44.4  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF  $538.9 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS COMPARED TO  $533.3 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WERE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK RESULTING FROM STOCK PURCHASES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN AND STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE PERIOD.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  WERE PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OPERATING EXPENSES, PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, PURCHASES OF NON-MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS, PAYMENT OF TAXES ON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK HELD BY EMPLOYEES AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  APPROXIMATELY  84%  OF OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  . OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. WE EXPECT THAT CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES, CASH FLOWS THAT ARE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND CASH BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AND OTHER CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  NET WORKING CAPITAL  NET WORKING CAPITAL IS COMPRISED OF CURRENT ASSETS LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE INCREASE IN OUR NET WORKING CAPITAL AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.

OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY BUSINESS LEVELS AND THE PAYMENT TERMS SET FORTH IN OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS FROM OPERATIONS AND TIMING OF CASH RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND DISBURSEMENTS MADE TO VENDORS.  28  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(46.0  )  $(13.1  )  $(32.9  )  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO PAYMENTS TO ACQUIRE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF OTHER ENTITIES AND AN INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PURCHASING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, PURCHASING INTANGIBLE ASSETS, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, PURCHASING SOFTWARE LICENSES, AND MAKING STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30,  2019  MARCH 31,  2018  CHANGE  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(134.1  )  $(97.1  )  $(37.0  )  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 30, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND PAYMENTS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  AS OF THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE ACTUAL TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FUTURE REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND MARKET CONDITIONS, CORPORATE AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, STOCK PRICE, ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER FACTORS. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $594 MILLION  REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER THIS AND PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS. SEE PART II, ITEM 2, \u201cUNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON SHARE REPURCHASES.

THE CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES ON JANUARY 28, 2022 AND CURRENTLY HAS NO SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS. ANY OUTSTANDING LOANS DRAWN UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE DUE AT MATURITY ON JANUARY 28, 2022. OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS MAY BE PAID AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO MATURITY. AS OF  MARCH 30, 2019  , THERE WERE  $50.0 MILLION  OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL FINANCIAL COVENANTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  2024 NOTES  IN OCTOBER 2014, WE ISSUED  $350.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  4.375%  SENIOR NOTES DUE OCTOBER 15, 2024 (THE \u201c2024 NOTES\u201d). WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $342.4 MILLION  FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE 2024 NOTES, NET OF A DISCOUNT OF  $1.4 MILLION  AND ISSUANCE COSTS OF  $6.2 MILLION  . INTEREST IS PAYABLE IN CASH SEMI-ANNUALLY.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PAST PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PROSPECTS. THE FOLLOWING WILL BE DISCUSSED AND ANALYZED.  \u00d8  OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS  \u00d8  OVERVIEW OF 2019 RESULTS  \u00d8  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u00d8  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u00d8  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  \u00d8  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  \u00d8  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS  THE COMPANY\u2019S OBJECTIVE IS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION AS A LEADING PROVIDER OF PAPER-BASED PACKAGING SOLUTIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE, THE COMPANY OFFERS CUSTOMERS ITS PAPERBOARD, CARTONS, CUPS, LIDS, FOODSERVICE CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING MACHINES, EITHER AS AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION OR SEPARATELY. CARTONS, CARRIERS AND CONTAINERS ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT AND HOLD PRODUCTS. PRODUCT OFFERINGS INCLUDE A VARIETY OF LAMINATED, COATED AND PRINTED PACKAGING STRUCTURES THAT ARE PRODUCED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S COATED RECYCLED BOARD (\u201cCRB\u201d), COATED UNBLEACHED KRAFT (\u201cCUK\u201d) AND SOLID BLEACHED SULFATE (\"SBS\"). INNOVATIVE DESIGNS AND COMBINATIONS OF PAPERBOARD, FILMS, FOILS, METALLIZATION, HOLOGRAPHICS AND EMBOSSING ARE CUSTOMIZED TO THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THE CUSTOMERS.  THE COMPANY IS IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES (I) TO EXPAND MARKET SHARE IN ITS CURRENT MARKETS AND TO IDENTIFY AND PENETRATE NEW MARKETS; (II) TO CAPITALIZE ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, BUSINESS COMPETENCIES, AND MILLS AND FOLDING CARTON ASSETS; (III) TO DEVELOP AND MARKET INNOVATIVE, SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND APPLICATIONS; AND (IV) TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COSTS BY FOCUSING ON OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGIES AND ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES MAY BE INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS INFLATION OF RAW MATERIAL AND OTHER COSTS, WHICH THE COMPANY CANNOT ALWAYS PASS THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS, AND THE EFFECT OF OVERCAPACITY IN THE WORLDWIDE PAPERBOARD PACKAGING INDUSTRY.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS  IMPACT OF INFLATION/DEFLATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF ENERGY (INCLUDING NATURAL GAS, FUEL OIL AND ELECTRICITY), PINE AND HARDWOOD PULP, CHEMICALS, SECONDARY FIBERS, PURCHASED PAPERBOARD, ALUMINUM FOIL, INK, PLASTIC FILMS AND RESINS, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND LABOR. COSTS INCREASED IN THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2019  BY $27.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE MONTHS  OF  2018  . THE HIGHER COSTS IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  WERE DUE TO WOOD ($12.5 MILLION), LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS ($9.0 MILLION), EXTERNAL BOARD ($2.3 MILLION), CORRUGATED ($1.2 MILLION), ENERGY ($0.6 MILLION), FREIGHT ($0.4 MILLION) AND OTHER COSTS, NET ($2.3 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SECONDARY FIBER COST ($1.1 MILLION).  BECAUSE THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS EXPERIENCES SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO MANAGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO NATURAL GAS SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PRICES FOR A PORTION OF ITS EXPECTED USAGE FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  AND ALL OF 2020. SINCE NEGOTIATED SALES CONTRACTS AND THE MARKET LARGELY DETERMINE THE PRICING FOR ITS PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY IS AT TIMES LIMITED IN ITS ABILITY TO RAISE PRICES AND PASS THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS ANY INFLATIONARY OR OTHER COST INCREASES THAT THE COMPANY MAY INCUR.  COMMITMENT TO COST REDUCTION  . IN LIGHT OF INCREASING MARGIN PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY HAS PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE COSTS, IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND INCREASE PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY UTILIZES A GLOBAL CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE THAT USES STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL TO HELP DESIGN AND MANAGE MANY TYPES OF ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION AND MAINTENANCE. THIS INCLUDES A SIX SIGMA PROCESS FOCUSED ON REDUCING VARIABLE AND FIXED MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED THE CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE TO INCLUDE THE DEPLOYMENT OF LEAN SIGMA PRINCIPLES INTO MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN SERVICES.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED SAVINGS AND OPERATING EFFICIENCIES IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS, ECONOMIC AND COMPETITIVE UNCERTAINTIES AND CONTINGENCIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE STRATEGIC COST REDUCTIONS OR OTHER COST SAVINGS PLANS, IT MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OTHER MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, ANY FAILURE TO GENERATE THE ANTICIPATED EFFICIENCIES AND SAVINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPETITION AND MARKET FACTORS.  AS SOME PRODUCTS CAN BE PACKAGED IN DIFFERENT TYPES OF MATERIALS, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITION FROM OTHER MANUFACTURERS\u2019 CRB, CUK, SBS, FOLDING BOX BOARD, AND RECYCLED CLAY-COATED NEWS. ADDITIONAL SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS ALSO INCLUDE PLASTIC, SHRINK FILM AND CORRUGATED CONTAINERS. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS WITH MANY OF ITS CUSTOMERS, THE UNDERLYING CONTRACTS MAY BE RE-BID OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME, AND THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN RENEWING ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. THE COMPANY WORKS TO MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE THROUGH EFFICIENCY, PRODUCT INNOVATION AND STRATEGIC SOURCING TO ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY OCCASIONALLY RESULT IN THE LOSS OF A CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES HISTORICALLY ARE DRIVEN BY CONSUMER BUYING HABITS IN THE MARKETS ITS CUSTOMERS SERVE. CHANGES IN CONSUMER DIETARY HABITS AND PREFERENCES, INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF LIVING, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES, ACCESS TO CREDIT MARKETS, AS WELL AS OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR. NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY BY THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANY\u2019S INTRODUCTION OF NEW PACKAGING PRODUCTS ALSO IMPACT ITS SALES.  DEBT OBLIGATIONS  . THE COMPANY HAD AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  $3,188.7 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  . THIS DEBT HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE COMPANY, AS IT REQUIRES A PORTION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO BE USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST, EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO THE RISK OF INCREASED INTEREST RATES AND MAY RESTRICT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING. COVENANTS IN THE COMPANY'S AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND INDENTURES MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO DISPOSE OF ASSETS, INCUR GUARANTEE OBLIGATIONS, PREPAY OTHER INDEBTEDNESS, REPURCHASE STOCK, PAY DIVIDENDS, MAKE OTHER RESTRICTED PAYMENTS AND MAKE ACQUISITIONS OR OTHER INVESTMENTS. THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRE COMPLIANCE WITH A MAXIMUM CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AND A MINIMUM CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO. THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO COMPLY IN FUTURE PERIODS WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS WILL DEPEND ON ITS ONGOING FINANCIAL AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHICH IN TURN WILL BE SUBJECT TO MANY OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTROL. SEE \"COVENANT RESTRICTIONS\" IN \u201cFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S DEBT OBLIGATIONS.  THE DEBT AND THE RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE INDENTURES COULD LIMIT THE COMPANY\u2019S FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES. THE OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND THE RESTRICTIONS MAY ALSO LEAVE THE COMPANY MORE VULNERABLE TO A DOWNTURN IN GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR ITS BUSINESS, OR UNABLE TO CARRY OUT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES THAT ARE NECESSARY OR IMPORTANT TO ITS GROWTH STRATEGY AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS.  OVERVIEW OF FIRST QUARTER 2019 RESULTS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS AN ANALYSIS OF  NET SALES  ,  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  AND OTHER INFORMATION RELEVANT TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EUROPE PAPERBOARD PACKAGING  NET SALES  DECREASED  SLIGHTLY AS INCREASED VOLUMES FOR BEVERAGE AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND HIGHER SELLING PRICES, WERE OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (UNAUDITED; TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND STORE DATA)  THE 2019 AND 2018 FIRST QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE TWELVE-WEEK PERIODS ENDED MARCH 24, 2019 AND MARCH 25, 2018.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,100 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  FIRST QUARTER  OF 2019  FIRST QUARTER  OF 2018  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH  +4.6%  +16.8%  SAME STORE SALES GROWTH.

OUR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REMAINED POSITIVE BUT WAS PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE.  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 200 NET NEW STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. WE OPENED 173 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 27 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  15  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES WORLDWIDE, INCREASED 4.6% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $50.6 MILLION, OR 6.4%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES RESULTING FROM ORDER AND STORE COUNT GROWTH, AS WELL AS HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE, COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES RESULTING FROM STORE COUNT AND SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $10.0 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER STRATEGIC AREAS PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES IN INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. INCOME FROM OPERATIONS WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $3.9 MILLION, OR 4.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS, AS NOTED ABOVE. THIS INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE.

COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND FRANCHISED STORE REVENUES MAY VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO CHANGES IN STORE COUNT MIX. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AS WELL AS THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL.

THESE CHANGES IN U.S. STORES REVENUES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW.  U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES  REVENUES FROM U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.3 MILLION, OR 1.9%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND 6.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES  REVENUES FROM U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $7.2 MILLION, OR 8.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISED STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD. U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND 8.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  16  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING  REVENUES FROM U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING INCREASED $6.9 MILLION, OR 8.4%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISED STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD. U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 4.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND 8.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 1.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $6.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 5.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDER COUNTS AT THE STORE LEVEL. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $2.2 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 4.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $3.7 MILLION PARTIALLY OFFSET THE INCREASE IN REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 5.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.

COMPONENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES PRIMARILY INCLUDE FOOD, LABOR, DELIVERY AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $22.4 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN MARGIN ARE MORE FULLY DISCUSSED BELOW.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE STORE OPERATING MARGIN DECREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER FOOD PRICES.  \u2022  LABOR COSTS INCREASED 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 30.8% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN LABOR RATES IN CERTAIN MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $5.5 MILLION, OR 6.5%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $6.9 MILLION, OR 8.4%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET INCREASED $4.6 MILLION, OR 15.3%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (\u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d) AND THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES DURING THE QUARTER. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE INCREASED TO 4.1% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, FROM 3.9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, RESULTING FROM THE HIGHER INTEREST RATES ON THE DEBT OUTSTANDING IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED $1.7 MILLION, OR 11.1%, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED TO 15.1% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 14.3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $23.4 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $150.1 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $98.1 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $93.0 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $83.1 MILLION.  18  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF MARCH 24, 2019.  BASED UPON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $113.0 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $150.1 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $34.3 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.48 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $26.4 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, WE HAD $25.0 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $101.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS  OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN FUNDED BY EXCESS CASH FLOWS. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $750.0 MILLION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 33,549 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $8.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $242.74 PER SHARE. AS OF MARCH 24, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A TOTAL REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR SHARE REPURCHASES OF APPROXIMATELY $150.6 MILLION.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 448,008 SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $101.1 MILLION, OR AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $225.63 PER SHARE.  DIVIDENDS  ON FEBRUARY 20, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MARCH 15, 2019 WHICH WAS PAID ON MARCH 29, 2019. WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $27.2 MILLION ACCRUED FOR COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS AT MARCH 24, 2019.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRST QUARTER, ON APRIL 23, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A $0.65 PER SHARE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON ITS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF JUNE 14, 2019 TO BE PAID ON JUNE 28, 2019.  19  THE FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE MAIN COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS.

THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES DURING 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018 AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, RESTRICTED IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $12.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $12.2 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS).  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $10.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $13.6 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES, COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTERS) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MATURITIES OF RESTRICTED ADVERTISING FUND INVESTMENTS OF $4.0 MILLION.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $107.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY $101.1 MILLION IN COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS-APPROVED OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

A  DECREASE  IN NET WORKING CAPITAL OF  $686.3 MILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2018  WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CURRENT LIABILITIES.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERED THE IMPACT OF THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND UTILIZED CERTAIN OUTSIDE SOURCES OF ECONOMIC INFORMATION WHEN DEVELOPING THE BASIS FOR THEIR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT WAS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS AND PERCENT IMPROVED AS A RESULT OF SELLING PRICE INCREASES AND REDUCED IMPACTS OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ON COST OF GOODS SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES.  25  THE AMERICAS GROUP\u2019S GROSS PROFIT WAS  HIGHER  THAN LAST YEAR BY  $27.7 MILLION  IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF  2019  DUE TO SELLING PRICE INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES.

THE CONSUMER BRANDS GROUP\u2019S GROSS PROFIT  INCREASED  BY  $6.3 MILLION  IN THE QUARTER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE PRIMARILY TO SELLING PRICE INCREASES AND REDUCED IMPACTS OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ON COST OF GOODS SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION RATE CHANGES.

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS A MEASUREMENT THAT IS NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES A USEFUL MEASUREMENT OF THE OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY. SOME INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS ALSO UTILIZE SUCH A MEASUREMENT AS AN INDICATOR OF THE VALUE OF PROFITS AND CASH THAT ARE GENERATED STRICTLY FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, PUTTING ASIDE WORKING CAPITAL AND CERTAIN OTHER BALANCE SHEET CHANGES. FOR THIS MEASUREMENT, MANAGEMENT INCREASES NET INCOME FOR SIGNIFICANT NON-OPERATING AND NON-CASH EXPENSE ITEMS TO ARRIVE AT AN AMOUNT KNOWN AS \u201cEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d (EBITDA).

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  ON PAGE  16.  U.K. EXIT FROM THE EU  A REFERENDUM HELD IN THE U.K. IN 2016 RESULTED IN A MAJORITY VOTE IN FAVOR OF EXITING THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU). IN MARCH 2017, THE U.K. NOTIFIED THE EU OF ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU. IN APRIL 2019, THE DEADLINE FOR THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU WAS EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL COULD OCCUR  SOONER IF THE U.K. PASSES A WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT PRIOR TO THE DEADLINE. NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU REGARDING THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE WITHDRAWAL ARE ONGOING.  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE U.K., IRELAND AND FRANCE. IN CONNECTION WITH THE U.K.\u2019S INTENTION TO WITHDRAW FROM THE EU, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO HOW WE OPERATE IN THE REGION, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING A BANK AND BROKER-DEALER IN THE EU.  \u25cf  BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH INTERNATIONAL DESIGNATED ACTIVITY COMPANY (BAMLI DAC), OUR MAIN BANKING ENTITY IN IRELAND, WAS ESTABLISHED IN LATE 2018 THROUGH THE MERGER OF TWO ENTITIES. BAMLI DAC PROVIDES BANKING SERVICES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA DIRECTLY AND THROUGH ITS BRANCH NETWORK. RELIANCE ON THE EU\u2019S CROSS-BORDER MERGER DIRECTIVE ENABLED BAMLI DAC TO MIGRATE CLIENT POSITIONS, WITH DECREASED LEGAL COMPLEXITY AND OPERATIONAL RISK.  \u25cf  BOFA SECURITIES EUROPE SA (BOFASE), A NEWLY FORMED INVESTMENT FIRM IN FRANCE, WAS SET UP TO DELIVER INVESTMENT SERVICES IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA EXCLUDING THE U.K. AND IS NOW OPERATIONAL.  \u25cf  MERRILL LYNCH INTERNATIONAL (MLI) CONTINUES TO BE OUR PRIMARY INVESTMENT FIRM IN THE U.K.  \u25cf  BANA, INCLUDING ITS LONDON BRANCH, CONTINUES TO CONDUCT OPERATIONS IN THE EU AND THE U.K.  THESE CHANGES WILL ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO SERVICE OUR CLIENTS WITH MINIMAL DISRUPTION, RETAIN OPERATIONAL FLEXIBILITY, MINIMIZE TRANSITION RISKS AND MAXIMIZE LEGAL ENTITY EFFICIENCIES, INDEPENDENT OF THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME AND TIMING OF THE WITHDRAWAL.  TO FACILITATE CLIENT READINESS AND MITIGATE OPERATIONAL RISK, BOFASE AND BAMLI DAC CONTINUE TO EXECUTE INTERNAL AND CLIENT-RELATED TESTING ACTIVITIES ACROSS PRODUCT AND BUSINESS LINES. MIGRATION OF CLIENT ACTIVITY TO BOFASE AND BAMLI DAC BEGAN IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE WE HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO MINIMIZE OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION AND PREPARE FOR VARIOUS POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU, THE PREPAREDNESS OF OUR COUNTERPARTIES AND THE RELEVANT FINANCIAL MARKETS INFRASTRUCTURE REMAIN OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL. THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THE U.K.\u2019S WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND COULD RESULT IN REGIONAL AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS. IN PREPARATION FOR THE WITHDRAWAL, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS POTENTIAL RISKS, INCLUDING OPERATIONAL, REGULATORY AND LEGAL RISKS.

NET INCOME WAS  $7.3 BILLION  , OR  $0.70  PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  $6.9 BILLION  , OR  $0.62  PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THE IMPROVEMENT IN NET INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME AND A DECLINE IN NONINTEREST EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NONINTEREST INCOME AND AN INCREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES.  TOTAL ASSETS  INCREASED  $22.7 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  $2.4 TRILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS DUE TO INCREASED CLIENT BALANCES IN THE EQUITIES BUSINESSES IN  GLOBAL MARKETS  AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER ASSETS AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CUSTOMER AND OTHER RECEIVABLES DUE TO CLIENT ACTIVITY IN  GLOBAL MARKETS.  TOTAL LIABILITIES  INCREASED  $21.0 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  $2.1 TRILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TRADING ACCOUNT LIABILITIES DUE TO INCREASED CLIENT ACTIVITY IN  GLOBAL MARKETS  AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER LIABILITIES DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS DUE TO LOWER FUNDING NEEDS AS A RESULT OF DEPOSIT GROWTH. SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  INCREASED  $1.7 BILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME AND MARKET VALUE INCREASES ON DEBT SECURITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RETURNS OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS.  NET INTEREST INCOME  NET INTEREST INCOME  INCREASED  $606 MILLION  TO  $12.4 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. NET INTEREST YIELD ON A FULLY TAXABLE-EQUIVALENT (FTE) BASIS  INCREASED  9  BASIS POINTS (BPS) TO  2.51 PERCENT  . THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES AS WELL AS LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH, MODESTLY OFFSET BY LOAN SPREAD COMPRESSION. WE EXPECT FULL-YEAR 2019 NET INTEREST INCOME TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY THREE PERCENT COMPARED TO FULL-YEAR 2018 ASSUMING THE INTEREST RATE FORWARD CURVE AS OF APRIL 16, 2019 WHEN THE FIRST QUARTER RESULTS WERE ANNOUNCED, AND LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK.

THE FOLLOWING HIGHLIGHTS THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.  \u25cf  SERVICE CHARGES  DECREASED  $82 MILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER TREASURY SERVICES-RELATED REVENUE AND CREDIT FEES IN  GLOBAL BANKING,  AS WELL AS LOWER OVERDRAFT FEES DUE TO POLICY CHANGES AND LOWER ATM VOLUME IN  CONSUMER BANKING.  \u2022  INVESTMENT AND BROKERAGE SERVICES INCOME  DECREASED  $304 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE MARKET VALUATIONS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND DECLINES IN TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE AND ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT (AUM) PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF AUM FLOWS. THE DECLINE IN TRANSACTIONAL REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKET VOLATILITY RESULTING IN LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY.  \u25cf  INVESTMENT BANKING FEES  DECREASED  $89 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN DEBT AND EQUITY UNDERWRITING FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADVISORY FEES.  \u25cf  TRADING ACCOUNT INCOME  DECREASED  $215 MILLION  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CLIENT ACTIVITY ACROSS FIXED-INCOME, CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES (FICC) AND EQUITIES.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  INCREASED  $179 MILLION  TO  $1.0 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SINGLE-NAME UTILITY CLIENT CHARGE-OFF IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD AND ENERGY RESERVE RELEASES IN COMMERCIAL IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, A SLOWER PACE OF PORTFOLIO IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER REAL ESTATE, AND PORTFOLIO SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO.

BANK OF AMERICA  4  NONINTEREST EXPENSE  TABLE 3  NONINTEREST EXPENSE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS  $8,249  $8,480  OCCUPANCY AND EQUIPMENT  1,605  1,607  INFORMATION PROCESSING AND COMMUNICATIONS  1,164  1,165  PRODUCT DELIVERY AND TRANSACTION RELATED  662  756  MARKETING  442  345  PROFESSIONAL FEES  360  381  OTHER GENERAL OPERATING  742  1,108  TOTAL NONINTEREST EXPENSE  $13,224  $13,842  NONINTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  $618 MILLION  TO  $13.2 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EFFICIENCY SAVINGS, LOWER FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) EXPENSE AND LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESSES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  TABLE 4  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  $8,767  $8,394  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  1,456  1,476  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  16.6%  17.6%  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR RECURRING TAX PREFERENCE BENEFITS AND TAX BENEFITS FROM DEDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. WE EXPECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY 19 PERCENT, ABSENT UNUSUAL ITEMS.  SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA  IN THIS FORM 10-Q, WE PRESENT CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS OR OTHERWISE INCLUDE COMPONENTS THAT DIFFER FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE PROVIDED AS ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (INCLUDING PERIOD-TO-PERIOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE) OR COMPLIANCE WITH PROSPECTIVE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT INTENDED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND MAY NOT BE DEFINED OR CALCULATED THE SAME WAY AS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  WE VIEW NET INTEREST INCOME AND RELATED RATIOS AND ANALYSES ON AN FTE BASIS, WHICH WHEN PRESENTED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. TO DERIVE THE FTE BASIS, NET INTEREST INCOME IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT TAX-EXEMPT INCOME ON AN EQUIVALENT BEFORE-TAX BASIS WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN  INCOME TAX EXPENSE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CALCULATION, WE USE THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21 PERCENT AND A REPRESENTATIVE STATE TAX RATE. NET INTEREST YIELD, WHICH MEASURES THE BASIS POINTS WE EARN OVER THE COST OF FUNDS, UTILIZES NET INTEREST INCOME (AND THUS TOTAL REVENUE) ON AN FTE BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT PRESENTATION OF THESE ITEMS ON AN FTE BASIS ALLOWS FOR COMPARISON OF AMOUNTS FROM BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT SOURCES AND IS CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICES.  WE MAY PRESENT CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RATIOS EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS (E.G., DEBIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (DVA) GAINS (LOSSES)) WHICH RESULT IN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE THESE ITEMS IS USEFUL BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO ASSESS THE UNDERLYING OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS OF OUR BUSINESSES AND TO ALLOW BETTER COMPARISON OF PERIOD-TO-PERIOD OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  WE ALSO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS BASED ON CERTAIN RATIOS THAT UTILIZE TANGIBLE EQUITY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE. TANGIBLE EQUITY REPRESENTS AN ADJUSTED SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OR COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AMOUNT WHICH HAS BEEN REDUCED BY GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRS)), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE USED TO EVALUATE OUR USE OF EQUITY. IN ADDITION, PROFITABILITY, RELATIONSHIP AND INVESTMENT MODELS USE BOTH RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AND RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS KEY MEASURES TO SUPPORT OUR OVERALL GROWTH GOALS. THESE RATIOS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY MEASURES OUR NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADJUSTED AVERAGE COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO REPRESENTS ADJUSTED ENDING COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DIVIDED BY TOTAL ASSETS LESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING MSRS), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  \u25cf  RETURN ON AVERAGE TANGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY MEASURES OUR NET INCOME APPLICABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS A PERCENTAGE OF ADJUSTED AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. THE TANGIBLE EQUITY RATIO REPRESENTS ADJUSTED ENDING SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DIVIDED BY TOTAL ASSETS LESS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EXCLUDING MSRS), NET OF RELATED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES.  \u25cf  TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS ADJUSTED ENDING COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DIVIDED BY ENDING COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF RATIOS THAT UTILIZE TANGIBLE EQUITY PROVIDES ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY PRESENT MEASURES OF THOSE ASSETS THAT CAN GENERATE INCOME. TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER COMMON SHARE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE LEVEL OF TANGIBLE ASSETS IN RELATION TO OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  THE AFOREMENTIONED SUPPLEMENTAL DATA AND PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE PRESENTED IN TABLES  5  AND  6.

MANAGING RISK  RISK IS INHERENT IN ALL OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE SEVEN KEY TYPES OF RISK FACED BY THE CORPORATION ARE STRATEGIC, CREDIT, MARKET, LIQUIDITY, COMPLIANCE, OPERATIONAL AND REPUTATIONAL. SOUND RISK MANAGEMENT ENABLES US TO SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND DELIVER FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS. IF NOT MANAGED WELL, RISKS CAN RESULT IN FINANCIAL LOSS, REGULATORY SANCTIONS AND PENALTIES, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, EACH OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES. THE CORPORATION TAKES A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO RISK MANAGEMENT WITH A DEFINED RISK FRAMEWORK AND AN ARTICULATED RISK APPETITE STATEMENT WHICH ARE APPROVED ANNUALLY BY THE ENTERPRISE RISK COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD.  OUR RISK FRAMEWORK IS THE FOUNDATION FOR CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF RISKS FACING THE CORPORATION. THE RISK FRAMEWORK SETS FORTH CLEAR ROLES, RESPONSIBILITIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RISK AND PROVIDES A BLUEPRINT FOR HOW THE BOARD, THROUGH DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO COMMITTEES AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, ESTABLISHES RISK APPETITE AND ASSOCIATED LIMITS FOR OUR ACTIVITIES.  OUR RISK APPETITE STATEMENT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT THE CORPORATION MAINTAINS AN ACCEPTABLE RISK PROFILE BY PROVIDING A COMMON FRAMEWORK AND A COMPARABLE SET OF MEASURES FOR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD TO CLEARLY INDICATE THE LEVEL OF RISK THE CORPORATION IS WILLING TO ACCEPT. RISK APPETITE IS SET AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND IS ALIGNED WITH THE CORPORATION\u2019S STRATEGIC, CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL OPERATING PLANS. OUR LINE OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND RISK APPETITE ARE ALSO SIMILARLY ALIGNED.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR RISK FRAMEWORK, OUR RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE KEY TYPES OF RISK FACED BY THE CORPORATION, SEE THE  MANAGING RISK  THROUGH REPUTATIONAL RISK SECTIONS IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  CAPITAL MANAGEMENT  THE CORPORATION MANAGES ITS CAPITAL POSITION SO THAT ITS CAPITAL IS MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND ALIGNS WITH RISK, RISK APPETITE AND STRATEGIC PLANNING. ADDITIONALLY, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS AT ALL TIMES, EVEN UNDER ADVERSE SCENARIOS, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, MEET OBLIGATIONS TO CREDITORS AND COUNTERPARTIES, MAINTAIN READY ACCESS TO FINANCIAL MARKETS, CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A CREDIT INTERMEDIARY, REMAIN A SOURCE OF STRENGTH FOR OUR SUBSIDIARIES, AND SATISFY CURRENT AND FUTURE REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR RISK AND GOVERNANCE PROCESSES, AS CAPITAL IS A KEY CONSIDERATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, RISK APPETITE AND RISK LIMITS.  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW CAPITAL ALLOCATED TO OUR BUSINESSES AND ALLOCATE CAPITAL ANNUALLY DURING THE STRATEGIC AND CAPITAL PLANNING PROCESSES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  BUSINESS SEGMENT OPERATIONS  ON PAGE  8.  CCAR AND CAPITAL PLANNING  THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (FEDERAL RESERVE) REQUIRES BHCS TO SUBMIT A CAPITAL PLAN AND REQUESTS FOR CAPITAL ACTIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE RULES GOVERNING THE COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL ANALYSIS AND REVIEW (CCAR) CAPITAL PLAN.  IN ADDITION TO OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2018 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A PLAN TO REPURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $2.5 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH JUNE 30, 2019, WHICH WAS APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE. DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  , WE REPURCHASED  $6.3 BILLION  OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE BOARD'S REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \u2013 CCAR AND CAPITAL PLANNING IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASES ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE CORPORATION\u2019S CAPITAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ALTERNATIVE USES OF CAPITAL, STOCK TRADING PRICE AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND MAY BE SUSPENDED AT ANY TIME. THE REPURCHASES MAY BE EFFECTED THROUGH OPEN MARKET PURCHASES OR PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING REPURCHASE PLANS THAT SATISFY THE CONDITIONS OF RULE 10B5-1 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. AS A \u201cWELL-CAPITALIZED\u201d BHC, WE MAY NOTIFY THE FEDERAL RESERVE OF OUR INTENTION TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS NOT TO EXCEED 0.25 PERCENT OF TIER 1 CAPITAL,  BANK OF AMERICA  16  AND WHICH WERE NOT CONTEMPLATED IN OUR CAPITAL PLAN, SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S NON-OBJECTION.  IN APRIL 2019, WE SUBMITTED OUR 2019 CCAR CAPITAL PLAN AND RELATED SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS ANNOUNCED THAT IT WILL RELEASE CCAR CAPITAL PLAN SUMMARY RESULTS, INCLUDING SUPERVISORY PROJECTIONS OF CAPITAL RATIOS, LOSSES AND REVENUES UNDER STRESS SCENARIOS, AND PUBLISH THE RESULTS OF STRESS TESTS CONDUCTED UNDER THE SUPERVISORY ADVERSE AND SUPERVISORY SEVERELY ADVERSE SCENARIOS BY JUNE 30, 2019.  REGULATORY CAPITAL  AS A FINANCIAL SERVICES HOLDING COMPANY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY CAPITAL RULES, INCLUDING BASEL 3, ISSUED BY U.S. BANKING REGULATORS. THE CORPORATION AND ITS PRIMARY AFFILIATED BANKING ENTITY, BANA, ARE ADVANCED APPROACHES INSTITUTIONS UNDER BASEL 3 AND ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS UNDER BOTH THE STANDARDIZED AND ADVANCED APPROACHES. THE APPROACH THAT YIELDS THE LOWER RATIO IS USED TO ASSESS CAPITAL ADEQUACY INCLUDING UNDER THE PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION (PCA) FRAMEWORK. AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019  , COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 (CET1) AND TIER 1 CAPITAL RATIOS FOR THE CORPORATION WERE LOWER UNDER THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH WHEREAS THE ADVANCED APPROACHES YIELDED A LOWER TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON BASEL 3, SEE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND RELATED BUFFERS WERE FULLY PHASED IN AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019. THE PCA FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED  CATEGORIES OF CAPITALIZATION, INCLUDING WELL CAPITALIZED, BASED ON THE BASEL 3 REGULATORY RATIO REQUIREMENTS. U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE CERTAIN MANDATORY ACTIONS DEPENDING ON THE CATEGORY OF CAPITALIZATION, WITH NO MANDATORY ACTIONS REQUIRED FOR WELL-CAPITALIZED BANKING ORGANIZATIONS.  IN ORDER TO AVOID RESTRICTIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS, THE CORPORATION MUST MEET RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO REQUIREMENTS THAT INCLUDE A CAPITAL CONSERVATION BUFFER GREATER THAN 2.5 PERCENT, PLUS ANY APPLICABLE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER AND A GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANK (G-SIB) SURCHARGE. THE BUFFERS AND SURCHARGE MUST BE COMPRISED SOLELY OF CET1 CAPITAL.  THE CORPORATION IS ALSO REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO (SLR) OF 3.0 PERCENT PLUS A LEVERAGE BUFFER OF 2.0 PERCENT IN ORDER TO AVOID CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS. OUR INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION SUBSIDIARIES ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM 6.0 PERCENT SLR TO BE CONSIDERED WELL CAPITALIZED UNDER THE PCA FRAMEWORK.

TLAC CONSISTS OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S TIER 1 CAPITAL AND ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED DIRECTLY BY THE CORPORATION. ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT FOR TLAC RATIOS IS COMPRISED OF UNSECURED DEBT THAT HAS A REMAINING MATURITY OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR AND SATISFIES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS  AS PRESCRIBED IN THE TLAC FINAL RULE. AS WITH THE RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND SLR, THE CORPORATION IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TLAC RATIOS IN EXCESS OF MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS PLUS APPLICABLE BUFFERS IN ORDER TO AVOID RESTRICTIONS ON CAPITAL DISTRIBUTIONS AND DISCRETIONARY BONUS PAYMENTS.

REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  THE FOLLOWING SUPPLEMENTS THE DISCLOSURE IN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT \u2013 REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DEDUCTION OF UNSECURED DEBT OF G-SIBS  ON APRIL 2, 2019, THE U.S. BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A PROPOSAL THAT WOULD REQUIRE ADVANCED APPROACHES FIRMS TO DEDUCT INVESTMENTS IN TLAC-ELIGIBLE LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER PARI PASSU OR SUBORDINATED DEBT INSTRUMENTS ISSUED BY G-SIBS ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD FROM REGULATORY CAPITAL. THE PROPOSAL IS INTENDED TO LIMIT THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS BETWEEN G-SIBS AND IS COMPLEMENTARY TO EXISTING REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THAT GENERALLY REQUIRE BANKS TO DEDUCT INVESTMENTS IN THE REGULATORY CAPITAL OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  BROKER-DEALER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND SECURITIES REGULATION  THE CORPORATION\u2019S PRINCIPAL U.S. BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES ARE MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED (MLPF&S) AND MERRILL LYNCH PROFESSIONAL CLEARING CORP (MLPCC). MLPCC IS A FULLY-GUARANTEED SUBSIDIARY OF MLPF&S AND PROVIDES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SERVICES. BOTH ENTITIES ARE SUBJECT TO THE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF SEC RULE 15C3-1. BOTH ENTITIES ARE ALSO REGISTERED AS FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION REGULATION 1.17.  MLPF&S HAS ELECTED TO COMPUTE THE MINIMUM CAPITAL REQUIREMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENT AS PERMITTED BY SEC RULE 15C3-1. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , MLPF&S\u2019 REGULATORY NET CAPITAL AS DEFINED BY RULE 15C3-1 WAS $13.3 BILLION AND EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF $2.1 BILLION BY $11.1 BILLION. MLPCC\u2019S NET CAPITAL OF $4.9 BILLION EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT OF $588 MILLION BY $4.3 BILLION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MLPF&S IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF $500 MILLION AND TO NOTIFY THE SEC IN THE EVENT ITS TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL IS LESS THAN $5.0 BILLION. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , MLPF&S HAD TENTATIVE NET CAPITAL AND NET CAPITAL IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM AND NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.  AS A RESULT OF RESOLUTION PLANNING, THE CURRENT BUSINESS OF MLPF&S IS EXPECTED TO BE REORGANIZED INTO TWO AFFILIATED BROKER-  DEALERS: MLPF&S AND BOFA SECURITIES, INC., A NEWLY FORMED BROKER-DEALER. UNDER THE CONTEMPLATED REORGANIZATION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, BOFA SECURITIES, INC. WOULD BECOME THE LEGAL ENTITY FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES THAT ARE NOW PROVIDED BY MLPF&S. MLPF&S\u2019 RETAIL SERVICES WOULD REMAIN WITH MLPF&S. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION PLANNING, SEE  ITEM 1. BUSINESS  \u2013  RESOLUTION PLANNING  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  MLI, A U.K. INVESTMENT FIRM, IS REGULATED BY THE PRUDENTIAL REGULATION AUTHORITY AND THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY, AND IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , MLI\u2019S CAPITAL RESOURCES WERE $35.0 BILLION, WHICH EXCEEDED THE MINIMUM PILLAR 1 REQUIREMENT OF $13.6 BILLION.  LIQUIDITY RISK  FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  OUR PRIMARY LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO MEET EXPECTED OR UNEXPECTED CASH FLOW AND COLLATERAL NEEDS WHILE CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESSES AND CUSTOMERS UNDER A RANGE OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. TO ACHIEVE THAT OBJECTIVE, WE ANALYZE AND MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY RISK UNDER EXPECTED AND STRESSED CONDITIONS, MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO DIVERSE FUNDING SOURCES, INCLUDING OUR STABLE DEPOSIT BASE, AND SEEK TO ALIGN LIQUIDITY-RELATED INCENTIVES AND RISKS.  WE DEFINE LIQUIDITY AS READILY AVAILABLE ASSETS, LIMITED TO CASH AND HIGH-QUALITY, LIQUID, UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES THAT WE CAN USE TO MEET OUR CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AS THOSE OBLIGATIONS ARISE. WE MANAGE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION THROUGH LINE OF BUSINESS AND ALM ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THROUGH OUR LEGAL ENTITY FUNDING STRATEGY, ON BOTH A FORWARD AND CURRENT (INCLUDING INTRADAY) BASIS UNDER BOTH EXPECTED AND STRESSED CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT A CENTRALIZED APPROACH TO FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT ENHANCES OUR ABILITY TO MONITOR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, MAXIMIZES ACCESS TO FUNDING SOURCES, MINIMIZES BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATES TIMELY RESPONSES TO LIQUIDITY EVENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING GLOBAL FUNDING AND LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY SOURCES, LIQUIDITY ARRANGEMENTS, CONTINGENCY PLANNING AND CREDIT RATINGS DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE  LIQUIDITY RISK  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  19  BANK OF AMERICA  NB HOLDINGS CORPORATION  WE HAVE INTERCOMPANY ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN KEY SUBSIDIARIES UNDER WHICH WE TRANSFERRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, AS THE PARENT COMPANY, WHICH IS A SEPARATE AND DISTINCT LEGAL ENTITY FROM OUR BANKING AND NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES, AND AGREED TO TRANSFER CERTAIN ADDITIONAL PARENT COMPANY ASSETS NOT NEEDED TO SATISFY ANTICIPATED NEAR-TERM EXPENDITURES, TO NB HOLDINGS CORPORATION, A WHOLLY-OWNED HOLDING COMPANY SUBSIDIARY (NB HOLDINGS). THE PARENT COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME FLOW OF DIVIDENDS, INTEREST AND OTHER AMOUNTS OF CASH NECESSARY TO SERVICE ITS DEBT, PAY DIVIDENDS AND PERFORM OTHER OBLIGATIONS AS IT WOULD HAVE HAD IF IT HAD NOT ENTERED INTO THESE ARRANGEMENTS AND TRANSFERRED ANY ASSETS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS SUPPORT OUR PREFERRED SINGLE POINT OF ENTRY RESOLUTION STRATEGY, UNDER WHICH ONLY THE PARENT COMPANY WOULD BE RESOLVED UNDER THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE.

TYPICALLY, PARENT COMPANY AND NB HOLDINGS LIQUIDITY IS IN THE FORM OF CASH DEPOSITED WITH BANA.  OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 LIQUIDITY IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DEPOSIT AND LENDING ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS SECURITIES VALUATION AND NET DEBT ACTIVITY. LIQUIDITY AT BANK SUBSIDIARIES EXCLUDES THE CASH DEPOSITED BY THE PARENT COMPANY AND NB HOLDINGS. OUR BANK SUBSIDIARIES CAN ALSO GENERATE INCREMENTAL LIQUIDITY BY PLEDGING A RANGE OF UNENCUMBERED LOANS AND SECURITIES TO CERTAIN FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS (FHLBS) AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW. THE CASH WE COULD HAVE OBTAINED BY BORROWING AGAINST THIS POOL OF SPECIFICALLY-IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE ASSETS WAS  $354 BILLION  AND  $344 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . WE HAVE ESTABLISHED OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES TO ENABLE US TO BORROW AGAINST THESE ASSETS, INCLUDING REGULARLY MONITORING OUR TOTAL POOL OF ELIGIBLE LOANS AND SECURITIES COLLATERAL. ELIGIBILITY IS DEFINED IN GUIDELINES FROM THE FHLBS AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT THEIR DISCRETION. DUE TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS, LIQUIDITY GENERATED BY THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES CAN GENERALLY BE USED ONLY TO FUND OBLIGATIONS WITHIN THE BANK SUBSIDIARIES, AND TRANSFERS TO THE PARENT COMPANY OR NONBANK SUBSIDIARIES MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.  LIQUIDITY HELD IN OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES, COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF BROKER-DEALER SUBSIDIARIES, IS PRIMARILY AVAILABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS OF THAT ENTITY AND TRANSFERS TO THE PARENT COMPANY OR TO ANY OTHER SUBSIDIARY MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL DUE TO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS AND MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. OUR OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES ALSO HOLD UNENCUMBERED INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES AND EQUITIES THAT WE BELIEVE COULD BE USED TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY.

HOWEVER, HQLA FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING LCR IS NOT REPORTED AT MARKET VALUE, BUT AT A LOWER VALUE THAT INCORPORATES REGULATORY DEDUCTIONS AND THE EXCLUSION OF EXCESS LIQUIDITY HELD AT CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES. THE LCR IS CALCULATED AS THE AMOUNT OF A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION\u2019S UNENCUMBERED HQLA RELATIVE TO THE ESTIMATED NET CASH OUTFLOWS THE INSTITUTION COULD ENCOUNTER OVER A 30-DAY PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY STRESS, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE. OUR AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED HQLA, ON A NET BASIS, WAS  $444 BILLION  AND  $446 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . FOR THE SAME PERIODS, THE AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED LCR WAS  115 PERCENT  AND  118 PERCENT  . OUR LCR WILL FLUCTUATE DUE TO NORMAL BUSINESS FLOWS FROM CUSTOMER ACTIVITY.  LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS  WE UTILIZE LIQUIDITY STRESS ANALYSIS TO ASSIST US IN DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNTS OF LIQUIDITY TO MAINTAIN AT THE PARENT COMPANY AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MEET CONTRACTUAL AND CONTINGENT CASH OUTFLOWS UNDER A RANGE OF SCENARIOS.

DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES  WE FUND OUR ASSETS PRIMARILY WITH A MIX OF DEPOSITS, AND SECURED AND UNSECURED LIABILITIES THROUGH A CENTRALIZED, GLOBALLY COORDINATED FUNDING APPROACH DIVERSIFIED ACROSS PRODUCTS, PROGRAMS, MARKETS, CURRENCIES AND INVESTOR GROUPS. WE FUND A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR LENDING ACTIVITIES THROUGH OUR DEPOSITS, WHICH WERE  $1.38 TRILLION  AT BOTH  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OUR TRADING ACTIVITIES IN OTHER REGULATED ENTITIES ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED ON A SECURED BASIS THROUGH SECURITIES LENDING AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND THESE AMOUNTS WILL VARY BASED ON CUSTOMER ACTIVITY AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  LONG-TERM DEBT  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ISSUED  $14.7 BILLION  OF LONG-TERM DEBT CONSISTING OF  $9.6 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH WAS TLAC ELIGIBLE,  $1.5 BILLION  FOR BANK OF AMERICA, N.A. AND  $3.6 BILLION  OF OTHER DEBT. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LONG-TERM, TLAC-ELIGIBLE SENIOR NOTES ISSUED BY BANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION SINCE LATE 2016 ARE CALLABLE, AT OUR OPTION, AT LEAST ONE YEAR BEFORE EACH STATED MATURITY DATE. THE CALL FEATURES GIVE US THE FLEXIBILITY TO RETIRE LONG-TERM NOTES BEFORE THEIR FINAL YEAR OUTSTANDING, WHEN THEY ARE NO LONGER ELIGIBLE TO COUNT TOWARD TLAC REQUIREMENTS, AND REPLACE THEM WITH NEW TLAC-ELIGIBLE DEBT, SHOULD WE CHOOSE TO DO SO.

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR ALM ACTIVITIES, SEE  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  ON PAGE  39.  WE MAY ISSUE UNSECURED DEBT IN THE FORM OF STRUCTURED NOTES FOR CLIENT PURPOSES, CERTAIN OF WHICH QUALIFY AS TLAC-ELIGIBLE DEBT. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ISSUED  $1.8 BILLION  OF STRUCTURED NOTES, WHICH ARE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT PAY INVESTORS RETURNS LINKED TO OTHER DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, INDICES,  CURRENCIES OR COMMODITIES. WE TYPICALLY HEDGE THE RETURNS WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY ON THESE LIABILITIES WITH DERIVATIVES AND/OR INVESTMENTS IN THE UNDERLYING INSTRUMENTS, SO THAT FROM A FUNDING PERSPECTIVE, THE COST IS SIMILAR TO OUR OTHER UNSECURED LONG-TERM DEBT. WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO SETTLE CERTAIN STRUCTURED NOTE OBLIGATIONS FOR CASH OR OTHER SECURITIES PRIOR TO MATURITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH WE CONSIDER FOR LIQUIDITY PLANNING PURPOSES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT A PORTION OF SUCH BORROWINGS WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING BEYOND THE EARLIEST PUT OR REDEMPTION DATE.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SENIOR AND SUBORDINATED DEBT OBLIGATIONS CONTAIN NO PROVISIONS THAT COULD TRIGGER A REQUIREMENT FOR AN EARLY REPAYMENT, REQUIRE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL SUPPORT, RESULT IN CHANGES TO TERMS, ACCELERATE MATURITY OR CREATE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS UPON AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS, FINANCIAL RATIOS, EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR STOCK PRICE.

CONSUMER PORTFOLIO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO BEGINS WITH INITIAL UNDERWRITING AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT A BORROWER\u2019S CREDIT CYCLE. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXPERIENTIAL JUDGMENT ARE USED IN ALL ASPECTS OF PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT INCLUDING UNDERWRITING, PRODUCT PRICING, RISK APPETITE, SETTING CREDIT LIMITS, AND ESTABLISHING OPERATING PROCESSES AND METRICS TO QUANTIFY AND BALANCE RISKS AND RETURNS. STATISTICAL MODELS ARE BUILT USING DETAILED BEHAVIORAL INFORMATION FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES SUCH AS CREDIT BUREAUS AND/OR INTERNAL HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ARE A COMPONENT OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS. THESE MODELS ARE USED IN PART TO ASSIST IN MAKING BOTH NEW AND ONGOING CREDIT DECISIONS, AS WELL AS PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING AUTHORIZATIONS AND LINE MANAGEMENT, COLLECTION PRACTICES AND STRATEGIES, AND DETERMINATION OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND ALLOCATED CAPITAL FOR CREDIT RISK.  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  IMPROVEMENT IN HOME PRICES CONTINUED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  RESULTING IN IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . ADDITIONALLY, LOWER CREDIT LOSSES IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018.  IMPROVED CREDIT QUALITY AND CONTINUED LOAN BALANCE RUNOFF PRIMARILY IN THE NON-CORE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SEASONING WITHIN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO, DROVE A  $46 MILLION  DECREASE  IN THE CONSUMER ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  TO  $4.8 BILLION  .

CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CONSUMER LOAN MODIFICATIONS GENERALLY INVOLVE A REDUCTION IN THE CUSTOMER\u2019S INTEREST RATE ON THE ACCOUNT AND PLACING THE CUSTOMER ON A FIXED PAYMENT PLAN NOT EXCEEDING 60 MONTHS, ALL OF WHICH ARE CONSIDERED TDRS (THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO).  MODIFICATIONS OF CREDIT CARD AND OTHER CONSUMER LOANS ARE MADE THROUGH RENEGOTIATION PROGRAMS UTILIZING DIRECT CUSTOMER CONTACT, BUT MAY ALSO UTILIZE EXTERNAL RENEGOTIATION PROGRAMS. THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO IS EXCLUDED IN LARGE PART FROM  TABLE 26  AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE LOANS REMAIN ON ACCRUAL STATUS UNTIL EITHER CHARGED OFF OR PAID IN FULL. AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO WAS  $600 MILLION  AND  $566 MILLION  , OF WHICH  $510 MILLION  AND  $481 MILLION  WERE CURRENT OR LESS THAN 30 DAYS PAST DUE UNDER THE MODIFIED TERMS. THE  INCREASE  IN THE RENEGOTIATED TDR PORTFOLIO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NEW RENEGOTIATED ENROLLMENTS OUTPACING RUNOFF OF EXISTING PORTFOLIOS.  COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  COMMERCIAL CREDIT RISK IS EVALUATED AND MANAGED WITH THE GOAL THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE CONTINUE TO BE ALIGNED WITH OUR RISK APPETITE. WE REVIEW, MEASURE AND MANAGE CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT EXPOSURE BY INDUSTRY, PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP AND LOAN SIZE. WE ALSO REVIEW, MEASURE AND MANAGE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS BY GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AND PROPERTY TYPE. IN ADDITION, WITHIN OUR NON-U.S. PORTFOLIO, WE EVALUATE EXPOSURES BY REGION AND BY COUNTRY. TABLES  32  ,  35  AND  38  SUMMARIZE OUR CONCENTRATIONS. WE ALSO UTILIZE SYNDICATIONS OF EXPOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES, LOAN SALES, HEDGING AND OTHER RISK MITIGATION  TECHNIQUES  TO  MANAGE  THE  SIZE  AND  RISK  PROFILE  OF  THE  COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, SEE  COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT \u2013 INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS  ON PAGE  32  AND  TABLE 35.

COMMERCIAL CREDIT PORTFOLIO  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , CREDIT QUALITY AMONG LARGE CORPORATE AND MIDDLE-MARKET BORROWERS IN OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PORTFOLIO REMAINED STRONG. CREDIT QUALITY OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BORROWERS IN MOST SECTORS REMAINED STABLE WITH CONSERVATIVE LTV RATIOS. HOWEVER, SOME OF THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS EXPERIENCED SLOWING TENANT DEMAND AND DECELERATING RENTAL INCOME.  TOTAL COMMERCIAL UTILIZED CREDIT EXPOSURE  DECREASED  $3.1 BILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  TO  $617.9 BILLION  PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER HELD-FOR-SALE LOAN EXPOSURE. THE UTILIZATION RATE FOR LOANS AND LEASES, STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT (SBLCS) AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, AND COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT, IN THE AGGREGATE, WAS  59 PERCENT  AT BOTH  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TABLE 28  PRESENTS COMMERCIAL CREDIT EXPOSURE BY TYPE FOR UTILIZED, UNFUNDED AND TOTAL BINDING COMMITTED CREDIT EXPOSURE. COMMERCIAL UTILIZED CREDIT EXPOSURE INCLUDES SBLCS AND FINANCIAL GUARANTEES AND COMMERCIAL LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED AND FOR WHICH WE ARE LEGALLY BOUND TO ADVANCE FUNDS UNDER PRESCRIBED CONDITIONS DURING A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD, AND EXCLUDES EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS. ALTHOUGH FUNDS HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADVANCED, THESE EXPOSURE TYPES ARE CONSIDERED UTILIZED FOR CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

NON-U.S. PORTFOLIO  OUR NON-U.S. CREDIT AND TRADING PORTFOLIOS ARE SUBJECT TO COUNTRY RISK. WE DEFINE COUNTRY RISK AS THE RISK OF LOSS FROM UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, SOCIAL INSTABILITY AND CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES. A RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IS IN PLACE TO MEASURE, MONITOR AND MANAGE NON-U.S.  RISK AND EXPOSURES. IN ADDITION TO THE DIRECT RISK OF DOING BUSINESS IN A COUNTRY, WE ALSO ARE EXPOSED TO INDIRECT COUNTRY RISKS (E.G., RELATED TO THE COLLATERAL RECEIVED ON SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS OR RELATED TO CLIENT CLEARING ACTIVITIES). THESE INDIRECT EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THROUGH CREDIT, MARKET AND OPERATIONAL RISK GOVERNANCE, RATHER THAN THROUGH COUNTRY RISK GOVERNANCE.

NET COUNTRY EXPOSURE FOR THESE 20 COUNTRIES  INCREASED  $4.9 BILLION  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED CORPORATE EXPOSURE ACROSS MULTIPLE COUNTRIES.  NON-U.S. EXPOSURE IS PRESENTED ON AN INTERNAL RISK MANAGEMENT BASIS AND INCLUDES SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN CREDIT EXPOSURE, SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ISSUED BY OR DOMICILED IN COUNTRIES OTHER THAN THE U.S.  FUNDED LOANS AND LOAN EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE LOANS, LEASES, AND OTHER EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT AND FUNDS, INCLUDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND DUE FROM PLACEMENTS. UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS ARE THE UNDRAWN PORTION OF LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO LOANS AND LOAN EQUIVALENTS. NET COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE INCLUDES THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE COUNTERPARTY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, AND SECURED FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

OUR LARGEST EMERGING MARKET COUNTRY EXPOSURE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS CHINA, WITH NET EXPOSURE OF  $14.2 BILLION  , CONCENTRATED IN LARGE STATE-OWNED COMPANIES, SUBSIDIARIES OF MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND COMMERCIAL BANKS.  THE OUTLOOK FOR POLICY DIRECTION AND THEREFORE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE IN THE EU REMAINS UNCERTAIN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF REDUCED POLITICAL COHESION AMONG EU COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE U.K.\u2019S ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE A FAVORABLE EXIT FROM THE EU WILL FURTHER WEIGH ON ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  BANK OF AMERICA  34  \u2013 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS \u2013 U.K. EXIT FROM THE EU  ON PAGE  3  . OUR LARGEST EU COUNTRY EXPOSURE AT  MARCH 31, 2019  WAS THE U.K. WITH NET EXPOSURE OF  $53.7 BILLION  , WHICH REPRESENTS A  $1.1 BILLION  DECREASE FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN CORPORATE EXPOSURE.  WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR OUR EXPOSURES TO TARIFF-SENSITIVE INDUSTRIES AND OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURE, PARTICULARLY TO COUNTRIES THAT ACCOUNT FOR A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF U.S. TRADE, IN LIGHT OF ONGOING TRADE TENSIONS.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  INCREASED  $179 MILLION  TO  $1.0 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES WAS  $22 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , RESULTING IN  AN INCREASE  IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES. THIS COMPARED TO  A REDUCTION  OF  $77 MILLION  IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  WERE  $991 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $911 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. WE EXPECT NET CHARGE-OFFS FOR EACH OF THE REMAINING QUARTERS IN 2019 TO APPROXIMATE THIS QUARTER\u2019S NET CHARGE-OFFS, ASSUMING CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUE.  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO  INCREASED  $82 MILLION  TO  $830 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SLOWER PACE OF PORTFOLIO IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, AND SEASONING IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO.  THE PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, INCLUDING UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS,  INCREASED  $97 MILLION  TO  $183 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SINGLE-NAME UTILITY CLIENT CHARGE-OFF AND ENERGY RESERVE RELEASES IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES IS COMPRISED OF TWO COMPONENTS. THE FIRST COMPONENT COVERS NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS AND TDRS. THE SECOND COMPONENT COVERS LOANS AND LEASES ON WHICH THERE ARE INCURRED LOSSES THAT ARE NOT YET INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFIABLE, AS WELL AS INCURRED LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THE LOSS FORECAST MODELS, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS. WE EVALUATE THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES BASED ON THE TOTAL OF THESE TWO COMPONENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES EXCLUDES LOANS HELD-FOR-SALE (LHFS) AND LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION AS THE FAIR VALUE REFLECTS A CREDIT RISK COMPONENT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, SEE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THE FACTORS THAT IMPACTED THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES INCLUDED IMPROVEMENT IN THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIOS DRIVEN BY CONTINUING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND STRONG LABOR MARKETS, PROACTIVE CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND THE IMPACT OF HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ORIGINATIONS. EVIDENCING THE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY AND STRONG LABOR MARKETS ARE LOW LEVELS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND INCREASES IN HOME PRICES. IN ADDITION TO THESE IMPROVEMENTS, IN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, NONPERFORMING CONSUMER LOANS  DECREASED  $264 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AS RETURNS TO PERFORMING STATUS, PAYDOWNS, CHARGE-OFFS AND LOAN SALES CONTINUED TO OUTPACE NEW NONACCRUAL LOANS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES FOR THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO, AS PRESENTED IN  TABLE 40  , WAS  $4.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $46 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY IN THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO. THE REDUCTION IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE CONSUMER REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO WAS DUE TO IMPROVED HOME PRICES, LOWER NONPERFORMING LOANS AND A DECREASE IN LOAN BALANCES IN OUR NON-CORE PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR THE U.S. CREDIT CARD PORTFOLIO WAS DRIVEN BY PORTFOLIO SEASONING.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES FOR THE COMMERCIAL PORTFOLIO, AS PRESENTED IN  TABLE 40  , WAS  $4.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $22 MILLION  FROM  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . COMMERCIAL RESERVABLE CRITICIZED UTILIZED EXPOSURE  INCREASED  TO  $11.8 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $11.1 BILLION  (TO  2.22 PERCENT  FROM  2.08 PERCENT  OF TOTAL COMMERCIAL RESERVABLE UTILIZED EXPOSURE) AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , AND NONPERFORMING COMMERCIAL LOANS  INCREASED  TO  $1.3 BILLION  AT  MARCH 31, 2019  FROM  $1.1 BILLION  (TO  0.26 PERCENT  FROM  0.22 PERCENT  OF OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL LOANS EXCLUDING LOANS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION) AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WITH THE INCREASES SPREAD ACROSS MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES. SEE TABLES  29  ,  30  AND  31  FOR MORE DETAILS ON KEY COMMERCIAL CREDIT STATISTICS.  THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL LOANS AND LEASES OUTSTANDING WAS  1.02 PERCENT  AT BOTH  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS  IN ADDITION TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES, WE ALSO ESTIMATE PROBABLE LOSSES RELATED TO UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS SUCH AS LETTERS OF CREDIT, FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, UNFUNDED BANKERS\u2019 ACCEPTANCES AND BINDING LOAN COMMITMENTS, EXCLUDING COMMITMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION.

TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT  TO EVALUATE RISK IN OUR TRADING ACTIVITIES, WE FOCUS ON THE ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL VOLATILITY OF REVENUES GENERATED BY INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS AS WELL AS PORTFOLIOS OF POSITIONS.  VAR IS A COMMON STATISTIC USED TO MEASURE MARKET RISK AS IT ALLOWS THE AGGREGATION OF MARKET RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. A VAR MODEL SIMULATES THE VALUE OF A PORTFOLIO UNDER A RANGE OF SCENARIOS IN ORDER TO GENERATE A DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL GAINS AND LOSSES. VAR REPRESENTS THE LOSS A PORTFOLIO IS NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEED MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TIMES PER PERIOD, BASED ON A SPECIFIED HOLDING PERIOD, CONFIDENCE LEVEL AND WINDOW OF HISTORICAL DATA. WE USE ONE VAR MODEL CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE TRADING PORTFOLIOS, AND IT USES A HISTORICAL SIMULATION APPROACH BASED ON A THREE-YEAR WINDOW OF HISTORICAL DATA. OUR PRIMARY VAR STATISTIC IS EQUIVALENT TO A 99 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THIS MEANS THAT FOR A VAR WITH A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD, THERE SHOULD NOT BE LOSSES IN EXCESS OF VAR, ON AVERAGE, 99 OUT OF 100 TRADING DAYS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  TABLE 41  PRESENTS THE TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO VAR WHICH IS THE COMBINATION OF THE TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS (AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS) PORTFOLIO AND THE FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE MARKET RISK VAR TRADING ACTIVITIES, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  THE TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO VAR RESULTS IN  TABLE 41  INCLUDE MARKET RISK TO WHICH WE ARE EXPOSED FROM ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS, EXCLUDING CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (CVA), DVA AND RELATED HEDGES. THE MAJORITY OF THIS PORTFOLIO IS WITHIN THE  GLOBAL MARKETS  SEGMENT.  TABLE 41  PRESENTS PERIOD-END, AVERAGE, HIGH AND LOW DAILY TRADING VAR FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  ,  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  MARCH 31, 2018  USING A 99 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL. THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN  TABLE 41  AND  TABLE 42  ALIGN TO THE VIEW OF COVERED POSITIONS USED IN THE BASEL 3 CAPITAL CALCULATIONS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY POSITIONS ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERED COVERED POSITIONS, REGARDLESS OF TRADING OR BANKING TREATMENT FOR THE TRADE, EXCEPT FOR STRUCTURAL FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS THAT ARE EXCLUDED WITH PRIOR REGULATORY APPROVAL.  THE AVERAGE TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS PORTFOLIO VAR INCREASED MODESTLY FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION FROM CHANGES IN THE EQUITY RISK PROFILE IN THE PORTFOLIO.  37  BANK OF AMERICA  TABLE 41  MARKET RISK VAR FOR TRADING ACTIVITIES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  MARCH 31, 2018  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  PERIOD END  AVERAGE  HIGH  (1)  LOW  (1)  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  $8  $6  $10  $4  $9  $7  $13  $3  $8  $8  $12  $6  INTEREST RATE  38  28  49  17  36  28  45  18  33  23  33  18  CREDIT  21  21  26  18  26  25  29  23  28  27  31  23  EQUITY  26  19  26  14  20  25  40  15  16  19  28  14  COMMODITIES  5  7  13  4  13  9  15  6  10  6  12  3  PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (61  )  (48  )  \u2014  \u2014  (59  )  (60  )  \u2014  \u2014  (57  )  (49  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS PORTFOLIO  37  33  47  25  45  34  45  26  38  34  43  25  IMPACT FROM LESS LIQUID EXPOSURES  4  4  \u2014  \u2014  5  2  \u2014  \u2014  4  6  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL COVERED POSITIONS AND LESS LIQUID TRADING POSITIONS PORTFOLIO  41  37  53  28  50  36  51  26  42  40  51  29  FAIR VALUE OPTION LOANS  7  8  10  7  8  9  12  8  12  10  12  8  FAIR VALUE OPTION HEDGES  4  10  17  4  5  6  7  4  9  8  10  6  FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (6  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  (7  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  (11  )  (9  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL FAIR VALUE OPTION PORTFOLIO  5  9  16  5  6  6  8  5  10  9  10  7  PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION  (4  )  (6  )  \u2014  \u2014  (3  )  (4  )  \u2014  \u2014  (3  )  (4  )  \u2014  \u2014  TOTAL MARKET-BASED PORTFOLIO  $42  $40  56  30  $53  $38  54  28  $49  $45  57  33  (1)  THE HIGH AND LOW FOR EACH PORTFOLIO MAY HAVE OCCURRED ON DIFFERENT TRADING DAYS THAN THE HIGH AND LOW FOR THE COMPONENTS.

A BACKTESTING EXCESS OCCURS WHEN A TRADING LOSS EXCEEDS THE VAR FOR THE CORRESPONDING DAY. THESE EXCESSES ARE EVALUATED TO UNDERSTAND THE POSITIONS AND MARKET MOVES THAT PRODUCED THE TRADING LOSS WITH A GOAL OF ENSURING THAT THE VAR METHODOLOGY ACCURATELY REPRESENTS THOSE LOSSES. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR BACKTESTING PROCESS, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT \u2013 BACKTESTING  IN THE MD&A OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THERE WERE NO DAYS IN WHICH THERE WAS A BACKTESTING EXCESS FOR OUR TOTAL COVERED PORTFOLIO VAR, UTILIZING A ONE-DAY HOLDING PERIOD.  TOTAL TRADING-RELATED REVENUE  TOTAL TRADING-RELATED REVENUE, EXCLUDING BROKERAGE FEES, AND CVA, DVA AND FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENT GAINS (LOSSES), REPRESENTS THE TOTAL AMOUNT EARNED FROM TRADING POSITIONS, INCLUDING MARKET-BASED NET INTEREST INCOME, WHICH ARE TAKEN IN A DIVERSE RANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND MARKETS. TRADING ACCOUNT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON FAIR VALUE, SEE  NOTE 20 \u2013 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K  . TRADING-RELATED REVENUE CAN BE VOLATILE AND IS LARGELY DRIVEN BY GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER DEMAND. ALSO, TRADING-RELATED REVENUE IS DEPENDENT ON THE VOLUME AND TYPE OF TRANSACTIONS, THE LEVEL OF RISK ASSUMED, AND THE VOLATILITY OF PRICE AND RATE MOVEMENTS AT ANY GIVEN TIME WITHIN THE EVER-CHANGING MARKET ENVIRONMENT. SIGNIFICANT DAILY REVENUE BY BUSINESS IS MONITORED AND THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THESE ARE REVIEWED.  THE FOLLOWING HISTOGRAM IS A GRAPHIC DEPICTION OF TRADING VOLATILITY AND ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY LEVEL OF TRADING-RELATED REVENUE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , POSITIVE TRADING-RELATED REVENUE WAS RECORDED FOR 100 PERCENT OF THE TRADING DAYS, OF WHICH 89 PERCENT WERE DAILY TRADING GAINS OF OVER $25 MILLION. THIS COMPARES TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  WHERE POSITIVE TRADING-RELATED REVENUE WAS RECORDED FOR 95 PERCENT OF THE TRADING DAYS, OF WHICH 53 PERCENT WERE DAILY TRADING GAINS OF OVER $25 MILLION.  TRADING PORTFOLIO STRESS TESTING  BECAUSE THE VERY NATURE OF A VAR MODEL SUGGESTS RESULTS CAN EXCEED OUR ESTIMATES AND IT IS DEPENDENT ON A LIMITED HISTORICAL WINDOW, WE ALSO STRESS TEST OUR PORTFOLIO USING SCENARIO ANALYSIS. THIS ANALYSIS ESTIMATES THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF OUR TRADING PORTFOLIO THAT MAY RESULT FROM ABNORMAL MARKET MOVEMENTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE  TRADING RISK MANAGEMENT \u2013 TRADING PORTFOLIO STRESS TESTING  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME FOR BANKING BOOK ACTIVITIES.  INTEREST RATE RISK REPRESENTS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT MARKET RISK EXPOSURE TO OUR BANKING BOOK BALANCE SHEET. INTEREST RATE RISK IS MEASURED AS THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN NET INTEREST INCOME CAUSED BY MOVEMENTS IN MARKET INTEREST RATES. CLIENT-FACING ACTIVITIES, PRIMARILY LENDING AND DEPOSIT-TAKING, CREATE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE POSITIONS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  WE PREPARE FORWARD-LOOKING FORECASTS OF NET INTEREST INCOME. THE BASELINE FORECAST TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION EXPECTED FUTURE BUSINESS GROWTH, ALM POSITIONING AND THE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS AS IMPLIED BY THE MARKET-BASED FORWARD CURVE. WE THEN MEASURE AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT THAT ALTERNATIVE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS HAVE ON THE BASELINE FORECAST IN ORDER TO ASSESS INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY UNDER VARIED CONDITIONS. THE NET INTEREST INCOME FORECAST IS FREQUENTLY UPDATED FOR CHANGING ASSUMPTIONS AND DIFFERING OUTLOOKS BASED ON ECONOMIC TRENDS, MARKET  39  BANK OF AMERICA  CONDITIONS AND BUSINESS STRATEGIES. THUS, WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR OUR BALANCE SHEET POSITION IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.  THE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS THAT WE ANALYZE INCORPORATE BALANCE SHEET ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS LOAN AND DEPOSIT GROWTH AND PRICING, CHANGES IN FUNDING MIX, PRODUCT REPRICING, MATURITY CHARACTERISTICS AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES PREMIUM AMORTIZATION. OUR OVERALL GOAL IS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK SO THAT MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES DO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECT EARNINGS AND CAPITAL.  TABLE 43  PRESENTS THE SPOT AND 12-MONTH FORWARD RATES USED IN OUR BASELINE FORECASTS AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TABLE 43  FORWARD RATES  MARCH 31, 2019  FEDERAL  FUNDS  THREE-MONTH  LIBOR  10-YEAR  SWAP  SPOT RATES  2.50%  2.60%  2.41%  12-MONTH FORWARD RATES  2.25  2.31  2.43  DECEMBER 31, 2018  SPOT RATES  2.50%  2.81%  2.71%  12-MONTH FORWARD RATES  2.50  2.64  2.75  TABLE 44  SHOWS THE PRETAX IMPACT TO FORECASTED NET INTEREST INCOME OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESULTING FROM INSTANTANEOUS PARALLEL AND NON-PARALLEL SHOCKS TO THE MARKET-BASED FORWARD CURVE. PERIODICALLY WE EVALUATE THE SCENARIOS PRESENTED SO THAT THEY ARE MEANINGFUL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CURRENT RATE ENVIRONMENT.  IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  , THE ASSET SENSITIVITY OF OUR BALANCE SHEET TO RISING RATES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN INTEREST RATES. WE CONTINUE TO BE ASSET SENSITIVE TO A PARALLEL MOVE IN INTEREST RATES WITH THE MAJORITY OF THAT IMPACT COMING FROM THE SHORT END OF THE YIELD CURVE. ADDITIONALLY, HIGHER INTEREST RATES IMPACT THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND, ACCORDINGLY, FOR DEBT SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AFS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ACCUMULATED OCI AND THUS CAPITAL LEVELS UNDER THE BASEL 3 CAPITAL RULES. UNDER INSTANTANEOUS UPWARD PARALLEL SHIFTS, THE NEAR-TERM ADVERSE IMPACT TO BASEL 3 CAPITAL IS REDUCED OVER TIME BY OFFSETTING POSITIVE IMPACTS TO NET INTEREST INCOME.

AS PART OF OUR ALM ACTIVITIES, WE USE SECURITIES, CERTAIN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES, AND INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES IN MANAGING INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY.  THE BEHAVIOR OF OUR DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO IN THE BASELINE FORECAST AND IN ALTERNATE INTEREST RATE SCENARIOS IS A KEY ASSUMPTION IN OUR PROJECTED ESTIMATES OF NET INTEREST INCOME. THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IN  TABLE 44  ASSUMES NO CHANGE IN DEPOSIT PORTFOLIO SIZE OR MIX FROM THE BASELINE FORECAST IN ALTERNATE RATE ENVIRONMENTS. IN HIGHER RATE SCENARIOS, ANY CUSTOMER ACTIVITY RESULTING IN THE REPLACEMENT OF LOW-COST OR NONINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS WITH HIGHER YIELDING DEPOSITS OR MARKET-BASED FUNDING WOULD REDUCE OUR BENEFIT IN THOSE SCENARIOS.  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE UTILIZED IN OUR ALM ACTIVITIES AND SERVE AS AN EFFICIENT TOOL TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. WE USE DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS OR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ON OUR BALANCE SHEET DUE TO INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE COMPONENTS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES, SEE  NOTE 3 \u2013 DERIVATIVES  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  . FOR MORE INFORMATION ON INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT, SEE  INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE BANKING BOOK  IN THE MD&A  OF THE CORPORATION\u2019S 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  WE USE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE THE VARIABILITY IN THE CASH FLOWS OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND OTHER FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS CASH FLOW HEDGES). THE NET LOSSES ON BOTH OPEN AND TERMINATED CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OCI WERE  $1.0 BILLION  AND  $1.3 BILLION  , ON A PRETAX BASIS, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THESE NET LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED CASH FLOWS AFFECT EARNINGS AND WILL DECREASE INCOME OR INCREASE EXPENSE ON THE RESPECTIVE HEDGED CASH FLOWS. ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN OPEN CASH FLOW DERIVATIVE HEDGE POSITIONS AND NO CHANGES IN PRICES OR INTEREST RATES BEYOND WHAT IS IMPLIED IN FORWARD YIELD CURVES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , THE PRETAX NET LOSSES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS AS FOLLOWS: 25 PERCENT WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR, 53 PERCENT IN YEARS TWO THROUGH FIVE AND 12 PERCENT IN YEARS SIX THROUGH TEN, WITH THE REMAINING 10 PERCENT THEREAFTER. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, SEE  NOTE 3 \u2013 DERIVATIVES  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE HEDGE OUR NET INVESTMENT IN NON-U.S. OPERATIONS DETERMINED TO HAVE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR USING FORWARD FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS THAT TYPICALLY SETTLE IN LESS THAN 180 DAYS, CROSS-CURRENCY BASIS SWAPS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS. WE RECORDED NET AFTER-TAX LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES IN ACCUMULATED OCI ASSOCIATED WITH NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WHICH WERE OFFSET BY GAINS ON OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN CONSOLIDATED NON-U.S. ENTITIES AT  MARCH 31, 2019.  TABLE 45  PRESENTS DERIVATIVES UTILIZED IN OUR ALM ACTIVITIES AND SHOWS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT, FAIR VALUE, WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RECEIVE-FIXED AND PAY-FIXED RATES, EXPECTED MATURITY AND AVERAGE ESTIMATED DURATIONS OF OUR OPEN ALM DERIVATIVES AT  MARCH 31, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  .

MORTGAGE BANKING RISK MANAGEMENT  WE ORIGINATE, FUND AND SERVICE MORTGAGE LOANS, WHICH SUBJECT US TO CREDIT, LIQUIDITY AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, AMONG OTHERS. WE DETERMINE WHETHER LOANS WILL BE HELD FOR INVESTMENT OR HELD FOR SALE AT THE TIME OF COMMITMENT AND MANAGE CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISKS BY SELLING OR SECURITIZING A PORTION OF THE LOANS WE ORIGINATE.  INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK CAN BE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE MORTGAGE BUSINESS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND OTHER MARKET FACTORS IMPACT THE VOLUME OF MORTGAGE ORIGINATIONS. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES ALSO IMPACT THE VALUE OF INTEREST RATE LOCK COMMITMENTS (IRLCS) AND THE RELATED RESIDENTIAL FIRST MORTGAGE LHFS BETWEEN THE DATE OF THE IRLC AND THE DATE THE LOANS ARE SOLD TO THE SECONDARY MARKET. AN INCREASE IN MORTGAGE INTEREST  RATES TYPICALLY LEADS TO A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. CONVERSELY, WHEN THERE IS AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES, THE VALUE OF THE MSRS WILL INCREASE DRIVEN BY LOWER PREPAYMENT EXPECTATIONS. BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE RISKS OF THESE TWO HEDGED ITEMS OFFSET, WE COMBINE THEM INTO ONE OVERALL HEDGED ITEM WITH ONE COMBINED ECONOMIC HEDGE PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND SECURITIES.  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  , WE RECORDED GAINS OF $61 MILLION AND $69 MILLION RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE MSRS, IRLCS AND LHFS, NET OF GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE HEDGE PORTFOLIO.

EXECUTIVE  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING INTERIOR DESIGN COMPANY AND MANUFACTURER AND RETAILER OF QUALITY HOME FURNISHINGS. FOUNDED OVER 85 YEARS AGO, TODAY WE ARE A LEADING INTERNATIONAL HOME FASHION BRAND DOING BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. WE ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED FROM DESIGN THROUGH DELIVERY, AFFORDING OUR CLIENTELE A VALUE PROPOSITION OF STYLE, QUALITY AND PRICE. WE OFFER COMPLEMENTARY INTERIOR DESIGN SERVICE TO OUR CLIENTS AND SELL A FULL RANGE OF FURNITURE PRODUCTS AND DECORATIVE ACCENTS THROUGH ETHANALLEN.COM AND A NETWORK OF APPROXIMATELY 300 DESIGN CENTERS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THE DESIGN CENTERS REPRESENT A MIX OF INDEPENDENT LICENSEES AND OUR OWN COMPANY OPERATED RETAIL SEGMENT. WE OWN AND OPERATE NINE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, INCLUDING SIX MANUFACTURING PLANTS AND ONE SAWMILL IN THE UNITED STATES AND ONE MANUFACTURING PLANT IN EACH OF MEXICO AND HONDURAS.  OUR BUSINESS MODEL IS TO MAINTAIN CONTINUED FOCUS ON (I) COMMUNICATING OUR MESSAGES WITH STRONG ADVERTISING AND MARKETING CAMPAIGNS, (II) CAPITALIZING ON THE STRENGTH OF OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS AND MANAGEMENT IN OUR RETAIL DESIGN CENTERS, (III) UTILIZING ETHANALLEN.COM AS A KEY MARKETING TOOL TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO A NETWORK OF APPROXIMATELY 200 NORTH AMERICAN DESIGN CENTERS LOCATED NEAR OUR DEMOGRAPHIC BASE, (IV) INVESTING IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS KEY ASPECTS OF OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED BUSINESS, AND (V) LEVERAGING THE BENEFITS OF OUR VERTICAL INTEGRATION BY MAINTAINING OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE WE MANUFACTURE APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR PRODUCTS.  OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES ARISE FROM.  -  PROVIDING FASHIONABLE HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS OF THE FINEST CRAFTSMANSHIP;  -  OFFERING COMPLIMENTARY DESIGN SERVICE THROUGH AN ESTIMATED 2,000 MOTIVATED INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS NETWORK-WIDE;  -  OFFERING A WIDE ARRAY OF CUSTOM PRODUCTS ACROSS OUR UPHOLSTERY, CASE GOODS, AND ACCENT PRODUCT CATEGORIES;  -  ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGY IN ALL ASPECTS OF THE BUSINESS; AND  -  LEVERAGING OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE.  WE HAVE COMPLETED A MAJOR TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, HAVING REFRESHED OVER 70% OF OUR ENTIRE PRODUCT LINE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS. IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, WE FURTHER STRENGTHENED OUR OFFERINGS WITH NEW PRODUCTS FEATURING A MODERN PERSPECTIVE ON CLASSIC DESIGNS. OUR CONTRACT SALES, INCLUDING SALES TO GSA, HOSPITALITY AND COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES, CONTINUE TO GROW AND GSA HAS BECOME ONE OF OUR TEN LARGEST CUSTOMERS. OUR INTERNET SALES, WHILE STILL A LOW PERCENTAGE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED SALES, ARE GROWING AT A RATE THAT CONTINUES TO OUT-PACE OUR BRICK AND MORTAR DESIGN CENTERS.  WE MEASURE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR DESIGN CENTERS BASED ON NET SALES AND WRITTEN ORDERS BOOKED ON A COMPARABLE PERIOD BASIS. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTERS ARE THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR AT LEAST 15 MONTHS, INCLUDING RELOCATED DESIGN CENTERS PROVIDED THE ORIGINAL AND RELOCATED DESIGN CENTER LOCATION HAD BEEN OPERATING FOR AT LEAST 15 MONTHS ON A COMBINED BASIS. DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF OPERATIONS OF NEWLY OPENED DESIGN CENTERS, WRITTEN ORDERS ARE BOOKED, BUT MINIMAL NET SALES ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS. DESIGN CENTERS WE ACQUIRE FROM INDEPENDENT RETAILERS ARE INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER SALES IN THEIR 13TH FULL MONTH OF ETHAN ALLEN-OWNED OPERATIONS. THE FREQUENCY OF OUR PROMOTIONAL EVENTS AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF THE END OF THOSE EVENTS CAN ALSO AFFECT THE COMPARABILITY OF ORDERS BOOKED DURING A GIVEN PERIOD. OUR INTERNATIONAL NET SALES ARE COMPOSED OF OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT SALES TO INDEPENDENT RETAILERS AND OUR RETAIL SEGMENT SALES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH THE COMPANY OPERATED INTERNATIONAL DESIGN CENTERS.  FISCAL 2019 THIRD QUARTER IN REVIEW  -  IMPROVED GROSS MARGIN, COST CONTAINMENT WITHIN OUR EXPENSES AND A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE HELPED INCREASE OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 TO $0.30, UP FROM $0.09 IN THE YEAR AGO THIRD QUARTER. AN INCREASE OF 1.5% FOR RETAIL NET SALES WAS PARTLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 8.9% FOR WHOLESALE NET SALES. CONSOLIDATED INTERNATIONAL NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED 30.2% PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES IN CHINA AND MADE UP 6.6% OF OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES COMPARED WITH 9.3% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. GROSS PROFIT GREW BY $1.7 MILLION OR 1.7% IN THE CURRENT YEAR THIRD QUARTER COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO, DRIVEN BY A 200-BASIS POINT EXPANSION IN OUR GROSS MARGIN. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, GROSS MARGIN WAS 55.3%, UP FROM 53.3% A YEAR AGO, DUE TO IMPROVED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE GROSS MARGIN COUPLED WITH A CHANGE IN THE RETAIL SALES MIX RELATIVE TO TOTAL SALES, WHICH WAS 78.1% COMPARED WITH 75.5% IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OPERATING EXPENSES IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $5.1 MILLION, OR 5.5%, REPRESENTING 49.3% AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES COMPARED WITH 51.2% A YEAR AGO. THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES WAS A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RETAIL OCCUPANCY AND SELLING EXPENSES. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 24.8% IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED WITH 31.2% IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO TAX LAW CHANGES RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT.  16  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS THAT INFLUENCED OUR PERFORMANCE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ($ IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS). UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, ALL COMPARISONS IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ARE FROM THE THREE- OR NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR THREE- OR NINE-MONTH PERIOD.  THIRD  QUARTER  E  NDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  THIRD  QUARTER  E  NDED  MARCH 31, 2018  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $177.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $181.4 MILLION FOR THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 2.0%. SALES DECREASED BY 8.9% FOR OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A 1.5% INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT. THERE WAS A 30.2% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN OUR COMBINED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE SEGMENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES.  RETAIL NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $138.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $136.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 1.5%. COMPARATIVE RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED 0.5%. THERE WERE 142 COMPANY-OPERATED DESIGN CENTERS DURING THE QUARTER, DOWN FROM 147 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WAS A 1.9% INCREASE IN SALES IN THE U.S., WHILE SALES FROM THE CANADIAN DESIGN CENTERS DECREASED 9.6%. TOTAL WRITTEN BUSINESS (NEW ORDERS BOOKED) INCREASED 1.4%, WITH AN INCREASE IN THE U.S. AND A DECREASE IN CANADA. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER WRITTEN BUSINESS IN THE QUARTER INCREASED 0.4% IN TOTAL.  WHOLESALE NET SALES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $108.4 MILLION COMPARED WITH $118.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 8.9%. THE LOWER NET SALES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL NETWORK. THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER NET SALES BENEFITTED FROM DELAYED SHIPMENTS DURING THE FIRST HALF THAT HAD BEGUN SHIPPING DURING THE QUARTER. CONTRACT SALES INCREASED FOR THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER WHILE INTERNATIONAL SALES, ESPECIALLY TO CHINA, DECREASED.  GROSS PROFIT  FOR THE QUARTER OF $98.4 MILLION COMPARED WITH $96.7 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 1.7%, WITH AN INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND A DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. A PRICE INCREASE EARLIER IN FISCAL 2019 IMPROVED GROSS PROFIT, WHILE LOWER WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT. GROSS MARGIN FOR THE QUARTER WAS 55.3% COMPARED WITH 53.3% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. RETAIL SALES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SALES WERE 78.1% FOR THE QUARTER COMPARED WITH 75.5% IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, INCREASING OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.  OPERATING EXPENSES  FOR THE QUARTER OF $87.7 MILLION, OR 49.3% OF NET SALES, DECREASED $5.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $92.8 MILLION, OR 51.2% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE 5.5% DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS OF $6.4 MILLION. THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER ALSO REFLECTED A REDUCTION IN EXPENSES DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF $1.5 MILLION IN ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $10.7 MILLION, OR 6.0% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $3.9 MILLION, OR 2.1% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PRIMARY CAUSES FOR THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER GROSS PROFIT AND A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS.  RETAIL OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER WAS A LOSS OF $1.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $2.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE HIGHER OPERATING INCOME AND IMPROVED MARGIN IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IMPROVED SALES AND GROSS MARGIN IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD.  WHOLESALE OPERATING INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $13.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH $7.9 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER GROSS MARGIN AND LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  FOR THE QUARTER TOTALED $2.6 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1.2 MILLION. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 24.8% IN THE QUARTER COMPARED WITH 31.2%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 24.8% PRIMARILY INCLUDES A PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX ON THE CURRENT QUARTER\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, INCLUDING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, TAX EXPENSE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CANADIAN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE PRIMARILY INCLUDES TAX EXPENSE ON THAT QUARTER\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, RE-MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  NET INCOME  FOR THE QUARTER OF $8.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH $2.6 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN $0.30 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED WITH $0.09 IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  19  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  NINE  MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  COMPARED WITH  NINE  MONTHS  ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018  CONSOLIDATED NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $562.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $561.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 0.3%. SALES INCREASED BY 2.6% IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4.1% DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. THERE WAS A 28.1% DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL SALES IN OUR COMBINED RETAIL AND WHOLESALE SEGMENTS, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL TRADE DISPUTES.  RETAIL NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $442.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $431.5 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AN INCREASE OF 2.6%. COMPARATIVE RETAIL NET SALES INCREASED 1.4%.

THERE WAS A 3.6% INCREASE IN SALES IN THE U.S., WHILE SALES FROM THE CANADIAN DESIGN CENTERS DECREASED 20.0%. TOTAL WRITTEN BUSINESS (NEW ORDERS BOOKED) DECREASED 0.6%, WITH A DECREASE IN BOTH CANADA AND THE U.S. COMPARABLE DESIGN CENTER WRITTEN BUSINESS YEAR-TO-DATE DECREASED 1.9% IN TOTAL.  WHOLESALE NET SALES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $334.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH $348.5 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF 4.1%. DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR, WHOLESALE SEGMENT SALES WERE AT ELEVATED LEVELS AS THE SHIPPING DELAYS AND THE HIGH BACKLOGS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER WERE MOSTLY CAUGHT UP IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THIS YEAR THE WHOLESALE SEGMENT BACKLOG LEVELS RETURNED TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS. LOWER INTERNATIONAL SALES, ESPECIALLY TO CHINA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CONTRACT SALES, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES DECREASE.  GROSS PROFIT  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $308.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $304.8 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, UP 1.3%, WITH AN INCREASE IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND A DECREASE IN OUR WHOLESALE SEGMENT. CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN YEAR-TO-DATE WAS 54.9% COMPARED WITH 54.3%. A PRICE INCREASE EARLIER IN FISCAL 2019 IMPROVED GROSS PROFIT, WHILE LOWER WHOLESALE SALES VOLUME NEGATIVELY IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT. RETAIL SALES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED SALES WAS 78.7% YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARED WITH 76.9% IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, INCREASING OUR CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN.  OPERATING EXPENSES  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $270.1 MILLION, OR 48.0% OF NET SALES, DECREASED $1.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $271.9 MILLION, OR 48.4% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE $1.8 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6.5 MILLION REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED LOGISTICS (FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE) COSTS OF $2.4 MILLION.  OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $38.6 MILLION, OR 6.9% OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH $33.0 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE PRIMARY CAUSES FOR THE 17.1% INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WERE INCREASED DOMESTIC RETAIL SALES AND LOWER NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SALES IN WHOLESALE AND INCREASED VARIABLE LOGISTICS COSTS.  RETAIL OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $0.1 MILLION COMPARED WITH A LOSS OF $6.3 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE IMPROVED OPERATING INCOME WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE IMPROVED DOMESTIC SALES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL OPERATING INCOME.  WHOLESALE OPERATING INCOME  YEAR-TO-DATE OF $36.2 MILLION COMPARED WITH $37.0 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER THIRD QUARTER NET SALES AND INCREASED DISTRIBUTION COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN NATIONAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING EXPENSES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  YEAR-TO-DATE TOTALED $9.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $8.0 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 25.0% IN THE PERIOD COMPARED WITH 24.4%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY INCLUDES TAX EXPENSE ON THE FISCAL YEAR\u2019S TAXABLE INCOME, INCLUDING FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES, TAX EXPENSE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CANADIAN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND TAX AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE REVERSAL OF VARIOUS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.

THIS RESULTED IN NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE YEAR-TO-DATE OF $1.08 COMPARED WITH $0.90, AN INCREASE OF 20.0%.  20  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  LIQUIDITY  AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $25.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $22.4 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018. OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY.  A SUMMARY OF NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 IS PROVIDED BELOW (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET INCOME PLUS OTHER NON-CASH ITEMS  $44.6  $40.7  CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL  (0.3  )  (5.6  )  TOTAL PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $44.3  $35.1  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $(7.0  )  $(9.1  )  OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES  0.1  0.5  TOTAL (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(6.9  )  $(8.6  )  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  BORROWINGS ON REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  $16.0  $-  PAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS  (8.4  )  (14.3  )  PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS  (41.9  )  (24.3  )  REPURCHASE OF COMPANY STOCK  -  (1.1  )  OTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES  0.2  0.2  TOTAL (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(34.1  )  $(39.5  )  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, CASH OF $44.3 MILLION WAS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF $9.2 MILLION. THIS WAS LARGELY DUE HIGHER NET INCOME AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUR WORKING CAPITAL COMPARED WITH LAST YEAR AS FISCAL 2018 EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY INCREASE TO SUPPORT THE ORDER BACKLOG. WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS CONSIST OF CURRENT ASSETS (ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, PREPAID AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS) LESS CURRENT LIABILITIES (CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, PAYABLES, AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES).  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, $6.9 MILLION OF CASH WAS USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES, A DECREASE OF $1.7 MILLION. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED $2.1 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR AND RELATED PRIMARILY TO RETAIL DESIGN CENTER IMPROVEMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CASH FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2018, AND FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS RESTRICTED CASH AS A COMPONENT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS PRESENTED ON ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. PREVIOUSLY THE NET CHANGE IN RESTRICTED CASH WAS CONSIDERED AN INVESTING ACTIVITY. PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  -  YEAR-TO-DATE, $34.1 MILLION WAS USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, WHICH IS $5.4 MILLION LESS CASH USED THAN THE $39.5 MILLION OF CASH USED DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018. THE DECREASE YEAR OVER YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $13.2 MILLION PAYMENT ON THE PREVIOUSLY OUTSTANDING TERM LOAN IN FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET BORROWING ON THE FACILITY OF $8.0 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO DATE PERIOD WE PAID DIVIDENDS OF $41.9 MILLION COMPARED WITH $24.3 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR TO DATE PERIOD. IN NOVEMBER 2018, WE DECLARED A $1.00 PER SHARE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND, WHICH WAS PAID IN JANUARY 2019, IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE, ALSO PAID IN JANUARY 2019. WE HAVE CONTINUOUSLY PAID REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FOR EVERY QUARTER SINCE 1996 AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LIQUIDITY PERMIT.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH OUR OTHER AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDING THE FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MAKE ALL REQUIRED DEBT PAYMENTS, TO PERMIT ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $97.7 MILLION COMPARED WITH $93.2 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $4.5 MILLION, OR 4.8%. THE COMPANY HAD A CURRENT RATIO OF 1.77 TO 1 AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND 1.77 TO 1 AT JUNE 30, 2018.  21  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  IN ADDITION TO USING AVAILABLE CASH TO FUND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, NECESSARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME, EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH AGENTS, IN THE OPEN MARKET AT PRICES AND ON TERMS SATISFACTORY TO US. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDING MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES, RESPECTIVELY.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  -  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $2.0 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $4.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $1.3 MILLION, OR 64%, WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO RETAIL DESIGN CENTER IMPROVEMENTS.  CAPITAL NEEDS  -  DURING DECEMBER 2018 WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR, $165 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING FACILITY. TO PARTIALLY FUND THE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS IN JANUARY 2019, WE BORROWED $16.0 MILLION FROM THE FACILITY. BY MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD REPAID $8.0 MILLION OF THE TOTAL BORROWED FROM CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND TIMING OF OUR RELATED CASH PAYMENTS SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  LETTERS OF CREDIT -  AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, THERE WAS $6.2 MILLION OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE FACILITY.  TOTAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE FACILITY WAS $150.8 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 AND $108.8 AT JUNE 30, 2018. AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL THE COVENANTS UNDER THE FACILITY.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE REPURCHASES IN THE OPEN MARKET AND PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS, INCLUDING PURSUANT TO OUR PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER THE PROGRAM DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD A REMAINING BOARD AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE 2,518,046 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO OUR PROGRAM.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, THE DEGREE OF SUCCESS OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS, THE TIMING OF TAX AND OTHER PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS NECESSARY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO SUPPORT GROWTH OF OUR OPERATIONS WILL IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE EFFECT OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FACTORS MENTIONED HERE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2018, WE HAD TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OF $184.2 MILLION, OF WHICH $176.0 MILLION RELATED TO OUR OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS OF $16.0 MILLION UNDER OUR RENEWED FACILITY, OF WHICH WE HAD REPAID $8.0 MILLION BY MARCH 31, 2019, AS DESCRIBED IN THE  CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u2013  CAPITAL NEEDS  SECTION OF THIS MD&A, THERE WERE NO NEW MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  DIVIDENDS  IN JANUARY 2019, WE PAID A $1.00 PER SHARE SPECIAL CASH DIVIDEND, IN ADDITION TO THE REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE. ON JANUARY 28, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.19 PER SHARE. THE CASH DIVIDEND OF $5.1 MILLION WAS PAID ON APRIL 25, 2019, TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 11, 2019. FUTURE CASH DIVIDENDS WILL DEPEND ON OUR EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OTHER FACTORS CONSIDERED RELEVANT BY US AND IS SUBJECT TO FINAL DETERMINATION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  AND  CONTINGENCIES  EXCEPT AS INDICATED BELOW, WE DO NOT UTILIZE OR EMPLOY ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITIES, IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. AS SUCH, WE DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY (I) RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTERESTS, (II) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS (OTHER THAN AS SPECIFIED BELOW), OR (III) VARIABLE INTERESTS WHICH COULD SERVE AS A SOURCE OF POTENTIAL RISK TO OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, PROVIDE GUARANTEES ON BEHALF OF SELECTED AFFILIATED ENTITIES OR BECOME CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN BUSINESS AGREEMENTS. THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THESE GUARANTEES AND OBLIGATIONS MAY VARY BASED ON OUR UNDERLYING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BENEFITING PARTY AND THE BUSINESS PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE GUARANTEE OR OBLIGATION IS BEING PROVIDED. THE ONLY SUCH PROGRAM IN PLACE AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018 WAS FOR OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM AS FURTHER DESCRIBED BELOW.  22  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  ETHAN ALLEN CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM  -  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM, WHICH IS FINANCED AND ADMINISTERED BY A THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO ETHAN ALLEN, ARE SET FORTH IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THAT FINANCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER (THE \u201cPROGRAM AGREEMENT\u201d) WHICH WAS LAST AMENDED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2014. ANY INDEPENDENT RETAILER CHOOSING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM IS REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO A SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH THAT SAME THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTION WHICH SETS FORTH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE RETAILER IS TO PERFORM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS OFFERING OF CONSUMER CREDIT TO ITS CUSTOMERS (THE \u201cRETAILER AGREEMENT\u201d). WE HAVE OBLIGATED OURSELVES ON BEHALF OF ANY INDEPENDENT RETAILER CHOOSING TO PARTICIPATE IN OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM BY AGREEING, IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT, BREACH, OR FAILURE OF THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER TO PERFORM UNDER SUCH RETAILER AGREEMENT, TO TAKE ON CERTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DELIVERY OF GOODS AND REIMBURSEMENT OF CUSTOMER DEPOSITS. CUSTOMER RECEIVABLES ORIGINATED BY INDEPENDENT RETAILERS REMAIN NON-RECOURSE TO ETHAN ALLEN. THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT WILL TERMINATE ON JULY 31, 2019, AND THE COMPANY WILL UTILIZE A SUBSTITUTE PROGRAM UPON TERMINATION. WHILE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS (UNDISCOUNTED) THAT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THIS OBLIGATION IS INDETERMINABLE, RECOURSE PROVISIONS EXIST THAT WOULD ENABLE US TO RECOVER, FROM THE INDEPENDENT RETAILER, ANY AMOUNT PAID OR INCURRED BY US RELATED TO OUR PERFORMANCE. BASED ON THE UNDERLYING CREDITWORTHINESS OF OUR INDEPENDENT RETAILERS, INCLUDING THEIR HISTORICAL ABILITY TO PERFORM SATISFACTORILY IN CONNECTION WITH THE TERMS OF OUR CONSUMER CREDIT PROGRAM, WE BELIEVE THIS OBLIGATION WILL EXPIRE WITHOUT REQUIRING FUNDING BY US. TO ENSURE FUNDING FOR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS SOLD, THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM AGREEMENT ALSO CONTAIN A RIGHT FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES PROVIDER TO DEMAND FROM US COLLATERAL AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE VOLUME OF PROGRAM SALES IF WE DO NOT MEET A COVENANT REGARDING MINIMUM WORKING CAPITAL OR TANGIBLE NET WORTH. AT BOTH MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2018, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH COVENANT.  PRODUCT WARRANTIES  -  OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING OUR CASE GOODS, UPHOLSTERY AND HOME ACCENTS, GENERALLY CARRY EXPLICIT PRODUCT WARRANTIES THAT EXTEND UP TO TWELVE YEARS AND ARE PROVIDED BASED ON TERMS THAT ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE INDUSTRY. ALL OUR DOMESTIC INDEPENDENT RETAILERS ARE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO AND PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A WARRANTY SERVICE AGREEMENT. WE RECORD PROVISIONS FOR ESTIMATED WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED COSTS AT TIME OF SALE BASED ON HISTORICAL WARRANTY LOSS EXPERIENCE AND MAKE PERIODIC ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE PROVISIONS TO REFLECT ACTUAL EXPERIENCE. ON RARE OCCASIONS, CERTAIN WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED CLAIMS INVOLVE MATTERS OF DISPUTE THAT ULTIMATELY ARE RESOLVED BY NEGOTIATION, ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION. IN CERTAIN CASES, A MATERIAL WARRANTY ISSUE MAY ARISE WHICH IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. WE PROVIDE FOR SUCH WARRANTY ISSUES AS THEY BECOME KNOWN AND ARE DEEMED BOTH PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT, FROM TIME TO TIME, ADDITIONAL WARRANTY AND OTHER RELATED CLAIMS COULD ARISE FROM DISPUTES OR OTHER MATTERS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY TOTALED $1.4 MILLION AT MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH $1.5 MILLION AT JUNE 30, 2018.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. WE DISCUSS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  WE IMPLEMENTED ASC 606 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER CHANGES IN OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. REFER TO NOTE 4,  REVENUE RECOGNITION  , FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 3,  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  , TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE FROM CONCEPT OF IDEA, TO ENGINEERING, TO MANUFACTURING, TO RETAIL AND LOGISTICS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN STRONG MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES IN NORTH AMERICA, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A LONG-TERM COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ADVANCE OUR OBJECTIVES OF MAINTAINING FAST ORDER DELIVERY, EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY AND IMPROVING CAPACITY TO SHIP STOCKED AND CUSTOM MADE-TO-ORDER ITEMS MORE QUICKLY, WHICH IN TURN WILL ALLOW US TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. HAVING REFRESHED OVER 70% OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS, OUR CURRENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS ARE FRESH AND RELEVANT.  23  ETHAN ALLEN INTERIORS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  OUR MARKETING PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO BE STRENGTHENED WITH MESSAGING FOCUSED ON OUR STYLISH PRODUCTS, QUALITY AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A TARGETED ADVERTISING PROGRAM UTILIZING VARIOUS ADVERTISING MEDIUMS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019 AS WE BROADEN THE REACH OF OUR MESSAGING TO DRIVE MORE TRAFFIC TO OUR DESIGN CENTERS AND TO ETHANALLEN.COM.  OUR NETWORK OF PROFESSIONALLY TRAINED INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS DIFFERENTIATE US SIGNIFICANTLY FROM OUR COMPETITORS. WE CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THE LEVEL OF SERVICE, PROFESSIONALISM, AND INTERIOR DESIGN COMPETENCE, AS WELL AS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR RETAIL OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OVER TIME, WE WILL CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM (I) CONTINUOUS REPOSITIONING OF OUR RETAIL NETWORK, (II) FREQUENT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, (III) NEW AND INNOVATIVE MARKETING PROMOTIONS AND EFFECTIVE USE OF TARGETED ADVERTISING MEDIA, AND (IV) CONTINUED USE OF THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY COMBINED WITH PERSONAL SERVICE FROM OUR INTERIOR DESIGN PROFESSIONALS.  WE EXPECT THE HOME FURNISHINGS INDUSTRY TO REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO BOTH THE SOURCING OF PRODUCTS AND THE WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SALE OF THOSE PRODUCTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS CONTINUE TO FACE PRICING PRESSURES BECAUSE OF THE LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS ON IMPORTS, PARTICULARLY FROM ASIA. WHILE WE ALSO UTILIZE OVERSEAS SOURCING FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE CHOOSE TO DIFFERENTIATE OURSELVES BY MAINTAINING A SUBSTANTIAL NORTH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING BASE, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS STRUCTURE ENABLES US TO LEVERAGE OUR VERTICALLY INTEGRATED STRUCTURE TO OUR ADVANTAGE. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT A BALANCED APPROACH TO PRODUCT SOURCING, WHICH INCLUDES OUR OWN NORTH AMERICAN MANUFACTURING OF APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS COUPLED WITH THE IMPORT OF OTHER SELECTED PRODUCTS, PROVIDES THE GREATEST DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY AND SHORT LEAD TIMES AND IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO ENSURING THAT ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF QUALITY AND SERVICE ARE MAINTAINED.  WITH OUR VERTICAL ENTERPRISE WELL POSITIONED, WE MAINTAIN A CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK.

A REFERENCE TO A \u201cNOTE\u201d RELATES TO A NOTE IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS MD&A REFLECTS OUR OPERATING RESULTS, UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.  CERTAIN STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS MD&A MAY BE DEEMED TO BE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  SEE \u201cSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORW  ARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d  OVERVIEW  GENERAL  LSB IS HEADQUARTERED IN OKLAHOMA CITY, OKLAHOMA AND THROUGH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, MANUFACTURES AND SELLS CHEMICAL PRODUCTS FOR THE AGRICULTURAL, MINING, AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS.  WE OWN AND OPERATE FACILITIES IN CHEROKEE, ALABAMA, EL DORADO, ARKANSAS AND PRYOR, OKLAHOMA, AND OPERATE A FACILITY FOR COVESTRO IN BAYTOWN, TEXAS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND DIRECTLY TO END CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.  KEY OPERATING INITIATIVES FOR 2019  WE BELIEVE OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE  FOLLOWING KEY INITIATIVES.  \u2022  IMPROVING THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR CHEMICAL PLANTS.  OVER THE  PAST 24 MONTHS, OUR  FOCUS HAS BEEN ON UPGRADING OUR EXISTING MAINTENANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM THROUGH TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS AND WORK PROCESSES TO IMPROVE OUR PREDICTIVE AND PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AT OUR FACILITIES.  WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE MAINTENANCE EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN EXPEDITING IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERALL USE.  WE COMPLETED THE INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION DURING 2018. ADDITIONALLY,  BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS TO DO A THOROUGH REVIEW OF OUR OPERATING AND MAINTENANC  E PROCEDURES AND OUR PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS AT ALL OF OUR FACILITIES IN AN EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHERE WE MAY HAVE GAPS IN PROCEDURES AND PROGRAMS AND WHERE WE MAY NEED ENHANCEMENTS. BASED ON THE \u201cGAP ANALYSIS\u201d COMPLETED, WE HAVE SEVERAL INITIATIVES UNDERWAY THAT WE BELIEVE WILL IMPROVE THE OVERALL RELIABILITY OF OUR PLANTS AND ALLOW US TO PRODUCE MORE PRODUCTS FOR SALE WHILE LOWERING OUR COST OF PRODUCTION. THOSE INITIATIVES ARE FOCUSED ON OPERATING BEHAVIOR AND PROCEDURE ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDING OPERATOR TRAINING, LEADERSHIP TRAINING, SHIFT CHANGE ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE PROCEDURES  \u2022  FOCUS ON THE CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT OF OUR SAFETY PERFORMANCE.  WE BELIEVE THAT HIGH SAFETY STANDARDS ARE CRITICAL AND A PRECURSOR TO IMPROVED PLANT PERFORMANCE.  WITH THAT IN MIND, WE IMPLEMENTED AND ARE CURRENTLY MANAGING ENHANCED SAFETY PROGRAMS AT OUR FACILITIES THAT FOCUS ON REDUCING RISKS AND IMPROVING OUR SAFETY CULTURE.  \u2022  CONTINUE BROADENING OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS.  WE HAVE INCREASED OUR OVERALL SALES VOLUME OF HDAN OVER THE  PAST SEVERAL YEARS  BY APPROXIMATELY 30% THROUGH VARIOUS MARKETING INITIATIVES INCLUDING: (1) STORING AND DISTRIBUTING HDAN AT OUR PRYOR FACILITY WHICH ALLOWS US TO SELL TO NEW MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS OUT OF THAT FACILITY AND; (2) EDUCATING GROWERS ON THE AGRONOMIC BENEFITS AND THE ADDITIONAL APPLICATIONS FOR HDAN.  TO FURTHER LEVERAGE OUR PLANTS CURRENT PRODUCTION CAPACITY, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXPAND THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS BY PARTNERING WITH CUSTOMERS TO TAKE PRODUCT FURTHER INTO THE WESTERN U.S. AS WELL AS MARKETS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WE ALSO PARTNERED WITH A CURRENT CUSTOMER TO POSITION AN EMULSION EXPLOSIVES PLANT AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING PRODUCT TO THAT FACILITY SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE FURTHER GUEST PLANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AT OUR FACILITIES IN 2019.  IN ADDITION, THROUGH INCREASED MARKETING EFFORTS, WE INCREASED OUR SALES VOLUMES OF NITRIC ACID OVER THE  PAST 24 MONTHS  BY APPROXIMATELY 31%.  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR MARKET FOR OUR NITRIC ACID PRODUCTS IN NORTH AMERICA AND TO FULLY UTILIZE AVAILABLE NITRIC ACID PRODUCTION CAPACITY OF OUR FACILITIES.  \u2022  IMPROVING THE MARGINS ON SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE FOCUSED ON INCREASING OUR SALES VOLUMES TO PRODUCE AT OPTIMAL ON-STREAM RATES AND LOWER OUR MANUFACTURING COSTS PER TON OF PRODUCT.  IN 2019, WE WILL UNDERTAKE A REVIEW OF ALL SALES TO CUSTOMERS TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE THE MARGINS ON SALES TO THOSE CUSTOMERS AND TO EXPLORE IF THERE ARE FURTHER PRODUCT UPGRADING OPPORTUNITIES.  \u2022  CONTINUED FOCUS ON PROCUREMENT AND LOGISTICS.  IN 2018, WE ENGAGED OUTSIDE EXPERTS TO ASSIST US IN CENTRALIZING AND EXPANDING OUR COMPANY-WIDE PROCUREMENT EFFORTS.  WE COMPLETED OUR INITIAL AREAS OF FOCUS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, COMPLETED THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE CHANGES, AND CONTINUE TO SEE BENEFITS SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS, ALONG WITH SEVERAL ADDITIONAL IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS, WILL RESULT IN AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN EXPENSES AND CAPITAL SPEND IN THE AGGREGATE OF BETWEEN $3 MILLION TO $5 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO REALIZE OVER THE NEXT 12 TO 24 MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE EFFECTIVENESS AND OVERALL COST OF OUR LOGISTICS STRATEGY THROUGH A CENTRALLY MANAGED TEAM FOCUSED ON BUILDING LOGISTICS PARTNERS THAT WILL HELP US FURTHER DRIVE EFFICIENCIES IN 2019.  20  \u2022  FOCUS ON IMPROVING OU  R CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL.  WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND REDUCE OUR OVERALL COST OF CAPITAL.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPROVING END MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH OUR IMPROVED OPERATING PERFORM  ANCE WILL BE A BENEFIT IN ACHIEVING THOSE EFFORTS.  WE  CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY SEEK WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE GOING FORWARD.  WE MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY OR ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES.  EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE INITIATIVES, THEY MAY NOT ACHIEVE THE RESULTS THAT WE EXPECT OR DESIRE.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  EXPECTATIONS ON INCREASED PLANTED CORN ACREAGE IN THE U.S. FOR THE 2019/2020 SEASON HAVE SUPPORTED NITROGEN FERTILIZER DEMAND OUTLOOKS THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  HOWEVER, CONTINUED ADVERSE WEATHER IN THE MIDWEST, FLOODING THROUGHOUT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER REGION DURING MARCH AND SATURATED FIELDS IN IOWA AND NEBRASKA HAVE DELAYED FERTILIZER APPLICATION AND PLANTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  CHALLENGING WEATHER PATTERNS HAVE CONTINUED INTO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  WHILE PRICING FOR OUR KEY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS HAVE IMPROVED COMPARED TO A YEAR AGO, WE EXPECT CURRENT HIGH PRODUCT INVENTORY LEVELS ACROSS THE SUPPLY CHAIN TO CHALLENGE PRICING IN THE NEAR TERM.  KEY INDUSTRY FACTORS  SUPPLY AND DEMAND  AGRICULTURAL  SALES OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WERE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. THE  PRICE AT WHICH OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ARE ULTIMATELY SOLD DEPENDS ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR NITROGEN FERTILIZERS WHICH, IN TURN, DEPENDS UPON WORLD GRAIN DEMAND AND PRODUCTION LEVELS, THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE, WEATHER CONDITIONS, COMPETITIVE PRICING AND THE AVAILABILITY OF IMPORTS.  ADDITIONALLY, EXPANSIONS OR UPGRADES OF COMPETITORS\u2019 FACILITIES AND INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER INDUSTRY ECONOMICS.  THESE FACTORS CAN AFFECT, IN ADDITION TO SELLING PRICES, THE LEVEL OF INVENTORIES IN THE MARKET WHICH CAN CAUSE PRICE VOLATILITY AND EFFECT PRODUCT MARGINS.  ADDITIONALLY, CHANGES IN CORN PRICES AND THOSE OF SOYBEAN, COTTON AND WHEAT PRICES, CAN AFFECT THE NUMBER OF ACRES OF CORN PLANTED IN A GIVEN YEAR, AND THE NUMBER OF ACRES PLANTED WILL DRIVE THE LEVEL OF NITROGEN FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION, LIKELY EFFECTING PRICES.  INDUSTRY REPORTS INDICATED CHINA\u2019S RECENT TARIFFS PLACED ON U.S. SOYBEANS COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT OF 2 TO 4 MILLION ACRES THAT WILL BE ROTATED FROM SOYBEANS TO CORN IN THE NEXT PLANTING SEASON. THE USDA ALSO ESTIMATES AN INCREASE IN 2019 CORN ACRES THAT IS IN LINE WITH OTHER INDUSTRY REPORTS OF APPROXIMATELY 92 MILLION TO 93 MILLION.  SOYBEAN PRICING CONCERNS MAY DRIVE CROP PLANTING SELECTION WHEN FINAL CROP CHOICES ARE MADE AT THE FARM LEVEL.

ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, GIVEN THE LOW PRICE OF NATURAL GAS IN NORTH AMERICA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, NORTH AMERICAN FERTILIZER PRODUCERS HAVE BECOME THE GLOBAL LOW-COST PRODUCERS FOR DELIVERED FERTILIZER PRODUCTS TO THE MIDWEST U.S.  SEVERAL YEARS AGO, THE MARKET BELIEVED THAT LOW NATURAL GAS PRICES WOULD CONTINUE.  THAT BELIEF, COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE FERTILIZER PRICING, STIMULATED INVESTMENT IN NUMEROUS EXPANSIONS OF EXISTING NITROGEN CHEMICAL FACILITIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF NEW NITROGEN CHEMICAL FACILITIES.  SINCE THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS, GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER SUPPLY HAS OUTPACED GLOBAL NITROGEN FERTILIZER DEMAND CAUSING OVERSUPPLY IN THE GLOBAL AND NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS.  THE INCREASED FERTILIZER SUPPLY LED TO LOWER NITROGEN FERTILIZER SALE PRICES DURING MOST OF 2017.  ALSO, ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF AMMONIA AND OTHER FERTILIZER PRODUCTS CHANGED THE PHYSICAL FLOW OF AMMONIA IN NORTH AMERICA PLACING PRESSURE ON AMMONIA AND OTHER FERTILIZER PRICES UNTIL THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ACCEPTED THE NEW SUPPLY.  BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2017 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE IN FERTILIZER PRICES AS IMPORTS OF FERTILIZERS HAVE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE NEW DOMESTIC SUPPLY OF FERTILIZER HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED.  WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  21  INDUSTRIAL  SALES OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES ARE DEPENDENT UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS PRIMARILY IN THE HOUSING, AUTOMOTIVE, AND PAPER  INDUSTRIES.  ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL, THE U.S. ECONOMIC INDICATORS GENERALLY CONTINUE TO BE POSITIVE FOR THESE SECTORS DOMESTICALLY.  OUR  SALES PRICES GENERALLY VARY WITH THE MARKET PRICE OF AMMONIA OR NATURAL GAS, AS APPLICABLE, IN OUR PRICING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS.  MINING  SALES OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY 10% OF OUR TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR MINING PRODUCTS ARE LDAN AND AN SOLUTIONS, WHICH ARE PRIMARY USED AS AN FUEL OIL AND SPECIALTY EMULSIONS FOR SURFACE MINING OF COAL AND FOR USAGE IN QUARRIES AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY.  AS REPORTED BY THE EIA, ANNUAL COAL PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. FOR THE FULL YEAR OF 2018 WAS DOWN 2% FROM 2017 DUE TO THIS MARKET\u2019S WEAK COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE ELECTRICAL GENERATION SECTOR COMPARED WITH NATURAL GAS AND TO A LESSER DEGREE LOWER EXPORT DEMAND.  EIA IS FORECASTING ANOTHER 9% DECREASE IN U.S. COAL PRODUCTION IN 2019 FOLLOWED BY A CONTINUED DECLINE OF 6% IN 2020.  THIS ESTIMATED DECLINE IS BASED ON THE CONTINUAL SHIFT IN UTILITY-SCALE ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM COAL TO NATURAL GAS.  WE BELIEVE THAT COAL PRODUCTION IN THE U.S. CONTINUES TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FROM COMPETITION FROM NATURAL GAS AND RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY.  WHILE WE BELIEVE, OUR PLANTS ARE WELL LOCATED TO SUPPORT THE MORE STABLE COAL-PRODUCING REGIONS IN THE UPCOMING YEARS, OUR CURRENT MINING SALES VOLUMES ARE BEING AFFECTED BY OVERALL LOWER CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR LDAN.  AS PART OF OUR CONTINUED EFFORT TO EXPAND SALES OF OUR MINING PRODUCTS, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH A CURRENT CUSTOMER, BY WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS LOCATED AN EMULSION PLANT FOR THE MINING BUSINESS AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY.  FARMER ECONOMICS  THE DEMAND FOR FERTILIZER IS AFFECTED BY THE AGGREGATE CROP PLANTING DECISIONS AND FERTILIZER APPLICATION RATE DECISIONS OF INDIVIDUAL FARMERS.  INDIVIDUAL FARMERS MAKE PLANTING DECISIONS BASED LARGELY ON PROSPECTIVE PROFITABILITY OF A HARVEST, WHILE THE SPECIFIC VARIETIES AND AMOUNTS OF FERTILIZER THEY APPLY DEPEND ON FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, SOIL CONDITIONS, WEATHER PATTERNS AND THE TYPES OF CROPS PLANTED.  NATURAL GAS PRICES  NATURAL GAS IS THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK USED TO PRODUCE NITROGEN FERTILIZERS AT OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  IN RECENT YEARS, U.S. NATURAL GAS RESERVES HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, ADVANCES IN EXTRACTING SHALE GAS, WHICH HAS REDUCED AND STABILIZED NATURAL GAS PRICES, PROVIDING NORTH AMERICA WITH A COST ADVANTAGE OVER CERTAIN IMPORTS.  AS A RESULT, OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION AND THAT OF OTHER NORTH AMERICAN NITROGEN FERTILIZER PRODUCERS HAS BEEN POSITIVELY AFFECTED.  WE HISTORICALLY HAVE PURCHASED NATURAL GAS IN THE SPOT MARKET, USING FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS, OR THROUGH A COMBINATION OF BOTH AND HAVE USED FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS TO LOCK IN PRICING FOR A PORTION OF OUR NATURAL GAS REQUIREMENTS.  THESE FORWARD PURCHASE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY EITHER FIXED-PRICE OR INDEX-PRICE, SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND FOR A FIXED SUPPLY QUANTITY.  WE ARE ABLE TO PURCHASE NATURAL GAS AT COMPETITIVE PRICES DUE TO OUR CONNECTIONS TO LARGE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS AND THEIR PROXIMITY TO INTERSTATE PIPELINE SYSTEMS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE VOLUME OF NATURAL GAS WE PURCHASED AND THE AVERAGE COST PER MMBTU.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31,  2019  2018  NATURAL GAS VOLUMES (MMBTU IN MILLIONS)  7.4  7.7  NATURAL GAS AVERAGE COST PER MMBTU  $2.91  $2.79  TRANSPORTATION COSTS  COSTS FOR TRANSPORTING NITROGEN-BASED PRODUCTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THEIR SELLING PRICE.  FOR EXAMPLE, AMMONIA IS A HAZARDOUS GAS AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES AND MUST BE TRANSPORTED IN SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT, WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN OTHER FORMS OF NITROGEN FERTILIZERS.  IN RECENT YEARS, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE AMMONIA CONSUMED ANNUALLY IN THE U.S. WAS IMPORTED.  THEREFORE, NITROGEN FERTILIZERS PRICES IN THE U.S. ARE INFLUENCED BY THE COST TO TRANSPORT PRODUCT FROM EXPORTING COUNTRIES, GIVING DOMESTIC PRODUCERS WHO TRANSPORT SHORTER DISTANCES AN ADVANTAGE. HOWEVER, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE RECENT RISING COSTS OF RAIL AND TRUCK FREIGHT DOMESTICALLY.  HIGHER TRANSPORTATION COSTS MAY IMPACT OUR MARGINS IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PASS THROUGH THESE COSTS.  AS A RESULT, WE CONTINUE TO EVALUATE SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES TO REDUCE OR COUNTER THE IMPACT OF HIGHER LOGISTICS COSTS.  22  KEY OPERATIONAL FACTORS  FACILITY RELIABILITY  CONSISTENT, RELIABLE AND SAFE OPERATIONS AT OUR CHEMICAL PLANTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF PLANNED DOWNTIME AT OUR PLANTS, INCLUDING TURNAROUNDS IS MITIGATED THROUGH A DILIGENT PLANNING PROCESS THAT CONSIDERS THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES TO PERFORM THE NEEDED MAINTENANCE, FEEDSTOCK LOGISTICS AND OTHER FACTORS.  UNPLANNED DOWNTIME OF OUR PLANTS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN LOST CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FROM LOST SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, LOST FIXED COST ABSORPTION FROM LOWER PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE.  ALL TURNAROUNDS RESULT IN LOST CONTRIBUTION MARGIN FROM LOST SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, LOST FIXED COST ABSORPTION FROM LOWER PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, WHICH REPAIR, AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  OUR EL DORADO FACILITY PERFORMED A PARTIAL TURNAROUND DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2018.  THE REMAINING PORTION OF THIS TURNAROUND ACTIVITY WILL BE PERFORMED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019.  FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THIS WORK, WE EXPECT THE EL DORADO FACILITY TO MOVE TO A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE WITH THE NEXT TURNAROUND PLANNED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022.  OUR CHEROKEE FACILITY IS CURRENTLY ON A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE WITH T  HE NEXT TURNAROUND TO BE PERFORMED IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE THIRD QUARTER  O  F 2021.  OUR PRYOR FACILITY TURNAROUND IS SCHEDULED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE WITH A TWO-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE AT THIS FACILITY WITH THE NEXT TURNAROUND PLANNED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2021.  AT THAT TIME, WE WILL SEEK TO MOVE TO A THREE-YEAR TURNAROUND CYCLE.  PREPAY CONTRACTS  WE USE FORWARD SALES OF OUR FERTILIZER PRODUCTS TO OPTIMIZE OUR ASSET UTILIZATION, PLANNING PROCESS AND PRODUCTION SCHEDULING.  THESE SALES ARE MADE BY OFFERING CUSTOMERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURCHASE PRODUCT ON A FORWARD BASIS AT PRICES AND DELIVERY DATES THAT ARE AGREED UPON WHICH DATES ARE USUALLY WITHIN 12 MONTHS.  WE USE THIS PROGRAM TO VARYING DEGREES DURING THE YEAR DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR VIEW OF CHANGING PRICE ENVIRONMENTS.  FIXING THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THEIR ULTIMATE DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS TYPICALLY CAUSES OUR REPORTED SELLING PRICES AND MARGINS TO DIFFER FROM SPOT MARKET PRICES AND MARGINS AVAILABLE AT THE TIME OF SHIPMENT.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF  THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  OUR CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WERE $94.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $100.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME WAS $0.1 MILLION COMPARED TO $1.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019.  THE ITEMS IMPACTING OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW AND UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\u201d  ITEMS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF RESULTS OF THE FIRST QUARTER  ON-STREAM RATES  THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR PLANTS AFFECT OUR PRODUCTION, THE ABSORPTION OF FIXED COSTS OF EACH PLANT AND SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.  IT IS A KEY OPERATING METRIC THAT WE USE TO MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  IN PARTICULAR, WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE ON-STREAM RATES OF OUR AMMONIA PLANTS AS AMMONIA IS THE BASIC PRODUCT AS USED TO PRODUCE ALL UPGRADED PRODUCTS.  THE ON-STREAM RATES NOTED BELOW EXCLUDE TURNAROUND DAYS, WHEN APPLICABLE.  AT OUR CHEROKEE FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 93% COMPARED TO 85% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, THE CHEROKEE FACILITY\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE WAS IMPACTED BY MAINTENANCE COMPLETED ON ITS PRIMARY REFORMER.  OUR TARGET ON-STREAM RATE FOR THIS AMMONIA PLANT FOR 2019 IS 95%.  AT OUR EL DORADO FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 96% COMPARED TO 100% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018. OUR TARGET ON-STREAM RATE FOR THIS AMMONIA PLANT FOR 2019 IS 95%.  AT OUR PRYOR FACILITY, THE AMMONIA PLANT\u2019S ON-STREAM RATE FOR FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS 88% COMPARED TO 91% FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  WHILE WE ANTICIPATE BRIEF PERIODS OF UNSCHEDULED DOWNTIME DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 AS WE CONTINUE TO TAKE ACTIONS TO IMPROVE LONG-TERM RELIABILITY, WE ARE TARGETING AN AMMONIA PLANT ON-STREAM RATE FOR 2019 OF 90%.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FOCUS ON IMPROVING ON-STREAM RATES AS DISCUSSED IN KEY OPERATING INITIATIVES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR OVERALL ON-STREAM RATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  23  SELLING PRICES  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AVERAGE AGRICULTURAL SELLING PRICES FOR  OUR UAN, AMMONIA AND HDAN INCREASED 49%, 14%, AND 7% RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2018 AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR THE SAME PERIOD REFLECTING A MORE FAVORABLE ALIGNMENT OF DEMAND WITH  MARKET CAPACITY FOR THESE PRODUCTS.  OUR FIRST QUARTER 2019 AVERAGE INDUSTRIAL SELLING PRICES FOR OUR AMMONIA DECREASED COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  THE FIRST QUARTER 2019 TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 15% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WHICH LEAD TO A DECREASE IN INDUSTRIAL SELLING PRICES AS MANY OF OUR INDUSTRIAL CONTRACTS ARE INDEXED TO THE TAMPA AMMONIA PRICE.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS V  OLUMES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WEATHER-DRIVEN PLANTING DELAYS  AND FLOODING EXPERIENCED DURING THE BEGINNING OF THE 2019 SPRING  APPLICATION SEASON.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASE IN SALES VOLUMES WERE HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR ALL OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.  25  \u2022  INDUSTRIAL ACIDS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL CHEMICAL PRODUCTS SALES DECREASED PRIMARILY FROM LOWER INDUSTRIAL AMMONIA SELLING PRICES DUE TO LOWER TAMPA  AMMONIA  INDEX PRICES. A  VERAGE TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  APPROXIMATELY  $50 PER TON LOWER COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018.  THIS DECREASE IN SALES PRICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SALES VOLUMES FOR MOST OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS.  \u2022  MINING PRODUCTS SALES VOLUMES ARE DOWN DUE TO TIMING OF SALES.  WE EXPECT TO MAKE UP THIS VOLUME IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  GROSS PROFIT  AS NOTED IN THE TABLES ABOVE, WE RECOGNIZED A GROSS PROFIT $7.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $10.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, OR A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.8 MILLION.  OVERALL, OUR GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECREASED 2% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE INCREASED 5% TO 14% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 FROM 9% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 AS SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS IMPROVED PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DELAYED OR LOST VOLUME RESULTING FROM OVERALL POOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FLOODING ACROSS THE U.S. AND PRIMARILY IN THE AREAS, WE TYPICALLY SEE FERTILIZER SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER.  INDUSTRIAL AND MINING PRODUCTS ADJUSTED GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE DECLINED 11% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 TO 37% FROM 49% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER OVERALL TAMPA AMMONIA PRICING, WHICH AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $280 PER METRIC TON IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO $330 PER METRIC TON FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  IN ADDITION TO THE NET NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GROSS PROFIT FROM THE LOWER SALES DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $1.0 MILLION OF HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS INCURRED TO MOVE PRODUCT FOR STORAGE AS A RESULT OF THE DELAY IN THE SPRING APPLICATION SEASON AND APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION FROM HIGHER NATURAL GAS COSTS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  OUR SG&A EXPENSES W  ERE $7.2  MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, A DECREASE OF $1.1 MILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN COMPENSATION-RELATED COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  WAS $11.0 MILLION COMPARED  TO $9.3 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES IN 2018 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5.  NON-OPERATING OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME), NET  NON-OPERATING OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS $0.2 MILLION COMPARED TO NON-OPERATING INCOME OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 OR A CHANGE OF $1.1 MILLION. THIS VARIANCE PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INCLUDED IN THE SERIES E PREFERRED.  PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR  INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR  THE FIRST QUARTER  OF 2019  WAS $0.4 MILLION COMPARED TO A BENEFIT OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE RESULTING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018 WAS 4% (PROVISION ON PRE-TAX LOSS) AND 14% (BENEFIT ON PRE-TAX LOSS), RESPECTIVELY.  FOR THE FIRST OF 2019, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS LESS THAN THE STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.  ALSO SEE  DISCUSSION  IN NOTE 7.

ALSO SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE UNDER \u201cCOMPLIANCE WITH LONG-TERM DEBT COVENANTS.  REDEMPTION OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED  \u2013 AT MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WERE 139,768 OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AND THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE (PAR VALUE PLUS ACCRUED DIVIDENDS) WAS $219 MILLION.  A  T ANY TIME ON OR AFTER  OCTOBER 25, 2023  , EACH SERIES E HOLDER HAS THE RIGHT TO ELECT TO HAVE SUCH HOLDER\u2019S SHARES REDEEMED BY US AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PER SHARE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE PER SHARE OF $1,000 PLUS ACCRUED AND UNPAID DIVIDENDS PLUS THE PARTICIPATION RIGHTS VALUE (THE \u201cLIQUIDATION PREFERENCE\u201d).  ADDITIONALLY, AT OUR OPTION, WE MAY REDEEM THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AT ANY TIME AT A REDEMPTION PRICE PER SHARE EQUAL TO THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF SUCH SHARE AS OF THE REDEMPTION DATE. LASTLY, WITH RECEIPT OF (I) PRIOR CONSENT OF THE ELECTING SERIES E HOLDER OR A MAJORITY OF SHARES OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED AND (II) ALL OTHER REQUIRED APPROVALS, INCLUDING UNDER ANY PRINCIPAL U.S. SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH OUR COMMON STOCK IS THEN LISTED FOR TRADING, WE CAN REDEEM THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAVING AN AGGREGATE COMMON STOCK PRICE EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT OF THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE OF SUCH SHARES BEING REDEEMED IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN LIEU OF CASH AT THE REDEMPTION DATE.  IN THE EVENT OF LIQUIDATION, THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ITS LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE BEFORE ANY SUCH DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS OR PROCEEDS IS MADE TO OR SET ASIDE FOR THE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND ANY OTHER JUNIOR STOCK. IN THE EVENT OF A CHANGE OF CONTROL, WE MUST MAKE AN OFFER TO PURCHASE ALL OF THE SHARES OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED OUTSTANDING AT THE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE.  SINCE CARRYING VALUES OF THE REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCKS ARE BEING INCREASED BY PERIODIC ACCRETIONS (INCLUDING THE AMOUNT FOR DIVIDENDS EARNED BUT NOT YET DECLARED OR PAID) USING THE INTEREST METHOD SO THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT WILL EQUAL THE REDEMPTION VALUE AS OF OCTOBER 25, 2023, THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE REDEMPTION DATE BY THE HOLDER, THIS ACCRETION HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE.  HOWEVER, THIS ACCRETION WILL CHANGE IF THE EXPECTED REDEMPTION DATE CHANGES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \u2013 FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO PP&E WERE $7.1 MILLION  .  THE CAPITA  L EXPENDITURES WERE FUNDED PRIMARILY FROM CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL.  SEE DISCUSSION ABOVE UNDER \u201cCAPITALIZATION\u201d FOR OUR EXPECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  28  EXPENSES ASSOCIAT  ED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORY COMPLIANCE  WE ARE SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC FEDERAL AND STATE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES.  AS A RESULT, WE INCURRED EXPENSES OF $1.2 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR EXPENSES RANGING FROM $3.4 MILLION TO $3.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.  HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL COSTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATES.  DIVIDENDS  WE HAVE NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IN MANY YEARS, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR OUTSTANDING  COMMON STOCK IN THE NEAR FUTURE.  DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED ARE CUMULATIVE AND PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY (MAY 1 AND NOVEMBER 1) IN ARREARS AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF 14% OF THE LIQUIDATION VALUE OF $1,000 PER SHARE, BUT SUCH ANNUAL RATE WILL INCREASE BEGINNING ON APRIL 25, 2021 AS DISCUSSED IN NO  TE 8.  EACH SHARE OF SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A SEMI-ANNUAL DIVIDEND, ONLY WHEN DECLARED BY OUR BOARD. IN ADDITION, DIVIDENDS IN ARREARS AT THE DIVIDEND DATE, UNTIL PAID,  SHALL COMPOUND ADDITIONAL DIVIDENDS AT THE CURRENT ANNUAL RATE OF 14%, BUT SUCH ANNUAL RATE WILL INCREASE BEGINNING ON APRIL 25, 2021. THE CURRENT SEMI-ANNUAL COMPOUNDED DIVIDEND IS APPROXIMATELY $103.83 PER SHARE FOR THE CURRENT AGGREGATE SEMI-ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $14.5 MILLION.  WE ALSO MUST DECLARE A DIVIDEND ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED ON A PRO RATA BASIS WITH OUR COMMON STOCK. AS LONG AS  THE  PURCHASER  HOLDS AT LEAST 10% OF THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED, WE MAY NOT DECLARE DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER PREFERRED STOCKS UNLESS AND UNTIL DIVIDENDS HAVE BEEN DECLARED AND PAID ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED FOR THE THEN CURRENT DIVIDEND PERIOD IN CASH.  AS OF MARCH  31, 2019, THE  AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES E REDEEMABLE PREFERRED WAS  APPROXIMATELY $79.6 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES D 6% CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE CLASS C PREFERRED STOCK (THE \u201cSERIES D PREFERRED\u201d) AND SERIES B 12% CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE CLASS C PREFERRED STOCK (THE \u201cSERIES B PREFERRED\u201d) ARE PAYABLE ANNUALLY, ONLY WHEN DECLARED BY OUR BOARD, AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  $0.06 PER SHARE ON OUR OUTSTANDING NON-REDEEMABLE SERIES D PREFERRED FOR AN AGGREGATE DIVIDEND OF $60,000, AND  \u2022  $12.00 PER SHARE ON OUR OUTSTANDING NON-REDEEMABLE SERIES B PREFERRED FOR AN AGGREGATE DIVIDEND OF $240,000.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE AMOUNT OF ACCUMULATED DIVIDENDS ON THE SERIES D PREFERRED AND SERIES B PREFERRED TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $1.1  MILLION. ALL SHARES  OF THE SERIES D PREFERRED AND SERIES B PREFERRED ARE OWNED BY THE GOLSEN HOLDERS.  THERE ARE NO OPTIONAL OR MANDATORY REDEMPTION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SERIES B PREFERRED OR SERIES D PREFERRED.  SEASONALITY  WE BELIEVE FERTILIZER PRODUCTS SOLD TO THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY ARE SEASONAL WHILE SALES INTO THE INDUSTRIAL AND MINING SECTORS GENERALLY ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE.  THE SELLING SEASONS FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY DURING THE SPRING AND FALL PLANTING SEASONS, WHICH TYPICALLY EXTEND FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE AND FROM SEPTEMBER THROUGH NOVEMBER IN THE GEOGRAPHICAL MARKETS WE DISTRIBUTE THE MAJORITY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.  AS A RESULT, WE TYPICALLY INCREASE OUR INVENTORY OF FERTILIZER PRODUCTS PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EACH PLANTING SEASON IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF SALES TO THE AGRICULTURAL MARKETS DEPEND UPON WEATHER CONDITIONS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT BONDS  WE ARE CONTINGENTLY LIABLE TO SURETIES IN RESPECT OF INSURANCE BONDS ISSUED BY THE SURETIES IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO BY SUBSIDIARIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THESE INSURANCE BONDS PRIMARILY REPRESENT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY THE SURETIES FOR PAYMENTS, UP TO $9.7 MILLION, MADE BY THEM IN RESPECT OF SUCH BONDS.  THESE INSURANCE BONDS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPIRE OR BE RENEWED IN 2019.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTES 1 AND 2 FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.

IT IS ALSO REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS UTILIZED AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 COULD CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.
