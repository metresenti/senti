OUR COMPANY\u2019S VISION IS THAT OUR GUESTS, EMPLOYEES AND SHAREHOLDERS STAY LOYAL TO OUR RESTAURANT BRANDS AND VALUE THEM AS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THEIR LIVES. WE WANT OUR COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE TO MAKE IT A LEADER IN OUR INDUSTRY.  WE ARE HEADQUARTERED IN HOUSTON, TEXAS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IS LOCATED AT 13111 NORTHWEST FREEWAY, SUITE 600, HOUSTON, TEXAS 77040, AND OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER AT THAT ADDRESS IS (713) 329-6800. OUR WEBSITE IS WWW.LUBYSINC.COM. THE INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE IS NOT, AND SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE, A PART OF THIS FORM 10-Q OR INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO ANY OF OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC.  AS OF  DECEMBER 18, 2019  , WE OWNED AND OPERATED  119  RESTAURANTS, OF WHICH  78  ARE TRADITIONAL CAFETERIAS,  40  ARE GOURMET HAMBURGER RESTAURANTS, AND ONE IS A CASUAL DINING RESTAURANT AND BAR. THESE ESTABLISHMENTS ARE LOCATED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RETAIL CENTERS, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL AREAS MOSTLY THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. INCLUDED IN THE  119  RESTAURANTS THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE ARE 12 RESTAURANTS LOCATED AT SIX PROPERTY LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE A SIDE-BY-SIDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA AND FUDDRUCKERS ON THE SAME PROPERTY. WE REFER TO THESE LOCATIONS AS \u201cCOMBO LOCATIONS.\u201d  AS OF  DECEMBER 18, 2019  , WE OPERATED  33  CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES LOCATIONS. WE OPERATED 22 OF THESE LOCATIONS IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS AREA, THREE IN DALLAS, TEXAS, THREE IN THE TEXAS LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, TWO IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, ONE IN NORTHWEST TEXAS ONE IN KANSAS, AND ONE IN NORTH CAROLINA. LUBY\u2019S CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES CURRENTLY PROVIDES FOOD SERVICE MANAGEMENT TO HOSPITALS, CORPORATE DINING FACILITIES, SPORTS STADIUMS, AND A SENIOR CARE FACILITY.  AS OF  DECEMBER 18, 2019  , WE HAD  37  FRANCHISE OWNERS OPERATING  97  FUDDRUCKERS RESTAURANTS. OUR LARGEST  6  FRANCHISE OWNERS OWN FIVE TO TWELVE RESTAURANTS EACH AND  12  FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN TWO TO FOUR RESTAURANTS. THE  19  REMAINING FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN ONE RESTAURANT.  ACCOUNTING PERIODS  THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST. ACCORDINGLY, EACH FISCAL YEAR NORMALLY CONSISTS OF 13 FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR ACCOUNTING PERIODS, ACCOUNTING FOR 364 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. HOWEVER, EVERY FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR, WE HAVE A FISCAL YEAR THAT CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS, ACCOUNTING FOR 371 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER CONSISTS OF FOUR FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 16 WEEKS, AND THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 12 WEEKS, IN LENGTH. THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  35  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 18, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 19, 2018  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 15.4% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019. WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HEMOSTASIS MANAGEMENT REVENUE INCREASED 17.2% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019.  PLASMA  PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED  6.9%  AND  8.8%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PLASMA REVENUE INCREASED  7.3%  AND  9.2%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN VOLUME OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  . FAVORABLE NEXSYS PCS PRICING AND INCREASES IN SALES OF SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN PLASMA LIQUID SOLUTIONS, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS USING CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, HOWEVER, WE EXPECT DECLINES IN OUR PLASMA LIQUIDS REVENUE BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THIS BUSINESS.  BLOOD CENTER  BLOOD CENTER REVENUE INCREASED  0.7%  AND DECREASED  1.1%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, BLOOD CENTER REVENUE INCREASED  0.6%  AND DECREASED  0.5%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF APHERESIS PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SOFTWARE REVENUE AND WHOLE BLOOD DISPOSABLES. THE DECREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN WHOLE BLOOD DISPOSABLES AND SOFTWARE REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN APHERESIS PRODUCTS. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE APHERESIS BUSINESS DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ORDER TIMING, THE BENEFIT OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND TO BE FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY ADDITIONAL DECLINES AS CERTAIN CUSTOMERS CONVERT TO ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY. THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF THIS APHERESIS BUSINESS IS AN INCREMENTAL REVENUE DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR AND $17 MILLION IN FISCAL 2021 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2020.  26  HOSPITAL  HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  6.4%  AND  3.8%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  7.1%  AND  4.9%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH OF DISPOSABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TEG  \u00ae  DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES. IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS. THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES DUE TO THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SALES OF OUR ORTHOPAT PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2019.

WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, GROSS PROFIT INCREASED  15.4%  AND  22.3%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE PRICING DRIVEN BY THE ANNUALIZATION OF NEXSYS PCS DEVICE CONVERSIONS, MIX AND INCREMENTAL SAVINGS FROM THE 2020 PROGRAM. THE ABSENCE OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT WERE INCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.

WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED  22.0%  AND  18.7%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE DECREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS MADE IN CLINICAL PROGRAMS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS, WHICH WAS RECEIVED IN MAY 2019.  27  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  5.9%  AND  0.7%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  6.5%  AND  1.5%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS, AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS AND INCREASES IN BOTH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND VARIABLE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SAVINGS FROM BOTH THE 2020 PROGRAM AND THE 2018 PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GAIN RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAINTREE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PARTIAL OFFSET DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS  WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $1.9  MILLION AND  $50.6  MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TRANSFER TO CSL OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY TO CSL. REFER TO NOTE 4,  DIVESTITURE  , TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS AGREEMENT. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WE RECORDED OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS TOTALING  $1.9  MILLION.  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE FROM OUR $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN AND $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING LOAN ENTERED INTO ON JUNE 15, 2018, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE MAJORITY OF EXPENSE, DECREASED BY  $0.3 MILLION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 DUE TO HIGHER TERM LOAN BORROWINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY  $1.4 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BALANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  3.0%.  INCOME TAXES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES. OUR REPORTED TAX RATE IS IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AS THE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE TAX RATES THAT DIFFER FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE.  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , WE REPORTED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $7.9 MILLION AND $6.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 21.0% AND 9.6%, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  INCLUDES DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED FROM EXCESS STOCK COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS OF $3.1 MILLION AND $12.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS AND THE IMPACT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE UNION LIQUID SOLUTIONS OPERATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. REFER TO NOTE 4,  DIVESTITURE  , TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS DIVESTITURE.  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  , WE REPORTED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $7.2 MILLION AND $17.6 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 28.2% AND 34.0%, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  INCLUDES A DISCRETE STOCK COMPENSATION WINDFALL BENEFIT OF $1.8 MILLION AND $5.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  WAS HIGHER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF $21.2 MILLION RECORDED IN PRETAX INCOME FOR WHICH NO TAX BENEFIT WAS RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAINTAINED AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE IMPACTED JURISDICTION.  28  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE BELIEVE DEPICT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW POSITION.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  MARCH 30,  2019  CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS  $126,417  $169,351  WORKING CAPITAL  $325,883  $340,362  CURRENT RATIO  2.3  2.4  NET DEBT  (1)  $(245,287  )  $(180,769  )  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (DSO)  59  67  INVENTORY TURNOVER  1.9  2.5  (1)  NET DEBT POSITION IS THE SUM OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LESS TOTAL DEBT.  IN JULY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE 2020 PROGRAM. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $60 MILLION AND $70 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2020 PROGRAM. THESE CHARGES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTLAYS, INCLUDING SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS, WILL BE INCURRED AS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THESE INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF FISCAL 2023. DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY INCURRED  $3.9 MILLION  AND  $6.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. WE BELIEVE THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR EXPECTED CASH OUTLAYS RELATE PRIMARILY TO INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION OF THE NEXSYS PCS AND PLASMA PLANT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT AND RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND INITIATIVES.  AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD  $126.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS HELD IN THE U.S. OR IN COUNTRIES FROM WHICH IT CAN BE REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED FOR A  $350.0 MILLION  TERM LOAN AND A $350.0 MILLION  REVOLVING LOAN. INTEREST ON THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING LOAN IS ESTABLISHED USING LIBOR PLUS  1.13%  -  1.75%  , DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY NON-FINANCIAL AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS. AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , $328.1 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN WITH AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF  3.0%  AND $45.0 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE ALSO HAD  $25.4 MILLION  OF UNCOMMITTED OPERATING LINES OF CREDIT TO FUND OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS UNDER WHICH THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019.  WE HAVE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF  $4.4 MILLION  REQUIRED DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER BANK COVENANTS AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019.  CASH FLOWS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018  INCREASE/  (DECREASE)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE HAVE REMOVED THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY THROUGHOUT OUR CASH FLOW STATEMENT, EXCEPT FOR ITS EFFECT ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  29  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $26.8 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW DRIVEN LARGELY BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY BUILD TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICES, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED PAYROLL AND THE IMPACT OF NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES. THE WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $90.9 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD DUE TO SPEND RELATED TO THE NEXSYS PCS LAUNCH AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS IN OUR PLASMA BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR PLASMA LIQUID SOLUTIONS OPERATIONS AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAINTREE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $85.0 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BORROWINGS, NET OF PAYMENTS, ON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND BY INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY LIMITED DUE TO OUR LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THEIR DIVERSITY ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. CERTAIN MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES, HOWEVER, CAN EXPOSE US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PLASMA BUSINESS UNIT, SALES ARE CONCENTRATED WITH SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXTENDED TO ANY ONE OF THESE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL CUSTOMERS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AT ANY POINT IN TIME. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. INCLUDE SALES TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT DELAYS AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAYMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS OF THOSE COUNTRIES' NATIONAL ECONOMIES.  WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE ALL RECEIVABLES FOR POTENTIAL COLLECTION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CUSTOMERS OR THE COUNTRIES' HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DETERIORATE SUCH THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  INFLATION  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. HISTORICALLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION BY IMPROVING OUR MANUFACTURING AND PURCHASING EFFICIENCIES, BY INCREASING EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND BY ADJUSTING THE SELLING PRICES OF PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR INFLATION PRESSURES GENERALLY AND RAW MATERIALS INDICES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM DERIVATIVES COULD RESULT IN CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN OUR COSTS TO PROCURE PLASTIC RAW MATERIALS.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  ,  35.4%  AND  35.3%  , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., GENERALLY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, YET OUR REPORTING CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE ALSO INCUR CERTAIN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN LOCAL CURRENCY. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATE TO SALES DENOMINATED IN EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CHINESE YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT. THE YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXPOSURE IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SOURCING PRODUCTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  SINCE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXCEED THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND, CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT OUR PRIMARY CASH FLOWS RELATE TO PRODUCT COSTS OR COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LOCAL OPERATIONS. WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THESE CURRENCIES, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  30  WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MINIMIZE, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THE UNFORESEEN IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE UTILIZE FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY JAPANESE YEN AND EURO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SWISS FRANCS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS. THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE VOLATILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, BUT BECAUSE WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ONE YEAR OUT, RATES ARE FIXED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, THEREBY FACILITATING FINANCIAL PLANNING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THESE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FINAL IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS HEDGED AND THE ACTUAL LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  STANDARDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") UPDATE NO. 2016-13, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326). ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS INTENDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING FORECASTED INFORMATION, TO DEVELOP CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15, INTANGIBLES, GOODWILL AND OTHER - INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40). THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2019-12, INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740). THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL IMPROVE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF AND SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY REMOVING CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPALS IN TOPIC 740. ASC UPDATE NO. 2019-12 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2022. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  CERTAIN STATEMENTS THAT WE MAKE FROM TIME TO TIME, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS REPORT, CONSTITUTE \u201cFORWARD LOOKING-STATEMENTS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \"EXCHANGE ACT\").

COMPARABLE STORE SALES REFLECT THE POINT AT WHICH MERCHANDISE AND SERVICE ORDERS ARE FULFILLED AND DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, EXCLUDING SHIPPING AND DELIVERY, AND ARE NET OF DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS. WHEN A  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STORE IS RELOCATED, WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER NET SALES FROM THAT STORE TO BE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. A STORE TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE IN THE FISCAL MONTH IT IS CLOSED. THE STORE THEN BECOMES COMPARABLE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL MONTH IN WHICH IT REOPENS. NET SALES FROM OUR WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES) ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN CALCULATIONS OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  (2)  WE HAVE PRESENTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND LEONARD GREEN AND PARTNERS, L.P. (\u201cLGP\u201d) TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN EVALUATING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING ON OUR GAAP RESULTS IN ADDITION TO USING NON-GAAP MEASURES SUPPLEMENTALLY. OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED CAPTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATION. PLEASE REFER TO FOOTNOTES (3) AND (4) OF THIS TABLE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING WHY WE BELIEVE EACH NON-GAAP MEASURE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL PURPOSES FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT USES EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ALSO REFERS TO ELFA THIRD-PARTY NET SALES AFTER THE CONVERSION OF ELFA\u2019S NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DISCLOSURE OF ELFA THIRD-PARTY NET SALES WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE.  (3)  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP. WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION UNDER OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. ADJUSTED EBITDA REFLECTS FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO EBITDA TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN NON-CASH AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IN OUR EVALUATION OF ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q BECAUSE THEY ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN CONNECTION WITH COVENANT COMPLIANCE AND EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, AND WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY, ITS EXECUTIVES AND OUR COVENANT COMPLIANCE, AS APPLICABLE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT GAAP MEASURES OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS. ADDITIONALLY,  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE MEASURES OF FREE CASH FLOW FOR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCRETIONARY USE, AS THEY DO NOT REFLECT CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TAX PAYMENTS, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STORE OPENINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CASH COSTS THAT MAY RECUR IN THE FUTURE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA CONTAIN CERTAIN OTHER LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES, CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND CASH COSTS TO REPLACE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED. IN EVALUATING ADJUSTED EBITDA, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION, SUCH AS PRE-OPENING COSTS AND STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE. OUR PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING ON OUR GAAP RESULTS IN ADDITION TO USING EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA SUPPLEMENTALLY. OUR MEASURES OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED CAPTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATION.  A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS SET FORTH BELOW.

THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE SWEDISH TAX RATE AND THE BENEFIT OF THE FINALIZATION OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, A $100,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW), AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, DIRECT MATERIALS, PAYROLL, STORE LEASES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND UPDATING EXISTING STORES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING BUILDING OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER, AND ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OTHER CURRENT AND NONCURRENT LIABILITIES, TAXES RECEIVABLE AND TAXES PAYABLE. OUR LIQUIDITY FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF OUR BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND AS A RESULT, OUR BORROWINGS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER DURING  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THESE PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. OUR BORROWINGS GENERALLY INCREASE IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AS WE PREPARE FOR OUR ANNUAL SHELVING SALE, THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM OF LOANS, BONDS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT OR EQUITY, TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AT DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE HAD $13,971 OF CASH, OF WHICH $5,935 WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $38,352 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY $11,774 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019.  THERE WERE $4,276 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE.

NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1,136 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NON-CASH ITEMS OF $27,260 AND NET INCOME OF $1,959 WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $30,355. THE NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORY, COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORY IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY BUILD-UP RELATED TO THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SEASONALITY OF SALES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TIMING OF INVENTORY RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS.

NON-CASH ITEMS OF $29,029 AND NET INCOME OF $5,798 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $17,004.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $36,751 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019. THIS INCLUDED NET PROCEEDS OF $46,000 FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REPAYMENTS OF $5,365 FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PAYMENTS OF $3,512 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, AND $372 FOR TAXES PAID WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15,737 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THIS INCLUDED NET PROCEEDS OF $42,000 FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PAYMENTS OF $23,751 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $2,384, AND $128 FOR TAXES PAID WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, TCS HAD A TOTAL OF $38,352 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND $58,000 OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, ELFA HAD A TOTAL OF $11,774 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  WE PRESENT FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH WE DEFINE AS NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN A PERIOD MINUS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MADE IN THAT PERIOD, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL LIQUIDITY, AS THE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW GENERATED IN ANY PERIOD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT REPAYMENT, INVESTMENT, AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY AND NON-DISCRETIONARY CASH USES. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT. OUR DEFINITION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT SOLELY REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS A MEASURE THAT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ALTHOUGH OTHER COMPANIES REPORT THEIR FREE CASH FLOW, NUMEROUS METHODS MAY EXIST FOR CALCULATING A COMPANY\u2019S FREE CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT, THE METHOD USED BY OUR  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT TO CALCULATE OUR FREE CASH FLOW MAY DIFFER FROM THE METHODS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE THEIR FREE CASH FLOW.  OUR FREE CASH FLOW FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF SEASONALITY OF NET SALES, BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND TIMING OF INVESTMENTS IN NEW STORE OPENINGS, EXISTING STORE REMODELS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HISTORICALLY, OUR FREE CASH FLOW HAS BEEN LOWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO LOWER NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND AS SUCH, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FULL YEAR. OUR FREE CASH FLOW OF -$30,432 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 HAS DECREASED AS COMPARED TO -$3,505 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018, DUE TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019. WE DO EXPECT OUR FREE CASH FLOW TO INCREASE IN FISCAL 2020 AS OUR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR THE OPENING OF THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED ONCE IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A RECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO FREE CASH FLOW.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(1,136)  $17,823  LESS: ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  (29,296)  (21,328)  FREE CASH FLOW  $(30,432)  $(3,505)  SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. AND CERTAIN OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO (THE \u201cSENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY\u201d). ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2018 (THE \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE\u201d), THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AMENDED THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO SEPTEMBER 14, 2023, (II) DECREASE THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO 5.00% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 4.00% FOR BASE RATE LOANS AND, BEGINNING FROM THE DATE THAT A COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS DELIVERED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, ALLOW THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO STEP DOWN TO 4.75% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 3.75% FOR BASE RATE LOANS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.75:1.00, AND (III) IMPOSE A 1.00% PREMIUM IF A VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT IS MADE FROM THE PROCEEDS OF A REPRICING TRANSACTION WITHIN 12 MONTHS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, WE REPAID $20,000 OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WHICH REDUCED THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO $272,500.  WE DREW DOWN A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $10,000 ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS $253,985  AND THE INTEREST RATE ON SUCH BORROWINGS IS LIBOR +5.00%, SUBJECT TO A LIBOR FLOOR OF 1.00%. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY PROVIDES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF $1,703 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023, WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2023.  THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTORS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS) (OTHER THAN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS) AND (B) A SECOND PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE ASSETS SECURING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS AND ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, AMONG THESE AN EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) REQUIREMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.

THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS AUGUST 18, 2022.  THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE FACILITY IS $100,000.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST AT LIBOR+1.25%. IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES AN UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL REVOLVING FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF LENDER COMMITMENTS AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT PROCEEDS ARE TO BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND ALLOWS FOR SWING LINE ADVANCES OF UP TO $15,000 AND THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OF UP TO $40,000.  THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS LIMITED BY REFERENCE TO A BORROWING BASE FORMULA BASED UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND RESERVES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. AS A RESULT OF THE BORROWING BASE FORMULA, THE ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE LESS THAN THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY).  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, CONSISTING OF INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND (B) A SECOND-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, AND ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS).

THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A CONSOLIDATED FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0 IF EXCESS AVAILABILITY IS LESS THAN $10,000 AT ANY TIME. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED  ITS  MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK AB  ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 1, 2014 AND THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES THEREUNDER, AND ENTERED INTO A NEW MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK ABP, FILIAL I SVERIGE (\u201cNORDEA BANK\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF (I) AN SEK 110.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $11,774 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d), (II) UPON ELFA\u2019S REQUEST, AN ADDITIONAL SEK 115.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $12,309 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ADDITIONAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY, THE \u201c2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES\u201d), AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (III) AN UNCOMMITTED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 25.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $2,676 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF NORDEA BANK\u2019S COMMITMENT AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY\u201d, TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES, THE \u201c2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE TERM FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES BEGAN ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND MATURES ON APRIL 1, 2024. LOANS BORROWED UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA BANK\u2019S BASE RATE +1.40%. ANY LOAN BORROWED UNDER THE INCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT STIBOR +1.70%.  THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SECURED BY THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS OF ELFA. THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES, AS WELL AS THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO OUR ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  , FILED WITH THE SEC ON  MAY 30, 2019.  CERTAIN OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, AS THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE DEPICTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUCH POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  , FILED WITH THE SEC ON  MAY 30, 2019. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02,  LEASES  , WHICH IS UPDATED BELOW.  LEASES  WE RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT, MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FIXED FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE HAVE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS. THEREFORE, LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY INCLUDE ALL FIXED PAYMENTS IN THE LEASE ARRANGEMENT. WE RECORD A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE LIABILITY, INCREASED FOR ANY PREPAID LEASE COSTS AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS AND REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES. WE REMEASURE THE LEASE LIABILITY AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET WHEN A CHANGE TO OUR FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OCCURS. LEASE EXPENSE ON OPERATING LEASES IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE AND IS RECORDED IN SG&A.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, AND THE EXERCISE OF RENEWAL OPTIONS. OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE; THEREFORE, WE UTILIZE AN INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE TO CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE REPRESENTS THE RATE OF INTEREST WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ON A COLLATERALIZED BORROWING, FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS, OVER A SIMILAR TERM AND IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF OUR LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS. THE OPTION PERIODS ARE GENERALLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE LEASE TERM USED TO MEASURE OUR LEASE LIABILITIES AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS UPON COMMENCEMENT AS EXERCISE OF THE OPTIONS IS NOT REASONABLY CERTAIN. WE REMEASURE THE LEASE LIABILITY AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET WHEN WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE A RENEWAL OPTION.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT LEASES SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 3 IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, FILED WITH THE SEC ON MAY 30, 2019, OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING DIRECT AND INDIRECT  LABOR, MATERIALS, SERVICES, FIXED COSTS FOR RENT, UTILITIES AND  DEPRECIATION, AND VARIABLE OVERHEAD. GROSS MARGIN SHOULD NOT BE  CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPERATING INCOME OR NET INCOME, WHICH  ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT GROSS  MARGIN, ALTHOUGH A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USEFUL AND  MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS A BASIS FOR MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS.  IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATES OUR COST  STRUCTURE AND PROVIDES FUNDS FOR OUR TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE  USE GROSS MARGIN IN MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND  HAVE HISTORICALLY ANALYZED AND REPORTED GROSS MARGIN INFORMATION  PUBLICLY. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE GROSS MARGIN IN A DIFFERENT  MANNER.  INTRODUCTION  WE WERE INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1992 AS THE SUCCESSOR TO  LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A NEW MEXICO LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP, FORMED IN 1989, AND ITS PREDECESSOR, INTEGRATED SOLAR  TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, A NEW MEXICO CORPORATION, FORMED IN 1985.

LATE IN FISCAL 2019, THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED FROM  39,000 TO 55,000 SQUARE FEET TO ADD CAPACITY FOR POLISHING TO  SUPPORT OUR GROWING INFRARED BUSINESS.  IN DECEMBER 2016, WE ACQUIRED ISP, AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY,  ISP LATVIA. ISP IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MANUFACTURER OFFERING A  FULL RANGE OF INFRARED PRODUCTS FROM CUSTOM INFRARED OPTICAL  ELEMENTS TO CATALOG AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE LENS ASSEMBLIES.

RECENT ORGANIZATIONAL AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  TO ENSURE WE FULLY LEVERAGE THE EXPANDED CAPABILITIES AND MANAGE  THE BROADER PRODUCT PORTFOLIO THAT WE NOW HAVE, WE BEGUN  INTRODUCING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IN JULY 2019. WE CREATED AND  FILLED THE POSITION OF CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. THIS POSITION  COMBINES ALL OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING, SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS  UNDER ONE LEADER TO ENSURE THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE TIES BETWEEN DEMAND  AND SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL ENSURE THE BEST  COORDINATION BETWEEN TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THE  POSITION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING ANNUAL PLAN OBJECTIVES,  I.E.  , REVENUES, GROSS MARGIN, CONTROLLABLE OPERATING  INCOME AND RETURN ON ASSET OBJECTIVES. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, WITH A PRODUCT MANAGER FOR EACH OF OUR  MAJOR PRODUCT CAPABILITIES: MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS  AND CUSTOM DESIGNED OPTICS. PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IS PRINCIPALLY A  PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT ANALYZES PRODUCTS WITHIN THE  PRODUCT CAPABILITY AREAS AS DEFINED ABOVE. THIS FUNCTION WILL  FACILITATE CHOOSING INVESTMENT PRIORITIES AND ENSURING SUCCESSFUL  PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO DEFINED, BUT NOT  FILLED, THE POSITION OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC BUSINESS  ASSESSMENT. THIS PERSON WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STRATEGICALLY  ALIGNING LIGHPATH\u2019S COMPETENCIES WITH STRATEGIC INDUSTRY  REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND WILL MANAGE THE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  FUNCTION.  21  PRODUCT GROUPS AND MARKETS  IN FISCAL 2019, WE REORGANIZED OUR BUSINESS INTO THREE PRODUCT  GROUPS: PMO, INFRARED PRODUCTS AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. THESE  PRODUCT GROUPS ARE SUPPORTED BY OUR MAJOR PRODUCT CAPABILITIES.  MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS, AND CUSTOM DESIGNED  OPTICS.  OUR PMO PRODUCT GROUP CONSISTS OF VISIBLE PRECISION MOLDED OPTICS  WITH VARYING APPLICATIONS. OUR INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP IS COMPRISED  OF INFRARED OPTICS, BOTH MOLDED AND DIAMOND-TURNED, AND THERMAL  IMAGING ASSEMBLIES.

IN ADDITION, BOTH PRODUCT GROUPS OFFER BOTH CATALOG  AND CUSTOM DESIGNED OPTICS.  OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCT GROUP IS COMPRISED OF VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS,  SUCH AS OPTICAL SUBSYSTEMS, ASSEMBLIES, AND COLLIMATORS, AND  NON-RECURRING ENGINEERING (\u201cNRE\u201d) PRODUCTS, CONSISTING  OF THOSE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP PURSUANT TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  AGREEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO WITH CUSTOMERS. TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS  APPROACH US AND REQUEST THAT WE DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR  APPLICATIONS FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS TO FIT THEIR PARTICULAR  NEEDS OR SPECIFICATIONS. THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF ANY SUCH PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.  WE HAVE ALSO ALIGNED OUR MARKETING EFFORTS BY OUR CAPABILITIES  (  I.E.,  MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS, AND CUSTOM  OPTICS), AND THEN BY INDUSTRY. WE CURRENTLY SERVE THE FOLLOWING  MAJOR MARKETS: DEFENSE AND SECURITY, OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND  COMPONENTS, DATACOM/TELECOM, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, LIFE SCIENCES,  MACHINE VISION AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY. CUSTOMERS IN EACH OF  THESE MARKETS MAY SELECT THE BEST OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUIT  THEIR NEEDS FROM OUR ENTIRE SUITE OF PRODUCTS, AVAILING US TO  CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES, PARTICULARLY WHERE WE CAN LEVERAGE OUR  KNOWLEDGE BASE AGAINST OUR EXPANDING DESIGN LIBRARY. WITHIN OUR  PRODUCT GROUPS, WE HAVE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS THAT SERVE OUR MAJOR  MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INFRARED PRODUCTS CAN BE USED FOR GAS  SENSING DEVICES, SPECTROMETERS, NIGHT VISION SYSTEMS, ADVANCED  DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS (\u201cADAS\u201d), THERMAL WEAPON GUN  SIGHTS, AND INFRARED COUNTER MEASURE SYSTEMS, AMONG  OTHERS.  THE PHOTONICS MARKET DRIVES OUR GROWTH AND IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT  APPLICATION AREAS: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY,  DISPLAY, LIGHTING, PHOTOVOLTAIC, PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY, LIFE  SCIENCES, AND MEASUREMENT AND AUTOMATED VISION. IN 2018, THE MARKET  SIZE FOR THESE APPLICATIONS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WAS ESTIMATED AT  APPROXIMATELY $556 BILLION. LIGHTPATH HAS PRODUCT APPLICATIONS IN  SIX OF THE EIGHT APPLICATION AREAS, ALL EXCEPT FOR DISPLAYS AND  PHOTOVOLTAIC. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST MARKETS AND MARKETS SURVEY,  THESE SIX APPLICATION AREAS HAD AN ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF  APPROXIMATELY $401 BILLION AND ARE GROWING AT A 7% COMPOUND ANNUAL  GROWTH RATE. WITHIN THE LARGER OVERALL MARKETS, WE BELIEVE THERE IS  A MARKET OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION FOR OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS AND  CAPABILITIES. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE OUR PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE  SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND,  THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS IN EACH  OF THESE MAJOR MARKETS. IN ADDITION TO THESE MAJOR MARKETS, A LARGE  PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO UNAFFILIATED  COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS TO FULFILL THEIR  CUSTOMERS\u2019 ORDERS, AS WELL AS UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES THAT  OFFER OUR PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN THEIR CATALOGS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO  LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY, KNOW-HOW, ESTABLISHED LOW-COST  MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY AND PARTNERSHIPS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. OUR  PRODUCT MANAGERS FOCUS ON PURSUING CUSTOMER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES  WHERE OUR DIFFERENTIAL ADVANTAGES COINCIDE WITH KEY CUSTOMER  NEEDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL SECOND QUARTER: THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019,  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  REVENUES.  REVENUE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $9.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, OR 12%, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. REVENUE  GENERATED BY INFRARED PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION IN  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.3 MILLION, OR 34%, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF ORDER SHIPMENTS AGAINST A LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL  CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, REVENUE FROM THIS CONTRACT WAS LOWER, AS WE  HAD SHIPPED THE BALANCE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT BEFORE THE RENEWAL  WAS FINALIZED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CUSTOMER  REQUESTED THAT WE ACCELERATE SHIPMENTS THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD  PREVIOUSLY DELAYED IN THE PRECEDING QUARTER BECAUSE OF DELAYS IT  EXPERIENCED FOR OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN; THUS, ORDER  SHIPMENTS RELATED TO THIS LARGE CONTRACT WERE HIGHER IN THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019. ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, THESE ORDERS CANNOT  BE DELAYED BEYOND MARCH 31, 2020 AND, THEREFORE, THE BALANCE OF  THIS ORDER MUST SHIP NEXT QUARTER. REVENUE GENERATED BY PMO  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO $4.1 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $416,000, OR 10%.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN  SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET, AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE  AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS  WAS APPROXIMATELY $885,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $193,000, OR 28%, COMPARED TO $693,000 IN  THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS  PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL  AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.  22  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $3.9 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.5  MILLION IN SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL COST OF  SALES WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $5.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE INCREASES IN GROSS MARGIN AND COST OF SALES  ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES. GROSS MARGIN AS A  PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 41% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. GIVEN THE  SHIFT IN REVENUE TOWARD INFRARED PRODUCTS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE  LOWER MARGINS THAN PMO PRODUCTS, THIS ACTUALLY REFLECTS AN OVERALL  IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGINS, DUE TO OUR IMPROVED COST STRUCTURE  AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE IRVINGTON  FACILITY RELOCATION IN JUNE 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) COSTS  WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 13%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $2.5 MILLION IN THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. SG&A  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY  $200,000 OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE RELOCATION OF THE  IRVINGTON FACILITY TO OUR EXISTING ORLANDO FACILITY AND RIGA  FACILITY. THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECTS SAVINGS FROM  THE ABSENCE OF THESE NON-RECURRING COSTS, AS WELL AS REDUCED  PERSONNEL AND OVERHEAD COSTS RESULTING FROM THE RESTRUCTURING  ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON FACILITY. WE EXPECT  FUTURE SG&A COSTS TO CONTINUE TO REFLECT REDUCED OPERATING AND  OVERHEAD COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR  MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $469,000 IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF 10%, AS COMPARED TO  APPROXIMATELY $519,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THIS DECREASE IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE A  DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PERSONNEL  FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO OUR NEWLY CREATED PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  FUNCTION, FOR WHICH EXPENSES ARE NOW INCLUDED IN SG&A  COSTS.  THIS DECREASE IN  PERSONNEL COSTS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PATENT  APPLIATION FILING EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  APPROXIMATELY $89,000, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $153,000 IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST  EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH  THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019. WE EXPECT THAT INTEREST EXPENSE WILL REMAIN NEAR  CURRENT LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME, NET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $123,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF APPROXIMATELY  $48,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RESULTING  FROM NET GAINS AND LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE  TRANSACTIONS. WE EXECUTE ALL FOREIGN SALES FROM OUR U.S. FACILITIES  AND INTER-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS, PARTIALLY  MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-UNITED STATES CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY  THE CHINESE YUAN AND EURO, ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE  PREVAILING ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE  TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE YEAR. DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE  INCURRED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OF  APPROXIMATELY $119,000, COMPARED TO NET FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSACTION LOSSES OF $50,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR.  INCOME TAXES.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX  EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $322,000, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCOME  TAXES FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA AND CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES  ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND DECLARED BY LPOIZ DURING  THE QUARTER. WHILE THIS REPATRIATION TRANSACTION RESULTED IN SOME  ADDITIONAL CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES, LPOIZ CURRENTLY QUALIFIES FOR  A REDUCED CHINESE INCOME TAX RATE; THEREFORE, THE TOTAL TAX ON  THOSE EARNINGS WAS STILL BELOW THE NORMAL INCOME TAX RATE. THIS  COMPARES TO A NET INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $23,000  RECORDED FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH WAS COMPRISED  OF A TAX BENEFIT ON LOSSES IN THE U.S. JURISDICTION, OFFSET BY TAX  EXPENSE ON INCOME GENERATED IN CHINA. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE  8,  INCOME  TAXES  , IN THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $769,000, OR $0.03 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, COMPARED  TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $16,000, OR $0.00 BASIC AND DILUTED  EARNINGS PER SHARE, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE  INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS  COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES, RESULTING IN HIGHER GROSS  MARGIN, COUPLED WITH A DECREASE IN EXPENSES FOR SG&A AND  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES. THESE DIFFERENCES INCREASED OPERATING  INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $863,000 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. IN  ADDITION, THERE WERE FAVORABLE DIFFERENCES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND  FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES, OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE  DIFFERENCE OF $345,000 IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON STOCK SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE 25,837,903  AND 27,361,273 BASIC AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 25,781,941 AND 27,397,239 BASIC  AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE BASIC COMMON STOCK SHARES, AND  DECREASE IN WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED COMMON STOCK SHARES, WAS DUE  TO THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014  ESPP AND UPON THE EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS.  23  FISCAL FIRST HALF: SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  REVENUES.  REVENUE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY $17.1  MILLION, AN INCREASE OF LESS THAN 1%, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME  PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. REVENUE GENERATED BY INFRARED  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, AN INCREASE OF 3%, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION IN  THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INFRARED  PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF MOLDED  INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6  MATERIAL. REVENUES FROM SHIPMENTS AGAINST THE LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL  CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS DURING THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2020 WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019.  REVENUE GENERATED BY PMO PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF 5%, AS COMPARED TO  $7.2 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE  DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES  TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE MARKETS, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS. REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR SPECIALTY  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 11%, AS COMPARED TO $1.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS  PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL  AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF  SPECIALTY PRODUCTS TO A MEDICAL CUSTOMER, DUE TO TIMING OF  ORDERS.  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $6.3 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 4%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $6.6  MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL COST OF  SALES WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, COMPARED TO $10.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 37% FOR  THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 39% FOR THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES, AND DECREASE IN  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, IS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS  THAT IMPACTED THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY  MITIGATED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FIRST, GROSS  MARGINS FOR OUR PMO PRODUCTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER  DUTIES AND FREIGHT CHARGES RESULTING FROM INCREASED TARIFFS  BEGINNING IN JUNE 2019. THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS INCREASED COST OF  SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020; HOWEVER, THESE COSTS  WERE MITIGATED IN THE SECOND QUARTER BY THE STRATEGIES WE  IMPLEMENTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. SECOND, GROSS MARGINS FOR  INFRARED PRODUCTS WERE IMPACTED BY YIELD ISSUES RELATED TO OUR BD6  PRODUCTS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER COSTS DURING THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. YIELDS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS TAKEN EARLY IN  THE SECOND QUARTER. VOLUMES CONTINUE TO INCREASE FOR OUR BD6-BASED  INFRARED MOLDED PRODUCTS, AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD CONVERTING  GERMANIUM-BASED DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS TO OUR BD6  MATERIAL, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR INFRARED  MARGINS OVER TIME.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, SG&A COSTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9%, AS  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. SG&A FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019  INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $291,000 OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES RELATED  TO THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON FACILITY TO OUR EXISTING ORLANDO  FACILITY AND RIGA FACILITY. THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECTS  SAVINGS FROM THE ABSENCE OF THESE NON-RECURRING COSTS, AS WELL AS  REDUCED PERSONNEL AND OVERHEAD COSTS RESULTING FROM THE  RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON  FACILITY.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $897,000 IN THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9%, AS  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $989,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING  OF PERSONNEL FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO OUR NEWLY CREATED PRODUCT  MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, FOR WHICH EXPENSES ARE NOW INCLUDED IN  SG&A. THE DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASES IN PATENT EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF  FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  APPROXIMATELY $188,000, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $298,000 IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST  EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH  THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019.  OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $393,000 IN THE FIRST HALF OF  FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $387,000 IN THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM NET LOSSES ON FOREIGN  EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS. WE EXECUTE ALL FOREIGN SALES FROM OUR U.S.  FACILITIES AND INTER-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS,  PARTIALLY MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-UNITED STATES CURRENCIES,  PRIMARILY THE CHINESE YUAN AND EURO, ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF  EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, AND REVENUES AND  EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE YEAR.  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE INCURRED NET FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSACTION LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $376,000, COMPARED TO  $388,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  24  INCOME TAXES.  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX  EXPENSE OF $470,000, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCOME TAXES FROM OUR  OPERATIONS IN CHINA, AND CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH  THE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND DECLARED BY LPOIZ DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER. THIS COMPARES TO A NET INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $202,000 RECORDED FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH WAS  COMPRISED OF A TAX BENEFIT ON LOSSES IN THE U.S. JURISDICTION,  OFFSET BY TAX EXPENSE ON INCOME GENERATED IN CHINA. PLEASE REFER TO  NOTE 8,  INCOME  TAXES  , IN THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET INCOME (LOSS).  NET LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $606,000, OR $0.02 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE, COMPARED TO A  NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $567,000, OR $0.02 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS  PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE SLIGHT INCREASE  IN NET LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE  UNFAVORABLE DIFFERENCE OF $673,000 IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $529,000 IN OPERATING INCOME,  COUPLED WITH A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $111,000.  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON STOCK SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE TO  25,832,337, FOR BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, COMPARED TO 25,777,330, FOR BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, IN THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE  BASIC COMMON STOCK SHARES WAS DUE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CLASS A  COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP AND UPON THE EXERCISES OF STOCK  OPTIONS AND RSUS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5  MILLION AND TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.3  MILLION, OF WHICH, GREATER THAN 50% OF OUR CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE  GENERATED IN CHINA AND LATVIA AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.  BEFORE ANY FUNDS CAN BE REPATRIATED FROM CHINA THROUGH DIVIDENDS,  THE RETAINED EARNINGS OF THE LEGAL ENTITY MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 50%  OF ITS REGISTERED CAPITAL. BASED ON RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE END OF THE PRIOR STATUTORY TAX YEAR, LPOIZ  HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.5 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION AND LPOI  DID NOT HAVE ANY EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION.  DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE DECLARED AN  INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND OF $2 MILLION PAYABLE FROM LPOIZ TO US AS ITS  PARENT COMPANY, OF WHICH $1 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID TO US AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE REMAINING $1 MILLION WILL BE PAID TO US IN A  FUTURE PERIOD. THIS DIVIDEND IS FROM EARNINGS ACCUMULATED PRIOR TO  JANUARY 1, 2019. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO PERMANENTLY INVEST EARNINGS  GENERATED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2019, AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NOT PROVIDED  FOR FUTURE CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES ON SUCH RELATED  EARNINGS.  LOANS PAYABLE CONSISTS OF THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN PURSUANT TO THE  AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT. THE AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES  FOR A BANKUNITED REVOLVING LINE AND A GUIDANCE LINE. AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2019, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WAS  APPROXIMATELY $5.3 MILLION, AND WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON  THE BANKUNITED REVOLVING LINE OR GUIDANCE LINE.  THE AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT INCLUDES CERTAIN CUSTOMARY COVENANTS. AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS. FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 12,  LOANS  PAYABLE  , TO THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE GENERALLY RELY ON CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND EQUITY AND DEBT  OFFERINGS, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE, TO SATISFY OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND TO MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO REPAY THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO  RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN REVENUE OR A LACK OF  ANTICIPATED SALES GROWTH, INCREASED MATERIAL COSTS, INCREASED LABOR  COSTS, PLANNED PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS NOT BEING  REALIZED, INCREASES IN PROPERTY, CASUALTY, BENEFIT AND LIABILITY  INSURANCE PREMIUMS, AND INCREASES IN OTHER COSTS. WE WILL ALSO  CONTINUE EFFORTS TO KEEP COSTS UNDER CONTROL AS WE SEEK RENEWED  SALES GROWTH. OUR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARD GENERATING POSITIVE  CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY. IF THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL,  WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. SHOULD CAPITAL NOT BE  AVAILABLE TO US AT REASONABLE TERMS, OTHER ACTIONS MAY BECOME  NECESSARY IN ADDITION TO COST CONTROL MEASURES AND CONTINUED  EFFORTS TO INCREASE SALES. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE EXPLORING  STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE SALE OF THE COMPANY, THE SALE OF CERTAIN  PRODUCT LINES, THE CREATION OF JOINT VENTURES OR STRATEGIC  ALLIANCES UNDER WHICH WE WILL PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE  CREATION OF LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR TECHNOLOGY,  OR OTHER ALTERNATIVES.  CASH FLOWS \u2013 FINANCINGS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $489,000 IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $872,000 USED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020  REFLECTED APPROXIMATELY $501,000 IN PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR LOANS  AND FINANCE LEASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $12,000 IN  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019 WAS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY $897,000 IN PRINCIPAL  PAYMENTS ON OUR LOANS AND CAPITAL LEASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  APPROXIMATELY $25,000 IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CLASS A COMMON  STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP AND FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK  OPTIONS.  25  CASH FLOWS \u2013 OPERATING.  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $938,000 FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO CASH USED IN  OPERATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $398,000 FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN INVENTORY, COMPARED TO AN  INCREASE IN INVENTORY DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL  YEAR, AND COLLECTIONS ON OTHER RECEIVABLES DURING THE FIRST SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE ANTICIPATE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR CASH FLOWS  PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IN FUTURE YEARS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED  SALES GROWTH AND ANTICIPATED MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON  PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING THE RELOCATION OF OUR IRVINGTON  FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARGINAL INCREASES IN SALES AND  MARKETING AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS \u2013 INVESTING.  DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE  EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION IN INVESTMENTS  IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION,  INCLUDING EQUIPMENT FINANCED THROUGH CAPITAL LEASES, IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE RELATED TO  EXPANSION OF OUR BD6 MATERIAL PRODUCTION AND OUR INFRARED COATING  CAPACITY.  OVERALL, WE  ANTICIPATE THAT THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL  2020 WILL BE LOWER THAN IN FISCAL 2019, HOWEVER, THE TOTAL AMOUNT  EXPENDED WILL DEPEND ON OPPORTUNITIES AND  CIRCUMSTANCES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, OUR PRINCIPAL COMMITMENTS CONSISTED OF  OBLIGATIONS UNDER OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES AND DEBT AGREEMENTS.  NO MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020  IN OUR CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS TO REPAY DEBT OR TO MAKE  PAYMENTS UNDER OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES, OR IN OUR CONTINGENT  LIABILITIES AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES INVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST  ENTITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OTHER THAN THE POLICY CHANGES DISCLOSED IN NOTE 2,  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , TO THE  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF  PART I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL  CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN ITEM  7, MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2,  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  , TO THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES.  26  HOW WE OPERATE  WE HAVE CONTINUING SALES OF TWO BASIC TYPES: SALES VIA AD-HOC  PURCHASE ORDERS OF MOSTLY STANDARD PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS (OUR  \u201cTURNS\u201d BUSINESS) AND THE MORE CHALLENGING AND  POTENTIALLY MORE REWARDING BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS LATTER TYPE OF BUSINESS, WE WORK WITH  CUSTOMERS TO HELP THEM DETERMINE OPTICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND EVEN  CREATE CERTAIN OPTICAL DESIGNS FOR THEM, INCLUDING COMPLEX  MULTI-COMPONENT DESIGNS THAT WE CALL \u201cENGINEERED  ASSEMBLIES.\u201d THIS IS FOLLOWED BY \u201cSAMPLING\u201d SMALL  NUMBERS OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 TEST AND  EVALUATION. THEREAFTER, SHOULD A CUSTOMER CONCLUDE THAT OUR  SPECIFICATION OR DESIGN IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO THEIR PRODUCT NEED;  WE NEGOTIATE AND \u201cWIN\u201d A CONTRACT (SOMETIMES CALLED A  \u201cDESIGN WIN\u201d) \u2013 WHETHER OF A \u201cBLANKET  PURCHASE ORDER\u201d TYPE OR A SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE STRATEGY IS  TO CREATE AN ANNUITY REVENUE STREAM THAT MAKES THE BEST USE OF OUR  PRODUCTION CAPACITY, AS COMPARED TO THE TURNS BUSINESS, WHICH IS  UNPREDICTABLE AND UNEVEN. THIS ANNUITY REVENUE STREAM CAN ALSO  GENERATE LOW-COST, HIGH-VOLUME TYPE ORDERS. A KEY BUSINESS  OBJECTIVE IS TO CONVERT AS MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS TO THE DESIGN WIN  AND ANNUITY MODEL AS IS POSSIBLE. WE FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN  DOING SO.  \u25cf  MAINTAINING AN  OPTICAL DESIGN AND NEW PRODUCT SAMPLING CAPABILITY, INCLUDING A  HIGH-QUALITY AND RESPONSIVE OPTICAL DESIGN ENGINEERING  STAFF;  \u25cf  THE FACT THAT AS  OUR CUSTOMERS TAKE PRODUCTS OF THIS NATURE INTO HIGHER VOLUME,  COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION (FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF MOLDED OPTICS,  THIS MAY BE VOLUMES OVER ONE MILLION PIECES PER YEAR) THEY BEGIN TO  WORK SERIOUSLY TO REDUCE COSTS \u2013 WHICH OFTEN LEADS THEM TO  TURN TO LARGER OR OVERSEAS PRODUCERS, EVEN IF SACRIFICING QUALITY;  AND  \u25cf  OUR SMALL BUSINESS  MASS MEANS THAT WE CAN ONLY OFFER A MODERATE AMOUNT OF TOTAL  PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY BEFORE WE REACH FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED  BY THE NEED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \u2013 IN  OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED CASH RESOURCES AND CASH FLOW,  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTS  ITSELF IN OUR MARKETS WITHOUT ARRANGING FOR SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES TO WINNING MORE \u201cANNUITY\u201d  BUSINESS, WE NEVERTHELESS BELIEVE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN PROCURING  THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE CAPABILITIES IN OPTICAL DESIGN  ENGINEERING THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON THE MERCHANT MARKET, A MARKET  THAT WE BELIEVE IS UNDERSERVED IN THIS AREA OF SERVICE OFFERING.  ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE OFFER VALUE TO SOME CUSTOMERS AS A  SOURCE OF SUPPLY IN THE U.S. SHOULD THEY BE UNWILLING TO COMMIT TO  PURCHASE THEIR SUPPLY OF A CRITICAL COMPONENT FROM FOREIGN MERCHANT  PRODUCTION SOURCES. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING REVENUE RECOGNITION  RELATED TO OUR VARIOUS REVENUE STREAMS, REFER TO  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K DATED JUNE 30,  2019.  OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.  USUALLY ON A WEEKLY BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS A NUMBER OF  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE. THESE  INDICATORS CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND  CHALLENGES IN THE BUSINESS CHANGE. THESE INDICATORS ARE USED TO  DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING ACTIONS AND CHANGES. WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR NON-FINANCIAL PRODUCTION INDICATORS, SUCH AS THOSE NOTED, ARE  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.  FINANCIAL INDICATORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED KEY AND REVIEWED REGULARLY  ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  SALES  BACKLOG;  \u25cf  REVENUE  DOLLARS AND UNITS BY PRODUCT GROUP; AND  \u25cf  OTHER  KEY INDICATORS.  THESE INDICATORS ARE ALSO USED TO DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING  ACTIONS AND CHANGES AND ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL  BELOW.  27  SALES BACKLOG  WE BELIEVE OUR SALES GROWTH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE OUR BEST  INDICATOR OF SUCCESS. OUR BEST VIEW INTO THE EFFICACY OF OUR SALES  EFFORTS IS IN OUR \u201cORDER BOOK.\u201d OUR ORDER BOOK EQUATES  TO SALES \u201cBACKLOG.\u201d IT HAS A QUANTITATIVE AND A  QUALITATIVE ASPECT: QUANTITATIVELY, OUR BACKLOG\u2019S PROSPECTIVE  DOLLAR VALUE AND QUALITATIVELY, WHAT PERCENT OF THE BACKLOG IS  SCHEDULED BY THE CUSTOMER FOR DATE-CERTAIN DELIVERY. WE DEFINE OUR  \u201c12-MONTH BACKLOG\u201d AS THAT WHICH IS REQUESTED BY THE  CUSTOMER FOR DELIVERY WITHIN ONE YEAR AND WHICH IS REASONABLY  LIKELY TO REMAIN IN THE BACKLOG AND BE CONVERTED INTO REVENUES.  THIS INCLUDES CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDERS AND MAY INCLUDE AMOUNTS  UNDER SUPPLY CONTRACTS IF THEY MEET THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA.  GENERALLY, A HIGHER 12-MONTH BACKLOG IS BETTER FOR US.  OUR 12-MONTH BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $19.1  MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 7%, AS COMPARED TO $18.1 MILLION AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018. COMPARED TO THE END OF FISCAL 2019, OUR 12-MONTH  BACKLOG INCREASED BY 12% DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020. BACKLOG GROWTH RATES FOR THE LAST FIVE FISCAL QUARTERS  ARE.

THE TIMING OF THIS  RENEWAL IS SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. DURING THE FOURTH  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE BOOKED NEW ANNUAL CONTRACTS FOR MOLDED  INFRARED PRODUCTS.  THESE ANNUAL  CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED TO RENEW DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE  CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE TIMING OF EACH OF THESE ANNUAL CONTRACT  RENEWALS MAY VARY, AND MAY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE BACKLOG LEVELS AT  THE TIME THE ORDERS ARE RECEIVED, AND BACKLOG WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE  DRAWN DOWN AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AGAINST THESE  ORDERS.  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED STRONG DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS USED IN THE  INDUSTRIAL, DEFENSE AND FIRST RESPONDER SECTORS. DEMAND FOR  INFRARED PRODUCTS IS BEING FURTHER FUELED BY INTEREST IN LENSES  MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6 MATERIAL. WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN MODERATE  GROWTH IN OUR VISIBLE PMO PRODUCT GROUP BY CONTINUING TO DIVERSIFY  AND OFFER NEW APPLICATIONS, WITH A COST COMPETITIVE STRUCTURE. OVER  THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BROADENED OUR CAPABILITIES TO  INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GLASS TYPES AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE MUCH LARGER  LENSES, PROVIDING LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY  ROADMAP AND MARKET SHARE EXPANSION. BASED ON OUR BACKLOG AND RECENT  QUOTE ACTIVITY, WE EXPECT INCREASES IN REVENUE FROM SALES OF BOTH  MOLDED AND TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020.

REVENUE FROM THE PMO PRODUCT GROUP DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  $416,000, OR 10%, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE  IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES TO  CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET, AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE AND  INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. SALES OF PMO UNITS INCREASED BY 20%, AS  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, HOWEVER, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES  DECREASED 25%. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IS DUE TO A  SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS UNIT SALES,  WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE HIGHER VOLUMES AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING  PRICES. REVENUE FROM SALES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS DECREASED  BY APPROXIMATELY 7%, WHILE UNIT VOLUMES FOR THESE PRODUCTS MORE  THAN DOUBLED FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP INCREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION, OR 34%, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN INFRARED PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE  TIMING OF ORDER SHIPMENTS AGAINST A LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL CONTRACT  FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019, REVENUE FROM THIS CONTRACT WAS LOWER, AS WE HAD  SHIPPED THE BALANCE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT BEFORE THE RENEWAL WAS  FINALIZED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CUSTOMER  REQUESTED THAT WE ACCELERATE SHIPMENTS THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD  PREVIOUSLY DELAYED IN THE PRECEDING QUARTER BECAUSE OF DELAYS IT  EXPERIENCED FOR OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN; THUS, ORDER  SHIPMENTS RELATED TO THIS LARGE CONTRACT WERE HIGHER IN FISCAL  2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, THE BALANCE OF THESE  ORDERS MUST SHIP BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  SALES OF MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR  NEW BD6 MATERIAL, ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS ARE HIGHER IN VOLUME  AND LOWER IN PRICES THAN DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS.  ACCORDINGLY, SALES OF INFRARED UNITS INCREASED BY 91% DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  PERIOD, AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DECREASED 30%. INDUSTRIAL  APPLICATIONS, FIREFIGHTING CAMERAS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY  APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED  DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY OUR THERMAL IMAGING  ASSEMBLIES.  OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REVENUE INCREASED BY $193,000, OR 28%, IN  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER  OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW  NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL  MARKETS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  OUR REVENUE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $54,000, OR LESS THAN 1%,  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  PERIOD, WITH INCREASES IN INFRARED AND SPECIALTY PRODUCT SALES,  OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN PMO PRODUCT SALES.  REVENUE FROM THE PMO PRODUCT GROUP DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  $343,000, OR 5%, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND  DEFENSE MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SALES TO  CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS. SALES OF  PMO UNITS INCREASED BY 25%, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DECREASED 24%,  DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS SALES,  WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE HIGHER VOLUMES AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING  PRICES. THE UNIT VOLUME FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MORE THAN DOUBLED, AS COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP INCREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY $273,000, OR 3%, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020,  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, REVENUES FROM SHIPMENTS AGAINST THE  LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS  WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN  INFRARED PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF  MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6  MATERIAL. MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS ARE HIGHER IN VOLUME AND LOWER  IN PRICES THAN DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY,  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, SALES OF INFRARED UNITS  INCREASED BY 59%, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND AVERAGE  SELLING PRICES DECREASED 35%. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, FIREFIGHTING  CAMERAS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO BE THE  PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS,  PARTICULARLY OUR THERMAL IMAGING ASSEMBLIES.  IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REVENUE  INCREASED BY $124,000, OR 11%, AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR  CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. THIS INCREASE IS  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS TO A  MEDICAL CUSTOMER, DUE TO TIMING OF ORDERS.  OTHER KEY INDICATORS  OTHER KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE VARIOUS OPERATING METRICS, SOME OF  WHICH ARE QUALITATIVE AND OTHERS ARE QUANTITATIVE. THESE INDICATORS  CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE  BUSINESS CHANGE. THEY ARE MOSTLY NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS, SUCH AS  ON-TIME DELIVERY TRENDS, UNITS OF SHIPPABLE OUTPUT BY MAJOR PRODUCT  LINE, PRODUCTION YIELD RATES BY MAJOR PRODUCT LINE, AND THE OUTPUT  AND YIELD DATA FROM SIGNIFICANT INTERMEDIARY MANUFACTURING  PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF THE FINISHED SHIPPABLE  PRODUCT. THESE INDICATORS CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE SUCH OTHER  RELATED INDICATORS AS FULLY-YIELDED UNIT PRODUCTION PER-SHIFT,  WHICH VARIES BY THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND OUR STATE OF AUTOMATION  IN PRODUCTION OF THAT PRODUCT AT ANY GIVEN TIME. HIGHER UNIT  PRODUCTION PER SHIFT MEANS LOWER UNIT COST AND, THEREFORE, IMPROVED  MARGINS OR IMPROVED ABILITY TO COMPETE, WHERE DESIRABLE, FOR PRICE  SENSITIVE CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. THE DATA FROM THESE REPORTS IS  USED TO DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING ACTIONS AND CHANGES.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ASSESSES BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKES BUSINESS  DECISIONS REGARDING OUR OPERATIONS USING CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW UNDER  THE HEADING \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\u201d  29  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE REPORT OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP; HOWEVER,  OUR MANAGEMENT ALSO ASSESSES BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKES  BUSINESS DECISIONS REGARDING OUR OPERATIONS USING CERTAIN NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS THAT IS  SUPPLEMENTARY TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP; HOWEVER, WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS. AS SUCH,  YOU SHOULD NOT VIEW THESE DISCLOSURES AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS  DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY  COMPARABLE TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT OTHER COMPANIES  USE.  EBITDA  EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BY MANAGEMENT, LENDERS,  AND CERTAIN INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN THE EVALUATION  OF SOME ASPECTS OF A CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND CORE  OPERATING PERFORMANCE. INVESTORS SOMETIMES USE EBITDA, AS IT ALLOWS  FOR SOME LEVEL OF COMPARABILITY OF PROFITABILITY TRENDS BETWEEN  THOSE BUSINESSES DIFFERING AS TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CAPITAL  INTENSITY BY REMOVING THE IMPACTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  EBITDA ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE CHANGES IN MAJOR WORKING CAPITAL  ITEMS, SUCH AS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY AND PAYABLES, WHICH CAN ALSO  INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR, OR SOURCE OF, CASH. SINCE  DECISIONS REGARDING CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND FINANCING AND CHANGES IN  WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CASH  FLOW, EBITDA IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD INDICATOR OF A BUSINESS'S  CASH FLOWS. WE USE EBITDA FOR EVALUATING THE RELATIVE UNDERLYING  PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE OPERATIONS AND FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. WE  CALCULATE EBITDA BY ADJUSTING NET INCOME TO EXCLUDE NET INTEREST  EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT, DEPRECIATION AND  AMORTIZATION, THUS THE TERM \u201cEARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES,  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d AND THE ACRONYM  \u201cEBITDA.\u201d  WE BELIEVE EBITDA IS HELPFUL FOR INVESTORS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR  UNDERLYING BUSINESS OPERATIONS.

THE INCREASE IN EBITDA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020 WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND LOWER  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR EBITDA FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS  APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.2  MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN  EBITDA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES AND IMPROVED OPERATING  PERFORMANCE.  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES  UNDER  THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT,  INCLUDING OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL  OFFICER, WE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION  OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULE  13A-15(E) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE END  OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE  CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT  OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019 IN REPORTING ON A TIMELY BASIS INFORMATION  REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY US IN THE REPORTS WE FILE OR SUBMIT  UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.  DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS NO  CHANGE IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED  IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT) THAT HAS MATERIALLY  AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR  INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  30  P  ART II OTHER INFORMATION  ITEM 1.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 11, 2019.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT  TESSCO ARCHITECTS AND DELIVERS INNOVATIVE PRODUCT AND VALUE CHAIN SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT WIRELESS BROADBAND SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH WE SELL PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN MANY COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 97% OF OUR SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND OFFICE FACILITIES IN HUNT VALLEY, MARYLAND, RENO, NEVADA AND SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS BUSINESS WITHIN TWO SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING CUSTOMER MARKETS:  (1) PUBLIC CARRIERS, THAT ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE AIRTIME SERVICE TO INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIBERS; AND (2) VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, GOVERNMENT CHANNELS AND PRIVATE SYSTEM OPERATOR MARKETS, AND REFLECTS IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR OF AN ENHANCED GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. THIS GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSOLIDATION OF THESE CUSTOMER MARKETS IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE CONSOLIDATED MARKETS, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO BETTER ALIGN TERRITORIES WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE RETAIL MARKET WHICH INCLUDES RETAILERS, INDEPENDENT DEALER AGENTS AND CARRIERS.  WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES: BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE; NETWORK SYSTEMS; INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE; AND MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES. BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD, REPAIR AND UPGRADE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. SALES OF TRADITIONAL BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BASE STATION RADIOS, CABLE AND TRANSMISSION LINES AND ANTENNAS ARE IN PART DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. NETWORK SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD AND UPGRADE COMPUTING AND INTERNET NETWORKS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN GROWING OUR OFFERING OF WIRELESS BROADBAND, DISTRIBUTED ANTENNAS SYSTEMS (DAS), NETWORK EQUIPMENT, SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT AS DEPENDENT ON THE OVERALL CAPITAL SPENDING OF THE INDUSTRY. INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO INSTALL, TUNE, AND MAINTAIN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THIS CATEGORY IS MADE UP OF SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS EQUIPMENT AND VARIOUS FREQUENCY, VOLTAGE AND POWER-MEASURING DEVICES, REPLACEMENT PARTS AND COMPONENTS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF TOOLS, HARDWARE AND SUPPLIES REQUIRED BY SERVICE TECHNICIANS.  MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES PRODUCTS INCLUDE CELLULAR PHONE AND DATA DEVICE ACCESSORIES.  OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS LOOKING TO US FOR PRODUCT AND SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THE TERMS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE FACTORS, APPLICABLE TO EACH RELATIONSHIP OFTEN DIFFER. AMONG THESE FACTORS ARE THE STRENGTH OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S OR SUPPLIER\u2019S BUSINESS, THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE, INCLUDING PRICE STABILITY, CHANGING CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER AND TO CONTINUALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH OUR CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED ARE TYPICALLY OF LIMITED DURATION, TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS OR OTHERWISE RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY WIRELESS CARRIER CONSOLIDATION OR THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IS COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED AND IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS. IN ADDITION, MANY MANUFACTURERS SELL DIRECT. BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR DISTRIBUTORS ARE RELATIVELY LOW, PARTICULARLY IN THE MOBILE DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES MARKET, AND THE RISK OF NEW COMPETITORS ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE IS HIGH. CONSOLIDATION OF LARGER WIRELESS CARRIERS HAS AND WILL MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHALLENGES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR STRENGTH IN SERVICE, THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM, INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND OUR LARGE CUSTOMER BASE AND PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH APPROXIMATELY 400 MANUFACTURERS, PROVIDE US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 8.3% COMPARED WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCREASED BY 1.9%.  REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET INCREASED BY 12.5%.  REVENUES IN THE VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECLINED 3.6%, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE NOT YET REALIZING THE FULL BENEFITS OF OUR SALES STRATEGY REFINEMENTS. REVENUES IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 27.4%. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF CONTINUED OVERALL SOFTNESS IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 25.6% COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 20.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 16.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET DECREASED FROM 13.6% TO 11.9% DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED FROM 24.5% TO 24.0%. THIS DECLINE WAS DUE TO A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.5% TO 8.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET SOFTNESS AND THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SEVERAL OEM PHONE DEVICES. TOTAL INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS WERE $4.3 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT OFTEN DIFFER FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $1.0 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED FROM 18.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TO 19.0% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DUE TO LOWER REVENUES.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.1 MILLION  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND $0.6 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED A $2.6 MILLION NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE HAD BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $446,800 AND $478,400 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $247,900 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $367,900 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 16.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 20.8% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THE RESULT OF THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDING NON-RECURRING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO A CHANGE IN TAX LAW AND A REDUCTION IN THE GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST, DUE TO A LAPSE IN THE RELATED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. NET INCOME DECREASED 285.7% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 284.4% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 10.8% COMPARED WITH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 3.2%. REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED BY 2.8% AND 3.4%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PROJECT-ORIENTED NATURE OF THIS BUSINESS. SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS ADJUSTED THEIR FORECASTS OR PUSHED OUT THEIR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. REVENUES IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 26.7%. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF OVERALL SOFTNESS IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 19.8% COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 20.2% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 18.1% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED FROM 13.2% TO 12.3%, AND 24.5% TO 24.1%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.7% TO 13.4 % IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH OFTEN DIFFER  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $5.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED FROM 18.6% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, TO 19.5% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $1.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $2.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE, $2.0 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE, AND $1.9 MILLION IN FREIGHT EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED A $0.5 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RELATED TO SEVERANCE EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND A $2.6 MILLION NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE INCURRED BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $474,200 AND $1,499,700 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $667,100 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO $911,700 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 22.1% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 22.2% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. NET INCOME DECREASED 248.2% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 249.2% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2019  DECEMBER 30, 2018  CASH FLOW (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(2,998,800)  $3,254,400  CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (6,831,700)  (4,286,300)  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  9,801,000  1,014,100  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(29,500)  $(17,800)  WE USED $3.0 MILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED WITH NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS FISCAL 2020 OUTFLOW WAS DUE TO A NET LOSS, NET OF DEPRECIATION AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $4.3 MILLION USED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH USED IN BOTH PERIODS WAS DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LARGELY COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $9.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION PROVIDED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE UTILIZED OUR ASSET BASED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019, LEADING TO A CASH INFLOW OF $15.0 MILLION AND $6.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THOSE PERIODS. WE HAD CASH OUTFLOWS OF $5.1 MILLION DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF BOTH FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, DUE TO CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS.  ON OCTOBER 19, 2017, THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIMARY OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, AS CO-BORROWERS, ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS A LENDER (THE \u201cAMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d), WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE TERMS OF A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND WHICH RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING LIMIT TO UP TO $75 MILLION, FROM THE PREVIOUS BORROWING LIMIT OF UP TO $35 MILLION.  IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE BORROWING LIMIT, AND AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE APPLICABLE MATURITY DATE TO OCTOBER 19, 2021. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, BORROWINGS UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TOTALED $29.4 MILLION; THEREFORE, WE THEN HAD $45.6 MILLION AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO THE BORROWING BASE LIMITATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE OTHER APPLICABLE TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE RATES, AND THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY A MONTHLY COMMITMENT FEE, AS ALSO DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENTERING INTO OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER COMPANY AFFILIATE BORROWERS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE LOAN PARTIES, EXECUTED AND DELIVERED TO SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, A REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE LOAN PARTIES UNDER THE GUARANTY AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED BY THE LOAN PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING (INCLUDING THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GUARANTY BY THE LOAN PARTIES NOT OTHERWISE BORROWERS AND THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GRANT BY THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES OF A CONTINUING FIRST  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND ON ALL DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, LETTER OF CREDIT RIGHTS, AND ALL PROCEEDS) WERE RATIFIED AND CONFIRMED AS RESPECTS THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED FOR PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE HAVE MADE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER SHARE WAS PAID IN NOVEMBER 2019. ON JANUARY 21, 2020, OUR BOARD DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.02 PER SHARE, PAYABLE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2020 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF FEBRUARY 12, 2020.  ANY FUTURE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY CORRESPONDING RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES REMAINS SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETERMINATION FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, OUR POLICY IS TO APPLY EXCESS AVAILABLE CASH TO REDUCE THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME ON OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR INCREASED FOCUS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL QUARTERS ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES TO OUR PUBLIC CARRIER CUSTOMERS LED TO THE RECENT EXPANSION OF OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND HAS AT TIMES RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT FACILITY. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE, ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR ANY FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE FACILITY.  IF WE WERE TO UNDERTAKE AN ACQUISITION OR OTHER MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES THAT REQUIRE FUNDS IN EXCESS OF EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD LOOK TO SOURCES OF FUNDING FROM ADDITIONAL CREDIT FACILITIES, DEBT AND/OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS.  IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECREASING REVENUES AND PROFITS RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY OUR CUSTOMERS, OR BY THE WEAKENED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, IN EACH CASE AS A RESULT OF A DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON PIONEERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOPRINTED HUMAN TISSUES THAT EMULATE HUMAN BIOLOGY AND DISEASE. WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING OUR  IN VIVO  LIVER TISSUES TO TREAT END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE AND A SELECT GROUP OF LIFE-THREATENING, ORPHAN DISEASES, FOR WHICH THERE ARE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS OTHER THAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION.  RECENT EVENTS  ON DECEMBER 13, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TARVEDA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (\u201cTARVEDA\u201d), A PRIVATELY OWNED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, AND OPAL MERGER SUB, INC. (\u201cOPAL\u201d), A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OURS. THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, OPAL WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO TARVEDA, WITH TARVEDA AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION, BECOMING A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OURS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TARVEDA CAPITAL STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL ISSUE, AND TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, IN A TAX-FREE EXCHANGE, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK SUCH THAT TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE COMBINED COMPANY ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) AND OUR SECURITYHOLDERS WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE COMBINED COMPANY ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT). THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR TARVEDA\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT BASED ON OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. IF OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS BELOW $22 MILLION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR ADJUSTING THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO FORMER TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, TARVEDA\u2019S SECURITY HOLDERS MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS MERGER CONSIDERATION, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR SECURITYHOLDERS MAY BE FURTHER DILUTED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. IF OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS ABOVE $22 MILLION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR ADJUSTING THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO FORMER TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEBT OF EACH OF THE PARTIES. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL, AND, TO THE EXTENT THESE ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, TARVEDA\u2019S SECURITYHOLDERS MAY RECEIVE A LARGER OR SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY\u2019S PRO FORMA FULLY DILUTED CAPITALIZATION. IF TARVEDA\u2019S NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS BELOW $15 MILLION, WE MAY ELECT TO NOT CONSUMMATE THE MERGER.  22  THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING APPROVAL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER  , AS WELL  AS  A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF OUR COMMON SHARES. WE ANTICIPATE THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE  FISCAL  FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020. THE MERGER AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR BOTH US AND TARVEDA, AND FURTHER PROVIDES THAT, UPON TERMINATION O  F THE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES, EITHER PARTY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE OTHER PARTY A TERMINATION FEE RANGING BETWEEN $1.0 MILLION (PLUS REIMBURSEMENT OF $0.3 MILLION OF EXPENSES) AND $2.0 MILLION (PLUS REIMBURSEMENT OF $0.5 MILLION O  F EXPENSES), DEPENDING ON THE CAUSE OF THE TERMINATION.  PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE SOLICITED BIDS FROM POTENTIAL PURCHASERS FOR OUR OPERATING ASSETS, WHICH WE HAD SOUGHT TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF IN ONE OR MORE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT PROCESS, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LIFENET HEALTH (\u201cLIFENET\u201d) ON NOVEMBER 7, 2019 TO SELL CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY OF OUR SAMSARA SCIENCES, FOR $1.5 MILLION IN CASH, WHICH WAS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME. IN ADDITION, ON JANUARY 26, 2020, WE AND TARVEDA AGREED TO AMEND THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE THAT WE WOULD BE CREDITED WITH $1.5 MILLION FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE ISSUED TO TARVEDA STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IF WE DO NOT SELL OR TRANSFER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND REMAINING ASSETS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. OUR REMAINING ASSETS FOLLOWING THESE ACTIONS WILL CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTEREST RECEIVABLES, RESTRICTED CASH AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION, OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, OUR LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, OUR REMAINING ASSETS, OUR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH TARVEDA. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED, EXCEPT FOR SIX GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  AS A RESULT OF THE SALE TRANSACTION WITH LIFENET, ASIDE FROM THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, REMAINING ASSETS, AND LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, ALL OF OUR BUSINESS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MERGER WILL BE THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY TARVEDA IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE MERGER, IF THE MERGER CLOSES. ACCORDINGLY, BECAUSE OF THE PENDING MERGER WITH TARVEDA AND THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CLOSE THE PENDING MERGER WITH TARVEDA ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, THE MOST CRITICAL OF WHICH ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  EXPENSE,  THE VALUATION OF IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  , AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  . WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN. BESIDES THE ESTIMATES IDENTIFIED ABOVE THAT ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, WE MAKE MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALL ESTIMATES, WHETHER OR NOT DEEMED CRITICAL, AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, EVEN FOR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SINCE MARCH 31, 2019, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHANGES MADE UPON ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, LEASES (\u201cASC 842\u201d) AND THE RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL ASUS.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 DECREASED 66% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO A $0.2 MILLION DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE. WE HAD NO GRANT REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION IN PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AS WE REDUCED OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE QUARTER.

THIS ACTION CAUSED A $1.6 MILLION REDUCTION OF PERSONNEL RELATED COSTS, A $0.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN LAB SUPPLY COSTS, A $0.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN FACILITIES COSTS, AND A $0.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN ALL OTHER COSTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S AVERAGE FULL-TIME RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAFF DECREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF FORTY-FOUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO AN AVERAGE OF ZERO FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  .

OTHER INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND CONSISTED OF $0.2 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME, OFFSET BY A $0.1 MILLION LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS. INTEREST INCOME DECREASED FROM THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE YIELDS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES.  COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).

PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 INCREASED 20% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A $0.4 MILLION INCREASE IN SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS AND LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF THE $0.5 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE UP-FRONT FEE REFERENCED ABOVE.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  UNTIL OUR RECENT DECISION TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES AND MERGE WITH TARVEDA, WE HAD PRIMARILY DEVOTED OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE AND STUDY LIVING TISSUES THAT EMULATE KEY ASPECTS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY AND DISEASE, RAISING CAPITAL AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOLLOWING THE DECISION TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE DECISION TO MERGE WITH TARVEDA, WE HAVE  TAKEN STEPS TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES AND EXTEND OUR CASH RUNWAY, INCLUDING REDUCING  ALL COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY ACTIVITIES, EXCEPT FOR SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN CELLS OUT OF INVENTORY, NEGOTIATING AN EXIT FROM OUR LONG-TERM FACILITY LEASE, SELLING LAB EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY, AND REDUCING OUR WORKFORCE TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL NECESSARY TO  EXPLORE AND SUPPORT THESE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES AND MAINTAIN OUR CORE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LICENSES AND COLLABORATIONS WITH RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND UNIVERSITIES, AND TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE DELIVER IN THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $30.5 MILLION AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $276.7 MILLION. WE ALSO HAD NEGATIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $11.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $36.5 MILLION AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $260.8 MILLION.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $31.1 MILLION AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION, RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $28.7 MILLION. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $38.6 MILLION AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION, RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $34.8 MILLION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A SUMMARY OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES AND USES OF CASH FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY.

THIS $3.6 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH USAGE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE NET LOSS LESS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S RESTRUCTURING AND REDUCTION OF HEADCOUNT, AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN WORKING CAPITAL BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS WAS $0.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION OF CASH USAGE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $6.8 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. FINANCING IN BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH AT-THE-MARKET (\u201cATM\u201d) OFFERINGS.  27  OPERATIONS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS  THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE SALE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH PUBLIC AND ATM OFFERINGS, AND FROM REVENUE DERIVED FROM GRANTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS, COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS, PRODUCT SALES AND RESEARCH-BASED SERVICES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLAN AND AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES, WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AS CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  ASIDE FROM THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, REMAINING ASSETS, AND LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, OUR REMAINING CASH REQUIREMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER INCLUDING FEES PAYABLE TO FINANCIAL ADVISORS, CONSULTING FEES, LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SUPPORT, INSURANCE PREMIUMS, KEY EMPLOYEE RETENTION, SEVERANCE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL BENEFITS AND ONGOING COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SIX GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL THAT REMAIN WITH US THROUGH THE DATE THE SALE TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED, IF THE MERGER CLOSES. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE INCURRING APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION IN TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS AND $3.5 MILLION IN SEVERANCE RELATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER.  WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 (FILE NO. 333-222929), OR THE 2018 SHELF, THAT REGISTERED $100,000,000 OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS AND UNITS, OR ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOREGOING, WHICH EXPIRES ON FEBRUARY 22, 2021. ON MARCH 16, 2018, WE FILED A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2018 SHELF TO REGISTER THE SALE OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED IN AT-THE-MARKET OFFERINGS PURSUANT TO AN EQUITY OFFERING SALES AGREEMENT WE ENTERED INTO WITH TWO INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS AS OF THE SAME DATE. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE SOLD 6,087,382 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN AT-THE-MARKET OFFERINGS, WITH NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION UNDER THE 2018 SHELF.  BASED ON OUR USE OF THE 2018 SHELF THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE CAN OFFER AN AGGREGATE OF $81.3 MILLION IN FUTURE OFFERINGS UNDER THE 2018 SHELF, INCLUDING THE $31.3 MILLION REMAINING AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE THROUGH ITS AT-THE-MARKET PROGRAM, PRIOR TO ITS EXPIRATION DATE ON FEBRUARY 22, 2021.  WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY FURTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH RIGHTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY OR PURSUE OR CONSUMMATE A STRATEGIC TRANSACTION ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE CHOOSE. FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING COULD EVENTUALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AS A GOING CONCERN. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THERE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.  ON JUNE 25, 2019, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE LETTER FROM THE LISTING QUALIFICATIONS STAFF OF THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) INDICATING THAT, BASED UPON THE CLOSING BID PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE LAST 30 CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, WE NO LONGER MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CLOSING BID PRICE OF $1 PER SHARE, AS SET FORTH IN NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5450(A)(1). ON DECEMBER 26, 2019, WE OBTAINED AN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PERIOD OF 180 CALENDAR DAYS BY ELECTING TO TRANSFER TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PERIOD OFFERED ON THAT MARKET. TO QUALIFY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENT FOR MARKET VALUE OF PUBLICLY HELD SHARES AND ALL OTHER INITIAL LISTING STANDARDS FOR THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PROPOSED MERGER WITH TARVEDA, WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT OR MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OTHER LISTING REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR US TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. OUR FAILURE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE DURING THIS SECOND COMPLIANCE PERIOD COULD RESULT IN DELISTING AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD 130,497,563 TOTAL ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  IN ADDITION, OUR 2008 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 896,256 SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND THE 2012 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 28,553,986 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH 6,547,442 OPTIONS AND 7,015,674 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND 10,482,484 SHARES REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS. WE HAVE ALSO ISSUED TIME-BASED AND PERFORMANCE-BASED INDUCEMENT AWARDS UNDER THE INCENTIVE AWARD AGREEMENTS FOR UP TO 3,098,473 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, 1,188,718 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER OUR 2016 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. IN AGGREGATE, ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, SHARES UNDERLYING OUTSTANDING WARRANTS, AND SHARES ISSUABLE UNDER OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS OR RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2008 AND 2012 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS AND THE 2016 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN TOTAL 158,830,354 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUT OF THE 200,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019.  28  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING UNRECORDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE CERTAIN WARRANTS AND OPTIONS OUTSTANDING BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES ARE REGISTERED, AND/OR ALL RESTRICTIONS ON TRADING, IF ANY, ARE REMOVED, AND IN EITHER CASE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE APPLICABLE EXERCISE PRICES OF THE OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ORGANOVO HOLDINGS, INC.", "CIK": 1497253, "Date": "2020-02-10T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ONVO", "Name": "Organovo Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE MKT", "SIC": 2836.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 271488943.0, "key": "20200210ONVO", "labelr1": 2.9411764705882213, "labelr2": -5.714285714285704, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.58731556, "prof1": 0.41268438, "return1&2": 1.0260504201680671, "return1&2&3": 1.0260504201680671, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0260504201680671, "return2": 1.057142857142857, "return1": 0.9705882352941178, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 2.9411764705882253, "cumulative_return1": 0.18873623901898928, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3680, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9631920252341655, "cumreturn1b": 0.8830824113792172, "cumreturn1c": 1.0035700804391166, "cumreturndow": 1.0334973100638951, "cumreturnsp500": 1.030863913530317}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3691, "level_0": 3787, "index": 19545, "text": "ITEM 2.

ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF  EVENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS. AN INVESTMENT  IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. READERS OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE  RISKS SET FORTH IN THE RISK FACTORS AND BUSINESS SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019,  FILED WITH THE SEC ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS COMPILED THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING  INFORMATION BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT AND CONSIDERED BY MANAGEMENT TO BE REASONABLE. OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS,  HOWEVER, ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT AND NO REPRESENTATION, GUARANTY, OR WARRANTY IS TO BE INFERRED FROM THOSE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  THE  ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR PURPOSES OF THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPECIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF  FUTURE EVENTS AND ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AS TO POSSIBLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC, LEGISLATIVE, INDUSTRY, AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES.  AS A RESULT, THE IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA AND OTHER INFORMATION AND THEIR USE IN DEVELOPING AND SELECTING ASSUMPTIONS  FROM AND AMONG REASONABLE ALTERNATIVES REQUIRE THE EXERCISE OF JUDGMENT.

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  SPECIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ARE ACCURATE, AND WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY WAS FORMED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA ON JULY 13, 1993, AND WAS A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY LICENSED BY THE SBA  AS AN SBIC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY MADE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDED LOANS TO, SMALL BUSINESSES TO FINANCE THEIR GROWTH,  EXPANSION, AND DEVELOPMENT. UNDER APPLICABLE SBA REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS RESTRICTED TO INVESTING ONLY IN QUALIFIED SMALL  BUSINESSES AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACT, THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROVIDE ITS SHAREHOLDERS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INCOME, WITH CAPITAL  APPRECIATION AS A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE. THE COMPANY MADE ITS FIRST INVESTMENT IN A SMALL BUSINESS IN OCTOBER 1996.  15  IN  MAY 2014 THE COMPANY EFFECTIVELY CEASED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY CONSENTED TO A COURT ORDER APPOINTING THE SBA AS RECEIVER OF THE  COMPANY TO MARSHAL AND LIQUIDATE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THAT ORDER ALSO ENTERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR  OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE SBA, AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,770,722. THE SBA WAS APPOINTED  RECEIVER EFFECTIVE MAY 28, 2014.  OVER  THE COURSE OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY WAS LIMITED TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS BY THE  RECEIVER AND THE PAYMENT OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM TO THE SBA AND FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. THE SBIC LICENSE GRANTED  TO THE COMPANY BY THE SBA WAS REVOKED BY THE SBA EFFECTIVE MARCH 20, 2017. ON JUNE 28, 2017, THE RECEIVERSHIP WAS TERMINATED.  THE FINAL ORDER SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT \u201cCONTROL OF WATERSIDE SHALL BE UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED AND RETURNED TO ITS  SHAREHOLDERS C/O RORAN CAPITAL, LLC (\u201cRORAN\u201d) UPON NOTIFICATION OF ENTRY OF THIS ORDER.  UPON  TERMINATION OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, RORAN TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL BOOKS AND RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO IT BY THE SBA. WITH NO ASSETS  AND NO SBIC LICENSE FROM THE SBA, NO INCOME, AND LIABILITIES, AT THAT TIME, IN EXCESS OF $10,000,000, IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE COMPANY  THAT CONTINUING TO OPERATE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE COMPANY AND RORAN ENTERED IN TO A CONVERTIBLE  LOAN AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2017, AS AMENDED, TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPENSES WHILE IT SOUGHT A NEW BUSINESS TO  UNDERTAKE OR TO MERGE WITH AN EXISTING BUSINESS. THE NEW BOARD HAS CONTINUED TO WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.  THE  COMPANY IS NO LONGER OPERATING AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED AND  INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE, QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AND PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS  AND AUDITS. THE COMPANY FILED ALL DELINQUENT SEC FILINGS AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT AS OF JUNE 28, 2017, IT CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY SO IT DID NOT FILE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY FILED A FORM 10-K FOR THAT PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THAT 10-K,  ON JANUARY 18, 2018, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940  FOR AN ORDER DECLARING THAT THE COMPANY HAS CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. IN RESPONSE TO THAT FILING, THE SEC  ISSUED TO THE COMPANY COMMENTS IN A LETTER DATED MAY 16, 2018. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THOSE COMMENTS WITH THE FILING OF AN AMENDED  APPLICATION ON JUNE 4, 2018. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY STATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A FIFTH AMENDED APPLICATION  AND EXPECTS RESOLUTION SOON.  FROM  TIME-TO-TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d), OR OTHER  STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, RELATING TO THE TREATMENT AND RECORDING OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED  HEREIN, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT  ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF  CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING  THE REPORTING PERIODS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHICH (A) THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATE IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND  JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE AND (B) THE IMPACT  OF THE ESTIMATE ON FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.  16  THESE  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS BEAR THE RISK OF CHANGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ATTACHED  TO THESE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, AND CERTAIN ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR VALUE.  MANAGEMENT  BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT  THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  MANAGEMENT  REGULARLY EVALUATES THE KEY FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES UTILIZING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, CHANGES  IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. AFTER SUCH EVALUATIONS, IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THOSE  ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  ACTUAL  RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 OF OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL TO THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASSUMPTION  AS A GOING CONCERN  MANAGEMENT  PREPARES THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES  CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS, THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS, AND LIQUIDATION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. HOWEVER,  GIVEN OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  CONVERTIBLE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY BIFURCATES CONVERSION OPTIONS FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS AND ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AS FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. THE CRITERIA INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH (A) THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS  OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE NOT CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST  CONTRACT, (B) THE HYBRID INSTRUMENT THAT EMBODIES BOTH THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS NOT RE-MEASURED  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHERWISE APPLICABLE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS  AS THEY OCCUR AND (C) A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT WITH THE SAME TERMS AS THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENT. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS WHEN THE HOST INSTRUMENT IS DEEMED TO BE CONVENTIONAL, AS THAT TERM IS DESCRIBED UNDER  APPLICABLE GAAP.  WHEN  THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS SHOULD NOT BE BIFURCATED FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTS  ARE RECORDED FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF CONVERSION OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THE INSTRUMENTS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE EMBEDDED  IN THE INSTRUMENT.  BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE  THE  ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED BY THE COMPANY (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) GENERATED A BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE (\u201cBCF\u201d), WHICH ARISES WHEN A DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITY IS ISSUED WITH AN EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTION  THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR OR IN THE MONEY AT INCEPTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION HAS AN EFFECTIVE STRIKE PRICE THAT  IS LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE BCF BY ALLOCATING THE  INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE CONVERSION OPTION, WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE UPON CONVERSION MULTIPLIED BY  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE PER SHARE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK PER SHARE ON THE COMMITMENT  DATE, RESULTING IN A DISCOUNT ON THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT (RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL).  17  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY FOLLOWS PARAGRAPH 825-10-50-10 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AND HAS ADOPTED PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cPARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37\u201d)  TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE  IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS. TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37  ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE  (3) BROAD LEVELS. THE THREE (3) LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEVEL  1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  2: PRICING INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  OBSERVABLE AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  3: PRICING INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  FINANCIAL  ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES OR  SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL ASSUMPTION OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE.  THE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN  MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.  TRANSACTIONS  INVOLVING RELATED PARTIES CANNOT BE PRESUMED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS, AS THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS OF COMPETITIVE,  FREE-MARKET DEALINGS MAY NOT EXIST. REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES, IF MADE, SHALL NOT IMPLY THAT THE  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WERE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE THAT PREVAIL IN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH TRANSACTIONS UNLESS  SUCH REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND INCOME TAXES PROVISION  THE  COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13  WHICH ADDRESSES THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TAX BENEFITS CLAIMED OR EXPECTED TO BE CLAIMED ON A TAX RETURN SHOULD BE RECORDED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13, THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION  ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON  THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED  BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT (50%) LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST, AND PENALTIES ON INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTING  IN INTERIM PERIODS AND REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED  INCOME TAX BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13.  THE  ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  BALANCE SHEETS, AS WELL AS TAX CREDIT CARRY-BACKS AND CARRY-FORWARDS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON ITS BALANCE SHEETS AND PROVIDES VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS MANAGEMENT DEEMS NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT  MAKES JUDGMENTS AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAWS THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGED UPON AN AUDIT AND CAUSE CHANGES TO PREVIOUS  ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES WITHIN MULTIPLE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT IN  THESE JURISDICTIONS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL YEARS. IF ACTUAL  TAXABLE INCOME BY TAX JURISDICTION VARIES FROM ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES OR REVERSALS OF RESERVES MAY BE NECESSARY.  18  MANAGEMENT  ASSUMES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM ITS NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d)  CARRYFORWARDS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT MAY BE OFFSET AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME WAS NOT CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY  THAN NOT AND ACCORDINGLY, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE OFFSETS THE POTENTIAL TAX BENEFITS OF THE NET LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS. MANAGEMENT  MADE THIS ASSUMPTION BASED ON (A) THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND PRESENTLY HAS NO REVENUE-PRODUCING BUSINESS, (B)  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND (C) ITS ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS DAILY OPERATIONS BY WAY OF A PUBLIC  OR PRIVATE OFFERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  COMPARISON  OF THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018  DURING  THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS, AND THEREFORE, THERE  WERE NO REVENUES. EXPENSES WERE LIMITED TO MAINTAINING THE COMPANY IN GOOD STANDING AND STAYING CURRENT, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS  FILING OBLIGATIONS WITH THE SEC.  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $19,655 AND $21,876 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEE EXPENSE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF PROFESSIONALS.  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $32,452 AND $30,100 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEE EXPENSE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FEES EXPENDED IN CONVERTING THE ISSUER FROM A 1940 ACT COMPANY TO A 1934 ACT COMPANY.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $7,239 AND $28,412 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  DUE TO THE LOAN FORGIVENESS OF THE JUDGEMENT PAYABLE WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE.  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $29,900 AND $49,577 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  DUE TO THE LOAN FORGIVENESS OF THE JUDGEMENT PAYABLE WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE.  NET  LOSS  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $26,895 AND $50,288 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS  WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $62,352 AND $79,677 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS WAS  DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  19  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL 2018 AND THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND WE  EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEAR FUTURE. WE HAVE OBTAINED  FUNDING THROUGH A CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO $250,000 TO MEET OUR MOST CRITICAL CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND OF THIS  AMOUNT, WE HAVE DRAWN APPROXIMATELY $190,768 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE  LOAN FACILITY MATURES ON JUNE  19, 2020.  AS  A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON OUR FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019, DO NOT CONTAIN ANY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY.

RECENT  HIGHLIGHTS  \u25cf  ON JANUARY 29, 2020 WE ANNOUNCED THE PUBLICATION OF PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTERIM CLINICAL DATA IN THE FEBRUARY 2020 ISSUE OF PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL, GLIOMA.  THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS RESULTS FROM THE FIRST 22 PATIENTS OF OUR ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDY INVESTIGATING THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT OF VAL-083 WITH RADIATION THERAPY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (\u201cGBM\u201d) BEING CONDUCTED AT SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY CANCER CENTER (\u201cSYSUCC\u201d).  \u25cf  ON NOVEMBER 22, 2019 AT THE SOCIETY FOR NEURO-ONCOLOGY (\u201cSNO\u201d) ANNUAL MEETING WE PRESENTED POSITIVE INTERIM CLINICAL DATA IN TWO POSTERS UPDATING RESULTS FROM OUR TWO ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF GBM.  IN ADDITION, WE HOSTED A KEY OPINION LEADER (\u201cKOL\u201d) EVENT WHICH INCLUDED OUR SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD (\u201cSAB\u201d) AS WELL MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM.  THE KOL EVENT FEATURED OUR SAB AND MANAGEMENT IN A PANEL DISCUSSION OF OUR GBM CLINICAL STUDIES. A RECORDING AND TRANSCRIPT OF THE KOL EVENT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE \u201cPUBLICATIONS AND ABSTRACTS\u201d TAB OF THE \u201cNEWS & MEDIA\u201d SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE, LOCATED AT WWW.DELMARPHARMA.COM.  THE  UPDATED CLINICAL DATA WE PRESENTED AT SNO INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  THE FIRST POSTER OUTLINED THE OPEN-LABEL, PHASE 2 STUDY OF VAL-083 AS A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, UNMETHYLATED GBM.  \u25cf  THE SECOND POSTER OUTLINED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS RECEIVING VAL-083 IN THE OPEN-LABEL, PHASE 2 STUDY IN RECURRENT AND ADJUVANT UNMETHYLATED GBM SETTINGS.  22  \u25cf  ON  AUGUST 16, 2019, WE COMPLETED A FINANCING RAISING APPROXIMATELY $6.6 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS.  WE BELIEVE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE FULL ENROLLMENT  IN ALL THREE PATIENT GROUPS OF OUR TWO ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES WHICH IS EXPECTED  TO OCCUR BY THE FOURTH QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020.  VAL-083  CLINICAL STUDIES  WE  ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING VAL-083, A NOVEL DNA-TARGETING AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF GBM AND POTENTIALLY OTHER SOLID TUMORS, INCLUDING  OVARIAN CANCER. OUR RECENT RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION AND  ITS POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS BY FOCUSING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS EXHIBIT BIOLOGICAL FEATURES  THAT MAKE THEM RESISTANT TO, OR UNLIKELY TO RESPOND TO, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THERAPIES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING  VAL-083\u2019S ACTIVITY IN GBM IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MGMT METHYLATION STATUS ALLOWS US TO FOCUS PATIENT SELECTION BASED ON THIS  IMPORTANT BIOMARKER.  THE  EVALUATION OF MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION STATUS HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME COMMON PRACTICE IN THE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF GBM. IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK (\u201cNCCN\u201d) UPDATED ITS GUIDELINES FOR THE STANDARD TREATMENT  OF GBM BASED ON MGMT METHYLATION STATUS. WE BELIEVE THESE GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO CAPITALIZE ON  VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION BY UTILIZING MGMT METHYLATION AS A BIOMARKER TO OPTIMIZE PATIENT SELECTION FOR OUR  NOVEL DNA-TARGETING AGENT TO FOCUS ON THE MAJORITY OF GBM PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MGMT-UNMETHYLATED TUMORS.  OUR  CURRENT PRIORITY IS TO LEVERAGE THIS RESEARCH, AND VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, TO EFFICIENTLY ADVANCE VAL-083  FOR THE MOST PROMISING INDICATIONS, INCLUDING.  \u25cf  MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  GBM, CURRENTLY COMPRISING TWO ONGOING SEPARATE PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES FOR.  O  GBM  PATIENTS IN TWO STUDY ARMS AT MDACC.  \u25a0  AS  ADJUVANT THERAPY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING CHEMORADIATION; AND  \u25a0  IN  AVASTIN  \u00ae  -NAI\u0308VE RECURRENT GBM PATIENTS;  O  NEWLY  DIAGNOSED GBM PATIENTS (ONGOING STUDY AT SYSUCC); AND  \u25cf  POTENTIAL  FUTURE INDICATIONS INCLUDING OVARIAN CANCER, NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (\u201cNSCLC\u201d),  AND OTHER SOLID TUMOR INDICATIONS.  23  PHASE  2 STUDY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, WE INITIATED A SINGLE ARM, BIOMARKER DRIVEN, OPEN-LABEL PHASE 2 STUDY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM  PATIENTS AT SYSUCC IN GUANGZHOU, CHINA. THE STUDY IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH GUANGXI WUZHOU PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY.  IN THIS PHASE 2 STUDY, VAL-083 IS BEING COMBINED WITH RADIOTHERAPY  AS A POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMORADIATION WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE IN PATIENTS WITH MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM. THE GOALS  OF THE STUDY ARE TO CONFIRM THE SAFETY OF THE THREE-DAY VAL-083 DOSING REGIMEN IN COMBINATION WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND TO INVESTIGATE  EFFICACY OUTCOMES OF THE COMBINATION OF VAL-083 AND RADIOTHERAPY IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS.  WE  PLAN TO ENROLL UP TO 30 NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS IN THIS STUDY. THE EFFICACY ENDPOINTS OF THE STUDY  INCLUDE TUMOR RESPONSE, AS ASSESSED BY THE RESPONSE ASSESSMENT IN NEUROONCOLOGY (\u201cRANO\u201d), AND PROGRESSION-FREE  SURVIVAL (\u201cPFS\u201d), PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL AT SIX MONTHS (\u201cPFS6\u201d), AND OVERALL SURVIVAL  (\u201cOS\u201d), COMPARED TO HISTORICAL RESULTS IN THE TARGET POPULATION. THE STUDY IS BEING CONDUCTED IN TWO PARTS: (1)  DOSE-CONFIRMATION: VAL-083 IN COHORTS (20, 30 AND 40 MG/M  2  /DAY IV DAILY X 3 EVERY 21 DAYS) TO ASSESS SAFETY AND  ACTIVITY WHEN ADMINISTERED CONCURRENTLY WITH X-RAY THERAPY (\u201cXRT\u201d) TO CONFIRM THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE  (\u201cMTD\u201d), AND (2) EXPANSION: VAL-083 WILL BE STUDIED IN UP TO 20 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AT THE TARGET DOSE, AS  DETERMINED BY THE DOSE-CONFIRMATION PART OF THE STUDY, ADMINISTERED CONCURRENTLY WITH XRT. ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY AND  TOLERABILITY WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF VAL-083 IN COMBINATION WITH RADIOTHERAPY.  PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS OF VAL-083 IN PLASMA AND CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID (\u201cCSF\u201d) WILL BE USED TO CORRELATE DRUG  EXPOSURE IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH PATIENT OUTCOMES.  DOSE-CONFIRMING COHORTS STUDYING 20, 30, AND 40 MG/M  2  /DAY  X THREE EVERY 21 DAYS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. BASED ON THE DOSE CONFIRMATION PHASE OF THE STUDY, WE HAVE SELECTED 30 MG/M  2  /DAY  FOR COMBINATION WITH IRRADIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS.  THIS STUDY HAS ENROLLED 23 OUT OF A PLANNED 30 PATIENTS AS OF  THE DATA CUT-OFF DATE OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019. FOR THE 22 PATIENTS WHO HAD COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE CYCLE OF TREATMENT AS OF THAT DATE,  MEDIAN PFS WITH VAL-083 WAS 9.9 MONTHS (CI 7.3-12.0 MONTHS).  FOR THE 18 PATIENTS INITIALLY RECEIVING THE INTENDED TREATMENT  DOSE (30 MG/M  2  /DAY ON DAYS 1, 2 AND 3 OF A 21-DAY CYCLE) MEDIAN PFS WAS 10.4 MONTHS (CI 6.0-12.0 MONTHS). WHILE THIS  IS NOT A HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDY, HISTORICALLY, TEMOZOLOMIDE (\u201cTMZ\u201d) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE 6.9 MONTHS PFS IN UNMETHYLATED  GBM PATIENTS. OTHER DOSES WERE ALSO EXAMINED AS PART OF THE DOSE ESCALATION ASPECT OF THE STUDY, AND ALL BUT THE 20 MG/M  2  /DAY  DOSE ALSO DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PFS TO THE HISTORICAL COMPARATOR. A MEDIAN OF EIGHT CYCLES OF TREATMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY ALL  PATIENTS WHO HAD EITHER COMPLETED TREATMENT, OR REMAIN IN ACTIVE TREATMENT.  NINE PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED TEN OR MORE CYCLES.  THROUGH OUR RESEARCH, AND THAT OF THE NCI, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED  THAT VAL-083 CROSSES THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE SYSUCC STUDY INDICATE THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF VAL-083  IS GENERALLY AS HIGH IN CSF AS IN PLASMA AT TWO HOURS POST-INFUSION.  CONCENTRATION  OF VAL-083 \u2014 TWO HOURS POST DOSE  MEAN  CONCENTRATIONS (NG/ML)  CONC.  RATIO @ 2 HOURS  DOSE  (MG/M  2  )  N  PLASMA  (2 HOURS POST DOSE)  CSF  (2 HOURS POST DOSE)  CSF/PLASMA  20  1  110  154  1.40  30  3  97  134  1.41  40  3  170  190  1.13  BY COMPARISON, TEMOZOLOMIDE IS TYPICALLY 80% LOWER IN THE CSF  THAN THE PLASMA (SCHRECK ET AL. 2018, ONCOLOGY (WILLISTON PARK)). THE ACCUMULATION OF VAL-083 IN THE CSF FURTHER VALIDATES THAT  VAL-083 CROSSES THE BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THERAPEUTIC DRUG CONCENTRATIONS IN THE CSF ARE ACHIEVABLE FOR EXTENDED  PERIODS OF TIME.  24  PHASE  2 STUDY IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM IN COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER  IN FEBRUARY 2017, WE INITIATED A BIOMARKER DRIVEN, OPEN-LABEL,  SINGLE-ARM PHASE 2 STUDY IN COLLABORATION WITH MDACC. THIS BIOMARKER-DRIVEN STUDY (TESTING FOR MGMT METHYLATION STATUS) HAS BEEN  AMENDED TO ENROLL UP TO 83 PATIENTS (35 WITH A STARTING DOSE OF 40 MG/M  2  /DAY AND 48 WITH A STARTING DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY)  TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF VAL-083 TREATMENT TO IMPROVE OVERALL SURVIVAL IN GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS HAVE RECURRED FOLLOWING  TREATMENT WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE. THESE PATIENTS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED PREVIOUSLY WITH AVASTIN  \u00ae  . IN ADDITION, THIS  STUDY HAS BEEN AMENDED TO ADD A NEW ADJUVANT PATIENT ARM. THIS ARM WILL INCLUDE 24 PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY TREATED WITH TMZ IN COMBINATION  WITH RADIATION WHO, RATHER THAN BEING TREATED WITH ADDITIONAL CYCLES OF TMZ, WILL BEGIN TREATMENT WITH VAL-083.  RECURRENT  STUDY ARM  THE PATIENTS IN THE RECURRENT STUDY ARM ARE RECEIVING SECOND-LINE  THERAPY WITH VAL-083 FOLLOWING TMZ FAILURE.  SIXTY-TWO PATIENTS (OUT OF A PLANNED 83) HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AS OF NOVEMBER 15,  2019, WITH 35 PATIENTS (WITH NO ADDITIONAL PATIENTS PLANNED) HAVING RECEIVED AN INITIAL DOSE OF 40 MG/M  2  /DAY AND 27  (OUT OF A PLANNED 48) HAVING RECEIVED AN INITIAL DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY (ON DAYS 1, 2 AND 3 OF A 21-DAY CYCLE). MOS FOR  THE 60 PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE CYCLE OF TREATMENT WAS 7.5 MONTHS (CI 6.0-11.5 MONTHS). FOR THE 25 OF THOSE PATIENTS  WHO INITIALLY RECEIVED THE INTENDED TREATMENT DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY, MOS WAS 10.6 MONTHS (CI 5.8-10.6 MONTHS). WHILE  THIS IS NOT A HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDY, HISTORICALLY LOMUSTINE, WHICH IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED CHEMOTHERAPY FOR THESE RECURRENT PATIENTS,  HAS DEMONSTRATED A MOS OF 7.2 MONTHS (EORTC 26101, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED LOMUSTINE ARM).  THE SAFETY PROFILE HAS BEEN WELL WITHIN THE EXISTING SAFETY  MONITORING GUIDELINES DESCRIBED IN THE PRESENT STUDY PROTOCOL. HOWEVER, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AT MDACC,  WE HAVE AMENDED THE PROTOCOL FOR THIS CLINICAL STUDY TO MODIFY THE STARTING DOSE OF VAL-083 TO 30 MG/M  2  /DAY ON DAYS  1, 2 AND 3, OF A 21-DAY CYCLE. THIS MODIFICATION MAY IMPROVE TOLERANCE IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION AND THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASE  OVERALL EXPOSURE TO VAL-083 BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CYCLES OF DRUG PATIENTS MAY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. WE HAVE MODIFIED THE PATIENT  SCREENING PLATELET COUNT, FROM 100,000/\u039cL TO 125,000/\u039cL, FOR THE SAME REASONS. SAFETY DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL BECOME  PART OF THE OVERALL SAFETY DOSSIER TO SUPPORT FUTURE FILINGS WITH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS GBM PATIENT POPULATION, WHICH HAS BEEN  HEAVILY PRE-TREATED WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE, TO BE ABLE TO BE TREATED WITH MULTIPLE CYCLES OF VAL-083 WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT HEMATOLOGICAL  TOXICITIES. WE BELIEVE THE MODIFIED DOSE OF VAL-083, IN ADDITION TO THE CHANGE IN PATIENT ELIGIBILITY PLATELET COUNTS, SHOULD HELP  PROVIDE FOR ENHANCED PATIENT SAFETY. WE BELIEVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM THIS STUDY CAN ESTABLISH A POSITION FOR VAL-083 IN THE  TREATMENT OF MGMT-UNMETHYLATED RECURRENT GBM.  A  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS STUDY CAN BE FOUND AT CLINICATRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER NUMBER: NCT02717962.  ADJUVANT  STUDY ARM  ON JULY 24, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT  IN THE ADJUVANT ARM OF THE PHASE 2 STUDY BEING CONDUCTED AT MDACC. THE ADJUVANT ARM WILL INCLUDE UP TO 24 PATIENTS. THESE PATIENTS  WILL HAVE HAD INITIAL CYCLES OF TEMOZOLOMIDE CONCOMITANT WITH RADIATION BUT WILL NOT HAVE YET STARTED SUBSEQUENT CYCLES OF TMZ  (I.E. MAINTENANCE STAGE TMZ PATIENTS). PUBLISHED DATA FROM TANGUTURI ET AL (2017 NERO-ONCOLOGY) INDICATES THAT MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  PATIENTS RECEIVING CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE HAVE A MEDIAN PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL OF 6.9 MONTHS. AS OF NOVEMBER 15, 2019, FIVE  PATIENTS (OUT OF A PLANNED 24) HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AND ALL PATIENTS REMAIN ALIVE ON CONTINUED THERAPY.  AS  NOTED ABOVE, PATIENTS IN THE RECURRENT ARM OF THE MDACC CLINICAL STUDY HAVE BEEN HEAVILY PRE-TREATED WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE. BASED  ON PUBLISHED DATA FROM OUR MDACC AND SYSUCC CLINICAL STUDIES, WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT GBM PATIENTS  IN THE PRE-TEMOZOLOMIDE MAINTENANCE STAGE (I.E., ADJUVANT). AT THE AACR\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN APRIL 2019, WE REPORTED THAT  MYELOSUPPRESSION (THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND NEUTROPENIA) IS THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH VAL-083. THE HIGHER POTENTIAL  FOR MYELOSUPPRESSION WITH THE 40 MG/M  2  /DAY OF VAL-083 IN THIS STUDY APPEARS TO BE CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF CYCLES  OF PRIOR TMZ MAINTENANCE THERAPY (> 5 CYCLES).  SAFETY ACROSS STUDIES  FOUR SUBJECTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (\u201cSAE\u201d)  POSSIBLY RELATED TO VAL-083 IN THE NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GROUP, ELEVEN SUBJECTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A POSSIBLY DRUG-RELATED SAE IN THE  RECURRENT GROUP, AND NO PATIENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A POSSIBLY DRUG-RELATED SAE IN THE ADJUVANT GROUP AS OF THE RELEVANT DATA CUT-OFF  DATES.  25  FAST  TRACK DESIGNATION  THE FDA HAS GRANTED US FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FOR VAL-083 IN  RECURRENT GBM.  FAST  TRACK DESIGNATION IS DESIGNED TO EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF DRUGS THAT SHOW PROMISE IN TREATING LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND  ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING NEW TREATMENTS TO PATIENTS EARLIER. FAST TRACK DESIGNATION PROVIDES  SPONSORS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED FREQUENCY FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE FDA TO ENSURE AN OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND  TO COLLECT APPROPRIATE DATA NEEDED TO SUPPORT DRUG APPROVAL. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE FAST TRACK DESIGNATION MAY INCLUDE AN  ACCELERATED APPROVAL, A PRIORITY REVIEW, AND A ROLLING REVIEW. ACCELERATED APPROVAL IS GRANTED TO DRUGS THAT DEMONSTRATE AN  EFFECT ON A SURROGATE, OR INTERMEDIATE ENDPOINTS, REASONABLY LIKELY TO PREDICT CLINICAL BENEFIT. PRIORITY REVIEW SHORTENS THE  FDA REVIEW PROCESS FOR A NEW DRUG FROM TEN MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR DRUGS THAT DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT  IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF AN EXISTING THERAPY. ROLLING REVIEW PROVIDES A DRUG COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO  SUBMIT COMPLETED SECTIONS OF ITS NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) FOR REVIEW BY THE FDA. TYPICALLY, NDA REVIEWS DO  NOT COMMENCE UNTIL THE DRUG COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED THE ENTIRE APPLICATION TO THE FDA. THROUGH THE FAST TRACK DESIGNATION, THE  FDA ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE THAT QUESTIONS RAISED DURING THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ARE RESOLVED QUICKLY, OFTEN LEADING TO  EARLIER APPROVAL AND INCREASED ACCESS FOR PATIENTS.  MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  GBM  GBM  IS THE MOST COMMON AND THE MOST LETHAL FORM OF GLIOMA. ACCORDING TO THE CENTRAL BRAIN TUMOR REGISTRY OF THE UNITED STATES, GBM  OCCURS WITH AN INCIDENCE OF 3.20 PER 100,000 PERSON-YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 13,000 NEW CASES OF GBM WERE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED  STATES AND 16,000 IN EUROPE DURING 2017. WITHIN THE GBM PATIENT POPULATION, APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF PATIENTS ARE UNMETHYLATED  WITH RESPECT TO THEIR MGMT STATUS.  MEASUREMENT OF MGMT (O6-METHYL GUANINE METHYLTRANSFERASE) METHYLATION  STATUS HAS BECOME ROUTINE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AS A BIOMARKER THAT CORRELATES WITH RESISTANCE TO THE STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY  WITH TMZ (TEMODAR  \u00ae  ), AND PATIENT OUTCOMES IN GBM. APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF GBM PATIENTS\u2019 TUMORS ARE CHARACTERIZED  AS \u201cMGMT-UNMETHYLATED\u201d AND EXHIBIT A HIGH EXPRESSION OF MGMT, A NATURALLY OCCURRING DNA-REPAIR ENZYME, THE ACTIVITY  OF WHICH NULLIFIES THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF TMZ. THE LACK OF SPECIFIC THERAPIES FOR MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM IS A SIGNIFICANT  UNMET MEDICAL NEED. IMPORTANTLY, THE 2017 UPDATE TO THE NCCN GUIDELINES STATES THAT THE TREATMENT BENEFIT OF TMZ IS LIKELY TO  BE LOWER IN GBM PATIENTS WITH AN UNMETHYLATED MGMT PROMOTER.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT VAL-083\u2019S ANTI-TUMOR MECHANISM  IS ACTIVE INDEPENDENT FROM THE MGMT STATUS  IN VITRO  . WE BELIEVE THIS SUGGESTS THE POTENTIAL OF VAL-083 AS A REPLACEMENT  FOR THE CURRENT STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY, TEMOZOLOMIDE, IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM. WE ARE THEREFORE UTILIZING MGMT-METHYLATION  STATUS TO IDENTIFY GBM PATIENTS WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO RESPOND TO TEMOZOLOMIDE AND INCLUDING ONLY MGMT-UNMETHYLATED PATIENTS IN OUR  CURRENT CLINICAL STUDIES OF VAL-083.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 2017 UPDATE TO THE NCCN GUIDELINES, HIGHLIGHTS THIS UNMET NEED AND THE OPPORTUNITY  FOR VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL NEW STANDARD-OF-CARE IN THE TREATMENT OF MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM.  CURRENT  TREATMENTS FOR GLIOMAS AND GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME  GLIOMAS  ARE A TYPE OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (\u201cCNS\u201d) TUMOR THAT ARISES FROM GLIAL CELLS IN THE BRAIN OR SPINE. GLIAL CELLS  ARE THE CELLS SURROUNDING NERVES. THEIR PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION FOR NEURONS IN THE CNS.  GBM  IS THE MOST COMMON AND THE MOST LETHAL FORM OF GLIOMA. ACCORDING TO THE CENTRAL BRAIN  TUMOR REGISTRY OF THE UNITED STATES, GBM OCCURS WITH AN INCIDENCE OF 3.20 PER 100,000  PERSON-YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 13,000 NEW CASES OF GBM WERE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES  AND 16,000 IN EUROPE DURING 2017.  26  COMMON  SYMPTOMS OF GBM INCLUDE HEADACHES, SEIZURES, NAUSEA, WEAKNESS, PARALYSIS AND PERSONALITY OR COGNITIVE CHANGES SUCH AS LOSS OF  SPEECH OR DIFFICULTY IN THINKING CLEARLY. GBM PROGRESSES QUICKLY AND PATIENTS\u2019 CONDITIONS DETERIORATE RAPIDLY PROGRESSING  TO DEATH. THE OUTLOOK FOR GBM PATIENTS IS GENERALLY POOR. THE OVERALL MEDIAN SURVIVAL IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM PATIENTS WITH BEST  AVAILABLE TREATMENTS IS LESS THAN 15 MONTHS, AND TWO-YEAR AND FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES ARE APPROXIMATELY 30% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY.  MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS IS 12.2 MONTHS.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NCCN UPDATED TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR GBM. THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR GBM INCLUDES SURGICAL RESECTION  TO REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE TUMOR AS POSSIBLE (\u201cDEBULKING\u201d) FOLLOWED BY RADIOTHERAPY WITH CONCOMITANT AND ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY  WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE WITH OR WITHOUT TUMOR TREATING FIELDS (\u201cTTF\u201d). GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS EXHIBIT AN UNMETHYLATED  PROMOTER FOR THE GENE ENCODING THE DNA REPAIR ENZYME MGMT, A BIOMARKER CORRELATED WITH RESISTANCE TO TEMOZOLOMIDE, MAY BE TREATED  WITH RADIATION ALONE FOLLOWING SURGERY.  PATIENTS  WITH AN UNMETHYLATED MGMT PROMOTER HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF MGMT, A NATURALLY-OCCURRING DNA REPAIR ENZYME THAT REPAIRS TUMOR-FIGHTING  LESIONS INDUCED BY TMZ THUS ALLOWING A PATIENT\u2019S TUMOR TO CONTINUE TO GROW DESPITE TREATMENT, WHICH LEADS TO POOR OUTCOMES.  MEASUREMENT OF MGMT METHYLATION STATUS HAS BECOME ROUTINE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AS BIOMARKER THAT CORRELATES WITH RESPONSE TO TMZ  AND PATIENT OUTCOMES IN GBM.  PROBABILITY  OF GBM PATIENT SURVIVAL CORRELATED TO EXPRESSION OF MGMT ENZYME  (UNMETHYLATED PROMOTER = HIGH MGMT EXPRESSION AND SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER SURVIVAL)  TTF  (OPTUNE  \u00ae  ) IS A NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ADULTS WITH GBM. TTF USES ALTERNATING ELECTRICAL FIELDS TO DISRUPT TUMOR  CELL DIVISION, OR CAUSE CELL DEATH, THEREBY PREVENTING THE TUMOR FROM GROWING OR SPREADING AS QUICKLY. A CLINICAL STUDY REPORTED  THAT GBM PATIENTS TREATED WITH TTF COMBINED WITH TMZ EXPERIENCED LONGER SURVIVAL THAN THOSE TREATED WITH TMZ ALONE.  THE  MAJORITY OF GBM PATIENTS\u2019 TUMORS RECUR WITHIN 6 \u2013 12 MONTHS OF INITIAL TREATMENT. EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY THROUGH CLINICAL  STUDIES IS RECOMMENDED UNDER NCCN GUIDELINES FOR ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. NCCN GUIDELINES ALSO RECOMMEND TREATMENT WITH SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY,  SUCH AS LOMUSTINE (\u201cCCNU\u201d). FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL SURGICAL DEBULKING, LOCAL CHEMOTHERAPY WITH  CARMUSTINE (\u201cBCNU\u201d) WAFERS MAY BE EMPLOYED. CCNU AND BCNU TARGET THE SAME DNA-SITE AS TMZ AND ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO  MGMT-RELATED RESISTANCE.  27  AVASTIN  (AVASTIN  \u00ae  , AN ANTI-VEGF ANTIBODY) RECENTLY RECEIVED FULL APPROVAL IN THE US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND JAPAN AS A  SINGLE AGENT FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT GBM FOLLOWING PRIOR THERAPY. AVASTIN CARRIES AN FDA \u201cBLACK-BOX WARNING\u201d RELATED  TO SEVERE, SOMETIMES FATAL, SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS, WOUND HEALING COMPLICATIONS AND HEMORRHAGE. THERE  ARE NO DATA DEMONSTRATING AN IMPROVEMENT IN DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS OR INCREASED SURVIVAL FOR GBM PATIENTS TREATED WITH AVASTIN.  RECURRENT  GBM PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOSE TUMORS PROGRESS FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH AVASTIN, HAVE LIMITED OR NO TREATMENT OPTIONS AND  A VERY POOR PROGNOSIS. ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED LITERATURE, THE MEDIAN SURVIVAL FOR GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS PROGRESS FOLLOWING  AVASTIN IS LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS.  VAL-083  MECHANISM OF ACTION  CHEMOTHERAPY  FORMS THE BASIS OF TREATMENT IN NEARLY ALL CANCERS. WE BELIEVE THAT VAL-083 MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING TUMORS EXHIBITING BIOLOGICAL  FEATURES THAT CAUSE RESISTANCE TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CHEMOTHERAPY, PARTICULARLY FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE FAILED, OR BECOME RESISTANT  TO, OTHER TREATMENT REGIMENS.  BASED  ON PUBLISHED RESEARCH AND OUR OWN DATA, THE CYTOTOXIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, AND THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF VAL-083 ARE FUNCTIONALLY  DIFFERENT FROM ALKYLATING AGENTS COMMONLY USED IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. VAL-083 HAS PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED ACTIVITY IN CELL-LINES  THAT ARE RESISTANT TO OTHER TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. NO EVIDENCE OF CROSS-RESISTANCE HAS BEEN REPORTED IN PUBLISHED CLINICAL STUDIES.  OUR  RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT VAL-083 ATTACKS CANCER CELLS VIA A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER CHEMOTHERAPIES  USED IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT VAL-083 FORMS INTER-STRAND CROSSLINKS AT THE N  7  POSITION OF  GUANINE ON THE DNA OF CANCER CELLS. OUR DATA ALSO INDICATE THAT THIS CROSSLINK FORMS RAPIDLY AND IS NOT EASILY REPAIRED BY THE  CANCER CELL RESULTING IN CELL-CYCLE ARREST AND LETHAL DOUBLE-STRAND DNA BREAKS IN CANCER CELLS. VAL-083 READILY CROSSES THE BLOOD  BRAIN BARRIER. PUBLISHED PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE THAT VAL-083 IS ABSORBED MORE READILY IN TUMOR CELLS THAN  IN NORMAL CELLS.  IN  VITRO  , OUR DATA ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT VAL-083\u2019S DISTINCT MECHANISM MAY BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DRUG RESISTANCE AGAINST A  RANGE OF CANCERS. FOR EXAMPLE, VAL-083 IS ACTIVE AGAINST MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM CELLS WHICH ARE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE  AND NITROSOUREAS. VAL-083 ALSO RETAINS A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN P53 MUTATED NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (\u201cNSCLC\u201d),  OVARIAN CANCER AND MEDULLOBLASTOMA CELL LINES THAT ARE RESISTANT TO PLATINUM-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY.  IMPORTANTLY,  CLINICAL ACTIVITY AGAINST EACH OF THE TUMORS MENTIONED ABOVE WAS ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR NCI-SPONSORED PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HISTORICAL CLINICAL DATA AND OUR OWN RESEARCH SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL NEW TREATMENT  FOR MULTIPLE TYPES OF CANCER.  THE  MAIN DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITY (\u201cDLT\u201d) RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF VAL-083 IN PREVIOUS NCI-SPONSORED CLINICAL STUDIES  AND OUR OWN CLINICAL STUDIES IS MYELOSUPPRESSION, PARTICULARLY THROMBOCYTOPENIA. MYELOSUPPRESSION, INCLUDING THROMBOCYTOPENIA,  IS A COMMON SIDE EFFECT OF CHEMOTHERAPY. MYELOSUPPRESSION IS THE DECREASE IN CELLS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING IMMUNITY, CARRYING  OXYGEN, AND CAUSING NORMAL BLOOD CLOTTING. THROMBOCYTOPENIA IS A REDUCTION IN PLATELET COUNTS WHICH ASSIST IN BLOOD CLOTTING.  MODERN MEDICINE ALLOWS FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF MYELOSUPPRESSIVE SIDE EFFECTS. WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY  TO IMPROVE UPON THE DRUG\u2019S ALREADY ESTABLISHED EFFICACY PROFILE BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING THE DOSE OF VAL-083 THAT CAN  BE SAFELY ADMINISTERED TO CANCER PATIENTS.  THERE  IS NO EVIDENCE OF LUNG, LIVER, OR KIDNEY TOXICITY EVEN WITH PROLONGED TREATMENT BY VAL-083. DATA FROM THE CHINESE MARKET WHERE  THE DRUG HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS SUPPORTS THE SAFETY FINDINGS OF THE NCI STUDIES.  28  OTHER  INDICATIONS FOR VAL-083 \u2014 POTENTIAL FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES  OVARIAN  CANCER  OVARIAN  CANCER IS THE FIFTH MOST COMMON CANCER IN WOMEN AND IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH GYNECOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES.  IN 2016, APPROXIMATELY 22,300 WOMEN IN THE US WERE DIAGNOSED WITH OVARIAN CANCER AND 14,300 DIED FROM THEIR DISEASE.  VAL-083\u2019S  ACTIVITY AGAINST OVARIAN EPITHELIAL ADENOCARCINOMA (\u201cOEA\u201d) AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE CERVIX (\u201cSCC\u201d)  WAS REPORTED IN PRIOR NCI-SPONSORED CLINICAL STUDIES. IMPORTANTLY, NCI-RESEARCHERS RECOMMENDED VAL-083 FOR FURTHER ADVANCED STUDIES  IN THE TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CANCER.  WE  HAVE PRESENTED DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT VAL-083\u2019S DISTINCT MECHANISM OF ACTION ALLOWS ACTIVITY IN TUMORS THAT ARE RESISTANT  TO OTHER THERAPIES. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT CYTOTOXICITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST OVARIAN CANCER IS INDEPENDENT OF SENSITIVITY TO CISPLATIN  OR P53 STATUS  IN VITRO.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT VAL-083 IS ACTIVE IN PT-RESISTANT OVARIAN CELLS HARBORING A RANGE OF  P53-MUTATIONS.  IN  APRIL 2016, THE FDA GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CANCER.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, WE FILED AN IND FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN OVARIAN CANCER, ALONG WITH A PROTOCOL FOR A PHASE 1/2, OPEN-LABEL, MULTICENTER,  STUDY OF VAL-083 IN PATIENTS WITH  RE  CURRENT  P  LATINUM  R  ESISTANT  OV  ARIAN  CANCER (THE REPROVE STUDY).  THE  FDA HAS ALLOWED THIS STUDY TO BEGIN ENROLLING PATIENTS, BUT BASED ON ONGOING EVALUATION AND INPUT FROM OUR OVARIAN CLINICAL ADVISORY  BOARD, WE ARE REASSESSING THE OVARIAN CANCER PROGRAM. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE BEST PATH FORWARD IN OVARIAN CANCER  AND ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS STRATEGIC OPTIONS INCLUDING COMBINATION WITH PARP INHIBITORS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE INACTIVATED THE  IND WHILE WE EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE STUDY DESIGNS.  LUNG  CANCER  LUNG  CANCER IS A LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH AROUND THE WORLD AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR LUNG CANCER REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL  UNMET NEED DESPITE ADVANCES IN THERAPY. INCIDENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY 47 PER 100,000 WITH THE  MAJORITY (85%) BEING NSCLC, THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF LUNG CANCER. GLOBALLY, THE MARKET FOR LUNG CANCER TREATMENT MAY EXCEED $24  BILLION BY 2033 ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED BY EVALUATE PHARMA.  THE  ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST SOLID TUMORS, INCLUDING LUNG CANCER, HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN BOTH PRECLINICAL AND HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES  CONDUCTED BY THE NCI. DELMAR HAS DEVELOPED NEW NONCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THE UTILITY OF VAL-083 IN THE MODERN TREATMENT OF LUNG  CANCER. IN AN ESTABLISHED MURINE XENOGRAFT MODEL OF NSCLC, THE ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 WAS COMPARED TO STANDARD PLATINUM-BASED THERAPY  WITH CISPLATIN AGAINST HUMAN NSCLC CELL LINES A549 (TKI-SENSITIVE) AND H1975 (TKI-RESISTANT). IN THE STUDY, VAL-083 DEMONSTRATED  SUPERIOR EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN THE TREATMENT OF TKI-SUSCEPTIBLE (A549) TUMORS AND IN TKI-RESISTANT (H1975) TUMORS.  CENTRAL  NERVOUS SYSTEM METASTASES OF SOLID TUMORS  THE  SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC TUMORS BY MODERN TARGETED THERAPIES HAS LED TO INCREASED INCIDENCE OF MORTALITY DUE TO CNS METASTASES  OF LUNG CANCER AND OTHER SOLID TUMORS. IN JUNE 2013, WE SPLIT OUR PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL INTO TWO SEPARATE STUDIES.  ONE FOCUSING SOLELY ON REFRACTORY GBM AND THE OTHER FOCUSING ON SECONDARY BRAIN CANCERS CAUSED BY OTHER TUMORS THAT HAVE SPREAD  TO THE BRAIN.  BASED  ON HISTORICAL CLINICAL ACTIVITY AND OUR OWN RESEARCH, WE BELIEVE THAT VAL-083 MAY BE SUITABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH  CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM METASTASES WHO CURRENTLY HAVE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS. SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING  RESOURCES, WE MAY DEVELOP A SEPARATE PROTOCOL FOR THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF VAL-083 IN PATIENTS WITH SECONDARY BRAIN CANCER  CAUSED BY A SOLID TUMOR SPREADING TO THE BRAIN.  PEDIATRIC  BRAIN TUMORS  TUMORS  OF THE BRAIN AND SPINE MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY 20% OF ALL CHILDHOOD CANCERS AND THEY ARE THE SECOND MOST COMMON FORM OF CHILDHOOD  CANCER AFTER LEUKEMIA.  THE  ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT BRAIN TUMORS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN BOTH PRECLINICAL AND HUMAN CLINICAL  STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE NCI. WE HAVE PRESENTED DATA INDICATING THAT VAL-083 OFFERS POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THE  TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS INCLUDING SHH-P53 MUTATED MEDULLOBLASTOMA. IN MARCH 2016, THE FDA GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION  FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF MEDULLOBLASTOMA. SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, WE INTEND TO COLLABORATE  WITH LEADING ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS FOR THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS.  29  CORPORATE  HISTORY  WE ARE A NEVADA CORPORATION FORMED ON JUNE 24, 2009 UNDER THE  NAME BERRY ONLY, INC.

THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY, PRECLINICAL RESEARCH, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES. WITH RESPECT TO NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WE  RECOGNIZED $27,495 AND $25,744 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 RESPECTIVELY. FOR BOTH PERIODS, THE  AMOUNT RECOGNIZED RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXPENSE AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES.  32  EXCLUDING  THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $684,698 DURING THE  CURRENT QUARTER FROM $921,505 FOR THE PRIOR QUARTER DUE TO LOWER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRECLINICAL  RESEARCH, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MANUFACTURING  OF OUR FIRST LOT OF GMP DRUG PRODUCT WHICH WAS COMPLETED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. CLINICAL  DEVELOPMENT COSTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, PATIENT ENROLLMENT,  HOW A PATIENT REACTS TO TREATMENT, AND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENT CYCLES A PATIENT RECEIVES.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COSTS DECREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS WE HAVE REFINED OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO BY FOCUSING ON OUR  MOST IMPORTANT PATENT CLAIMS IN THE MOST STRATEGIC JURISDICTIONS. PATENT COSTS CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING ON THE FILING OF  NEW PATENTS, CONVERSION OF THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATIONS TO PCT APPLICATIONS, FOREIGN OFFICE ACTIONS, AND ACTUAL FILING COSTS. PRECLINICAL  RESEARCH COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN THE CURRENT QUARTER DUE TO THE COMPLETION, OR DEFERRAL, OF STUDIES THAT WERE ONGOING IN THE PRIOR  PERIOD. PERSONNEL COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEAD COUNT.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $1,053,747  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 FROM $874,884 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION  OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OFFICE AND SUNDRY EXPENSES. IN RELATION TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $170,373 RELATING TO  WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE WHILE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED NON-CASH,  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $158,279 RELATING TO STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT EXPENSES, AND WARRANTS ISSUED  FOR SERVICES. ALL PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS WERE CANCELED ON APRIL 30, 2019 SO THERE WAS NO RELATED EXPENSE INCURRED DURING THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $883,374 FROM $716,605 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OFFICE AND SUNDRY EXPENSES IN  THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER ACCOUNTING AND LEGAL FEES AND INCREASED  INVESTOR OUTREACH EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OFFICE AND SUNDRY HAS INCREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER COSTS OF DIRECTORS\u2019 AND OFFICERS\u2019 LIABILITY INSURANCE.

THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, PRECLINICAL RESEARCH,  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES. REGARDING NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, WE RECOGNIZED $40,491AND $58,334  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. FOR BOTH PERIODS, NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION  RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXPENSE AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES.  EXCLUDING  THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $1,393,177 DURING  THE CURRENT PERIOD FROM $1,908,035 FOR THE PRIOR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE MANUFACTURING,  AND RELATED COSTS, OF OUR FIRST LOT OF GMP API AND DRUG PRODUCT WHICH WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018. ALSO, WE INCURRED HIGHER PATIENT COSTS IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS SAMPLING ANALYSIS AS THE NUMBER OF TOTAL ENROLLED  PATIENTS IN OUR PHASE 2 STUDIES HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, THE FORMATION OF OUR SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD OCCURRED  IN JUNE 2019 RESULTING IN FEES INCURRED IN 2019 THAT WERE NOT INCURRED IN 2018. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS CAN VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, PATIENT ENROLLMENT, HOW A PATIENT REACTS TO  TREATMENT, AND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENT CYCLES A PATIENT RECEIVES.  PRECLINICAL RESEARCH COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN  THE PERIOD DUE TO THE COMPLETION, OR DEFERRAL, OF STUDIES THAT WERE ONGOING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COSTS DECREASED  IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS WE HAVE REFINED OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO  BY FOCUSING ON OUR MOST IMPORTANT PATENT CLAIMS IN THE MOST STRATEGIC JURISDICTIONS. PATENT COSTS CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING  ON THE FILING OF NEW PATENTS, CONVERSION OF THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATIONS TO PCT APPLICATIONS, FOREIGN OFFICE ACTIONS, AND ACTUAL  FILING COSTS. PERSONNEL COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEAD COUNT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,967,375 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $1,861,354 FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, OFFICE AND SUNDRY,  AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR PERIOD. IN RELATION TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE  INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE $213,205 RELATING TO WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES AND STOCK OPTION  EXPENSE WHILE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $354,905 RELATING TO PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS, WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES, AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ALL PERFORMANCE SHARE  UNITS WERE CANCELED ON APRIL 30, 2019 SO THERE WAS NO RELATED EXPENSE INCURRED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019.  34  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $1,754,170 FROM $1,506,449 FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, OFFICE AND SUNDRY, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES  IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACCOUNTING  AND LEGAL FEES AND INCREASED INVESTOR OUTREACH EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. OFFICE AND SUNDRY HAS INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO COSTS OF HIGHER DIRECTORS\u2019 AND OFFICERS\u2019 LIABILITY INSURANCE.  PREFERRED  SHARE DIVIDENDS  FOR  EACH OF THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 WE RECORDED $4,178 RELATED TO THE DIVIDEND PAYABLE TO VALENT  ON THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK. THE DIVIDEND HAS BEEN RECORDED AS A DIRECT INCREASE IN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT FOR BOTH  PERIODS.  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE ISSUED 7,400 (2018 \u2013 9,695) SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS A DIVIDEND ON THE  SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK AND RECOGNIZED $4,598 (2018 - $52,275) AS A DIRECT INCREASE IN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT.

DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 WE REPORTED NET LOSSES OF $3,345,922 AND $3,801,501, RESPECTIVELY. NON-CASH ITEMS RELATING TO AMORTIZATION  OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SHARES AND WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES, PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT EXPENSE (2018 ONLY), AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE  TOTALED $259,298 (2018 - $423,985) FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE FROM A USE OF CASH FROM A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES  OF $993,766 AND A REDUCTION IN RELATED PARTY PAYABLES OF $48,534. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS CASH FROM A REDUCTION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND DEPOSITS LARGELY DUE TO A PARTIAL REFUND OF A CLINICAL  STUDY DEPOSIT OF $728,276 AND CASH USED IN A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $420,679.  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WE RECEIVED $6,582,966 IN NET PROCEEDS FROM THE COMPLETION OF AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC  OFFERING BY US OF COMMON STOCK, PRE-FUNDED WARRANTS, AND COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECEIVED $26,550  PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE RECEIVED  $784,961 FROM THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.  WE  RECORDED $4,178 RELATED TO THE DIVIDEND PAYABLE TO VALENT DURING EACH OF THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  RESPECTIVELY.  35  GOING  CONCERN AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  GOING  CONCERN  (SEE  NOTE 1 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)  THE  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS WHICH ASSUMES THAT WE WILL CONTINUE  OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF LIABILITIES IN THE  NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE REPORTED A LOSS  OF $3,345,922 AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $3,976,058. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $63,933,043  AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $6,348,038. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES TO DATE. WE  DO NOT HAVE THE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING REVENUES UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS COMMERCIALIZED, OR PARTNERED, WHICH  MAY NOT EVER OCCUR. IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAINTAIN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  PROJECTS, AND FOR GENERAL OPERATIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT EXISTS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A  GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF FILING THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CONSEQUENTLY,  MANAGEMENT IS PURSUING VARIOUS FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS SO WE CAN CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. MANAGEMENT  PLANS TO SECURE THE NECESSARY FINANCING THROUGH THE ISSUE OF NEW EQUITY AND/OR THE ENTERING INTO OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS.  WE MAY TAILOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE ARE ABLE TO RAISE IN THE FUTURE. NEVERTHELESS,  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY  BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD BE MATERIAL.  OUR  FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u25cf  THE  RATE OF PROGRESS AND COST OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND OTHER DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION CAPABILITIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS OF ACQUIRING OR INVESTING IN BUSINESSES, PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND TECHNOLOGIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS AND TIMING OF SEEKING AND OBTAINING FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY APPROVALS;  \u25cf  THE  EFFECT OF COMPETING TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS;  \u25cf  THE  ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS AND TIMING OF ANY COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS INTO WHICH WE MAY ENTER; AND  \u25cf  THE  IMPACT OF US BEING A PUBLIC ENTITY.  UNTIL WE CAN GENERATE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF  PRODUCT REVENUE TO FINANCE OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WE MAY NEVER DO, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE FUTURE CASH NEEDS PRIMARILY THROUGH  PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OFFERINGS, OR STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT  IN DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CERTAIN OF THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK.  IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK, CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING, THESE  SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY FUNDING ARRANGEMENT  COULD REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND ACTIVITY IN EQUITY  MARKETS. WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE  ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY HAVE TO DELAY, REDUCE THE SCOPE OF OR ELIMINATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR MAKE CHANGES TO OUR OPERATING PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK A PARTNER FOR ONE OR MORE OF  OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE PROGRAMS AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD LOWER THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO US.  36  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES, REQUIRES  COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT BOTH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RECORDING OF ASSETS,  LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. SOME OF THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE JUDGMENTS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND  THEREFORE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  A  DETAILED PRESENTATION OF ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE ESTIMATES DERIVED THEREFROM IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 2  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 CONTAINED IN OUR FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SEC ON SEPTEMBER  9, 2019. WHILE ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE  FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE ESTIMATES DERIVED THEREFROM ARE CRITICAL.  \u25cf  WARRANTS  AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES  \u25cf  STOCK  OPTIONS  \u25cf  DERIVATIVE  LIABILITY  \u25cf  ACCRUALS  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND CLINICAL TRIALS  WARRANTS  AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES  WE  HAVE ISSUED EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES. THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE FAIR  VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT GRANTED.  STOCK  OPTIONS  WE  ACCOUNT FOR THESE AWARDS UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 718, \u201cCOMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d  (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE  OF GRANT AND RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR  UNVESTED OPTIONS TO NON-EMPLOYEES IS REVALUED AT EACH PERIOD END AND IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS.  THE DETERMINATION OF GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS IS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES  VARIABLES SUCH AS THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE, THE ANTICIPATED EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OF ITS GRANTEE, INTEREST RATES,  AND DIVIDEND YIELDS. THESE VARIABLES ARE PROJECTED BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL DATA, EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN ANY  OF THESE VARIABLES COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS. SUCH VALUE IS RECOGNIZED  AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, NET OF ACTUAL FORFEITURES, USING THE ACCELERATED ATTRIBUTION METHOD. WE RECOGNIZE  FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR. THE ESTIMATION OF STOCK AWARDS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY VEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT ACTUAL  RESULTS, OR UPDATED ESTIMATES, DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT IN THE PERIOD  ESTIMATES ARE REVISED.  DERIVATIVE  LIABILITY  WE  ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN WARRANTS UNDER THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO, AND  POTENTIALLY SETTLED IN, A COMPANY\u2019S OWN STOCK, ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS,  THE WARRANTS REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES UPON EXERCISE AND DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY PRECLUDE AN IMPLIED RIGHT TO NET CASH SETTLEMENT.  WE CLASSIFY THESE WARRANTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY WHICH IS FAIR VALUED AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD SUBSEQUENT  TO THE INITIAL ISSUANCE. WE HAVE USED A BINOMIAL MODEL AS WELL AS A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL (BASED ON A CLOSED-FORM  MODEL THAT USES A FIXED EQUATION) TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE WARRANTS. DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE FAIR-VALUE MODEL  AND CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. ANY CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATES (SPECIFICALLY PROBABILITIES  AND VOLATILITY) USED MAY CAUSE THE VALUE TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THAT REPORTED. THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK  AT THE DATE OF ISSUANCE, AND AT EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD, IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST  RATE IS BASED ON RATES PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BONDS WITH A MATURITY SIMILAR TO THE EXPECTED REMAINING LIFE OF THE WARRANTS  AT THE VALUATION DATE. THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE WARRANTS IS ASSUMED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THEIR REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM.  37  ACCRUALS  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND CLINICAL TRIALS  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR EXPENSES RESULTING FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS, CLINICAL RESEARCH  ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSULTANTS, AND UNDER CLINICAL SITE AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS. THE FINANCIAL  TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH VARY FROM CONTRACT TO CONTRACT AND MAY RESULT IN PAYMENT TERMS THAT  DO NOT MATCH THE PERIODS OVER WHICH MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED UNDER SUCH CONTRACTS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REFLECT THE APPROPRIATE  EXPENSES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY MATCHING THOSE EXPENSES WITH THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PERFORMED AND EFFORTS ARE  EXPENDED. WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE EXPENSES ACCORDING TO THE TIMING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE EXPENSES. WE DETERMINE ACCRUAL ESTIMATES  BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DISCUSSION WITH APPLICABLE PERSONNEL AND OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS AS TO THE PROGRESS OF CLINICAL TRIALS,  OR THE SERVICES COMPLETED. DURING THE COURSE OF A CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ADJUST OUR CLINICAL EXPENSE RECOGNITION IF ACTUAL RESULTS  DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. WE MAKE ESTIMATES OF OUR ACCRUED EXPENSES AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  KNOWN TO US AT THAT TIME. OUR CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TIMELY AND ACCURATE REPORTING OF CONTRACT RESEARCH  ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT OUR ESTIMATES TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM AMOUNTS ACTUALLY  INCURRED, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS AND TIMING OF SERVICES PERFORMED RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL STATUS AND TIMING OF SERVICES  PERFORMED MAY VARY AND MAY RESULT IN US REPORTING AMOUNTS THAT ARE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRIOR PERIOD ESTIMATES OF ACCRUED EXPENSES  FOR CLINICAL TRIALS.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  38", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "CIK": 1498382, "Date": "2020-02-13T00:00:00", "Ticker": "DMPI", "Name": "Delmar Pharmaceuticals Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 2834.0, "Business": "A1", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 990360497.0, "key": "20200213DMPI", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -0.18181818181820214, "labelr4": 5.646630236794177, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.58204806, "prof1": 0.41795197, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.001818181818182, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9452492134459348, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.001818181818182, "return4": 0.9435336976320582, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.2336009662557855, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3708, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0037444066826715, "cumreturn1b": 0.8841102354624248, "cumreturn1c": 0.9823369712597232, "cumreturndow": 1.0403949599100029, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0351505700838362}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3720, "level_0": 3819, "index": 72893, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE  PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT HAVE AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FOR THE PERIODS DESCRIBED. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. PLEASE SEE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d  ABOVE.  HISTORICAL OPERATIONS  GULFSLOPE ENERGY, INC. IS AN INDEPENDENT  OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE UNITED STATES, GULF OF MEXICO FEDERAL  WATERS OFFSHORE LOUISIANA IN 450 FEET OR LESS OF WATER DEPTH. THE COMPANY HAS UNDER LEASE SEVEN FEDERAL OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF  BLOCKS (REFERRED TO AS \u201cLEASES\u201d IN THIS REPORT) AND LICENSED 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) SEISMIC DATA  IN ITS AREA OF CONCENTRATION. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS DATA HAS BEEN REPROCESSED UTILIZING REVERSE TIME MIGRATION (RTM) TO MORE  ACCURATELY DEFINE THE IMAGING BELOW SALT. SINCE MARCH 2013, WE HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING HIGH-POTENTIAL OIL AND  NATURAL GAS PROSPECTS LOCATED ON THE SHELF IN THE U.S. GOM. WE HAVE EVALUATED OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA USING ADVANCED INTERPRETATION  TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ANALYSES, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND ACQUIRED LEASES ON MULTIPLE PROSPECTS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY CONTAIN  ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBON DEPOSITS, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT MORE REFINED ANALYSES OF OUR PROSPECTS AS WELL  AS TARGET ADDITIONAL LEASE AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. WE HAVE GIVEN PREFERENCE TO AREAS WITH WATER DEPTHS OF 450 FEET OR LESS WHERE  PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR ANY DISCOVERIES TO BE DEVELOPED RAPIDLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY WITH  THE GOAL TO REDUCE ECONOMIC RISK WHILE INCREASING RETURNS. RECENT ACTIONS OF THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT (\u201cBOEM\u201d)  HAVE REDUCED THE ROYALTY RATE FOR LEASES ACQUIRED IN FUTURE LEASE SALES IN WATER DEPTHS OF LESS THAN 200 METERS (APPROXIMATELY  656 FEET) FROM 18.75% TO 12.5%, WHICH FURTHER ENHANCES THE ECONOMICS FOR THE DRILLING OF ANY LEASES ACQUIRED AFTER AUGUST 2017  IN THESE WATER DEPTHS. THIS REDUCED ROYALTY APPLIES TO THREE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES.  THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL  PERSON HOURS IN THE REPROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION OF SEISMIC DATA. WE BELIEVE THE PROPRIETARY REPROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION  AND THE CONTIGUOUS NATURE OF OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (\u201cE&P\u201d)  COMPANIES OPERATING IN OUR CORE AREA.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY OPERATED OUR BUSINESS  WITH WORKING CAPITAL DEFICITS AND THESE DEFICITS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY EQUITY AND DEBT INVESTMENTS AND LOANS FROM MANAGEMENT. AS  OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD $3.8 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND, $3.1 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS FOR THE PAYMENT OF JOINT PAYABLES FROM  DRILLING OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL NEED TO RAISE A MINIMUM OF $10.0 MILLION TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND PLANNED  EXPENDITURES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021. THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCINGS.  THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WITH ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES  EXPERIENCED  MANAGEMENT  . OUR MANAGEMENT HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN FINDING AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS. OUR TEAM HAS A TRACK  RECORD OF DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS OVER 200  YEARS OF COMBINED INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE EXPLORING, DISCOVERING, AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS. WE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED A TECHNICAL  TEAM WITH OVER 150 YEARS OF COMBINED INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE EXPLORING FOR AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND  EXECUTION OF OUR TECHNICAL STRATEGY. WE BELIEVE THE APPLICATION OF ADVANCED GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES ON A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA  WITH UNIQUE GEOLOGIC FEATURES SUCH AS CONVENTIONAL RESERVOIRS WHOSE TRAPPING CONFIGURATIONS HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY OVERLYING SALT  LAYERS PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  ADVANCED  SEISMIC IMAGE PROCESSING  . COMMERCIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN 3-D SEISMIC DATA IMAGING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED PROCESSING  ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING PRE-STACK DEPTH, BEAM, AND REVERSE TIME MIGRATION HAVE ALLOWED THE INDUSTRY TO BETTER DISTINGUISH HYDROCARBON  TRAPS AND IDENTIFY PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PROSPECTS. SPECIFICALLY, ADVANCED PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IMPROVE THE DEFINITION OF THE SEISMIC  DATA FROM A SCALE OF TIME TO A SCALE OF DEPTH, THUS CORRECTLY LOCATING THE IMAGES IN THREE DIMENSIONS. OUR TECHNICAL TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT  EXPERIENCE UTILIZING ADVANCED SEISMIC IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IN OUR CORE AREA, AND WE APPLY THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MOST ADVANCED  NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE CLEARER IMAGES.  INDUSTRY  LEADING POSITION IN OUR CORE AREA  . WE HAVE LICENSED 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF 3D SEISMIC DATA WHICH COVERS OVER 440 OCS FEDERAL  LEASE BLOCKS ON THE HIGHLY PROLIFIC LOUISIANA OUTER SHELF, OFFSHORE GULF OF MEXICO. WE BELIEVE THE PROPRIETARY AND STATE-OF-THE-ART  REPROCESSING OF OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA, ALONG WITH OUR PROPRIETARY AND LEADING-EDGE GEOLOGIC DEPOSITIONAL RESERVOIR SAND  AND PETROLEUM TRAPPING MODELS, GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE IN ASSEMBLING A HIGH-QUALITY DRILLING PORTFOLIO IN OUR CORE AREA. WE CONTINUOUSLY  WORK TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL LEASING OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR DRILLING PORTFOLIO.  TECHNICAL STRATEGY  WE BELIEVE THAT  A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL HYDROCARBON ACCUMULATIONS GLOBALLY HAS BEEN THE INABILITY OF SEISMIC TECHNOLOGY TO ACCURATELY  IMAGE DEEPER GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS BECAUSE OF OVERLYING MASSIVE, EXTENSIVE, AND COMPLEX SALT BODIES. LARGE AND THICK LATERALLY EXTENSIVE  SUBSURFACE SALT LAYERS HIGHLY DISTORT THE SEISMIC RAY PATHS TRAVELING THROUGH THEM, WHICH OFTEN HAS LED TO MISINTERPRETATION OF  THE UNDERLYING GEOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL MAJOR ACCUMULATIONS OF OIL AND GAS. WE BELIEVE THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS FOR A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN  COMPANY TO EXTENSIVELY APPLY ADVANCED SEISMIC ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES, WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE COMMERCIAL  DISCOVERY RATES FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS, AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT APPRAISAL AND DEVELOPMENT, POTENTIALLY HAVING A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT  ON RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DEEP WATER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  WORLDWIDE, AND WE ARE USING THEM TO DRILL TARGETS BELOW THE SALT BODIES IN AN AREA OF THE SHALLOWER WATERS OF THE GOM WHERE INDUSTRY  ACTIVITY HAS LARGELY BEEN ABSENT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. IN FACT, GULFSLOPE MANAGEMENT LED THE EARLY INDUSTRY TEAMS IN THEIR SUCCESSFUL  EFFORTS TO DISCOVER AND DEVELOP FIVE NEW FIELDS BELOW THE EXTENSIVE SALT BODIES IN OUR CORE AREA DURING THE 1990\u2019S, WHICH  HAVE PRODUCED OVER 125 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT.  14  OUR TECHNICAL  APPROACH TO EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT IS TO DEPLOY A TEAM OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED GEO-SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE CURRENT AND EXTENSIVE  UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OF THE PETROLEUM SYSTEM WITHIN OUR CORE AREA, THEREBY DECREASING THE TRADITIONAL TIMING  AND EXECUTION RISKS OF ADVANCING UP A LEARNING CURVE. FOR DATA LICENSING, RE-PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION, OUR TECHNICAL STAFF  HAS PRIORITIZED SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITHIN OUR 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF SEISMIC COVERAGE, WITH THE GOAL TO OPTIMIZE INITIAL CAPITAL  OUTLAYS.  MODERN 3-D SEISMIC  DATASETS WITH ACQUISITION PARAMETERS THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR IMPROVED IMAGING AT MULTIPLE DEPTHS ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN MANY OF  THESE SUB-BASINS ACROSS OUR CORE AREA, AND THEY CAN BE LICENSED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. THE APPLICATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART  SEISMIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE DELINEATION OF PROSPECTIVE STRUCTURES AND TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBON-CHARGED  RESERVOIRS BELOW MANY COMPLEX SALT BODIES. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SEISMIC TECHNOLOGY IS REVERSE TIME MIGRATION, WHICH WE BELIEVE  TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE, FASTEST, AND YET AFFORDABLE, SEISMIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY FOR CRITICAL DEPTH IMAGING AVAILABLE TODAY.  LEASE AND ACQUISITION  STRATEGY  OUR PROSPECT IDENTIFICATION  AND ANALYTICAL STRATEGY IS BASED ON A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGIC TRENDS WITHIN OUR CORE AREA. EXPLORATION EFFORTS HAVE  BEEN FOCUSED IN AREAS WHERE LEASE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. WE ENTERED INTO TWO MASTER 3-D LICENSE AGREEMENTS,  TOGETHER COVERING APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION ACRES AND WE HAVE COMPLETED ADVANCED PROCESSING ON SELECT AREAS WITHIN THIS LICENSED  SEISMIC AREA EXCEEDING ONE MILLION ACRES. WE CAN EXPAND THIS COVERAGE AND PERFORM FURTHER ADVANCED PROCESSING, BOTH WITH CURRENTLY  LICENSED SEISMIC DATA AND SEISMIC DATA TO BE ACQUIRED. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE AND REPROCESS THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DATA AVAILABLE  IN THE POTENTIAL PROSPECT\u2019S DIRECT VICINITY. THIS INCLUDES ADVANCED IMAGING INFORMATION TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A  PARTICULAR RESERVOIR\u2019S CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BOTH TRAPPING MECHANICS AND FLUID MIGRATION PATTERNS. REPROCESSING IS ACCOMPLISHED  THROUGH A SERIES OF MODEL BUILDING STEPS THAT INCORPORATE THE GEOMETRY OF THE GEOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE THE FINAL IMAGE. OUR INTEGRATION  OF EXISTING GEOLOGIC UNDERSTANDING AND ENHANCED SEISMIC PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION PROVIDES US WITH UNIQUE INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES  ON EXISTING PRODUCING AREAS AND ESPECIALLY UNDEREXPLORED FORMATIONS BELOW AND ADJACENT TO SALT BODIES THAT ARE HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE  FOR HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION.  WE CURRENTLY  HOLD SEVEN LEASES THAT COMPRISE FIVE PROSPECTS AND WE INTEND TO EVALUATE ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR GROWTH  OPPORTUNITIES WITH COMPANIES THAT HOLD ACTIVE LEASES IN OUR CORE AREA. OUR LEASES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PRIMARY TERM, EXPIRING IN  2020, 2022 AND 2023. BOEM\u2019S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PROVIDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS FOR LEASEHOLDERS TO APPLY TO RECEIVE  EXTENSIONS OF LEASE TERMS UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. GULFSLOPE IS EXPLORING ALL OPTIONS CONTAINED IN BOEM\u2019S REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK TO EXTEND THE TERMS OF THE LEASES. ADDITIONAL PROSPECTIVE ACREAGE CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH LEASE SALES, FARM-IN, OR  PURCHASE. AS IS CONSISTENT WITH A PRUDENT AND SUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION APPROACH, WE BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL SEISMIC LICENSING,  ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, AND/OR INTERPRETATION MAY BECOME HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS, IN ORDER TO MORE PRECISELY DEFINE THE MOST  OPTIMAL DRILLABLE LOCATION(S), PARTICULARLY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DISCOVERIES.  WE CONTINUE TO  EVALUATE POTENTIAL PRODUCING PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS IN THE OFFSHORE GOM, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR HIGHLY SPECIALIZED SUBSURFACE AND  ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERTISE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. ANY MERGER OR ACQUISITION IS LIKELY TO  BE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY.  DRILLING AND  OTHER EXPLORATORY AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES  WITH OUR SUCCESS  IN THE LEASING OF OUR TARGETED PROSPECTS, OUR PLAN HAS BEEN TO PARTNER WITH OTHER ENTITIES WHICH COULD INCLUDE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES  AND/OR FINANCIAL INVESTORS. OUR GOAL IS TO DIVERSIFY RISK AND MINIMIZE CAPITAL EXPOSURE TO EXPLORATION DRILLING COSTS. WE EXPECT  A PORTION OF OUR EXPLORATION COSTS TO BE PAID BY OUR PARTNERS THROUGH THESE TRANSACTIONS, IN RETURN FOR OUR PREVIOUS INVESTMENT  IN PROSPECT GENERATION AND DELIVERY OF AN IDENTIFIED PROSPECT ON ACREAGE WE CONTROL. SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE A COMMONLY ACCEPTED  INDUSTRY METHOD OF PROPORTIONATELY RECOUPING PRE-DRILL COST OUTLAYS FOR SEISMIC, LAND, AND ASSOCIATED INTERPRETATION EXPENSES.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. IN ANY DRILLING,  WE EXPECT THAT OUR RETAINED WORKING INTEREST WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED UPON FACTORS SUCH AS GEOLOGIC RISK AND WELL COST. EARLY MONETIZATION  OF A DISCOVERED ASSET OR A PORTION OF A DISCOVERED ASSET IS AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY AS A MEANS TO FUND DEVELOPMENT OR ADDITIONAL  EXPLORATION PROJECTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO POTENTIAL EQUITY OR DEBT OFFERINGS. HOWEVER, IF A REASONABLE VALUE WERE NOT RECEIVED  FROM THE MARKET AT THE DISCOVERY STAGE, THEN WE MAY ELECT TO RETAIN (SUBJECT TO LEASE TERMS) THE DISCOVERY ASSET UNDEVELOPED, UNTIL  A REASONABLE OFFER IS RECEIVED IN LINE WITH OUR PERCEIVED MARKET VALUE, OR WE MAY ELECT TO SEEK DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS ON A PROMOTED  BASIS IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO EVALUATE AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE PRODUCING PROPERTIES  THAT HAVE A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP TO OUR CORE AREA.  15  CURRENT OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CONDUCTING PRE-DRILL  OPERATIONS FOR TWO PROSPECTS TO INCLUDE THE TAU PROSPECT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO BE REDRILLED IN 2020. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT  ITS CURRENT CLAIM UNDER THE POLICY WILL PROVIDE FOR A REPLACEMENT WELL WITH ALL COSTS COVERED TO THE DEPTH OF 15,254 FEET. THE  COMPANY WILL CONTINUE DRILLING OPERATIONS TO A TOTAL DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 21,000 FEET WITH INCREMENTAL COSTS TO BE BORNE BY THE  WORKING INTEREST PARTICIPANTS IN THE WELL. THE EXPLORATION PLAN AND THE APD FOR THIS WELL HAVE BEEN FILED WITH BOEM AND ARE PENDING  APPROVAL.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE ACTIVE IN THE  EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS THAT IT DEEMS TO BE ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. ANY SUCH MERGER OR ACQUISITION IS  LIKELY TO BE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY.  ON JANUARY 8, 2018, THE COMPANY SIGNED  COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO PARTNERING WITH DELEK AND TEXAS SOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DRILLING OF NINE CURRENTLY LEASED  PROSPECTS. THE INITIAL PHASE (PHASE I) CONSISTS OF A COMMITMENT TO DRILL THE CANOE PROSPECT (VR378) AND THE TAU PROSPECT (SS336  AND SS351). THE COMPANY COMMENCED DRILLING OPERATIONS AT THE CANOE PROSPECT IN AUGUST 2018. THE WELL COMPLETED DRILLING IN AUGUST  2018 AND BASED ON LOGGING-WHILE-DRILLING (LWD) AND ISOTUBE ANALYSIS OF HYDROCARBON SAMPLES, OIL SANDS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN THE NORTHWEST  CENTER OF THE BLOCK. THE WELL WAS DRILLED TO A TOTAL OF 5,765 FEET MEASURED DEPTH (5,700 FEET TRUE VERTICAL DEPTH) AND ENCOUNTERED  NO PROBLEMS WHILE DRILLING. A FULL INTEGRATION OF THE WELL INFORMATION AND SEISMIC DATA IS BEING PERFORMED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION  OF THE SHALLOW POTENTIAL OF THE WELLBORE AND THE BLOCK, AND TO DEFINE COMMERCIALITY OF THESE OIL PAYS. THE WELL WAS TEMPORARILY  ABANDONED, AND MULTIPLE OPEN HOLE PLUGS WERE SET ACROSS SEVERAL INTERVALS. THE WELL IS EQUIPPED WITH A MUD-LINE SUSPENSION SYSTEM  FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE RE-ENTRY. A DEEPER SUBSALT PROSPECT ON THE CANOE LEASE BLOCK, FOR WHICH THE BLOCK WAS ORIGINALLY LEASED, IS  DRILL-READY, DUE TO FURTHER SEISMIC ENHANCEMENT.  THE TAU PROSPECT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY  SIX MILES NORTHEAST OF THE MAHOGANY FIELD, DISCOVERED IN 1993. THE MAHOGANY FIELD IS RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY  BELOW ALLOCTHONOUS SALT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE TAU PROSPECT IS DEFINED BY MAPPING OF 3D SEISMIC REPROCESSED BY RTM METHODS.  DRILLING OPERATIONS ON THE TAU SUBSALT PROSPECT COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE WELLBORE IS DESIGNED TO TEST MULTIPLE MIOCENE  HORIZONS TRAPPED AGAINST A WELL-DEFINED SALT FLANK, INCLUDING EQUIVALENT RESERVOIR SANDS DISCOVERED AND DEVELOPED AT THE NEARBY  MAHOGANY FIELD. THE SURFACE LOCATION FOR TAU IS LOCATED IN 305 FEET OF WATER. IN JANUARY 2019, THE TAU WELL EXPERIENCED AN UNDERGROUND  CONTROL OF WELL EVENT AND AS A RESULT, WE FILED AN INSURANCE CLAIM WITH ITS INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS FOR A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $10.8 MILLION FOR 100% WORKING INTEREST. THE INSURANCE CLAIM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED. ON MAY 13, 2019, GULFSLOPE ANNOUNCED THE  TAU WELL WAS DRILLED TO A MEASURED DEPTH OF 15,254 FEET, AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINALLY PERMITTED 29,857 FOOT MEASURED DEPTH. PRODUCIBLE  HYDROCARBON ZONES WERE NOT ESTABLISHED TO THE CURRENT DEPTH, BUT HYDROCARBON SHOWS WERE ENCOUNTERED. COMPLEX GEOMECHANICAL CONDITIONS  REQUIRED TWO BY-PASS WELLBORES, ONE SIDETRACK WELLBORE, AND EIGHT CASING STRINGS TO REACH THE CURRENT DEPTH. EQUIPMENT LIMITATIONS  PREVENT FURTHER DRILLING AT THIS TIME. IN ADDITION, THE DRILLING RIG HAD CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. DUE  TO THESE FACTORS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO TEMPORARILY ABANDON THIS WELL IN A MANNER THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR RE-ENTRY AT A LATER  TIME. THE COMPANY IS PLANNING FOR A REDRILL OF THETAU PROSPECT IN 2020.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY USES THE FULL COST METHOD OF  ACCOUNTING FOR ITS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. UNDER THE FULL COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED  WITH SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CAPITALIZED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS INTO A SINGLE  COST CENTER (\u201cFULL COST POOL\u201d). SUCH COSTS INCLUDE PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS, GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL (\u201cG&G\u201d)  COSTS, CARRYING CHARGES ON NON-PRODUCING PROPERTIES, COSTS OF DRILLING BOTH PRODUCTIVE AND NON-PRODUCTIVE WELLS. OVERHEAD COSTS,  WHICH INCLUDES EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCURRED THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ACQUISITION,  EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CAPITALIZED. INTEREST EXPENSE IS CAPITALIZED RELATED TO UNEVALUATED PROPERTIES AND WELLS  IN PROCESS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INCURRING COSTS AND EXPENDING RESOURCES TO GET THE PROPERTIES READY FOR THEIR  INTENDED PURPOSE. FOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT BEING CURRENTLY  DEPRECIATED, DEPLETED, OR AMORTIZED AND ON WHICH EXPLORATION OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE IN PROGRESS, INTEREST COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED.  PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY SALES WILL GENERALLY BE CREDITED TO THE FULL COST POOL, WITH NO GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED, UNLESS SUCH A SALE  WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITALIZED COSTS AND THE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT  ALTERATION WOULD TYPICALLY INVOLVE A SALE OF 25% OR MORE OF THE PROVED RESERVES RELATED TO A SINGLE FULL COST POOL.  PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY  BASIS USING THE UNITS OF PRODUCTION METHOD (\u201cUOP\u201d), WHEREBY CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER TOTAL PROVED RESERVES.  THE AMORTIZATION BASE IN THE UOP CALCULATION INCLUDES THE SUM OF PROVED PROPERTY, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND  AMORTIZATION (\u201cDD&A\u201d), ESTIMATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT COSTS (FUTURE COSTS TO ACCESS AND DEVELOP PROVED RESERVES),  AND ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS, LESS RELATED SALVAGE VALUE.  16  THE COSTS OF UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND RELATED  CAPITALIZED COSTS (SUCH AS G&G COSTS) ARE WITHHELD FROM THE AMORTIZATION CALCULATION UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY ARE EITHER DEVELOPED  OR ABANDONED. UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND ARE DETERMINED  THROUGH AN EVALUATION CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, SEISMIC DATA, REQUIREMENTS TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE, DRILLING RESULTS, REMAINING  TIME IN THE COMMITMENT PERIOD, REMAINING CAPITAL PLAN, AND POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IN COUNTRIES WHERE PROVED  RESERVES EXIST, EXPLORATORY DRILLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY HOLES ARE TRANSFERRED TO PROVED PROPERTIES IMMEDIATELY UPON DETERMINATION  THAT A WELL IS DRY AND AMORTIZED ACCORDINGLY. IN COUNTRIES WHERE A RESERVE BASE HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, IMPAIRMENTS ARE CHARGED  TO EARNINGS.  COMPANIES THAT USE THE FULL COST METHOD  OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A CEILING TEST CALCULATION  EACH QUARTER. THE FULL COST CEILING TEST IS AN IMPAIRMENT TEST PRESCRIBED BY SEC REGULATION S-X RULE 4-10. THE CEILING TEST IS  PERFORMED QUARTERLY, ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS, UTILIZING THE AVERAGE OF PRICES IN EFFECT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH FOR  THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE COST CENTER CEILING IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF (A) ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES, DISCOUNTED  AT 10% PER ANNUM, FROM PROVED RESERVES, (B) THE COST OF PROPERTIES NOT BEING AMORTIZED, IF ANY, AND (C) THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET  VALUE OF UNPROVED PROPERTIES INCLUDED IN THE COST BEING AMORTIZED. IF SUCH CAPITALIZED COSTS EXCEED THE CEILING, THE COMPANY WILL  RECORD A WRITE-DOWN TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS AS A NON-CASH CHARGE TO EARNINGS. ANY SUCH WRITE-DOWN WILL REDUCE EARNINGS IN  THE PERIOD OF OCCURRENCE AND RESULTS IN A LOWER DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS. A WRITE-DOWN MAY  NOT BE REVERSED IN FUTURE PERIODS EVEN THOUGH HIGHER OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES MAY SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASE THE CEILING.  THE  COMPANY CAPITALIZES EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS INTO OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES UNTIL A DETERMINATION IS MADE THAT THE WELL HAS EITHER FOUND  PROVED RESERVES OR IS IMPAIRED. IF PROVED RESERVES ARE FOUND, THE CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS ARE RECLASSIFIED TO PROVED  PROPERTIES. THE WELL COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IF THE EXPLORATORY WELL IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS DRILLED  TWO WELL BORES AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING SUCH WELLS FOR PROVED RESERVES. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH COSTS ARE INCLUDED AS SUSPENDED  WELL COSTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT A FINAL ANALYSIS WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT NINE MONTHS AT WHICH TIME  THE COSTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FULL COST POOL.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES CONSISTED OF WELLS IN PROCESS, CAPITALIZED EXPLORATION AND ACQUISITION COSTS FOR UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND  NO PROVED RESERVES.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST.  WE ASSESS THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE  THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO OUR CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER 30, 2019.  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  THERE WAS NO REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OVERHEAD REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR WORKING INTEREST PARTNERS. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.02 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 NET OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE CAPITALIZED TO UNEVALUATED OIL  AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AS COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY  $0.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND NIL FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOAN EXTINGUISHMENT AND RESTRUCTURE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST CONVERSIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON  STOCK FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. GAIN ON DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WAS $1.2 MILLION AND A LOSS OF $0.2  MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE  UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED ACCUMULATED LOSSES  FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 2019, OF APPROXIMATELY $55.7 MILLION, AND HAS A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $19.6  MILLION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED LOSSES OF $0.2 MILLION AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM  OPERATIONS OF $1.8 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD $3.8 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND, $3.1 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS FOR JOINT  PAYABLES FROM DRILLING OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL NEED TO RAISE A MINIMUM OF $10 MILLION TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS  AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021. THE $10 MILLION IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL PROJECT EXPENDITURES AS WELL  AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH AMOUNTED  TO $13.3 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS.  OUR POLICY HAS BEEN TO PERIODICALLY RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY ON A LIMITED BASIS, TO AVOID UNDUE DILUTION WHILE AT  THE EARLY STAGES OF EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. SHORT TERM NEEDS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY FUNDED THROUGH LOANS FROM EXECUTIVE  MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WITH ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL  IN OBTAINING FINANCING, OPERATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CURTAILED OR CEASED. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  17  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $0.4  MILLION OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION  DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES OFFSET BY A $4.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019,  WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $0.6 MILLION OF CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION OF CASH USED  IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $0.1 MILLION INVESTMENT IN OIL AND  GAS PROPERTIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND APPROXIMATELY $1.4 MILLION INVESTMENT IN OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WE RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION  OF NET CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $0.03 MILLION USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO DEBT PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE PURCHASE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS  TO COVER EXPENDITURES PLANNED AFTER FEBRUARY 2020, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL, UNEXPECTED EXPENDITURES THAT WE MAY ENCOUNTER. FUTURE  EQUITY FINANCINGS MAY BE DILUTIVE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF FUTURE FINANCINGS MAY INCLUDE PREFERENCES OR RIGHTS  SUPERIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK. DEBT FINANCINGS MAY INVOLVE A PLEDGE OF ASSETS AND WILL RANK SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK. WE HAVE  HISTORICALLY FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH PRIVATE EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CREDIT OR EQUITY FACILITIES  AVAILABLE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, STOCKHOLDERS OR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON BEST EFFORTS FINANCINGS.  THE FAILURE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL COULD CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS, OR THE COMPANY WOULD NEED TO SELL ASSETS OR CONSIDER  ALTERNATIVE PLANS UP TO AND INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE LAPSE OF STATUES OF LIMITATIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES IN DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SAME ITEMS THAT IMPACTED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN FISCAL 2019.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d) WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM INCLUDING A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, THE IMPOSITION OF A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND THE CREATION OF NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN-SOURCED EARNINGS.  AS OF APRIL 26, 2019, WE HAD COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, HOWEVER, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON OUR BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND RECOGNIZE ANY ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED.  WE RECOGNIZED A $50 MILLION DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE LAPSE OF CERTAIN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING STANDARD AND, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 25, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A $34 MILLION DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $187 MILLION OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. INCLUSIVE OF PENALTIES, INTEREST AND CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS, $165 MILLION WOULD AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IF RECOGNIZED, AND $167 MILLION HAS BEEN RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES AND THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF THE EXPECTED EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT EITHER CERTAIN AUDITS WILL CONCLUDE, CERTAIN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL LAPSE, OR BOTH. AS A RESULT OF UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TAX AUDITS AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, AN ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE IMPACTS TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME.  LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CASH REQUIREMENTS  (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  JANUARY 24,  2020  APRIL 26,  2019  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  $3,008  $3,899  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT  $1,844  $1,799  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOW ACTIVITIES.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  (IN MILLIONS)  JANUARY 24,  2020  JANUARY 25,  2019  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $677  $942  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  1,227  521  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1,520  )  (2,117  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  (4  )  (17  )  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  $380  $(671  )  36  CASH FLOWS  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE $3.0 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $0.9 BILLION FROM APRIL 26, 2019. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.3 BILLION PAID FOR THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $400 MILLION USED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF OUR SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 2019, $334 MILLION USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $100 MILLION IN PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $443 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, $96 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES, AND $677 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED BY $1.0 BILLION TO $0.7 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 COMPARED TO APRIL 26, 2019 PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE DECREASES IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH CONVERSION CYCLE.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN DAYS)  JANUARY 24,  2020  APRIL 26,  2019  JANUARY 25,  2019  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  (1)  53  70  51  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING  (2)  22  21  16  DAYS PAYABLES OUTSTANDING  (3)  (75  )  (87  )  (78  )  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  (4)  1  3  (11  )  DAYS MAY NOT ADD DUE TO ROUNDING  (1)  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING, REFERRED TO AS DSO, CALCULATES THE AVERAGE COLLECTION PERIOD OF OUR RECEIVABLES. DSO IS BASED ON ENDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE FOR EACH PERIOD. DSO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY AVERAGE NET REVENUE PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER (91 DAYS FOR EACH OF THE QUARTERS PRESENTED ABOVE). DSO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019, WHILE IT DECREASED COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO LOWER SEASONAL INVOICING LEVELS AND MORE FAVORABLE SHIPPING LINEARITY.  (2)  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING, REFERRED TO AS DIO, MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM PROCUREMENT TO SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. DIO IS BASED ON ENDING INVENTORY AND COST OF REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD. DIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUES PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER. DIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF ON HAND INVENTORY AND LOWER COST OF REVENUES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD, WHILE IT WAS RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  (3)  DAYS PAYABLES OUTSTANDING, REFERRED TO AS DPO, CALCULATES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR PAYABLES REMAIN OUTSTANDING BEFORE PAYMENT. DPO IS BASED ON ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND COST OF REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUES PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER. DPO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019, WHILE IT DECREASED COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PURCHASES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.  (4)  THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE IS THE SUM OF DSO AND DIO LESS DPO. ITEMS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD TO DIFFER INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX, CHANGES IN PAYMENT TERMS (INCLUDING EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM SUPPLIERS), THE EXTENT OF SHIPMENT LINEARITY, SEASONAL TRENDS AND THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INVENTORY PURCHASES WITHIN THE PERIOD.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE GENERATED CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $677 MILLION, REFLECTING NET INCOME OF $623 MILLION, ADJUSTED BY NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $146 MILLION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $118 MILLION, AND A GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTIES OF $38 MILLION, COMPARED TO $942 MILLION OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  DECREASED $394 MILLION, REFLECTING LOWER DSO.  \u2022  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  DECREASED $158 MILLION, REFLECTING LOWER DPO.  \u2022  ACCRUED EXPENSES  DECREASED $273 MILLION,  PRIMARILY DUE TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PAYOUTS RELATED TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMMISSIONS AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS AND PAYMENTS OF INCOME TAXES.  WE EXPECT THAT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY MATERIALLY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SHIPMENT LINEARITY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS PERFORMANCE, INVENTORY AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, VENDOR PAYMENT INITIATIVES, TAX BENEFITS OR CHARGES FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS.  37  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE GENERATED $1.3 BILLION FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES, AND PAID $100 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WHILE DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WE GENERATED $661 MILLION FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES, AND PAID $138 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECEIVED $96 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF LAND IN SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA AND PAID $56 MILLION NET TO ACQUIRE A PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANY.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE USED $1.3 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF 22 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $334 MILLION FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $400 MILLION  FOR THE REPAYMENT OF OUR SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $443 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, COMPARED TO $1.6 BILLION USED FOR THE REPURCHASE OF 22 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, $306 MILLION USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $221 MILLION USED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  KEY FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS INCLUDE CHANGES IN OUR REVENUE MIX AND PROFITABILITY, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, IN PARTICULAR, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INVENTORIES, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES AND PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS, THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND THE TIMING OF REPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT. BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING POTENTIAL FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT, EQUITY OR OTHER SECURITIES, WILL SATISFY OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS, STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH DIVIDENDS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OUR LIQUIDITY IS INSUFFICIENT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CURTAIL SPENDING AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL COST SAVING MEASURES AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OR ENTER INTO NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, IF NECESSARY, ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL.  LIQUIDITY  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 CONSISTED OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH WE EXPECT TO GENERATE FROM OPERATIONS, AND OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND RELATED CREDIT FACILITY.  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING (IN MILLIONS).  JANUARY 24,  2020  APRIL 26,  2019  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $2,705  $2,325  SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  303  1,574  TOTAL  $3,008  $3,899  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 AND APRIL 26, 2019, $2.5 BILLION AND $3.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY VARIOUS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WERE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS, WHILE $0.5 BILLION AND $0.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. THE TCJA IMPOSED A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2017, AND GENERALLY ALLOWS COMPANIES TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS OF FOREIGN EARNINGS WITHOUT INCURRING ADDITIONAL FEDERAL TAXES. AS A PART OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR PROJECTED GLOBAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN HISTORICAL AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL NO LONGER BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.  OUR PRINCIPAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SUPPORT ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MEET CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS, INVEST IN CRITICAL OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT, FUND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND PAY DIVIDENDS, AS AND IF DECLARED.  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE THE PRESERVATION OF PRINCIPAL AND MAINTENANCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE DEFAULT RISK BY INVESTING IN HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES, LIMITING THE TIME TO MATURITY AND MONITORING THE COUNTER-PARTIES AND UNDERLYING OBLIGORS CLOSELY. WE BELIEVE OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE LIQUID AND ACCESSIBLE. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS OR INVESTMENTS FROM THE VALUES REPORTED AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020.  38  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK DUE TO TRENDS IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET EVENTS TO MINIMIZE THE MARKET RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  WE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.  WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, WE BELIEVE OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND COMMITTED CREDIT LINES WILL SATISFY, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, BOTH IN TOTAL AND DOMESTICALLY, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH DIVIDENDS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS.  WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  (SEC).  WE MAY IN THE FUTURE OFFER AN ADDITIONAL UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY AND OTHER SECURITIES.  SENIOR NOTES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR SENIOR NOTES AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 (IN MILLIONS).  3.375% SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 2021  $500  3.25% SENIOR NOTES DUE DECEMBER 2022  250  3.30% SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 2024  400  TOTAL  $1,150  INTEREST ON THE SENIOR NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE UNDERLYING TERMS, SEE NOTE 8 \u2013 FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND CREDIT FACILITY  WE HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (THE PROGRAM), UNDER WHICH WE MAY ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES.  AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE BORROWED, REPAID AND RE-BORROWED, WITH THE AGGREGATE FACE OR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME NOT TO EXCEED $1.0 BILLION.  THE MATURITIES OF THE NOTES CAN VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 397 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE NOTES ARE SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND MAY BE ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, MAY BE SOLD AT PAR AND BEAR INTEREST AT RATES DICTATED BY MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ISSUANCE.  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES OUTSTANDING WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $694 MILLION, A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 1.97% AND MATURITIES GENERALLY LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, WE HAVE A SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 10, 2021. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY THAT SERVES AS A BACK-UP FOR THE PROGRAM. PROCEEDS FROM THE FACILITY MAY ALSO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, PROVIDING ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CREDIT FACILITY EXCEEDS THE OUTSTANDING DEBT ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES OPTIONS THAT ALLOW US TO REQUEST AN INCREASE IN THE FACILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION AND TO EXTEND ITS MATURITY DATE FOR TWO ADDITIONAL ONE-YEAR PERIODS, BOTH SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ASSOCIATED COVENANTS IN THIS AGREEMENT. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THIS FACILITY DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING OUR COMMITMENTS RELATED TO FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, OPERATING LEASES AND INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THROUGH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT BE PRECISELY DETERMINED AND WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN THE NETWORK STORAGE INDUSTRY, HIRING PLANS AND OUR DECISIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCING OF OUR FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 TO BE BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $75 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON FEBRUARY 12, 2020, WE DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.48 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, PAYABLE ON APRIL 22, 2020 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 3, 2020.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $13.6 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  UNDER THIS PROGRAM,  WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH SOLICITED OR UNSOLICITED TRANSACTIONS IN THE OPEN MARKET, IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, THROUGH ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, PURSUANT TO A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY OUR MANAGEMENT.  THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. SINCE THE MAY 13, 2003 INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM THROUGH JANUARY 24, 2020, WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 335 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $38.76 PER SHARE, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $13.0 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, THE REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM WAS $0.6 BILLION.  39  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS AND FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, CORPORATE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  PURCHASE ORDERS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAKE COMMITMENTS TO OUR THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANAGE MANUFACTURER LEAD TIMES AND MEET PRODUCT FORECASTS, AND TO OTHER PARTIES TO PURCHASE VARIOUS KEY COMPONENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REPORTED PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARISING FROM THESE AGREEMENTS CONSISTS OF FIRM, NON-CANCELABLE, AND UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $486 MILLION IN NON-CANCELABLE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR INVENTORY. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR FIRM, NON-CANCELABLE AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF OUR FUTURE DEMAND FORECASTS CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUATION OF OUR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, OUR COMMITMENTS AND ASSOCIATED ACCRUALS MAY CHANGE.  IN ADDITION TO INVENTORY COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS, WE HAVE OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS AND CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED GOODS OR SERVICES. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $7 MILLION IN CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND $234 MILLION IN OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.  UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, OUR LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS $167 MILLION, INCLUDING INTEREST, PENALTIES AND CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS. DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TAX AUDITS AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.  FINANCING GUARANTEES  WHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM PAYMENT TERMS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE PROVIDE LONG-TERM FINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u2019 DATES OF EXECUTION, AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES AS \u201cTRUE SALES\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ON TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NET OF ANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, UPON PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE. WE SOLD $49 MILLION AND $54 MILLION OF RECEIVABLES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES GENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE END-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY TO THE END-USER CUSTOMER, IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.  SOME OF THE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN FINANCED ON A RECOURSE BASIS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS. UNDER THE TERMS OF RECOURSE LEASES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS, WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR THE AGGREGATE UNPAID REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS TO THE THIRD-PARTY LEASING COMPANIES IN THE EVENT OF END-USER CUSTOMER DEFAULT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COLLATERALIZED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE WE PROVIDE A GUARANTEE FOR RECOURSE LEASES AND COLLECTABILITY IS PROBABLE, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AS SALES TYPE LEASES. IF COLLECTABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE, THE CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS A DEPOSIT LIABILITY AND REVENUE IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEEMED COLLECTIBLE. FOR LEASES THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO, OTHER THAN PROVIDING RECOURSE, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 AND APRIL 26, 2019, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH SUCH CONTINGENCIES EXCEEDED THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES UNDER OUR LEASE FINANCING PROGRAMS OR OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR END-USER CUSTOMERS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. IF A SERVICE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED AS A RESULT OF OUR NON-PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE COULD, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, BE REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS RELATED TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT OR TO PAY THE AGGREGATE UNPAID PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND WE BELIEVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING TO ACQUIRE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS OR MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS REMOTE. THE PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT THAT REPRESENTS UNEARNED SERVICES REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND FINANCED UNEARNED SERVICES REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  WE ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US TO REIMBURSE LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE THIRD-PARTIES DUE TO VARIOUS EVENTS, SUCH AS LAWSUITS ARISING FROM PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. THESE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS ARE CONSIDERED OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.  40  LEGAL CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS WHICH ARISE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF OUR COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THE REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF SELECTED EVENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS.  OVERVIEW  SINO-GLOBAL HAS FOCUSED  ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CUSTOMIZED SHIPPING AGENCY SERVICES BUT HAS SINCE BEGUN LOOKING AGGRESSIVELY AT DIVERSIFYING ITS REVENUE  AND SERVICE MIX BY SEEKING NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS DUE TO INCREASED MARGIN COMPRESSION. THESE OPPORTUNITIES  HAVE RANGED FROM COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES TO OTHER SERVICE AND PRODUCT INITIATIVES.  WITH THE HOPE OF BRINGING  US BACK TO THE SHIPPING MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, ON APRIL 10, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR. WEIJUN  QIN, CEO OF A SHIPPING MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN CHINA, TO SET UP A JOINT VENTURE IN NEW YORK NAMED STATE PRIESTS MANAGEMENT LTD. (\u201cSTATE  PRIESTS\u201d), OF WHICH WE HOLD 90% EQUITY INTEREST. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY CASH CONTRIBUTION TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND THERE  HAS BEEN NO OPERATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE PENDING THE INTERNATIONAL SHIP SAFETY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATE FROM THE CHINA CLASSIFICATION  SOCIETY (THE \u201cCERTIFICATE\u201d). WE STARTED PROVIDING SHIPPING MANAGEMENT RELATED SERVICES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE CERTIFICATE  WHICH INCLUDES ARRANGING AND COORDINATION FOR SHIP MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION THIS QUARTER.  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2019,  WE SIGNED A REVISED COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR. QIN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR EQUITY INTEREST IN STATE PRIESTS. DUE TO STATE PRIESTS\u2019  FAILURE TO TIMELY OBTAIN THE NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM RELATED AUTHORITIES, MR. QIN AGREED TO EXCHANGE 80% EQUITY INTEREST IN SEA  CONTINENT MANAGEMENT LTD. (\u201cSEA CONTINENT\u201d), ANOTHER ENTITY HE OWNS, FOR OUR 90% EQUITY INTEREST IN STATE PRIESTS.  SEA CONTINENT ALREADY HAS THE CERTIFICATE FOR ITS OPERATIONS ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO OPERATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019.  TO ADAPT TO THE  CHANGING CHINA MARKET, WHICH HAS A HIGH DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURAL BY-PRODUCTS, ONE OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS STRATEGIES IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE U.S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS  AND THE SHIPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS TO CHINA USING ITS OVERALL SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS. ON JANUARY 10, 2020, THE COMPANY  ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR.

THE DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT WAS DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE SHIPPING AGENCY SERVICES  PROVIDED, WHERE WE FOCUSED MORE ON SHIPPING MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. OUR INTEGRATED SHIPPING  MANAGEMENT SERVICES INCLUDED ARRANGING AND COORDINATING SHIP MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION, REPAIRS, AND OTHER SERVICES.

DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, REVENUES  DECREASED BY $7,475,423 OR APPROXIMATELY 83.3%. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN CERTAIN FREIGHT LOGISTICS CONTRACTS  THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH CUSTOMERS STARTING FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ACTED AS AN AGENT IN ARRANGING THE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER AND DID NOT CONTROL THE SERVICES RENDERED TO THE CUSTOMER  AS WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO FULFILL THE SERVICES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, GROSS REVENUE  AND GROSS COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION AND $12.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EVEN WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER, EVERY TRANSACTION HAS A UNIQUE  GROSS MARGIN DUE TO DIFFERENT SERVICE SCOPES.

THIS INFORMATION MAY INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS,  PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY  ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY THE FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR ANY  REASON, EVEN IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE OR OTHER EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  OUR NET LOSS AND LIMITED WORKING CAPITAL  RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $620,731 DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RAISE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, AND  OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS SINCE OUR CURRENT CASH ASSETS ARE EXHAUSTED AND WE HAVE GENERATED NO REVENUES TO DATE TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON RELATED PARTIES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. WE WILL NEED TO SEEK OTHER FINANCING TO COMPLETE OUR BUSINESS  PLANS. THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF FUTURE FINANCING ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT,  IF ACHIEVED, WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXECUTE OUR INTENDED BUSINESS PLAN OR GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT DEFICIT, WE  EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES DURING THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. CONSEQUENTLY,  WE WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO CONTINUE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND/OR PUBLIC OFFERINGS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR WORKING  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS GENERATED FROM ANY PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND/OR PUBLIC OFFERINGS ARE INSUFFICIENT,  WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS BANK LOANS AND/OR FINANCINGS. NO ASSURANCE CAN  BE GIVEN THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE, OR IF AVAILABLE, WILL BE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  WE ARE INCURRING INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT  OF BEING A PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY. AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE DID  NOT INCUR AS A PRIVATE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AS WELL AS NEW RULES SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, HAVE REQUIRED CHANGES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THESE NEW RULES  AND REGULATIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND HAVE MADE SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY.  FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE HAVE CREATED ADDITIONAL BOARD COMMITTEES AND HAVE ADOPTED POLICIES REGARDING  INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INCURRED ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLIC  COMPANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS HAVE MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR  US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE, WHICH WE CURRENTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW RULES, IT  MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  WE CANNOT PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL COSTS WE MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY OR THE TIMING OF  SUCH COSTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OPERATING REVENUES  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUES OF $17,317 AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS SOLD TO A MANUFACTURER OF DEEP-ULTRAVIOLET  LIGHT SOURCES WHICH INCLUDED TOTAL COST OF SALES OF $6,611 RESULTING IN A GROSS PROFIT OF $10,706. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY  SALES REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  14  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $420,850 COMPARED TO OPERATING EXPENSES OF $124,959 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE  IN OPERATING EXPENSES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE OPERATING ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER, AS MOST OF FISCAL 2019 WAS SPENT ON  DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPOSED BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEREAS FISCAL 2020 FOCUSED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUSINESS  OPERATIONS. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $295,891.  NET INCOME (LOSS)  NET LOSS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 WAS $620,731 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $333,016 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED  INTEREST EXPENSE OF $210,587 FOR INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE  COMPANY INCURRED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $333,016 RELATING TO INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD  A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $14,264,153 AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $105,583,960. THE COMPANY HAS FEW REVENUES AND SIGNIFICANT  LOSSES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. CASH PRESENTLY  ON HAND IS IMMATERIAL. WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING $1,000,000 OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO FUND OPERATIONS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR  VIA KITS, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LIKIDO HEATING & COOLING UNITS, AND THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR EXTRACTION MACHINE. MANAGEMENT IS  PLANNING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS BY RAISING CAPITAL, AND BY ACCELERATING SALES & MARKETING EFFORTS TO TAKE PRE-ORDERS OF OUR  EXTRACTION MACHINES (RESULTING IN DOWN-PAYMENTS), THE SALES OF HIGH-MARGIN HEATING & COOLING UNITS, PRECISION PARTS, AND HEALTHCARE  VIA KITS. THE CONTINUATION OF THE COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON THE CONTINUED FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM ITS MANAGEMENT,  ITS ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY DEBT OR EQUITY FINANCING, AND GENERATE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PLANNED  FUTURE OPERATIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON EQUITY SALES OF OUR COMMON SHARES IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  ISSUANCES OF ADDITIONAL SHARES WILL RESULT IN DILUTION TO EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ACHIEVE ANY  ADDITIONAL SALES OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES OR ARRANGE FOR DEBT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND PLANNED ACQUISITIONS AND ACTIVITIES AND  THERE ARE NO PLANS TO INDUCE CONVERSION OF EXISTING DEBT. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT OUR PLANS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. THESE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATION  OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD THE COMPANY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR AUDIT FIRM INCLUDED AN  EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH IN THEIR REPORT REGARDING SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  WORKING CAPITAL  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD  CURRENT ASSETS OF $43,594 AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $14,307,747 COMPARED WITH CURRENT ASSETS OF $47,690 AND CURRENT LIABILITIES  OF $13,688,834 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN THE WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE TAX LIABILITY  DUE TO INTEREST, AND THE INCREASE IN RELATED PARTY NOTES PAYABLE.  CASH FLOWS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  $THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  2018  $CASH FLOWS FROM (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  (273,812  )  (85,817  )  CASH FLOWS FROM (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (2,278  )  \u2013  CASH FLOWS FROM (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  287,821  84,317  NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH DURING PERIOD  11,731  (1,500  )  15  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE COMPANY USED $273,812 OF CASH FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO $85,817 USED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN THE USE OF CASH FOR OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE TO AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS  RECEIVED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES THAT GAVE THE COMPANY MORE FLEXIBILITY TO INCUR MORE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING COSTS.  CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 THE COMPANY PURCHASED EQUIPMENT FOR $2,278, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE  ANY INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019, THE COMPANY $287,821 OF CASH WAS PROVIDED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES AS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF RELATED PARTY NOTES PAYABLE  COMPARED TO $84,317 RECEIVED FROM NOTES PAYABLE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION,  REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING  NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO  MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING  PERIODS.  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE (1) OF  THE NOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN GENERAL, MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ON INFORMATION FROM  THIRD PARTY PROFESSIONALS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES  AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT  AREAS REQUIRING THE USE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES RELATE TO THE VALUATION OF ITS MINERAL LEASES AND CLAIMS AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN  FINAL GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY RECORDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,  COMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION  , USING THE FAIR VALUE METHOD. ALL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH  GOODS OR SERVICES ARE THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE  OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENT ISSUED, WHICHEVER IS MORE RELIABLY MEASURABLE. EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND THE COST OF THE SERVICES RECEIVED AS CONSIDERATION ARE MEASURED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ISSUED.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE  TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES BY REMOVING OR MODIFYING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND  ADDING OTHER REQUIREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. CERTAIN AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, WHILE ALL OTHER AMENDMENTS  SHOULD BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE  THAT PERMITS THE COMPANY TO RECLASSIFY DISPROPORTIONATE TAX EFFECTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CAUSED BY THE TAX  CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL  YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE  A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JULY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-11  WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL REDUCE INCOME  STATEMENT VOLATILITY FOR COMPANIES THAT ISSUE WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING SUCH FEATURES.  17  THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL  IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW CREDIT  LOSS STANDARD THAT REPLACES THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT GAAP. THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL REQUIRES IMMEDIATE  RECOGNITION OF ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES EXPECTED TO OCCUR FOR MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER INSTRUMENTS. IT IS EFFECTIVE  FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. EARLY ADOPTION  FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE STANDARD\u2019S PROVISIONS AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT  ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST EFFECTIVE REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING  THE IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED NEW LEASE  ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASU NO. 2016-02, \u201c  LEASES  \u201d. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WAS INITIATED AS A JOINT PROJECT WITH THE  INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD TO SIMPLIFY LEASE ACCOUNTING AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF AND COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL  INFORMATION FOR USERS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR \u201cOPERATING LEASES\u201d  FOR LESSEES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF LEASE CONTRACTS. UNDER ASU NO. 2016-02, AT INCEPTION, A LESSEE MUST CLASSIFY ALL LEASES WITH  A TERM OF OVER ONE YEAR AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING, WITH BOTH CLASSIFICATIONS RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A DEFINED \u201cRIGHT-OF-USE\u201d  ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET. HOWEVER, RECOGNITION IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WILL DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE LEASE  CLASSIFICATION, WITH FINANCE LEASES RECOGNIZING THE AMORTIZATION OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET SEPARATE FROM THE INTEREST ON THE LEASE  LIABILITY AND OPERATING LEASES RECOGNIZING A SINGLE TOTAL LEASE EXPENSE. LESSOR ACCOUNTING UNDER ASU NO. 2016-02 WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY  UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS LEASE REQUIREMENTS UNDER GAAP. ASU NO. 2016-02 WILL TAKE EFFECT FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES IN FISCAL YEARS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AND FOR LEASES  EXISTING AT, OR ENTERED INTO AFTER, THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, LESSEES  AND LESSORS MUST APPLY A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION APPROACH. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 AND EXPECTS  IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DUE TO LEASE AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN FOOTNOTE  7.

NIGHTCLUB SAME-STORE SALES DECREASED  BY 1.8%, WHILE BOMBSHELLS SAME-STORE SALES INCREASED BY 19.2%.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL REVENUES WAS AS FOLLOWS (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $37,859  $37,728  BOMBSHELLS  10,350  6,013  OTHER  185  282  $48,394  $44,023  NIGHTCLUBS  SAME-STORE SALES DECREASED BY 1.8% DURING THE QUARTER (CONTRIBUTING A 1.6% DECREASE IN TOTAL NIGHTCLUBS REVENUES) DUE TO THE FACT  THAT THERE WERE THREE FULL WEEKS BETWEEN THANKSGIVING AND CHRISTMAS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER VERSUS FOUR IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR  PERIOD. THESE WEEKS ARE TYPICALLY A LARGE SEASONAL PERIOD FOR NIGHTCLUBS. NEW CLUBS CONTRIBUTED A 3.4% INCREASE, WHILE CLOSED  CLUBS CONTRIBUTED A 1.6% DECREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS REVENUES.  BOMBSHELLS  SAME-STORE SALES INCREASED BY 19.2% DURING THE QUARTER (CONTRIBUTING A 14.8% INCREASE IN TOTAL BOMBSHELLS REVENUES) BENEFITTING  FROM THE PRO BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES. FOUR NEW BOMBSHELLS UNITS, WHICH ARE NOT YET INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES BASE,  CONTRIBUTED A 57.3% INCREASE IN SEGMENT REVENUES.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  TOTAL  OPERATING EXPENSES, AS A PERCENT OF REVENUES, INCREASED TO 80.0% FROM 74.7% FROM YEAR-AGO, WITH A $5.8 MILLION INCREASE, OR 17.7%.  SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.  COST  OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED BY $964,000, OR 16.6%, MAINLY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM NEWLY ACQUIRED CLUBS AND NEWLY CONSTRUCTED  BOMBSHELLS. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED TO 14.0% FROM 13.2% MAINLY DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALES  MIX OF HIGHER-MARGIN SERVICE REVENUE AND AN INCREASE IN SALES MIX OF LOWER-MARGIN FOOD REVENUE.  SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $1.1 MILLION, OR 9.3%, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 27.3% FROM 27.5% MAINLY DUE TO RELATIVELY FIXED CORPORATE SALARIES.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $2.5 MILLION, OR 17.9%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES, TAXES AND PERMITS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, UTILITIES, AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED  DUE TO THE RE-AUDIT CONDUCTED BY OUR EXTERNAL AUDITORS, WHILE TAXES AND PERMITS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, UTILITIES, AND REPAIRS  AND MAINTENANCE INCREASED DUE TO INCREASE IN UNITS. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED TO 34.2% FROM 31.9% MAINLY DUE TO ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.  OUR  ADOPTION OF ASC 842 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019. SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $151,000, OR 7.4% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW UNITS.  24  OTHER  GAINS, NET OF $26,000 IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO A NET GAIN OF $1.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER WAS MAINLY DUE TO  THE SALE OF TWO REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR-YEAR FIRST QUARTER.  INCOME  FROM OPERATIONS  FOR  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, OUR OPERATING MARGIN WAS 20.0% AND 25.3%, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAIN DRIVERS FOR THE  DECREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN ARE DISCUSSED ABOVE, BUT MORE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM NET OTHER GAINS AND ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES.  SEGMENT  CONTRIBUTION TO INCOME FROM OPERATIONS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $13,776  $15,387  BOMBSHELLS  1,573  119  OTHER  (207  )  (119  )  GENERAL CORPORATE  (5,456  )  (4,255  )  $9,686  $11,132  OPERATING  MARGIN FOR THE NIGHTCLUBS SEGMENT WAS 36.4% AND 40.8% FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE OPERATING  MARGIN FOR BOMBSHELLS WAS 15.2% AND 2.0%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE CHANGE  IN NET OTHER GAINS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELIEF FROM PRE-OPENING  EXPENSES IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER FROM BOMBSHELLS UNITS THAT WERE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. EXCLUDING NET OTHER GAINS, NIGHTCLUBS WOULD  HAVE HAD NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN OF 36.6% AND 37.8% FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS  MAINLY FROM HIGHER TAXES AND PERMITS AND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. BOMBSHELLS DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL NON-GAAP  ADJUSTMENTS DURING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE DECREASED BY $36,000, OR 1.4%.  OUR  TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF LEASE EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WERE 7.3% AND 8.0% OF REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE DUE TO LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE  DOLLARS IN RELATION TO REVENUES.  INCOME  TAXES  INCOME  TAX EXPENSE WAS $1.6 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $1.8 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 22.0% FOR BOTH QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  BOTH YEARS IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT.  25  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN  ADDITION TO OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SEC REGULATION G, TO CLARIFY AND ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PAST PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.  GENERALLY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION  OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED  AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE MONITOR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF  THE COMPANY AND HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS GAUGE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW, EXCLUDING (OR INCLUDING) SOME ITEMS THAT  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED  FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. RELATIVE TO EACH OF THE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE FURTHER SET FORTH OUR RATIONALE AS FOLLOWS.  NON-GAAP  OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN.  WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN BY EXCLUDING  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) GAINS OR LOSSES ON  SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (C) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, AND (D) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THESE  ITEMS ASSISTS INVESTORS IN EVALUATING PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN WITHOUT THE IMPACT  OF ITEMS THAT ARE NOT A RESULT OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.  NON-GAAP  NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  . WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED  SHARE BY EXCLUDING OR INCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER  SHARE. ADJUSTMENT ITEMS ARE: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (C) GAINS  OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, (D) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, (E) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS, AND (F) THE INCOME TAX  EFFECT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ADJUSTMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE ADJUSTMENTS IS THE NET EFFECT OF THE  NON-GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, CALCULATED AT 21.8% AND 22.2% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF THE PRE-TAX NON-GAAP INCOME BEFORE TAXES  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE GAAP INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT). WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING  AND INCLUDING SUCH ITEMS HELP MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  . WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.  (A) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, (B) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), (C) NET INTEREST EXPENSE, (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF  BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, (F) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, AND (G) SETTLEMENT  OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING FOR SUCH ITEMS HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT THAT COMPARES RESULTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO ADJUST FOR FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE VARIATION BETWEEN DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS. THE RESULTS ARE, THEREFORE, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION  OF FINANCING ALTERNATIVES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE GUIDELINE TO ASSESS OUR UNLEVERAGED PERFORMANCE RETURN  ON OUR INVESTMENTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO THE TARGET BENCHMARK FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS OF NIGHTCLUBS.  WE  ALSO USE CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. SEE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d SECTION  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  26  THE  FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT  PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND PERCENTAGES).

THE  ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ADJUSTMENTS  RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, WHICH IS IMMATERIAL.  27  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $14.1 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF CASH WE HANDLE, WE HAVE VERY STRINGENT CASH CONTROLS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE  WORKING CAPITAL OF $7.3 MILLION COMPARED TO A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $2.3 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, EXCLUDING  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $4.8 MILLION AND $2.9 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL STRENGTHS. OUR NET CASH PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $10.3 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $11.5 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FLOWS FROM  OPERATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WE  HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS.  WE  HAVE NOT RECENTLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. INSTEAD, WE USE DEBT FINANCING TO LOWER OUR OVERALL  COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR RETURN ON STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF BORROWING FUNDS IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS  AND FROM SELLERS IN ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE RECENTLY SECURED TRADITIONAL BANK FINANCING ON OUR NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  AND REFINANCING OF OUR EXISTING NOTES PAYABLE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES FROM  THOSE SOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY UTILIZED THESE CASH FLOWS TO INVEST IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ADULT NIGHTCLUBS AND RESTAURANTS/SPORTS  BARS.

VARIANCES IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF NEW, REMODELED, OR RECONCEPTED LOCATIONS UNDER  CONSTRUCTION.  PRIOR  YEAR ACQUISITIONS OF $13.5 MILLION RELATE TO $7.5 MILLION CASH PAID ON THE PITTSBURGH CLUB ACQUISITION AND THE $6.0 MILLION CASH  PAID ON THE CHICAGO CLUB ACQUISITION.

WE PAID QUARTERLY  DIVIDENDS OF $0.03 PER SHARE DURING EACH OF THE CURRENT- AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  29  MANAGEMENT  ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES LESS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE USE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE BASELINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10,273  $11,452  LESS: MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  1,021  376  FREE CASH FLOW  $9,252  $11,076  OUR  FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE CURRENT-YEAR QUARTER DECREASED BY 16.5% COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REMODELING OF AN OLDER BOMBSHELLS UNIT AND ON UPGRADES IN OUR MIAMI CLUBS IN PREPARATION  FOR THE PRO FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.  OTHER  THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE FINANCING DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENT OR TREND THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECT LIQUIDITY. IN THE EVENT SUCH A TREND DEVELOPS, WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS WILL  BE ADEQUATELY MET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. IN OUR OPINION, WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT A TRUE INDICATOR OF OUR FINANCIAL STATUS.  TYPICALLY, BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY CARRY CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS BECAUSE BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY IMMEDIATE PAYMENT FOR SALES, WITH NOMINAL RECEIVABLES, WHILE INVENTORIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES NORMALLY  CARRY LONGER PAYMENT TERMS. VENDORS AND PURVEYORS OFTEN REMAIN FLEXIBLE WITH PAYMENT TERMS, PROVIDING BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS DOWN TURNS. WE CONSIDER THE PRIMARY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL STATUS TO BE THE  LONG-TERM TREND OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE MIX OF SALES REVENUES, OVERALL CASH FLOW, PROFITABILITY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE LEVEL OF  LONG-TERM DEBT.  30  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF SUCH INDICATORS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31.  INCREASE  INCREASE  2019  (DECREASE)  2018  (DECREASE)  2017  SALES OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES  $20,743  13.3%  $18,310  2.8%  $17,805  SALES OF FOOD AND MERCHANDISE  7,447  30.9%  5,690  7.2%  5,307  SERVICE REVENUES  17,193  -0.8%  17,331  9.1%  15,889  OTHER  3,011  11.8%  2,692  21.8%  2,211  TOTAL REVENUES  48,394  9.9%  44,023  6.8%  41,212  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10,273  -10.3%  $11,452  40.6%  $8,145  ADJUSTED EBITDA*  $11,864  -1.4%  $12,028  8.4%  $11,094  FREE CASH FLOW*  $9,252  -16.5%  $11,076  47.0%  $7,537  LONG-TERM DEBT (END OF PERIOD)  $141,826  -7.4%  $153,095  21.5%  $125,992  *  SEE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ABOVE IN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUBSECTION OF RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE  REPURCHASE  WE  PURCHASED 332,671 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.36 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHILE WE  PURCHASED 14,111 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.21 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2020,  THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $10.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  AS OF FEBRUARY 25, 2020, WE HAVE $13.8 MILLION REMAINING TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OTHER  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED FINANCING OTHER THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE, IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY STANDARD OF TREATING ENTERTAINERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDES US WITH SAFE  HARBOR PROTECTION TO PRECLUDE PAYROLL TAX ASSESSMENT FOR PRIOR YEARS. WE HAVE PREPARED PLANS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROTECT OUR  PROFITABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ALL STATES TO CONVERT DANCERS WHO ARE NOW  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INTO EMPLOYEES.  THE  SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE, SERVICE AND LOCATION, AS WELL AS THE PROFESSIONALISM  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH LEVEL OF NAME RECOGNITION AND PRESTIGE WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE.  IMPACT  OF INFLATION  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL OVERALL IMPACT FROM INFLATION IN OUR OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED  BY COMPETITION, WE HAVE MANAGED TO RECOVER INCREASED COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. HOWEVER, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  31  SEASONALITY  OUR  NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCED REVENUES FROM APRIL THROUGH SEPTEMBER  (OUR FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS) WITH THE STRONGEST OPERATING RESULTS OCCURRING DURING OCTOBER THROUGH MARCH (OUR FISCAL  FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS). OUR REVENUES IN CERTAIN MARKETS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SPORTING EVENTS THAT CAUSE UNUSUAL CHANGES IN  SALES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY  OUR  CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PROVIDES US WITH DISCIPLINED GUIDELINES ON HOW WE SHOULD USE OUR FREE CASH FLOWS; PROVIDED HOWEVER,  THAT WE MAY DEVIATE FROM THIS STRATEGY IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING  ACTIVITIES MINUS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. USING THE AFTER-TAX YIELD OF BUYING OUR OWN STOCK AS BASELINE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES  THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENT DECISIONS.  BASED  ON OUR CURRENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER BUYING  BACK OUR OWN STOCK IF THE AFTER-TAX YIELD ON FREE CASH FLOW IS ABOVE 10%;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER DISPOSING  OF UNDERPERFORMING UNITS TO FREE UP CAPITAL FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE USE;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER ACQUIRING  OR DEVELOPING OUR OWN CLUBS OR RESTAURANTS THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM CASH ON CASH RETURN OF  25%-33%, ABSENT AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER PAYING  DOWN OUR MOST EXPENSIVE DEBT IF IT MAKES SENSE ON A TAX ADJUSTED BASIS, OR THERE IS AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE.  GROWTH  STRATEGY  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC  SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING: (I) TO ACQUIRE EXISTING UNITS IN LOCATIONS THAT  ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH AND INCOME TARGETS AND WHICH APPEAR RECEPTIVE TO THE UPSCALE CLUB FORMULA WE HAVE DEVELOPED; (II)  TO OPEN NEW UNITS AFTER MARKET ANALYSIS; (III) TO FRANCHISE OUR BOMBSHELLS BRAND; (IV) TO FORM JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS  TO REDUCE START-UP AND OPERATING COSTS, WITH US CONTRIBUTING EQUITY IN THE FORM OF OUR BRAND NAME AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE; (V)  TO DEVELOP NEW CLUB CONCEPTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING SKILLS; (VI) TO DEVELOP AND OPEN OUR RESTAURANT  CONCEPTS AS OUR CAPITAL AND MANPOWER ALLOW; AND (VII) TO CONTROL THE REAL ESTATE IN CONNECTION WITH CLUB OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH  SOME UNITS MAY BE IN LEASED PREMISES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT BOMBSHELLS CAN GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH  POTENTIAL. ALL NINE OF THE EXISTING BOMBSHELLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 ARE LOCATED IN TEXAS. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO DIVERSIFY  OUR OPERATIONS WITH THESE UNITS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE SOB LICENSES, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WHILE WE ARE SEARCHING  FOR ADULT NIGHTCLUBS TO ACQUIRE, WE ARE ABLE TO ALSO SEARCH FOR RESTAURANT/SPORTS BAR LOCATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INCOME  TARGETS.  WE  OPENED ONE BOMBSHELLS UNIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. IN JANUARY 2020, SUBSEQUENT TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2019, WE OPENED ANOTHER BOMBSHELLS UNIT.  ON  NOVEMBER 5, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE SIGNED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE THE ASSETS AND RELATED  REAL ESTATE OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED, TOP GENTLEMEN\u2019S CLUB LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR FOR $15.0 MILLION. UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENTS, COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES WILL PAY $7.2 MILLION FOR THE CLUB AND $7.8 MILLION FOR THE REAL ESTATE USING $4.0 MILLION  IN SELLER FINANCING AT 6.0% FOR THE CLUB WITH THE BALANCE OF CASH FROM AN ANTICIPATED $11.0 MILLION BANK LOAN AT A BLENDED RATE  OF 6.25%. AS OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT, CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION IS STILL PENDING SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  WE  CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE NEW NIGHTCLUBS AND ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING NEW LOCATIONS THAT FIT OUR BUSINESS MODEL  AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL CLUBS MAY REQUIRE US TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL DEBT OR ISSUE OUR COMMON  STOCK, OR BOTH. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE,  IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. AN INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROWTH  STRATEGY.  32", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.", "CIK": 935419, "Date": "2020-02-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "RICK", "Name": "Ricks Cabaret International Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 5810.0, "Business": "TX", "Incorporated": "TX", "IRS": 760037324.0, "key": "20200227RICK", "labelr1": -4.366397721879458, "labelr2": 8.982630272952868, "labelr3": -3.460837887067402, "labelr4": -0.14150943396225274, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5833611, "prof1": 0.41663885, "return1&2": 0.9499155008532352, "return1&2&3": 0.98279053640189, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9841812777269868, "return2": 0.9101736972704714, "return1": 1.0436639772187946, "return3": 1.0346083788706741, "return4": 1.0014150943396225, "1_day_return": -4.366397721879456, "cumulative_return1": 0.024825633601645285, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3746, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9825003894622997, "cumreturn1b": 1.0592385551864811, "cumreturn1c": 0.845560826557652, "cumreturndow": 0.9092929471716293, "cumreturnsp500": 0.8947017210889143}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3748, "level_0": 3854, "index": 47240, "text": "ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  WE OPERATE IN FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES; PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES; FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES; AND LAND MANAGEMENT.  IN THE RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PRODUCER OF RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STEEL, FIBRE AND PLASTIC DRUMS, RIGID INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, TRANSIT PROTECTION PRODUCTS, WATER BOTTLES AND REMANUFACTURED AND RECONDITIONED INDUSTRIAL CONTAINERS, AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CONTAINER LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT, FILLING, LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSING AND OTHER PACKAGING SERVICES. WE SELL OUR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS CHEMICALS, PAINTS AND PIGMENTS, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, PETROLEUM, INDUSTRIAL COATINGS, AGRICULTURAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND MINERALS, AMONG OTHERS.  IN THE PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE PRODUCE AND SELL CONTAINERBOARD, CORRUGATED SHEETS, CORRUGATED CONTAINERS, AND OTHER CORRUGATED PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PACKAGING, AUTOMOTIVE, FOOD AND BUILDING PRODUCTS. OUR CORRUGATED CONTAINER PRODUCTS ARE USED TO SHIP SUCH DIVERSE PRODUCTS AS HOME APPLIANCES, SMALL MACHINERY, GROCERY PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS, BOOKS AND FURNITURE, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER APPLICATIONS. WE ALSO PRODUCE AND SELL COATED AND UNCOATED RECYCLED PAPERBOARD, SOME OF WHICH WE USE TO PRODUCE AND SELL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS (TUBES AND CORES, CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS, PROTECTIVE PACKAGING, AND ADHESIVES) AND CONSUMER PACKAGING PRODUCTS (FOLDING CARTONS, SET-UP BOXES, AND PACKAGING SERVICES). IN ADDITION, WE ALSO PURCHASE AND SELL RECYCLED FIBER.  IN THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PRODUCER OF FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS AND RELATED SERVICES. OUR FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS CONSIST OF A POLYPROPYLENE-BASED WOVEN FABRIC THAT IS PRODUCED AT OUR PRODUCTION SITES, AS WELL AS SOURCED FROM STRATEGIC REGIONAL SUPPLIERS. OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GLOBALLY AND SERVICE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SEGMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES, AMONG OTHERS.  IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE ACTIVE HARVESTING AND REGENERATION OF OUR UNITED STATES TIMBER PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM YIELDS. WHILE TIMBER SALES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT CUTTING SCHEDULE, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MARKET AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. WE ALSO SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, TIMBERLAND AND SPECIAL USE LAND, WHICH CONSISTS OF SURPLUS LAND, HIGHER AND BETTER USE (\"HBU\") LAND AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE OWNED APPROXIMATELY  246,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2019  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2019  FORM 10-K  , UPDATED BY PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EBITDA PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT ARE RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT. IN THAT CASE, EBITDA IS DEFINED AS OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THAT BUSINESS SEGMENT, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EBITDA PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET, FOR THAT BUSINESS SEGMENT. WE USE EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA AS FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR CURRENT AND HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE. THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FIRST  QUARTER RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE NET SALES, OPERATING PROFIT, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  .

(COLLECTIVELY \"THOLU\") ON JUNE 11, 2019 (THE \"THOLU ACQUISITION\").  THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION AND THE THOLU ACQUISITION. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  246,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS;  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER;  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE; AND  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE SALE OF TIMBERLAND PROPERTY IN \"TIMBERLAND GAINS,\" THE SALE OF HBU AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IN \"GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET\" AND THE SALE OF TIMBER AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \"NET SALES\" AND \"COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD\" IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. ALL HBU AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, TOGETHER WITH SURPLUS PROPERTY, IS USED TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL THE PROPERTY IS SOLD.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO LAKES OR RIVERS, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  18,800  ACRES OF SPECIAL USE PROPERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.  NET SALES  INCREASED  TO  $7.0 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  $6.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT  DECREASED  TO  $1.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  $2.6 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  .

IS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS  $11.4 MILLION  ON  $47.3 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $20.0 MILLION  ON  $55.7 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. THE DECREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED MIX OF EARNINGS AMONG TAX JURISDICTIONS, GREATER TAX CREDIT UTILIZATION AND FAVORABLE ONE-TIME DISCRETE ITEMS OF  $1.4 MILLION  THAT WERE RECOGNIZED IN THIS QUARTER.

COMPARABLE STORE SALES REFLECT THE POINT AT WHICH MERCHANDISE AND SERVICE ORDERS ARE FULFILLED AND DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS, EXCLUDING SHIPPING AND DELIVERY, AND ARE NET OF DISCOUNTS AND RETURNS. WHEN A  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  STORE IS RELOCATED, WE CONTINUE TO CONSIDER NET SALES FROM THAT STORE TO BE COMPARABLE STORE SALES. A STORE TEMPORARILY CLOSED FOR MORE THAN SEVEN DAYS IS NOT CONSIDERED COMPARABLE IN THE FISCAL MONTH IT IS CLOSED. THE STORE THEN BECOMES COMPARABLE ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FOLLOWING FISCAL MONTH IN WHICH IT REOPENS. NET SALES FROM OUR WEBSITE AND CALL CENTER (WHICH INCLUDES BUSINESS SALES) ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN CALCULATIONS OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  (2)  WE HAVE PRESENTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS. THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND LEONARD GREEN AND PARTNERS, L.P. (\u201cLGP\u201d) TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. WE PRESENT THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ASSIST INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY. IN EVALUATING THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION. OUR PRESENTATION OF THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING ON OUR GAAP RESULTS IN ADDITION TO USING NON-GAAP MEASURES SUPPLEMENTALLY. OUR NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED CAPTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATION. PLEASE REFER TO FOOTNOTES (3) AND (4) OF THIS TABLE FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING WHY WE BELIEVE EACH NON-GAAP MEASURE PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS REGARDING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL PURPOSES FOR WHICH MANAGEMENT USES EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  ADDITIONALLY, THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ALSO REFERS TO ELFA THIRD-PARTY NET SALES AFTER THE CONVERSION OF ELFA\u2019S NET SALES FROM SWEDISH KRONA TO U.S. DOLLARS USING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S CONVERSION RATE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DISCLOSURE OF ELFA THIRD-PARTY NET SALES WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS HELPS INVESTORS UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY\u2019S UNDERLYING PERFORMANCE.  (3)  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP. WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AND IS ONE OF THE COMPONENTS FOR PERFORMANCE EVALUATION UNDER OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS. ADJUSTED EBITDA REFLECTS FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO EBITDA TO ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN ITEMS, INCLUDING CERTAIN NON-CASH AND OTHER ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER IN OUR EVALUATION OF ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q BECAUSE THEY ARE KEY METRICS USED BY MANAGEMENT, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND LGP TO ASSESS OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA IN CONNECTION WITH COVENANT COMPLIANCE AND EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS, AND WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES. WE BELIEVE IT IS USEFUL FOR INVESTORS TO SEE THE MEASURES THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO EVALUATE THE COMPANY, ITS EXECUTIVES AND OUR COVENANT COMPLIANCE, AS APPLICABLE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE ALSO FREQUENTLY USED BY ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT GAAP MEASURES OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR LIQUIDITY AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY, OR ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE MEASURE DERIVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN INFERENCE THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY UNUSUAL OR NON-RECURRING ITEMS. ADDITIONALLY,  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE MEASURES OF FREE CASH FLOW FOR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCRETIONARY USE, AS THEY DO NOT REFLECT CERTAIN CASH REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TAX PAYMENTS, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STORE OPENINGS AND CERTAIN OTHER CASH COSTS THAT MAY RECUR IN THE FUTURE. EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA CONTAIN CERTAIN OTHER LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING THE FAILURE TO REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES, CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND CASH COSTS TO REPLACE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED. IN EVALUATING ADJUSTED EBITDA, YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IN THE FUTURE WE WILL INCUR EXPENSES THAT ARE THE SAME AS OR SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THIS PRESENTATION, SUCH AS PRE-OPENING COSTS AND STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE. OUR PRESENTATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO IMPLY THAT OUR FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE UNAFFECTED BY ANY SUCH ADJUSTMENTS. MANAGEMENT COMPENSATES FOR THESE LIMITATIONS BY RELYING ON OUR GAAP RESULTS IN ADDITION TO USING EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA SUPPLEMENTALLY. OUR MEASURES OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO OTHER SIMILARLY TITLED CAPTIONS OF OTHER COMPANIES DUE TO DIFFERENT METHODS OF CALCULATION.  A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS SET FORTH BELOW.

WE ADJUST FOR THESE COSTS TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OUR PERFORMANCE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  (B)  REFLECTS THE EXTENT TO WHICH OUR ANNUAL GAAP OPERATING LEASE EXPENSE HAS BEEN ABOVE OR BELOW OUR CASH OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS. THE AMOUNT VARIES DEPENDING ON THE AVERAGE AGE OF OUR LEASE PORTFOLIO (WEIGHTED FOR SIZE), AS OUR GAAP OPERATING LEASE EXPENSE ON YOUNGER LEASES TYPICALLY EXCEEDS OUR CASH OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS, WHILE OUR GAAP OPERATING LEASE EXPENSE ON OLDER LEASES IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN OUR CASH OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS. IN THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019, LEASE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPENING OF THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER WERE EXCLUDED FROM NON-CASH LEASE EXPENSE AND INCLUDED IN PRE-OPENING COSTS.  (C)  NON-CASH CHARGES RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH VARY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON VOLUME AND VESTING TIMING OF AWARDS. WE ADJUST FOR THESE CHARGES TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

(4)  ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED HAVE BEEN PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AS SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED BY, OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, GAAP. WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME  BEFORE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT, CERTAIN GAINS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS, CERTAIN MANAGEMENT TRANSITION COSTS INCURRED AND BENEFITS REALIZED, CHARGES INCURRED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR OPTIMIZATION PLAN, CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH AN ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY CLOSURE, CHARGES RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF ELFA FRANCE OPERATIONS, AND THE TAX IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND OTHER UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENT TAX ITEMS. WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED AS ADJUSTED NET INCOME DIVIDED BY THE DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING. WE USE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AND ADJUSTED NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE \u2013 DILUTED TO SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES, TO MAKE BUDGETING DECISIONS AND TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE AGAINST THAT OF OTHER PEER COMPANIES USING SIMILAR MEASURES.

THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $5,030 OF NET COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OPENING OF THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER. THE COMPANY OPENED TWO NEW STORES, INCLUDING ONE RELOCATION, IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 AS COMPARED TO OPENING FOUR NEW STORES, INCLUDING TWO RELOCATIONS, IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.

THIS DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES ON THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY.  TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 WAS $1,428 AS COMPARED TO A BENEFIT OF $5,989 IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 WAS 42.2%, AS COMPARED TO 3135.6% IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE SWEDISH TAX RATE AND THE BENEFIT OF THE FINALIZATION OF THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON FOREIGN EARNINGS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE RELIED ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, A $100,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d AS FURTHER DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d BELOW), AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, DIRECT MATERIALS, PAYROLL, STORE LEASES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND UPDATING EXISTING STORES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING BUILDING OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER, AND ELFA MANUFACTURING FACILITY ENHANCEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OPERATING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OTHER CURRENT AND NONCURRENT LIABILITIES, TAXES RECEIVABLE AND TAXES PAYABLE. OUR LIQUIDITY FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF OUR BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND AS A RESULT, OUR BORROWINGS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER DURING  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THESE PERIODS WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. OUR BORROWINGS GENERALLY INCREASE IN OUR SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS AS WE PREPARE FOR OUR ANNUAL SHELVING SALE, THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AND OUR ANNUAL ELFA\u00ae SALE. WE BELIEVE THAT CASH EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PAYMENTS DUE UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEEK TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, WHICH COULD BE IN THE FORM OF LOANS, BONDS, CONVERTIBLE DEBT OR EQUITY, TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.  AT DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE HAD $13,971 OF CASH, OF WHICH $5,935 WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. IN ADDITION, WE HAD $38,352 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY $11,774 OF ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED BELOW) AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019.  THERE WERE $4,276 IN LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER CONTRACTS AT THAT DATE.  CASH FLOW ANALYSIS  A SUMMARY OF OUR KEY COMPONENTS AND MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(1,136)  $17,823  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (29,284)  (20,413)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  36,751  15,737  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH  276  (577)  NET INCREASE IN CASH  $6,607  $12,570  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP) (1)  $(30,432)  $(3,505)  (1)  SEE BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND RECONCILIATION TO ITS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE.  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND DEFERRED TAXES AS WELL AS THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1,136 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NON-CASH ITEMS OF $27,260 AND NET INCOME OF $1,959 WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $30,355. THE NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORY, COMBINED WITH AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES. THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORY IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY BUILD-UP RELATED TO THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SEASONALITY OF SALES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TIMING OF INVENTORY RECEIPTS AND PAYMENTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $17,823 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. NON-CASH ITEMS OF $29,029 AND NET INCOME OF $5,798 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $17,004. THE NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORE OPENINGS, EXISTING STORE REMODELS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS.  OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 WERE $29,296. WE INCURRED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $13,434 RELATED TO THE OPENING OF THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN ABERDEEN, MARYLAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL IN LATE FISCAL 2019. WE INCURRED $9,249 OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORE OPENINGS, RELOCATIONS AND EXISTING STORE REMODELS. WE OPENED TWO NEW STORES, INCLUDING ONE RELOCATION, DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019. THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $6,613 WERE PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCT ROLLOUTS.  OUR TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018 WERE $21,328 WITH NEW STORE OPENINGS, RELOCATIONS AND EXISTING STORE REMODELS ACCOUNTING FOR LESS THAN HALF OF SPENDING AT $8,703. WE OPENED FOUR STORES, INCLUDING TWO RELOCATIONS, DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. WE INCURRED $5,674 OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS RELATED TO THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER. THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $6,951 WERE PRIMARILY FOR INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND NEW PRODUCT ROLLOUTS. WE RECORDED PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $915, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS RELATED TO A SALE OF A BUILDING IN LAHTI, FINLAND IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $36,751 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019. THIS INCLUDED NET PROCEEDS OF $46,000 FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET REPAYMENTS OF $5,365 FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PAYMENTS OF $3,512 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, AND $372 FOR TAXES PAID WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $15,737 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018. THIS INCLUDED NET PROCEEDS OF $42,000 FROM BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PAYMENTS OF $23,751 FOR REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM INDEBTEDNESS, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $2,384, AND $128 FOR TAXES PAID WITH THE WITHHOLDING OF SHARES UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, TCS HAD A TOTAL OF $38,352 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND $58,000 OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, ELFA HAD A TOTAL OF $11,774 OF UNUSED BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP)  WE PRESENT FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH WE DEFINE AS NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN A PERIOD MINUS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MADE IN THAT PERIOD, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT IS A USEFUL INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL LIQUIDITY, AS THE AMOUNT OF FREE CASH FLOW GENERATED IN ANY PERIOD IS REPRESENTATIVE OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT REPAYMENT, INVESTMENT, AND OTHER DISCRETIONARY AND NON-DISCRETIONARY CASH USES. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT FREE CASH FLOW PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS IN UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR LIQUIDITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS MANAGEMENT. OUR DEFINITION OF FREE CASH FLOW IS LIMITED IN THAT IT DOES NOT SOLELY REPRESENT RESIDUAL CASH FLOWS AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE MEASURE DOES NOT DEDUCT THE PAYMENTS REQUIRED FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. THEREFORE, WE BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO VIEW FREE CASH FLOW AS A MEASURE THAT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION TO OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. ALTHOUGH OTHER COMPANIES REPORT THEIR FREE CASH FLOW, NUMEROUS METHODS MAY EXIST FOR CALCULATING A COMPANY\u2019S FREE CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT, THE METHOD USED BY OUR  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT TO CALCULATE OUR FREE CASH FLOW MAY DIFFER FROM THE METHODS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO CALCULATE THEIR FREE CASH FLOW.  OUR FREE CASH FLOW FLUCTUATES AS A RESULT OF SEASONALITY OF NET SALES, BUILDING INVENTORY FOR KEY SELLING PERIODS, AND TIMING OF INVESTMENTS IN NEW STORE OPENINGS, EXISTING STORE REMODELS, INFRASTRUCTURE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HISTORICALLY, OUR FREE CASH FLOW HAS BEEN LOWER IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO LOWER NET SALES, OPERATING INCOME, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND AS SUCH, IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FULL YEAR. OUR FREE CASH FLOW OF -$30,432 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019 HAS DECREASED AS COMPARED TO -$3,505 FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018, DUE TO SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019. WE DO EXPECT OUR FREE CASH FLOW TO INCREASE IN FISCAL 2020 AS OUR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS FOR THE OPENING OF THE SECOND DISTRIBUTION CENTER ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED ONCE IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A RECONCILIATION OF FREE CASH FLOW, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE TO BE THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO FREE CASH FLOW.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(1,136)  $17,823  LESS: ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  (29,296)  (21,328)  FREE CASH FLOW  $(30,432)  $(3,505)  SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.

ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2018 (THE \u201cEFFECTIVE DATE\u201d), THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AMENDED THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, (I) EXTEND THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO SEPTEMBER 14, 2023, (II) DECREASE THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO 5.00% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 4.00% FOR BASE RATE LOANS AND, BEGINNING FROM THE DATE THAT A COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS DELIVERED TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, ALLOW THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE MARGIN TO STEP DOWN TO 4.75% FOR LIBOR LOANS AND 3.75% FOR BASE RATE LOANS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.75:1.00, AND (III) IMPOSE A 1.00% PREMIUM IF A VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENT IS MADE FROM THE PROCEEDS OF A REPRICING TRANSACTION WITHIN 12 MONTHS AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, WE REPAID $20,000 OF THE OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, WHICH REDUCED THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY TO $272,500.  WE DREW DOWN A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $10,000 ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS $253,985  AND THE INTEREST RATE ON SUCH BORROWINGS IS LIBOR +5.00%, SUBJECT TO A LIBOR FLOOR OF 1.00%. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY PROVIDES THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF $1,703 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2023, WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE DUE ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2023.  THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTORS AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS) (OTHER THAN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS) AND (B) A SECOND PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE ASSETS SECURING THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DESCRIBED BELOW ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS. OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS AND ALSO REQUIRE CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS OF THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, AMONG THESE AN EXCESS CASH FLOW (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) REQUIREMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  ON APRIL 6, 2012, THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC., THE CONTAINER STORE, INC. AND CERTAIN OF OUR DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH THE LENDERS PARTY THERETO, JPMORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND COLLATERAL AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS SYNDICATION AGENT (AS AMENDED, THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d). THE MATURITY DATE OF THE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS AUGUST 18, 2022.  THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE FACILITY IS $100,000.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUE INTEREST AT LIBOR+1.25%. IN ADDITION, THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES AN UNCOMMITTED INCREMENTAL REVOLVING FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF $50,000, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF LENDER COMMITMENTS AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES THAT PROCEEDS ARE TO BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, AND ALLOWS FOR SWING LINE ADVANCES OF UP TO $15,000 AND THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OF UP TO $40,000.  THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT AT ANY GIVEN TIME UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS LIMITED BY REFERENCE TO A BORROWING BASE FORMULA BASED UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE VALUE OF ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND RESERVES ESTABLISHED BY THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT. AS A RESULT OF THE BORROWING BASE FORMULA, THE ACTUAL BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BE LESS THAN THE STATED AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS REDUCED BY THE ACTUAL BORROWINGS AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY).  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY (A) A FIRST-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY, CONSISTING OF INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND (B) A SECOND-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN THE COLLATERAL THAT SECURES THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY ON A FIRST-PRIORITY BASIS, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE (EXCLUDING STOCK IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN EXCESS OF 65%, AND ASSETS OF NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER EXCEPTIONS). OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ARE GUARANTEED BY THE CONTAINER STORE GROUP, INC. AND EACH OF THE CONTAINER STORE, INC.\u2019S U.S. SUBSIDIARIES.  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT OUR ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT; INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES; SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS; MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES; LIQUIDATE OR DISSOLVE OURSELVES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS; MAKE LOANS, ADVANCES OR GUARANTEES; ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES; AND MAKE INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A CONSOLIDATED FIXED-CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.0 TO 1.0 IF EXCESS AVAILABILITY IS LESS THAN $10,000 AT ANY TIME. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY) HAD OCCURRED.  2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES  ON MARCH 18, 2019, ELFA REFINANCED  ITS  MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK AB  ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 1, 2014 AND THE SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES THEREUNDER, AND ENTERED INTO A NEW MASTER CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH NORDEA BANK ABP, FILIAL I SVERIGE (\u201cNORDEA BANK\u201d), WHICH CONSISTS OF (I) AN SEK 110.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $11,774 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d), (II) UPON ELFA\u2019S REQUEST, AN ADDITIONAL SEK 115.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $12,309 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201c2019 ADDITIONAL REVOLVING FACILITY\u201d AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ORIGINAL REVOLVING FACILITY, THE \u201c2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES\u201d), AND  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (III) AN UNCOMMITTED TERM LOAN FACILITY IN THE AMOUNT OF SEK 25.0 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $2,676 AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019), WHICH IS SUBJECT TO RECEIPT OF NORDEA BANK\u2019S COMMITMENT AND SATISFACTION OF SPECIFIED CONDITIONS (THE \u201cINCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY\u201d, TOGETHER WITH THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES, THE \u201c2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES\u201d). THE TERM FOR THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES BEGAN ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND MATURES ON APRIL 1, 2024. LOANS BORROWED UNDER THE 2019 ELFA REVOLVING FACILITIES BEAR INTEREST AT NORDEA BANK\u2019S BASE RATE +1.40%. ANY LOAN BORROWED UNDER THE INCREMENTAL TERM FACILITY WOULD BEAR INTEREST AT STIBOR +1.70%.  THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES ARE SECURED BY THE MAJORITY OF ASSETS OF ELFA. THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAINS A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, RESTRICT ELFA\u2019S ABILITY, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIED EXCEPTIONS, TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LIENS, SELL OR DISPOSE OF ASSETS, MERGE WITH OTHER COMPANIES, ENGAGE IN BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT IN A RELATED LINE OF BUSINESS AND MAKE GUARANTEES. IN ADDITION, ELFA IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN (I) A GROUP EQUITY RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF NOT LESS THAN 32.5% AND (II) A CONSOLIDATED RATIO OF NET DEBT TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) OF LESS THAN 3.20.  AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, ELFA WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES AND NO EVENT OF DEFAULT (AS DEFINED IN THE 2019 ELFA SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES) HAD OCCURRED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS THAT AFFECT AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES, AS WELL AS THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO OUR ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  , FILED WITH THE SEC ON  MAY 30, 2019.  CERTAIN OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, AS THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE DEPICTION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. SUCH POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019  , FILED WITH THE SEC ON  MAY 30, 2019. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02,  LEASES  , WHICH IS UPDATED BELOW.  LEASES  WE RECOGNIZE A LEASE LIABILITY UPON LEASE COMMENCEMENT, MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FIXED FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE HAVE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS. THEREFORE, LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY INCLUDE ALL FIXED PAYMENTS IN THE LEASE ARRANGEMENT. WE RECORD A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE LIABILITY, INCREASED FOR ANY PREPAID LEASE COSTS AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS AND REDUCED BY ANY LEASE INCENTIVES. WE REMEASURE THE LEASE LIABILITY AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET WHEN A CHANGE TO OUR FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OCCURS. LEASE EXPENSE ON OPERATING LEASES IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE AND IS RECORDED IN SG&A.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, AND THE EXERCISE OF RENEWAL OPTIONS. OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE; THEREFORE, WE UTILIZE AN INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE TO CALCULATE THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR FUTURE LEASE OBLIGATIONS. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE REPRESENTS THE RATE OF INTEREST WE WOULD HAVE TO PAY ON A COLLATERALIZED BORROWING, FOR AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS, OVER A SIMILAR TERM AND IN A SIMILAR ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. ADDITIONALLY, MANY OF OUR LEASES CONTAIN RENEWAL OPTIONS. THE OPTION PERIODS ARE GENERALLY NOT INCLUDED IN THE LEASE TERM USED TO MEASURE OUR LEASE LIABILITIES AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS UPON COMMENCEMENT AS EXERCISE OF THE OPTIONS IS NOT REASONABLY CERTAIN. WE REMEASURE THE LEASE LIABILITY AND RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET WHEN WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE A RENEWAL OPTION.  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT LEASES SEE NOTE 1 AND NOTE 3 IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2019, FILED WITH THE SEC ON MAY 30, 2019, OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

THE  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED EARNINGS AT OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT DUE TO HIGHER BASE RATES RESULTING FROM THE BASE RATE CASE IN NOVEMBER 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED EARNINGS AT CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES RESULTING FROM THE TIMING OF SREC TRANSFERS AND THE ABSENCE OF WIND ASSET REVENUE, WHICH WAS SOLD IN FEBRUARY 2019.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  OUR MANAGEMENT USES NFE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  ENERGY SERVICES  ECONOMICALLY HEDGES ITS NATURAL GAS INVENTORY WITH FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. NFE IS A MEASURE OF THE EARNINGS BASED ON ELIMINATING TIMING DIFFERENCES SURROUNDING THE RECOGNITION OF CERTAIN GAINS OR LOSSES, TO EFFECTIVELY MATCH THE EARNINGS EFFECTS OF THE ECONOMIC HEDGES WITH THE PHYSICAL SALE OF GAS AND, THEREFORE, ELIMINATES THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY TO GAAP EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THERE IS A RELATED TAX EFFECT ON CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE CORRESPONDING WITH THIS NON-GAAP MEASURE. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR TAX EFFECT ARE THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND RESULTING REVALUATION OF THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES THAT AROSE FROM DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITY AS MEASURED UNDER NFE. THE REVALUATION CAUSED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE ON RECONCILING ITEMS TO DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY RATE IN EFFECT. TO THE EXTENT WE UTILIZE FORWARDS, FUTURES, OR OTHER DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE FORECASTED SREC PRODUCTION, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE ALSO ELIMINATED FOR NFE PURPOSES.  GAAP REQUIRES US, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS, TO ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND USE THIS RATE TO CALCULATE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION. WE ALSO DETERMINE AN ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR NFE PURPOSES AND CALCULATE A QUARTERLY TAX  40  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR FORECASTED NET INCOME AND OUR FORECASTED NFE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. SINCE THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON CERTAIN FORECASTED ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES SURROUNDING COMPLETION OF CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES PROJECTS, THE RATE AND RESULTING NFE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. NO ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, SINCE THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS CALCULATED AT YEAR END.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR A REPLACEMENT OF, THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THOSE GAAP RESULTS.

THE  DECREASE  IN NFE DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASED EARNINGS AT CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES RESULTING FROM THE TIMING OF SREC TRANSFERS, ABSENCE OF WIND ASSET REVENUE, WHICH WAS SOLD IN FEBRUARY 2019 AND DECREASED INCOME TAX BENEFIT,  LOW  ER FINANCIAL MARGIN GENERATED AT ENERGY SERVICES RESULTING FROM NARROWER PRICING SPREADS AND DECREASED VOLUMES IN THE WHOLESALE GAS MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED BASE RATES AT OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT.  NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT  OVERVIEW  OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF NJNG, A NATURAL GAS UTILITY THAT PROVIDES REGULATED RETAIL NATURAL GAS SERVICE IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN NEW JERSEY TO APPROXIMATELY  552,100  RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS IN ITS SERVICE TERRITORY AND ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE OFF-SYSTEM SALES AND CAPACITY RELEASE MARKETS. THE BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS, WHICH CAN  41  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NEGATIVELY IMPACT CUSTOMER GROWTH, OPERATING AND FINANCING COSTS, FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES AND CUSTOMER CONSERVATION EFFORTS. THESE RISKS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CUSTOMER USAGE, CERTAIN REGULATORY ACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS. IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF EVENTS OR TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE RISKS.  IN ADDITION,  NJNG  \u2019  S  BUSINESS IS SEASONAL BY NATURE, AS WEATHER CONDITIONS DIRECTLY INFLUENCE THE VOLUME OF NATURAL GAS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. SPECIFICALLY, CUSTOMER DEMAND SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES DURING THE WINTER MONTHS WHEN NATURAL GAS IS USED FOR HEATING PURPOSES. AS A RESULT, NJNG RECEIVES MOST OF ITS NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION REVENUES DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND FISCAL QUARTERS AND IS SUBJECT TO VARIATIONS IN EARNINGS AND WORKING CAPITAL DURING THE YEAR.  AS A REGULATED COMPANY, NJNG IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE THE IMPACT OF REGULATORY DECISIONS ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE  NOTE 4.

THE INCREASE INCLUDES AN OVERALL RATE OF RETURN ON RATE BASE OF  6.95 PERCENT  , RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY OF  9.6 PERCENT  , A COMMON EQUITY RATIO OF  54 PERCENT  AND A DEPRECIATION RATE OF  2.78 PERCENT.  INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS  NJNG HAS SIGNIFICANT ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF ITS NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM, INCLUDING NEW UTILITY PLANT ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER GROWTH AND ITS ASSOCIATED PIPELINE INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAMS.  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF NJNG\u2019S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING ACCRUALS, FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , AND ESTIMATES OF EXPECTED INVESTMENTS FOR  FISCAL 2020  AND  2021  .

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM  ON  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , NJNG FILED A PETITION WITH THE BPU SEEKING AUTHORITY TO IMPLEMENT A FIVE-YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THE IIP CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS: TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION INVESTMENTS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY REPLACEMENT AND ENHANCEMENTS. THE TOTAL EXPECTED INVESTMENT FOR THE IIP IS APPROXIMATELY  $507 MILLION  . ALL APPROVED INVESTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED THROUGH ANNUAL FILINGS TO ADJUST BASE RATES.  SAFE II AND NJ RISE  NJNG CONTINUES TO IMPLEMENT BPU-APPROVED INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY OF NJNG'S GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  THE BPU APPROVED THE 5-YEAR SAFE II PROGRAM AND THE ASSOCIATED RATE MECHANISM, TO REPLACE THE REMAINING UNPROTECTED STEEL MAINS AND SERVICES FROM NJNG\u2019S NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT AN ESTIMATED COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $200 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AFUDC. WITH THE EXTENSION OF SAFE II,  $157.5 MILLION  WAS APPROVED FOR ACCELERATED COST RECOVERY METHODOLOGY. THE REMAINING  $42.5 MILLION  IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES MUST BE REQUESTED FOR RECOVERY IN FUTURE BASE RATE CASES, OF WHICH  $23.4 MILLION  WAS APPROVED IN NJNG\u2019S MOST RECENT BASE RATE CASE.  THE BPU APPROVED NJNG'S NJ RISE CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM, WHICH CONSISTS OF SIX CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROJECTS ESTIMATED TO COST  $102.5 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AFUDC, FOR GAS DISTRIBUTION STORM HARDENING AND MITIGATION PROJECTS, ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE. THESE SYSTEM ENHANCEMENTS ARE INTENDED TO MINIMIZE SERVICE IMPACTS DURING EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS TO CUSTOMERS IN THE MOST STORM-PRONE AREAS OF NJNG\u2019S SERVICE TERRITORY. RECOVERY OF NJ RISE INVESTMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NJNG\u2019S BASE RATES.

SOUTHERN RELIABILITY LINK  THE SRL IS AN APPROXIMATELY 30-MILE, 30-INCH TRANSMISSION MAIN DESIGNED TO SUPPORT IMPROVED SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND INTEGRITY IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF NJNG\u2019S SERVICE TERRITORY. ALL APPROVALS REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND CONSTRUCTION BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2018. THE COST TO CONSTRUCT SRL IS ESTIMATED TO BE BETWEEN  $250 MILLION  AND  $270 MILLION  UPON COMPLETION. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SRL WILL BE REQUESTED FOR RECOVERY IN A FUTURE BASE RATE CASE.  CUSTOMER GROWTH  IN CONDUCTING NJNG'S BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT FOCUSES ON FACTORS IT BELIEVES MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON ITS FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. NJNG'S POLICY IS TO WORK WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS, REGULATORS AND POLICYMAKERS, TO ACHIEVE FAVORABLE RESULTS. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE THE RATE OF NJNG'S CUSTOMER GROWTH IN ITS SERVICE TERRITORY, WHICH CAN BE INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL AND REGULATORY POLICIES, THE DELIVERED COST OF NATURAL GAS COMPARED WITH COMPETING FUELS, INTEREST RATES AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS. NJNG'S TOTAL CUSTOMERS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  DECEMBER 31,  2019  DECEMBER 31,  2018  FIRM CUSTOMERS  RESIDENTIAL  489,491  478,983  COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL & OTHER  30,422  29,640  RESIDENTIAL TRANSPORT  22,917  25,559  COMMERCIAL TRANSPORT  9,242  9,540  TOTAL FIRM CUSTOMERS  552,072  543,722  OTHER  49  39  TOTAL CUSTOMERS  552,121  543,761  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, NJNG ADDED  2,282  AND  2,934  NEW CUSTOMERS AND CONVERTED  3  AND  53  EXISTING CUSTOMERS TO NATURAL GAS HEAT AND OTHER SERVICES. NJNG EXPECTS THESE NEW CUSTOMER ADDITIONS, AND THOSE CUSTOMERS WHO ADDED ADDITIONAL NATURAL GAS SERVICES TO THEIR PREMISES TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY  $1.4 MILLION  ANNUALLY TO UTILITY GROSS MARGIN.  43  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NJNG EXPECTS TO ADD APPROXIMATELY  28,000  TO  30,000  NEW CUSTOMERS DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD OF FISCAL  2020  TO  2022  . BASED ON INFORMATION FROM MUNICIPALITIES AND DEVELOPERS, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL INDUSTRY ANALYSTS AND MANAGEMENT'S EXPERIENCE, NJNG ESTIMATES THAT APPROXIMATELY  65 PERCENT  OF THE GROWTH WILL COME FROM NEW CONSTRUCTION MARKETS AND  35 PERCENT  FROM CUSTOMER CONVERSIONS TO NATURAL GAS FROM OTHER FUEL SOURCES. THIS NEW CUSTOMER AND CONVERSION GROWTH WOULD INCREASE UTILITY GROSS MARGIN UNDER NJNG'S BASE RATES BY APPROXIMATELY  $5.5 MILLION  ANNUALLY, AS CALCULATED UNDER NJNG'S CIP TARIFF. SEE THE  NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS  SECTION OF  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THAT FOLLOWS FOR A DEFINITION AND FURTHER DISCUSSION OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN.  ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS  SAVEGREEN CONDUCTS HOME ENERGY AUDITS AND PROVIDES VARIOUS GRANTS, INCENTIVES AND FINANCING ALTERNATIVES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE THE INSTALLATION OF HIGH-EFFICIENCY HEATING AND COOLING EQUIPMENT AND OTHER ENERGY-EFFICIENCY UPGRADES. DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFIC INCENTIVE OR APPROVAL, NJNG RECOVERS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROGRAMS OVER A TWO TO 10-YEAR PERIOD THROUGH A TARIFF RIDER MECHANISM.  IN  DECEMBER 2018  , THE BPU APPROVED A DECREASE IN NJNG'S EE RECOVERY RATE REFLECTING ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED THROUGH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , WHICH RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY  $8.8 MILLION  , EFFECTIVE  JANUARY 1, 2019  . ON  OCTOBER 25, 2019  , THE BPU APPROVED NJNG\u2019S ANNUAL FILING TO INCREASE ITS EE RECOVERY RATE, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY  $11.3 MILLION  , EFFECTIVE  NOVEMBER 1, 2019.  SINCE INCEPTION,  $169.4 MILLION  IN GRANTS, REBATES AND LOANS HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS. THE RECOVERY INCLUDES A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL THAT RANGES FROM  6.69 PERCENT  TO  7.76 PERCENT  , WITH A RETURN ON EQUITY OF  9.75 PERCENT  TO  10.3 PERCENT.  CONSERVATION INCENTIVE PROGRAM/BGSS  THE CIP FACILITATES NORMALIZING NJNG\u2019S UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FOR VARIANCES NOT ONLY DUE TO WEATHER BUT ALSO FOR OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING CUSTOMER USAGE, SUCH AS CONSERVATION AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY. RECOVERY OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FOR THE NON-WEATHER VARIANCE THROUGH THE CIP IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF CERTAIN GAS SUPPLY COST SAVINGS ACHIEVED AND IS SUBJECT TO A VARIABLE MARGIN REVENUE TEST. ADDITIONALLY, RECOVERY OF THE CIP UTILITY GROSS MARGIN IS SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL EARNINGS TEST. AN ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE CIP MUST BE FILED BY JUNE 1, COINCIDENT WITH NJNG\u2019S ANNUAL BGSS FILING, DURING WHICH NJNG CAN REQUEST RATE CHANGES TO THE CIP. IN MAY 2014, THE BPU APPROVED THE CONTINUATION OF THE CIP PROGRAM WITH NO EXPIRATION DATE.  NJNG'S TOTAL UTILITY FIRM GROSS MARGIN INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE CIP MECHANISM.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  (THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  WEATHER  (1)  $(2,219  )  $(1,468  )  USAGE  1,043  (1,940  )  TOTAL  $(1,176  )  $(3,408  )  (1)  COMPARED WITH THE 20-YEAR AVERAGE, WEATHER WAS  2.5 PERCENT  AND  4.7 PERCENT  COLDER  -THAN-NORMAL DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  RECOVERY OF NATURAL GAS COSTS  NJNG\u2019S COST OF NATURAL GAS IS PASSED THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WITHOUT MARKUP, BY APPLYING NJNG\u2019S AUTHORIZED BGSS RATE TO ACTUAL THERMS DELIVERED. THERE IS NO UTILITY GROSS MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH BGSS COSTS; THEREFORE, CHANGES IN SUCH COSTS DO NOT IMPACT NJNG\u2019S EARNINGS. NJNG MONITORS ITS ACTUAL GAS COSTS IN COMPARISON TO ITS BGSS RATES TO MANAGE ITS CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS ALLOWED RECOVERY OF NATURAL GAS COSTS, WHICH IS FACILITATED THROUGH BPU-APPROVED DEFERRED ACCOUNTING AND THE BGSS PRICING MECHANISM. ACCORDINGLY, NJNG OCCASIONALLY ADJUSTS ITS PERIODIC BGSS RATES OR CAN ISSUE CREDITS OR REFUNDS, AS APPROPRIATE, FOR ITS RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS WHEN THE COMMODITY COST VARIES FROM THE EXISTING BGSS RATE. BGSS RATES FOR ITS LARGE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS ARE ADJUSTED MONTHLY BASED ON NYMEX PRICES.  IN  APRIL 2019  , THE BPU APPROVED NJNG\u2019S ANNUAL PETITION TO MAINTAIN ITS BGSS RATE FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND INCREASE ITS BALANCING CHARGE RATE, RESULTING IN A  $10.3 MILLION  INCREASE TO THE ANNUAL REVENUES CREDITED TO BGSS, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO THE CIP RATE, WHICH RESULTED IN A  $30.9 MILLION  ANNUAL RECOVERY DECREASE, EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . THE BALANCING CHARGE RATE INCLUDES THE COST OF BALANCING NATURAL GAS DELIVERIES WITH CUSTOMER USAGE FOR SALES AND TRANSPORTATION CUSTOMERS AND BALANCING CHARGE REVENUES ARE CREDITED TO BGSS.  44  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  IN  SEPTEMBER 2019  , THE BPU APPROVED, ON A PROVISIONAL BASIS, A DECREASE TO NJNG\u2019S BGSS RATE FOR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND AN INCREASE TO ITS BALANCING CHARGE RATE, RESULTING IN A  $2 MILLION  DECREASE TO THE ANNUAL REVENUES CREDITED TO BGSS, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO THE CIP RATES, RESULTING IN A  $10.6 MILLION  ANNUAL RECOVERY INCREASE, EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2019.  BGSS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS  NJNG IS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR REDUCING BGSS COSTS THROUGH A SERIES OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN-SHARING PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE OFF-SYSTEM SALES, CAPACITY RELEASE AND STORAGE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE BETTER UTILIZATION AND HEDGING OF NJNG\u2019S NATURAL GAS SUPPLY, TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE ASSETS. DEPENDING ON THE PROGRAM, NJNG SHARES 80 OR 85 PERCENT OF UTILITY GROSS MARGIN GENERATED BY THESE PROGRAMS WITH FIRM CUSTOMERS. UTILITY GROSS MARGIN FROM INCENTIVE PROGRAMS WAS  $2.7 MILLION  AND  $2 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  HEDGING  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE RELATIVE PRICE STABILITY TO ITS NATURAL GAS SUPPLY PORTFOLIO, NJNG EMPLOYS A HEDGING STRATEGY WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING AT LEAST 75 PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S PROJECTED WINTER PERIODIC BGSS GAS SALES VOLUMES HEDGED BY EACH NOVEMBER 1 AND AT LEAST 25 PERCENT OF THE PROJECTED PERIODIC BGSS GAS SALES HEDGED FOR THE FOLLOWING APRIL THROUGH MARCH PERIOD. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED WITH THE USE OF VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING FUTURES, SWAPS AND OPTIONS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH COMMODITY AND/OR WEATHER-RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITY.  COMMODITY PRICES  OUR NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT IS AFFECTED BY THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, WHICH CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CASH FLOWS, SHORT-TERM FINANCING COSTS, THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS CHARGED TO OUR CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE BGSS CLAUSE, OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHICH IMPACTS OUR BAD DEBT EXPENSE, AND OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER ENERGY SOURCES.  NATURAL GAS COMMODITY PRICES ARE SHOWN IN THE GRAPH BELOW, WHICH ILLUSTRATES THE DAILY NATURAL GAS PRICES  (1)  IN THE NORTHEAST MARKET REGION, ALSO KNOWN AS TETCO M-3.

IN  SEPTEMBER 2018  , THE BPU APPROVED NJNG\u2019S ANNUAL USF COMPLIANCE FILING TO INCREASE THE STATEWIDE USF RATE, WHICH WILL RESULT IN A  $1 MILLION  ANNUAL INCREASE, EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2018  . ON  JUNE 24, 2019  , NJNG FILED ITS ANNUAL USF COMPLIANCE FILING PROPOSING AN INCREASE TO THE STATEWIDE USF RATE, WHICH RESULTED IN THE ANNUAL RECOVERY INCREASING BY  $1.2 MILLION  , EFFECTIVE  OCTOBER 1, 2019.  ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION  NJNG IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OF FORMER MGP SITES, WHICH CONTAIN CONTAMINATED RESIDUES FROM FORMER GAS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THAT CEASED OPERATING AT THESE SITES BY THE MID-1950S AND, IN SOME CASES, HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED MANY YEARS EARLIER. ACTUAL MGP REMEDIATION COSTS MAY VARY FROM MANAGEMENT\u2019S ESTIMATES DUE TO THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS, REGULATORY DECISIONS BY THE NJDEP AND RELATED LITIGATION. NJNG REVIEWS THESE COSTS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR AND ADJUSTS ITS LIABILITY AND CORRESPONDING REGULATORY ASSET AS NECESSARY TO REFLECT ITS EXPECTED FUTURE REMEDIATION OBLIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, NJNG RECOGNIZED A REGULATORY ASSET AND AN OBLIGATION OF  $129.2 MILLION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , A  DECREASE  OF  $1.9 MILLION  , COMPARED WITH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . ON  SEPTEMBER 27, 2019  , NJNG FILED ITS ANNUAL SBC APPLICATION REQUESTING TO RECOVER REMEDIATION EXPENSES, INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN THE RAC, OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.4 MILLION  ANNUALLY AND AN INCREASE TO THE NJCEP FACTOR, WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN ANNUAL INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $3.3 MILLION  , TO BE EFFECTIVE  APRIL 1, 2020.  IN JUNE 2019, NJNG INITIATED A PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT OF A SITE IN ABERDEEN, NEW JERSEY TO DETERMINE PRIOR OWNERSHIP AND IF THERE WERE FORMER MGP OPERATIONS ACTIVE AT THE LOCATION. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL AND ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF NJNG\u2019S ANNUAL SBC APPLICATION TO RECOVER REMEDIATION EXPENSES.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES UTILITY GROSS MARGIN, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF NJNG. NJNG'S UTILITY GROSS MARGIN IS DEFINED AS NATURAL GAS REVENUES LESS NATURAL GAS PURCHASES, SALES TAX, AND REGULATORY RIDER EXPENSES, AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE DEFINITION OF GROSS MARGIN USED BY OTHERS IN THE NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT UTILITY GROSS MARGIN PROVIDES A MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR EVALUATING UTILITY OPERATIONS SINCE NATURAL GAS COSTS, SALES TAX AND REGULATORY RIDER EXPENSES ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING REVENUE AND PASSED THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NO EFFECT ON UTILITY GROSS MARGIN. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY USES NFE, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES. GAAP REQUIRES US, DURING THE INTERIM PERIODS, TO ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND USE THIS RATE TO CALCULATE THE YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION. WE ALSO DETERMINE AN ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR NFE PURPOSES AND CALCULATE A QUARTERLY TAX ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR FORECASTED NET INCOME AND OUR FORECASTED NFE FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. THIS ADJUSTMENT IS APPLIED TO CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES, AS SUCH ADJUSTMENT IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO TAX CREDITS GENERATED BY CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES. NO ADJUSTMENT IS NEEDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, SINCE THE ACTUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS CALCULATED AT YEAR END. ACCORDINGLY, FOR NFE PURPOSES, THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS  (3) PERCENT  FOR  FISCAL 2020  AND  (13) PERCENT  FOR  FISCAL 2019.  SINCE THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS BASED ON CERTAIN FORECASTED ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES SURROUNDING COMPLETION OF PROJECTS, THE RATE AND RESULTING NFE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. THE DETAILS OF SUCH TAX ADJUSTMENTS CAN BE FOUND IN THE TABLE BELOW.

ENERGY SERVICES MAINTAINS A STRATEGIC PORTFOLIO OF NATURAL GAS STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS THAT IT UTILIZES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS MARKET EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE SERVICE AND VALUE TO ITS CUSTOMERS. AVAILABILITY OF THESE STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS ALLOWS ENERGY SERVICES TO GENERATE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES BY CAPTURING PRICE DIFFERENTIALS OVER SPECIFIC TIME HORIZONS AND BETWEEN GEOGRAPHIC MARKET LOCATIONS.  ENERGY SERVICES ALSO PROVIDES MANAGEMENT OF STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION ASSETS FOR NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS AND REGULATED UTILITIES. THESE MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS TYPICALLY INVOLVE THE RELEASE OF PRODUCER/UTILITY OWNED STORAGE AND/OR TRANSPORTATION CAPACITY IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER AN OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE AND/OR DELIVER PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS. IN ADDITION TO THE CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE AND/OR SALE OF PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS, ENERGY SERVICES GENERATES OR PAYS FEE-BASED MARGIN IN EXCHANGE FOR ITS ACTIVE MANAGEMENT AND MAY PROVIDE THE PRODUCER AND/OR UTILITY WITH ADDITIONAL MARGIN BASED ON ACTUAL RESULTS.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF THESE CONTRACTS, ENERGY SERVICES GENERATES FINANCIAL MARGIN BY IDENTIFYING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY ENTERING INTO NATURAL GAS PURCHASE/SALE, STORAGE OR TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN CASES WHERE STORAGE IS UTILIZED TO FULFILL THESE CONTRACTS, THESE FORECAST SALES AND/OR PURCHASES ARE ECONOMICALLY HEDGED THROUGH THE USE OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EXCHANGE-TRADED FUTURES, OPTIONS AND SWAP CONTRACTS, AND ARE FREQUENTLY USED TO LOCK IN ANTICIPATED TRANSACTIONAL CASH FLOWS AND TO HELP MANAGE VOLATILITY IN NATURAL GAS MARKET PRICES. GENERALLY, WHEN ITS STORAGE AND TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS ARE EXPOSED TO PERIODS OF INCREASED MARKET VOLATILITY, ENERGY SERVICES IS ABLE TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO CAPTURE MARGIN BY IMPROVING THE RESPECTIVE TIME OR GEOGRAPHIC SPREADS ON A FORWARD BASIS.  ENERGY SERVICES ACCOUNTS FOR ITS PHYSICAL COMMODITY CONTRACTS AND ITS FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PHYSICAL COMMODITY CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN EARNINGS AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING REVENUE OR GAS PURCHASES ON THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. VOLATILITY IN REPORTED NET INCOME AT ENERGY SERVICES CAN OCCUR OVER PERIODS OF TIME DUE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS TIMING DIFFERENCES RELATED TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES CAN FLUCTUATE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE PRICE OF NATURAL GAS, SRECS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FROM THE ORIGINAL TRANSACTION PRICE. VOLATILITY IN EARNINGS CAN ALSO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SETTLEMENT OF FINANCIAL DERIVATIVES AND THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING PHYSICAL COMMODITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT SETTLES AND THE PHYSICAL NATURAL GAS IS INJECTED  52  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE, NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHEN EVALUATING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF ENERGY SERVICES. FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE ARE BASED ON REMOVING TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THERE IS A RELATED TAX EFFECT ON CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE CORRESPONDING WITH NFE.  MANAGEMENT VIEWS THESE MEASURES AS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE OVERALL EXPECTED ECONOMIC RESULT AND USES THESE MEASURES TO COMPARE ENERGY SERVICES' RESULTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED BENCHMARKS AND EARNINGS TARGETS AS THESE MEASURES ELIMINATE THE IMPACT OF VOLATILITY ON GAAP EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE UNANTICIPATED IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE RELATED TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ECONOMIC HEDGES, ENERGY SERVICES' ACTUAL NON-GAAP RESULTS CAN DIFFER FROM THE RESULTS ANTICIPATED AT THE OUTSET OF THE TRANSACTION. NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH, OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO, GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE.  WHEN ENERGY SERVICES RECONCILES THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO BOTH FINANCIAL MARGIN AND NFE, THE CURRENT PERIOD UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES ARE EXCLUDED AS A RECONCILING ITEM.

PENNEAST RECEIVED A CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY FOR THE PROJECT FROM FERC ON JANUARY 19, 2018.  ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2019, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE THIRD CIRCUIT ISSUED AN ORDER OVERTURNING THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY\u2019S ORDER GRANTING PENNEAST CONDEMNATION AND IMMEDIATE ACCESS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATURAL GAS ACT TO CERTAIN PROPERTIES IN WHICH THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY HOLDS AN INTEREST. A PETITION FOR REHEARING WAS DENIED BY THE THIRD CIRCUIT ON NOVEMBER 5, 2019.  ON OCTOBER 8, 2019, THE NJDEP ISSUED A LETTER INDICATING THAT IT DEEMED PENNEAST\u2019S FRESHWATER WETLANDS PERMIT APPLICATION TO BE ADMINISTRATIVELY INCOMPLETE AND CLOSED THE MATTER WITHOUT PREJUDICE. ON OCTOBER 11, 2019, PENNEAST SUBMITTED A LETTER TO THE NJDEP OBJECTING TO ITS POSITION THAT THE APPLICATION IS ADMINISTRATIVELY INCOMPLETE. PENNEAST'S OBJECTIONS WERE REJECTED BY THE NJDEP ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019.  ON OCTOBER 4, 2019, PENNEAST FILED A PETITION FOR DECLARATORY ORDER WITH FERC REQUESTING AN INTERPRETATION OF THE EMINENT DOMAIN AUTHORITY OF A FERC CERTIFICATE HOLDER UNDER THE NATURAL GAS ACT. THE DECLARATORY ORDER WAS GRANTED ON JANUARY 30, 2020.  ON JANUARY 30, 2020, PENNEAST FILED AN AMENDMENT WITH FERC TO CONSTRUCT THE PENNEAST PIPELINE IN TWO PHASES. PHASE  ONE CONSISTS OF CONSTRUCTION OF A 68-MILE PIPELINE IN PENNSYLVANIA FROM THE EASTERN MARCELLUS SHALE REGION IN LUZERNE COUNTY THAT WOULD TERMINATE IN NORTHAMPTON COUNTY. PHASE TWO INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF THE REMAINING ORIGINAL CERTIFICATED ROUTE IN PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW JERSEY. CONSTRUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN FOLLOWING APPROVAL BY FERC OF THE PHASED APPROACH AND RECEIPT OF ANY REMAINING GOVERNMENTAL AND REGULATORY PERMITS.  PENNEAST WAS GRANTED A 30-DAY EXTENSION TO FILE A PETITION FOR A WRIT OF  CERTIORARI  WITH THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES TO REVIEW THE SEPTEMBER 10, 2019 THIRD CIRCUIT DECISION AND NOW EXPECTS TO FILE A PETITION OF  CERTIORARI  BEFORE THE MARCH 4, 2020 DEADLINE.  WE EVALUATED OUR INVESTMENT IN PENNEAST FOR IMPAIRMENT AND DETERMINED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS NOT NECESSARY. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT FUTURE UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS, SUCH AS A REDUCED LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS FROM DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS AND LEGAL OUTCOMES, ESTIMATED INCREASES IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS, INCREASES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE, OR FURTHER SIGNIFICANT DELAYS, COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT.

NJR ALSO RAISED APPROXIMATELY  $3.6 MILLION  AND  $3.7 MILLION  OF EQUITY THROUGH THE DRP BY ISSUING APPROXIMATELY  80,000  AND  82,000  SHARES OF TREASURY STOCK, DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THERE WERE  NO  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ISSUED THROUGH THE WAIVER DISCOUNT FEATURE OF THE DRP DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019.  IN 1996, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED US TO IMPLEMENT A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WHICH WAS EXPANDED SEVEN TIMES SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM, AUTHORIZING A TOTAL OF  19.5 MILLION  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR REPURCHASE. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY  17.1 MILLION  OF THOSE SHARES AND MAY REPURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL  2.4 MILLION  SHARES UNDER THE APPROVED PROGRAM. THERE WERE  NO  SHARES REPURCHASED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018.  58  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  COMMON STOCK ISSUANCE AND FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT  ON  DECEMBER 4, 2019  , WE COMPLETED AN EQUITY OFFERING OF  6,545,454  COMMON SHARES, CONSISTING OF  5,333,334  COMMON SHARES ISSUED DIRECTLY BY THE COMPANY AND  1,212,120  COMMON SHARES ISSUABLE PURSUANT TO FORWARD SALES AGREEMENTS WITH INVESTMENT BANKS. THE ISSUANCE OF  5,333,334  RESULTED IN PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $212.9 MILLION  , NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS, AND WAS REFLECTED IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.  UNDER THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS, A TOTAL OF  1,212,120  COMMON SHARES WERE BORROWED FROM THIRD PARTIES AND SOLD TO THE UNDERWRITERS. EACH FORWARD SALE AGREEMENT ALLOWS US, AT OUR ELECTION AND PRIOR TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2020  , TO PHYSICALLY SETTLE THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS BY ISSUING COMMON SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR NET PROCEEDS AT THE THEN-APPLICABLE FORWARD SALE PRICE SPECIFIED BY THE AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS INITIALLY  $40.0125  PER SHARE, OR, ALTERNATIVELY, TO SETTLE THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS IN WHOLE OR IN PART THROUGH THE DELIVERY OR RECEIPT OF SHARES OR CASH. THE FORWARD SALE PRICE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT DAILY BASED ON A FLOATING INTEREST RATE FACTOR AND WILL DECREASE IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN FIXED AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENTS, SUCH AS DIVIDENDS.  OUR CURRENT INTENT IS TO PHYSICALLY SETTLE THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS BY ISSUING COMMON SHARES. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , IF WE HAD ELECTED TO NET SETTLE THE FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS, WE WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO PAY  $5 MILLION  UNDER A CASH SETTLEMENT OR WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO DELIVER  112,805  COMMON SHARES UNDER A NET SHARE SETTLEMENT.  DEBT  NJR AND ITS UNREGULATED SUBSIDIARIES GENERALLY RELY ON CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE UTILIZATION OF COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL AND SHORT-TERM DEBT FINANCING REQUIREMENTS. NJNG ALSO RELIES ON THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER FOR SHORT-TERM FUNDING. NJR AND NJNG PERIODICALLY ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND LONG-LIFE ASSETS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT SECURITIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING BORROWING AVAILABILITY, EQUITY PROCEEDS AND CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES' WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DIVIDEND REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. NJR, NJNG, CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES, MIDSTREAM AND ENERGY SERVICES CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT EACH OF THEIR FINANCING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WILL BE MET PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT, METER AND SOLAR SALE-LEASEBACKS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY.  WE BELIEVE THAT AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJR AND NJNG WERE, AND CURRENTLY ARE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL EXISTING DEBT COVENANTS, BOTH FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL.  SHORT-TERM DEBT  WE USE OUR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS PRIMARILY TO FINANCE ENERGY SERVICES' SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS, MIDSTREAM INVESTMENTS AND PENNEAST CONTRIBUTIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND, ON AN INITIAL BASIS, CLEAN ENERGY VENTURES' INVESTMENTS. ENERGY SERVICES' USE OF HIGH VOLUME STORAGE FACILITIES AND ANTICIPATED PIPELINE PARK-AND-LOAN ARRANGEMENTS, COMBINED WITH RELATED ECONOMIC HEDGING ACTIVITIES IN THE VOLATILE WHOLESALE NATURAL GAS MARKET, CREATE SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJR HAD REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES TOTALING  $575 MILLION  , WITH  $365.5 MILLION  AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITIES.  NJNG SATISFIES ITS DEBT NEEDS BY ISSUING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT BASED ON ITS FINANCIAL PROFILE. THE SEASONAL NATURE OF NJNG'S OPERATIONS CREATES LARGE SHORT-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS, PRIMARILY TO FINANCE NATURAL GAS PURCHASES AND CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. NJNG OBTAINS WORKING CAPITAL FOR THESE REQUIREMENTS, AND FOR THE TEMPORARY FINANCING OF CONSTRUCTION AND MGP REMEDIATION EXPENDITURES AND ENERGY TAX PAYMENTS, BASED ON ITS FINANCIAL PROFILE, THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER SUPPORTED BY THE NJNG CREDIT FACILITY OR THROUGH SHORT-TERM BANK LOANS UNDER THE NJNG CREDIT FACILITY.  NJNG\u2019S COMMERCIAL PAPER IS SOLD THROUGH SEVERAL COMMERCIAL BANKS UNDER AN ISSUING AND PAYING AGENCY AGREEMENT AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE  $250 MILLION  NJNG CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , THE UNUSED AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE NJNG CREDIT FACILITY, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO THE BACKSTOP UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, WAS  $199.7 MILLION.  59  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

NJR  BASED ON ITS AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJR'S AVERAGE INTEREST RATE WAS  2.71 PERCENT  , RESULTING IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJR HAD  TWO  LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING TOTALING  $4.8 MILLION  , WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE NJR CREDIT FACILITY BY THE SAME AMOUNT. NJR DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL BE DRAWN UPON BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.  ON  OCTOBER 9, 2019  , NJR ENTERED INTO A  $350 MILLION  BRIDGE FACILITY, WHICH WAS USED PRIMARILY TO FINANCE THE LEAF RIVER ACQUISITION. THE BRIDGE FACILITY ACCRUES INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE FOR A 1-MONTH INTEREST PERIOD PLUS  0.875 PERCENT  DURING THE FIRST 180 DAYS, AND  1.075 PERCENT  AFTER 180 DAYS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON THE CREDIT RATING OF NJNG FROM FITCH AND MOODY\u2019S. THE OCCURRENCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE BRIDGE FACILITY COULD RESULT IN ALL LOANS AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF NJR BECOMING IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE AND THE BRIDGE FACILITY BEING TERMINATED. LOANS UNDER THE BRIDGE FACILITY ARE REQUIRED TO BE PREPAID TO THE EXTENT OF NEW CASH PROCEEDS RECEIVED UPON THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY OF NJR, THE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS BY NJR OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS BY NJR OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES OR UPON OTHER SPECIFIED EVENTS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS SET FORTH IN THE BRIDGE FACILITY. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $137.1 MILLION  IN BORROWINGS REMAINING AGAINST THE FACILITY. THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE DECEMBER 2019 EQUITY ISSUANCE WERE USED TO PAY DOWN THE BRIDGE FACILITY.  ON  DECEMBER 13, 2019  , NJR ENTERED INTO A  FOUR  -MONTH,  $150 MILLION  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES ON  APRIL 13, 2020  . THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE PREPAID AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PREMIUM OR PENALTY OTHER THAN NORMAL BREAK FUNDING COSTS, PROCEEDS WILL BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL OR OTHER GENERAL BUSINESS PURPOSES OF NJR. AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  $85 MILLION  IN BORROWINGS AGAINST THE FACILITY.  NEITHER NJNG NOR ITS ASSETS ARE OBLIGATED OR PLEDGED TO SUPPORT THE NJR CREDIT FACILITY.  NJNG  AS NOTED ABOVE, BASED ON ITS AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJNG'S AVERAGE INTEREST RATE WAS  1.94 PERCENT  , RESULTING IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY  $211,000.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , NJNG HAD  TWO  LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING FOR  $731,000  , WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER NJNG'S COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY BY THE SAME AMOUNT. NJNG DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THESE LETTERS OF CREDIT WILL BE DRAWN UPON BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.  60  NEW JERSEY RESOURCES CORPORATION  PART I  ITEM 2.

DRIVEN BY OUR PURPOSE TO SHAPE A SUSTAINABLE WORLD TOGETHER, WE WORK ALONGSIDE OUR CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE BEVERAGE CAN, AUTOMOTIVE AND SPECIALTY MARKETS (INCLUDES FOIL PACKAGING, CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION PRODUCTS, ARCHITECTURAL, INDUSTRIAL, AND CONSUMER DURABLES).  WE HAVE RECYCLING OPERATIONS IN MANY OF OUR PLANTS TO RECYCLE BOTH POST-CONSUMER ALUMINUM AND POST-INDUSTRIAL ALUMINUM.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE HAD MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN  NINE  COUNTRIES ON FOUR CONTINENTS, WHICH INCLUDE  23  OPERATING PLANTS, AND RECYCLING OPERATIONS IN  TWELVE  OF THESE PLANTS.

REFERENCES TO OUR FORM 10-K MADE THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT REFER TO OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , FILED WITH THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) ON  MAY 8, 2019.  HIGHLIGHTS  WE REPORTED \"  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR COMMON SHAREHOLDER  \" OF  $107 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  37%  COMPARED TO  $78 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  WE REPORTED SEGMENT INCOME OF  $343 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  7%  COMPARED TO  $322 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE WAS DRIVEN BY PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION EFFORTS, OPERATING COST EFFICIENCIES, AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LESS FAVORABLE RECYCLING BENEFITS DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE LME ALUMINUM PRICES.  FURTHER, THESE FACTORS DROVE NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO  $464 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  ,  AN IMPROVEMENT  OF  $140 MILLION  OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD.  BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CLIMATE  ECONOMIC GROWTH, MATERIAL SUBSTITUTION, AND SUSTAINABILITY, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS AROUND POLYETHYLENE TEREPHTHALATE (PET) PLASTICS, CONTINUE TO DRIVE INCREASING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM AND ROLLED PRODUCTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHINA WHERE CAN SHEET OVERCAPACITY AND STRONG COMPETITION REMAINS, FAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND INCREASING CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING OPTIONS IS DRIVING HIGHER DEMAND FOR INFINITELY RECYCLABLE ALUMINUM BEVERAGE CANS AND BOTTLES. IN FISCAL 2019, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO EXPAND ROLLING, CASTING AND RECYCLING CAPABILITY IN PINDA, BRAZIL TO SUPPORT THIS DEMAND.  44  MEANWHILE, THE DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO GROW, WHICH DROVE THE INVESTMENTS WE MADE IN OUR AUTOMOTIVE SHEET FINISHING CAPACITY IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA IN RECENT YEARS, AND IS DRIVING OUR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN GUTHRIE, KENTUCKY (U.S.) AND CHANGZHOU, CHINA.  THIS DEMAND HAS BEEN PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE BENEFITS THAT RESULT FROM USING LIGHTWEIGHT ALUMINUM IN VEHICLE STRUCTURES AND COMPONENTS, AS COMPANIES RESPOND TO STRICTER GOVERNMENT EMISSIONS AND FUEL ECONOMY REGULATIONS, WHILE MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING VEHICLE SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE, RESULTING IN INCREASED COMPETITION WITH HIGH-STRENGTH STEEL.  FURTHER, WE SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE ALERIS, WHICH WOULD FURTHER DIVERSIFY OUR GLOBAL FOOTPRINT AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO. THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO THE RECEIPT OF CUSTOMARY REGULATORY AND ANTITRUST APPROVALS, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 19 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS.

NEARLY ALL OF OUR FLAT ROLLED PRODUCTS HAVE A PRICE STRUCTURE WITH THREE COMPONENTS: (I) A BASE ALUMINUM PRICE QUOTED OFF THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE (LME); (II) A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM; AND (III) A \u201cCONVERSION PREMIUM\u201d TO PRODUCE THE ROLLED PRODUCT WHICH REFLECTS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE COMPETITIVE MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THAT PRODUCT.  BASE ALUMINUM PRICES ARE TYPICALLY DRIVEN BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND GLOBAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR ALUMINUM.  THE LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS TEND TO VARY BASED ON THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR METAL IN A PARTICULAR REGION AND ASSOCIATED TRANSPORTATION COSTS.  IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND SOUTH AMERICA, WE PASS THROUGH LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE RECORDED THROUGH \"NET SALES.\"  IN ASIA WE PURCHASE OUR METAL INPUTS BASED ON THE LME AND INCUR A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM; HOWEVER, MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS IN THIS REGION PRICE THEIR METAL OFF THE SHANGHAI FUTURES EXCHANGE, WHICH DOES NOT INCLUDE A LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO FULLY PASS THROUGH THIS COMPONENT OF OUR METAL INPUT COST TO SOME OF OUR CUSTOMERS.  45  LME BASE ALUMINUM PRICES AND LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS  THE AVERAGE (BASED ON THE SIMPLE AVERAGE OF THE MONTHLY AVERAGES) AND CLOSING PRICES FOR ALUMINUM SET ON THE LME ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE TIMING OF THESE IMPACTS VARIES BASED ON CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND METAL SUPPLIERS IN EACH REGION.  THESE TIMING IMPACTS ARE REFERRED TO AS METAL PRICE LAG.  METAL PRICE LAG EXISTS DUE TO: (I) THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN THE PRICING OF OUR PURCHASES OF METAL, HOLDING AND PROCESSING THE METAL, AND THE PRICING OF THE SALE OF FINISHED INVENTORY TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND (II) CERTAIN CUSTOMER CONTRACTS CONTAINING FIXED FORWARD PRICE COMMITMENTS WHICH RESULT IN EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN METAL PRICES FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN WHEN OUR SALES PRICE FIXES AND THE SALE ACTUALLY OCCURS.  WE USE LME ALUMINUM FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PRESERVE OUR CONVERSION MARGINS AND MANAGE THE TIMING DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LME BASE METAL COMPONENT OF \u201cNET SALES,\u201d AND \u201cCOST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION).\"  THESE DERIVATIVES DIRECTLY HEDGE THE ECONOMIC RISK OF FUTURE LME BASE METAL PRICE FLUCTUATIONS TO BETTER MATCH THE PURCHASE PRICE OF METAL WITH THE SALES PRICE OF METAL.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LOCAL MARKET PREMIUM HEDGING OCCURS IN NORTH AMERICA DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS; HOWEVER, EXPOSURE HERE IS NOT FULLY HEDGED.  IN OUR EUROPE, ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA REGIONS, THE DERIVATIVE MARKET FOR LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS IS NOT ROBUST OR EFFICIENT ENOUGH FOR US TO OFFSET THE IMPACTS OF LMP PRICE MOVEMENTS BEYOND A SMALL VOLUME.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, VOLATILITY IN LOCAL MARKET PREMIUMS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.  WE ELECT TO APPLY HEDGE ACCOUNTING TO BETTER MATCH THE RECOGNITION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE BEING HEDGED IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  FOR UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVES, THERE ARE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVES AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURE IN THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVE POSITIONS TYPICALLY PRECEDES INVENTORY COST RECOGNITION, CUSTOMER DELIVERY AND REVENUE RECOGNITION.  THE TIMING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RECOGNITION OF UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON UNDESIGNATED METAL DERIVATIVES AND COST OR REVENUE RECOGNITION IMPACTS \u201cINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\u201d AND \u201cNET INCOME.\u201d  GAINS AND LOSSES ON METAL DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN SEGMENT INCOME UNTIL REALIZED.  46  FOREIGN CURRENCY AND RELATED HEDGING ACTIVITIES  WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS AND CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AROUND THE WORLD.  WE HAVE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AS FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATING RESULTS FROM VARIOUS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES INTO OUR U.S. DOLLAR REPORTING CURRENCY AT CURRENT AVERAGE RATES.  WE ALSO RECORD FOREIGN EXCHANGE REMEASUREMENT GAINS AND LOSSES WHEN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THAT OPERATION.  GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY IS CONTRIBUTING TO HIGHER LEVELS OF VOLATILITY AMONG THE CURRENCY PAIRS IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS.

IN EUROPE, WHERE WE HAVE PREDOMINANTLY LOCAL CURRENCY SELLING PRICES AND OPERATING COSTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE EURO STRENGTHENS, BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE EURO WEAKENS.  FOR OUR SWISS OPERATIONS, WHERE OPERATING COSTS ARE INCURRED PRIMARILY IN THE SWISS FRANC AND A LARGE PORTION OF REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN THE EURO, WE BENEFIT AS THE SWISS FRANC WEAKENS BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE FRANC STRENGTHENS.  IN SOUTH KOREA, WHERE WE HAVE LOCAL CURRENCY OPERATING COSTS AND U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SELLING PRICES FOR EXPORTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE SOUTH KOREAN WON WEAKENS BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE WON STRENGTHENS.  IN BRAZIL, WHERE WE HAVE PREDOMINATELY U.S. DOLLAR SELLING PRICES AND LOCAL CURRENCY MANUFACTURING COSTS, WE BENEFIT AS THE BRAZILIAN REAL WEAKENS, BUT ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AS THE REAL STRENGTHENS.  WE USE FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE ARISING FROM RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

WE RECOGNIZED  $49 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WHICH RESULTED IN AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  31%  .  THIS TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE STRENGTHENING BRAZILIAN REAL, OFFSET BY A $4 MILLION DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT BOOKED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SWISS TAX REFORM. WE RECOGNIZED  $37 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE IN THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD, WHICH RESULTED IN AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  33%  .  THIS TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING RECORDING A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR TAX LOSSES IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE COMPANY DETERMINED IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE LOSS WILL NOT BE UTILIZED.

THE \"ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER\" COLUMN ADJUSTS REGIONAL SEGMENT INCOME FOR INTERSEGMENT SHIPMENTS THAT OCCUR IN A PERIOD PRIOR TO RECOGNITION OF SEGMENT INCOME ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  THE \"ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER\" COLUMN ALSO REFLECTS ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN REGIONAL VOLUME, CONVERSION PREMIUM AND PRODUCT MIX, AND CONVERSION COSTS RELATED TO INTERSEGMENT SHIPMENTS FOR CONSOLIDATION.  \"ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER\" MUST ADJUST FOR PROPORTIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF EACH LINE ITEM FOR OUR LOGAN AFFILIATE BECAUSE WE CONSOLIDATE 100% OF THE LOGAN JOINT VENTURE FOR U.S. GAAP, BUT WE MANAGE OUR LOGAN AFFILIATE ON A PROPORTIONATELY CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  (B)  \"SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COSTS\" INCLUDE COSTS INCURRED DIRECTLY BY EACH SEGMENT AND ALL CORPORATE RELATED COSTS.  NORTH AMERICA  \u201cNET SALES\u201d  DECREASED  $282 MILLION  , OR  8%  , DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN AVERAGE ALUMINUM PRICES AND LOWER SPECIALTY SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CAN AND AUTOMOTIVE SHIPMENTS.  SEGMENT INCOME WAS  $468 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  18%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX AND OPERATING COSTS.  EUROPE  \u201cNET SALES\u201d  DECREASED  $175 MILLION  , OR  7%  , DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE ALUMINUM PRICES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS.  SEGMENT INCOME WAS  $160 MILLION  ,  A DECREASE  OF  6%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX, COST INFLATION, AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SHIPMENTS.  ASIA  \u201cNET SALES\u201d  DECREASED  $144 MILLION  , OR  9%  , DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE ALUMINUM PRICES AND LOWER SPECIALTY SHIPMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CAN SHIPMENTS.  SEGMENT INCOME WAS  $154 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  2%  , PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUME AND FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LESS FAVORABLE RECYCLING BENEFITS.  SOUTH AMERICA  \u201cNET SALES\u201d  DECREASED  $170 MILLION  , OR  11%  , DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE ALUMINUM PRICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CAN SHIPMENTS.  SEGMENT INCOME WAS  $309 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  5%  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME, FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX, FAVORABLE FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND TAX RECOVERIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST INFLATION AND LESS FAVORABLE RECYCLING BENEFITS.  53  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY LIQUIDITY SOURCES ARE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, CASH AND LIQUIDITY UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS.  OUR RECENT BUSINESS INVESTMENTS ARE BEING FUNDED THROUGH CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS AND A COMBINATION OF LOCAL FINANCING AND OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES.  MOST OF OUR RECENT STRATEGIC EXPANSION PROJECTS ARE OPERATING CLOSE TO FULL CAPACITY AND ARE GENERATING ADDITIONAL OPERATING CASH FLOW.  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR CONTINUED EXPANSIONS, SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: THE GENERATION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, OUR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES (INCLUDING REFINANCING) AND NEW DEBT ISSUANCES, AS NECESSARY.  NON-GUARANTOR INFORMATION  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT GUARANTORS REPRESENTED THE FOLLOWING APPROXIMATE PERCENTAGES OF (A) \"NET SALES\", (B) ADJUSTED EBITDA (SEGMENT INCOME), AND (C) \"TOTAL ASSETS\" OF THE COMPANY, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS (INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY BALANCES).  ITEM DESCRIPTION  RATIO  NET SALES REPRESENTED BY NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019)  21%  ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTED BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019)  13%  ASSETS OWNED BY NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES (AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019)  16%  IN ADDITION, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE NOT GUARANTORS HAD NET SALES OF  $2.0 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND, AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , THOSE SUBSIDIARIES HAD ASSETS OF  $2.1 BILLION  AND DEBT AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF  $1.3 BILLION  (INCLUDING INTER-COMPANY BALANCES).  AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY  OUR AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  IS AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).  DECEMBER 31, 2019  MARCH 31, 2019  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $1,031  $950  AVAILABILITY UNDER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES (A)  838  897  TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY  $1,869  $1,847  _________________________  (A)  OUR AVAILABILITY UNDER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE THE FINANCING FOR ALERIS.  THE  INCREASE  IN TOTAL AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO FREE CASH FLOW OF  $61 MILLION  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH CAPITAL SPENDING RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND DECREASES IN AVAILABILITY UNDER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.  SEE  NOTE 8 \u2014 DEBT  FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT OUR AVAILABILITY UNDER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES.  THE \u201cCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\u201d BALANCE ABOVE INCLUDES CASH HELD IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE HELD  $5 MILLION  OF \"CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\" IN CANADA, IN WHICH WE ARE INCORPORATED, WITH THE REST HELD IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE HELD  $827 MILLION  OF CASH IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH WE HAVE ASSERTED THAT EARNINGS ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS AND LOCAL EXPANSIONS WITH CASH HELD IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  CASH HELD OUTSIDE OF CANADA IS FREE FROM SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT THE CASH FROM BEING ACCESSED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDING, IF NECESSARY, TO FUND OPERATIONS AND SERVICE DEBT OBLIGATIONS IN CANADA.  UPON THE REPATRIATION OF ANY EARNINGS TO CANADA, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CANADIAN INCOME TAXES (SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT FOR FOREIGN TAXES PAID AND THE UTILIZATION OF THE LARGE CUMULATIVE NET OPERATING LOSSES WE HAVE IN CANADA) AND WITHHOLDING TAXES PAYABLE TO THE VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE DO NOT BELIEVE ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES EXIST THAT RESTRICT OUR USE OF \u201cCASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS\u201d IN A MATERIAL MANNER.  54  FREE CASH FLOW  REFER TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR OUR DEFINITION OF FREE CASH FLOW.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE DISPLAYS THE FREE CASH FLOW, THE CHANGE BETWEEN PERIODS, AS WELL AS THE ENDING BALANCES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  CHANGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $464  $324  $140  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (400  )  (434  )  34  PLUS: CASH USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE  \u2014  239  (239  )  LESS: PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS AND BUSINESS, NET OF TRANSACTION FEES, CASH INCOME TAXES AND HEDGING  (3  )  (2  )  (1  )  FREE CASH FLOW  $61  $127  $(66  )  ENDING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $1,031  $797  $234  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  THE  INCREASE  IN \"NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES\" PRIMARILY RELATES TO HIGHER SEGMENT INCOME PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS AND FAVORABLE PRICE AND PRODUCT MIX.  THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ALONG WITH LOWER QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  \"NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES\" WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED CASH CAPITAL SPENDING RELATED TO STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED CAPACITY EXPANSIONS IN GUTHRIE, KENTUCKY, CHANGZHOU, CHINA, AND PINDA, BRAZIL.  THE PRIOR PERIOD INCLUDED A $239 MILLION CASH OUTFLOW RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY THAT WE HISTORICALLY LEASED AT OUR SIERRE, SWITZERLAND ROLLING FACILITY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE BORROWED  $29 MILLION  OF LONG TERM DEBT IN CHINA TO FUND CAPITAL EXPANSION PROJECTS AND  $50 MILLION  IN SHORT TERM BORROWINGS IN BRAZIL TO FUND CERTAIN SHORT TERM COMMITMENTS.  WE MADE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $14 MILLION  ON OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND  $2 MILLION  IN FINANCE LEASES AND OTHER REPAYMENTS.  THE NET CASH OUTFLOW FROM OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES BALANCE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $38 MILLION  IN PAYMENTS ON OUR CHINA SHORT TERM CREDIT FACILITY.  WE INCURRED  $3 MILLION  IN DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  THERE WERE NO ISSUANCES OF LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.  WE MADE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS OF  $77 MILLION  ON KOREAN LONG-TERM DEBT,  $14 MILLION  ON OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY,  $3 MILLION  ON FINANCE LEASES, AND  $1 MILLION  OF OTHER REPAYMENTS.  THE NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITIES' BALANCE IS RELATED TO PROCEEDS OF  $92 MILLION  ON OUR ABL REVOLVER AND  $17 MILLION  ON OUR CHINA CREDIT FACILITIES. WE INCURRED  $2 MILLION  IN DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS.  55  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEC RULES, THE FOLLOWING QUALIFY AS OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS;  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER CERTAIN GUARANTEES OR CONTRACTS;  \u2022  A RETAINED OR CONTINGENT INTEREST IN ASSETS TRANSFERRED TO AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY OR SIMILAR ENTITY OR SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT THAT SERVES AS CREDIT, LIQUIDITY OR MARKET RISK SUPPORT TO THAT ENTITY FOR SUCH ASSETS; AND  \u2022  ANY OBLIGATION UNDER A MATERIAL VARIABLE INTEREST HELD BY THE REGISTRANT IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE REGISTRANT, OR ENGAGES IN LEASING, HEDGING OR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES WITH THE REGISTRANT.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION ADDRESSES THE APPLICABLE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS FOR OUR COMPANY.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  SEE  NOTE 12 \u2014 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS  WE HAVE ISSUED GUARANTEES ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  THE INDEBTEDNESS GUARANTEED IS FOR TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  SOME OF THE GUARANTEES HAVE ANNUAL TERMS WHILE OTHERS HAVE NO EXPIRATION AND HAVE TERMINATION NOTICE REQUIREMENTS.  NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES HOLDS ANY ASSETS OF ANY THIRD PARTIES AS COLLATERAL TO OFFSET THE POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THESE GUARANTEES.  SINCE WE CONSOLIDATE WHOLLY-OWNED AND MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALL LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH TRADE PAYABLES AND SHORT-TERM DEBT FACILITIES FOR THESE ENTITIES ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  OTHER ARRANGEMENTS  FACTORING OF TRADE RECEIVABLES  WE FACTOR TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON LOCAL CASH NEEDS, AS WELL AS ATTEMPTING TO BALANCE THE TIMING OF CASH FLOWS OF TRADE PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES, FUND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, AND FUND OTHER BUSINESS NEEDS.  FACTORED INVOICES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS WHEN WE DO NOT RETAIN A FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTEREST.  IF A FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTEREST IS RETAINED, WE CLASSIFY THESE FACTORINGS AS SECURED BORROWINGS.  HOWEVER, NO SUCH FINANCIAL OR LEGAL INTERESTS ARE CURRENTLY RETAINED.  OTHER  AS PART OF OUR ONGOING BUSINESS, WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN TRANSACTIONS THAT GENERATE RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES), WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES.  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE ARE NOT INVOLVED IN ANY UNCONSOLIDATED SPE TRANSACTIONS.  56  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER VARIOUS CONTRACTS RELATING TO DEBT AND INTEREST PAYMENTS, CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES, LONG-TERM PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  SEE  NOTE 8 \u2014 DEBT  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND \"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\" OF THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  FOR MORE DETAILS.  RETURN OF CAPITAL  PAYMENTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDER ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR FINANCIAL RESOURCES, CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY OUR BUSINESS, OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, RESTRICTIONS UNDER THE INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, BEING IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE APPROPRIATE INDENTURES AND COVENANTS UNDER THE INSTRUMENTS THAT GOVERN OUR INDEBTEDNESS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE DISCLOSED IN  NOTE 1 \u2014 BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (INCLUDING ASC 842 - LEASES), THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS REPORTED IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE  NOTE 1 \u2014 BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A FULL DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE RESPECTIVE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND EXPECTED EFFECTS ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME PRESENTS THE SUM OF THE RESULTS OF OUR FOUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS.  WE BELIEVE THAT TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME IS AN OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURE THAT MEASURES OPERATING RESULTS UNAFFECTED BY DIFFERENCES IN CAPITAL STRUCTURES, CAPITAL INVESTMENT CYCLES AND AGES OF RELATED ASSETS AMONG OTHERWISE COMPARABLE COMPANIES. IN REVIEWING OUR CORPORATE OPERATING RESULTS, WE ALSO BELIEVE IT IS IMPORTANT TO REVIEW THE AGGREGATE CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE OF ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS ON THE SAME BASIS WE REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF EACH OF OUR REGIONS AND TO DRAW COMPARISONS BETWEEN PERIODS BASED ON THE SAME MEASURE OF CONSOLIDATED PERFORMANCE.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES INVESTORS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PERFORMANCE IS ENHANCED BY INCLUDING THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR COMPARING OUR ONGOING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANY INVESTORS ARE INTERESTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS BY COMPARING OUR RESULTS FROM ONGOING OPERATIONS FROM ONE PERIOD TO THE NEXT AND WOULD ORDINARILY ADD BACK ITEMS THAT ARE NOT PART OF NORMAL DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS.  BY PROVIDING TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME, TOGETHER WITH RECONCILIATIONS, WE BELIEVE WE ARE ENHANCING INVESTORS\u2019 UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS ASSISTING INVESTORS IN EVALUATING HOW WELL WE ARE EXECUTING STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  HOWEVER, TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME IS NOT A MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER U.S. GAAP, AND OUR TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES.  TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME HAS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER U.S. GAAP.  FOR EXAMPLE, TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME.  \u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH EXPENDITURES OR REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS;  \u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS; AND  \u2022  DOES NOT REFLECT ANY COSTS RELATED TO THE CURRENT OR FUTURE REPLACEMENT OF ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED.  WE ALSO USE TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME.  \u2022  AS A MEASURE OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO ASSIST US IN COMPARING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BECAUSE IT REMOVES THE IMPACT OF ITEMS NOT DIRECTLY RESULTING FROM OUR CORE OPERATIONS;  \u2022  FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE PREPARATION OF OUR INTERNAL ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGETS AND FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS;  \u2022  TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR OPERATIONAL STRATEGIES; AND  \u2022  AS A BASIS TO CALCULATE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PAYMENTS FOR OUR KEY EMPLOYEES.  57  TOTAL SEGMENT INCOME IS EQUIVALENT TO OUR ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH WE REFER TO IN OUR EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL PRESENTATIONS TO ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS.  PLEASE SEE  NOTE 18 \u2014 SEGMENT, MAJOR CUSTOMER AND MAJOR SUPPLIER INFORMATION  FOR OUR DEFINITION OF SEGMENT INCOME.  FREE CASH FLOW CONSISTS OF: (A) \u201cNET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING ACTIVITIES,\u201d (B) PLUS \"NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) INVESTING ACTIVITIES\u201d (C) PLUS CASH USED IN THE \u201cACQUISITION OF ASSETS UNDER A CAPITAL LEASE\u201d, AND (D) LESS \u201cPROCEEDS FROM SALES OF ASSETS AND BUSINESS, NET OF TRANSACTION FEES, CASH INCOME TAXES AND HEDGING.\"  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES FREE CASH FLOW IS RELEVANT TO INVESTORS AS IT PROVIDES A MEASURE OF THE CASH GENERATED INTERNALLY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR DEBT SERVICE AND OTHER VALUE CREATION OPPORTUNITIES.  MANAGEMENT ALSO USES FREE CASH FLOW TO MEASURE THE PROFITABILITY AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.  HOWEVER, FREE CASH FLOW DOES NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, AS CERTAIN DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS MUST BE FUNDED OUT OF FREE CASH FLOW.  OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING FREE CASH FLOW MAY NOT BE CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES.  58  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND MARKET DATA  STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q  WHICH DESCRIBE NOVELIS' INTENTIONS, EXPECTATIONS, BELIEFS OR PREDICTIONS MAY BE FORWARD-LOOKING WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECURITIES LAWS.

OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  WE OPERATE IN FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES; PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES; FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES; AND LAND MANAGEMENT.  IN THE RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PRODUCER OF RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STEEL, FIBRE AND PLASTIC DRUMS, RIGID INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, TRANSIT PROTECTION PRODUCTS, WATER BOTTLES AND REMANUFACTURED AND RECONDITIONED INDUSTRIAL CONTAINERS, AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CONTAINER LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT, FILLING, LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSING AND OTHER PACKAGING SERVICES. WE SELL OUR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS CHEMICALS, PAINTS AND PIGMENTS, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, PETROLEUM, INDUSTRIAL COATINGS, AGRICULTURAL, PHARMACEUTICAL AND MINERALS, AMONG OTHERS.  IN THE PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE PRODUCE AND SELL CONTAINERBOARD, CORRUGATED SHEETS, CORRUGATED CONTAINERS, AND OTHER CORRUGATED PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA IN INDUSTRIES SUCH AS PACKAGING, AUTOMOTIVE, FOOD AND BUILDING PRODUCTS. OUR CORRUGATED CONTAINER PRODUCTS ARE USED TO SHIP SUCH DIVERSE PRODUCTS AS HOME APPLIANCES, SMALL MACHINERY, GROCERY PRODUCTS, AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENTS, BOOKS AND FURNITURE, AS WELL AS NUMEROUS OTHER APPLICATIONS. WE ALSO PRODUCE AND SELL COATED AND UNCOATED RECYCLED PAPERBOARD, SOME OF WHICH WE USE TO PRODUCE AND SELL INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS (TUBES AND CORES, CONSTRUCTION PRODUCTS, PROTECTIVE PACKAGING, AND ADHESIVES) AND CONSUMER PACKAGING PRODUCTS (FOLDING CARTONS, SET-UP BOXES, AND PACKAGING SERVICES). IN ADDITION, WE ALSO PURCHASE AND SELL RECYCLED FIBER.  IN THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT, WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PRODUCER OF FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS AND RELATED SERVICES. OUR FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS CONSIST OF A POLYPROPYLENE-BASED WOVEN FABRIC THAT IS PRODUCED AT OUR PRODUCTION SITES, AS WELL AS SOURCED FROM STRATEGIC REGIONAL SUPPLIERS. OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GLOBALLY AND SERVICE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SEGMENTS SIMILAR TO THOSE OF OUR RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES, AMONG OTHERS.  IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE ACTIVE HARVESTING AND REGENERATION OF OUR UNITED STATES TIMBER PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM YIELDS. WHILE TIMBER SALES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT CUTTING SCHEDULE, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MARKET AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. WE ALSO SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, TIMBERLAND AND SPECIAL USE LAND, WHICH CONSISTS OF SURPLUS LAND, HIGHER AND BETTER USE (\"HBU\") LAND AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE OWNED APPROXIMATELY  246,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2019  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2020.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2019  FORM 10-K  , UPDATED BY PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EBITDA PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT ARE RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT. IN THAT CASE, EBITDA IS DEFINED AS OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR THAT BUSINESS SEGMENT, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS EBITDA PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, PLUS NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET, FOR THAT BUSINESS SEGMENT. WE USE EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA AS FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT (INCOME) CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR CURRENT AND HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE. THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FIRST  QUARTER RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE NET SALES, OPERATING PROFIT, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2020  AND  2019  .

THE  $215.4 MILLION  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALES CONTRIBUTED BY THE ACQUIRED CARAUSTAR INDUSTRIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (\"CARAUSTAR\") OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUMES IN CERTAIN REGIONS AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. SEE THE \"SEGMENT REVIEW\" BELOW FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON NET SALES BY SEGMENT FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020.

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED CARAUSTAR OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS COSTS. SG&A EXPENSES WERE  12.2  PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  10.9  PERCENT OF NET SALES FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.

(COLLECTIVELY \"THOLU\") ON JUNE 11, 2019 (THE \"THOLU ACQUISITION\").  THE INCREASE IN ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION RELATED COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION AND THE THOLU ACQUISITION.

TRENDS  WE ANTICIPATE DEMAND SOFTNESS IN THE INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING BUSINESSES, PARTICULARLY IN NORTH AMERICA AND APAC, TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 2020. ADDITIONALLY, RAW MATERIAL PRICES FOR STEEL, RESIN, OLD CORRUGATED CONTAINERS, RECYCLED COATED AND UNCOATED PAPERBOARD ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 2020. WE ALSO ANTICIPATE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS TO BE VOLATILE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO THE POTENTIAL DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACTS DUE TO THE SPREAD OF THE CORONAVIRUS THAT WAS FIRST IDENTIFIED IN CHINA.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SEGMENT REVIEW  RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES  OUR RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STEEL, FIBRE AND PLASTIC DRUMS, RIGID INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, TRANSIT PROTECTION PRODUCTS, WATER BOTTLES AND REMANUFACTURED AND RECONDITIONED INDUSTRIAL CONTAINERS, AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CONTAINER LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT, FILLING, LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSING AND OTHER PACKAGING SERVICES.

THE  $29.2 MILLION  DECREASE  IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED VOLUMES IN THE U.S. AND APAC, DECREASED SELLING PRICES AS A RESULT OF CONTRACTUAL PRICE ADJUSTMENTS MECHANISMS RELATED TO RAW MATERIAL PRICE DECREASES, AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $107.8 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  $98.6 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  .

LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  246,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS;  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER;  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE; AND  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE SALE OF TIMBERLAND PROPERTY IN \"TIMBERLAND GAINS,\" THE SALE OF HBU AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IN \"GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET\" AND THE SALE OF TIMBER AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \"NET SALES\" AND \"COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD\" IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. ALL HBU AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, TOGETHER WITH SURPLUS PROPERTY, IS USED TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL THE PROPERTY IS SOLD.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO LAKES OR RIVERS, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  18,800  ACRES OF SPECIAL USE PROPERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.  NET SALES  INCREASED  TO  $7.0 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  $6.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  OPERATING PROFIT  DECREASED  TO  $1.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED WITH  $2.6 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  .

IS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS  $11.4 MILLION  ON  $47.3 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $20.0 MILLION  ON  $55.7 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. THE DECREASE TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED MIX OF EARNINGS AMONG TAX JURISDICTIONS, GREATER TAX CREDIT UTILIZATION AND FAVORABLE ONE-TIME DISCRETE ITEMS OF  $1.4 MILLION  THAT WERE RECOGNIZED IN THIS QUARTER. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 REFLECTED  $2.3 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY, OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES OF  $1.7 MILLION  RECOGNIZED DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE PERMANENT REINVESTMENT ASSERTION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER UNDER ASC 740-30. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF AN INDEMNIFICATION ON THE DIVESTURE OF ONE OF GREIF\u2019S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, GREIF RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY OF  $2.3 MILLION  . OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN TAX BENEFIT OF  $0.7 MILLION.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  THE ESTIMATED NET DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RANGES FROM  ZERO  TO  $3.4 MILLION  . ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM THE OPERATIONS OF OUR NON-WHOLLY OWNED, CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES THAT BELONG TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THOSE SUBSIDIARIES. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  AND  2019  WAS  $3.8 MILLION  AND  $6.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NET OPERATING PROFIT OF THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT JOINT VENTURE THAT WAS FORMED IN 2010 BY GREIF, INC. AND ONE OF ITS INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES WITH DABBAGH GROUP HOLDING COMPANY LIMITED AND ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFLEXIBLE PACKAGING JV\u201d OR \u201cFPS VIE\u201d).  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC.  BASED ON THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC. WAS  $32.3 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2020  COMPARED TO  $29.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019.  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) CHANGES  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 830, \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS,\u201d THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY ARE TRANSLATED INTO UNITED STATES DOLLARS AT THE RATE OF EXCHANGE EXISTING AT THE END OF THE CURRENT PERIOD, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE MONTH IN WHICH THEY ARE INCURRED. THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH REPRESENT THE  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EFFECTS OF TRANSLATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, ARE PRESENTED IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET  THE CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET OF TAX WAS INCOME OF  $21.7 MILLION  AND A LOSS OF  $0.8 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS IN THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF PENSION EVENTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  BALANCE SHEET CHANGES  WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES  THE  $22.5 MILLION  DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO  $641.7 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  FROM  $664.2 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES IN CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS.  THE  $12.7 MILLION  INCREASE  IN INVENTORIES TO  $370.9 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  FROM  $358.2 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES, OFFSET BY DECREASED RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES AND PRICES.

SEE NOTE 9 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  THE  $15.4 MILLION  INCREASE  IN OTHER LONG TERM LIABILITIES TO  $144.3 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  FROM  $128.9 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF  $7.6 MILLION  RELATED TO TAXES, WITH THE REMAINING VARIANCE DISAGGREGATED TO MINOR ACTIVITY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PROCEEDS FROM THE SENIOR NOTES WE HAVE ISSUED, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE USE THESE SOURCES TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FUND THESE ITEMS IN A LIKE MANNER.

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE VARIOUS BORROWING FACILITIES WHICH CHARGE INTEREST BASED ON THE ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR RATE PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY INTEREST RATE SWAPS.  IN 2019, WE ENTERED INTO SIX INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $1,300.0 MILLION  THAT AMORTIZE TO  $200.0 MILLION  OVER A FIVE YEAR TERM.

ACCORDINGLY, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2020  , AND  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $173.4 MILLION  , AND  $275.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED IN THE  119  RESTAURANTS THAT WE OWN AND OPERATE ARE 12 RESTAURANTS LOCATED AT SIX PROPERTY LOCATIONS WHERE WE OPERATE A SIDE-BY-SIDE LUBY\u2019S CAFETERIA AND FUDDRUCKERS ON THE SAME PROPERTY. WE REFER TO THESE LOCATIONS AS \u201cCOMBO LOCATIONS.\u201d  AS OF  DECEMBER 18, 2019  , WE OPERATED  33  CULINARY CONTRACT SERVICES LOCATIONS. WE OPERATED 22 OF THESE LOCATIONS IN THE HOUSTON, TEXAS AREA, THREE IN DALLAS, TEXAS, THREE IN THE TEXAS LOWER RIO GRANDE VALLEY, TWO IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS, ONE IN NORTHWEST TEXAS ONE IN KANSAS, AND ONE IN NORTH CAROLINA.

OUR LARGEST  6  FRANCHISE OWNERS OWN FIVE TO TWELVE RESTAURANTS EACH AND  12  FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN TWO TO FOUR RESTAURANTS. THE  19  REMAINING FRANCHISE OWNERS EACH OWN ONE RESTAURANT.  ACCOUNTING PERIODS  THE COMPANY\u2019S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST WEDNESDAY IN AUGUST. ACCORDINGLY, EACH FISCAL YEAR NORMALLY CONSISTS OF 13 FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR ACCOUNTING PERIODS, ACCOUNTING FOR 364 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. HOWEVER, EVERY FIFTH OR SIXTH YEAR, WE HAVE A FISCAL YEAR THAT CONSISTS OF 53 WEEKS, ACCOUNTING FOR 371 DAYS IN THE AGGREGATE. THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER CONSISTS OF FOUR FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 16 WEEKS, AND THE REMAINING THREE QUARTERS TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE FOUR-WEEK PERIODS, OR 12 WEEKS, IN LENGTH. THE FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER INCLUDES 13 WEEKS IN CERTAIN FISCAL YEARS TO ADJUST FOR OUR STANDARD 52 WEEK, OR 364 DAY, FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE 365 DAY CALENDAR YEAR. COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS.  SAME-STORE SALES  THE RESTAURANT BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO FOOD QUALITY, CONCEPT, LOCATION, PRICE, AND SERVICE, ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE AN EFFECT ON SAME-STORE SALES. OUR SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION MEASURES THE RELATIVE PERFORMANCE OF A CERTAIN GROUP OF RESTAURANTS. A RESTAURANT\u2019S SALES RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE SAME-STORE SALES CALCULATION IN THE QUARTER AFTER A STORE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR SIX CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS. STORES THAT CLOSE ON A PERMANENT BASIS (OR ON A TEMPORARY BASIS FOR REMODELING) ARE REMOVED FROM THE GROUP IN THE QUARTER WHEN OPERATIONS CEASE AT THE RESTAURANT, BUT REMAIN IN THE SAME-STORE GROUP FOR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED QUARTERS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS APPROACH LEADS TO MORE EFFECTIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISONS, NEITHER THE TIME FRAME NOR THE EXACT PRACTICE MAY BE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED BY OTHER RESTAURANT COMPANIES.  35  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 18, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 19, 2018  COMPARABILITY BETWEEN QUARTERS IS AFFECTED BY THE VARYING LENGTHS OF THE QUARTERS AND QUARTERS ENDING AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE CALENDAR YEAR WHEN SEASONAL PATTERNS FOR SALES ARE DIFFERENT.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM  IN JULY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE PROGRAM (THE \"2020 PROGRAM\") AND DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO MANAGEMENT TO DETERMINE THE DETAIL OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WILL COMPRISE THE PROGRAM. THE 2020 PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND REDUCE COST PRINCIPALLY IN OUR MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $60 MILLION AND $70 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2020 PROGRAM. THESE CHARGES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTLAYS, INCLUDING SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS, WILL BE INCURRED AS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THESE INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF FISCAL 2023.

THE TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A NET GAIN OF $8.1 MILLION.  CHANGE IN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSITION OF OUR OPERATING STRUCTURE TO THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS - PLASMA, BLOOD CENTER AND HOSPITAL - AND ACCORDINGLY REORGANIZED OUR OPERATING AND REPORTING STRUCTURE TO ALIGN WITH OUR THREE GLOBAL BUSINESS UNITS. THIS NEW SEGMENT STRUCTURE HAS BEEN REALIGNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE RESPECTIVE MARKETS TO ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF EACH BUSINESS AND EXCLUDES SERVICE. THE DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOWS HAS BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT OUR NEW REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  23  FINANCIAL SUMMARY  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NINE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018% INCREASE/  (DECREASE)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018% INCREASE/  (DECREASE)  NET REVENUES  $258,970  $247,356  4.7%  $749,987  $718,284  4.4%  GROSS PROFIT  $128,050  $111,175  15.2%  $370,956  $306,326  21.1%% OF NET REVENUES  49.4%  44.9%  49.5%  42.6%  OPERATING EXPENSES  $87,143  $82,855  5.2%  $293,612  $246,637  19.0%  OPERATING INCOME  $40,907  $28,320  44.4%  $77,344  $59,689  29.6%% OF NET REVENUES  15.8%  11.4%  10.3%  8.3%  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET  $(3,078  )  $(2,858  )  7.7%  $(12,152  )  $(7,875  )  54.3%  INCOME BEFORE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $37,829  $25,462  48.6%  $65,192  $51,814  25.8%  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $7,934  $7,185  10.4%  $6,290  $17,630  (64.3  )%% OF PRE-TAX INCOME  21.0%  28.2%  9.6%  34.0%  NET INCOME  $29,895  $18,277  63.6%  $58,902  $34,184  72.3%% OF NET REVENUES  11.5%  7.4%  7.9%  4.8%  NET INCOME PER SHARE - BASIC  $0.59  $0.36  63.9%  $1.16  $0.66  75.8%  NET INCOME PER SHARE - DILUTED  $0.58  $0.35  65.7%  $1.13  $0.64  76.6%  NET REVENUES INCREASED  4.7%  AND  4.4%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  .

REVENUE INCREASES IN PLASMA AND HOSPITAL PRIMARILY DROVE THE OVERALL INCREASE IN REVENUE DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  OPERATING INCOME INCREASED FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE PRICING, PRODUCT MIX AND INCREMENTAL SAVINGS FROM BOTH THE 2020 PROGRAM AND THE COMPLEXITY REDUCTION INITIATIVE (THE \"2018 PROGRAM\"). THE GAIN RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAINTREE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  . IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR PLASMA LIQUID SOLUTIONS OPERATIONS TO CSL PARTIALLY OFFSET INCREASES IN OPERATING INCOME DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  MANAGEMENT'S USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  MANAGEMENT USES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, IN ADDITION TO FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\"U.S. GAAP\"), TO MONITOR THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS, MAKE INFORMED BUSINESS DECISIONS, ESTABLISH BUDGETS AND FORECAST FUTURE RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED SUPPLEMENTAL TO, AND NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. CONSTANT CURRENCY GROWTH, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, MEASURES THE CHANGE IN REVENUE BETWEEN THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS USING A CONSTANT CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE.

THIS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN VOLUME OF PLASMA DISPOSABLES DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  . FAVORABLE NEXSYS PCS PRICING AND INCREASES IN SALES OF SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN PLASMA LIQUID SOLUTIONS, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  ON MAY 21, 2019, WE TRANSFERRED TO CSL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE TANGIBLE ASSETS HELD BY HAEMONETICS RELATING TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY. WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLY LIQUID SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS USING CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, HOWEVER, WE EXPECT DECLINES IN OUR PLASMA LIQUIDS REVENUE BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THIS BUSINESS.  BLOOD CENTER  BLOOD CENTER REVENUE INCREASED  0.7%  AND DECREASED  1.1%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  .

THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF APHERESIS PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN SOFTWARE REVENUE AND WHOLE BLOOD DISPOSABLES. THE DECREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECLINES IN WHOLE BLOOD DISPOSABLES AND SOFTWARE REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN APHERESIS PRODUCTS. THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE APHERESIS BUSINESS DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ORDER TIMING, THE BENEFIT OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND TO BE FURTHER COMPOUNDED BY ADDITIONAL DECLINES AS CERTAIN CUSTOMERS CONVERT TO ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF SUPPLY. THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF THE LOSS OF THIS APHERESIS BUSINESS IS AN INCREMENTAL REVENUE DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR AND $17 MILLION IN FISCAL 2021 AS COMPARED WITH FISCAL 2020.  26  HOSPITAL  HOSPITAL REVENUE INCREASED  6.4%  AND  3.8%  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  .

THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH OF DISPOSABLES ASSOCIATED WITH TEG  \u00ae  DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES. IN MAY 2019, WE RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS. THIS CLEARANCE BUILDS ON THE CURRENT INDICATION FOR THE TEG 6S SYSTEM IN CARDIOVASCULAR SURGERY AND CARDIOLOGY PROCEDURES, MAKING IT THE FIRST CARTRIDGE-BASED SYSTEM AVAILABLE IN THE U.S. TO EVALUATE THE HEMOSTASIS CONDITION IN ADULT TRAUMA PATIENTS. THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES DUE TO THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SALES OF OUR ORTHOPAT PRODUCTS EFFECTIVE MARCH 31, 2019.

WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, GROSS PROFIT INCREASED  15.4%  AND  22.3%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE PRICING DRIVEN BY THE ANNUALIZATION OF NEXSYS PCS DEVICE CONVERSIONS, MIX AND INCREMENTAL SAVINGS FROM THE 2020 PROGRAM. THE ABSENCE OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT WERE INCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.

WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED  22.0%  AND  18.7%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE DECREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS MADE IN CLINICAL PROGRAMS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IN ORDER TO SUPPORT FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE USE OF TEG 6S IN ADULT TRAUMA SETTINGS, WHICH WAS RECEIVED IN MAY 2019.  27  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  5.9%  AND  0.7%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  6.5%  AND  1.5%  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE INCREASE DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS, AN INCREASE IN INVESTMENTS AND INCREASES IN BOTH SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND VARIABLE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SAVINGS FROM BOTH THE 2020 PROGRAM AND THE 2018 PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GAIN RECOGNIZED ON THE SALE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAINTREE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PARTIAL OFFSET DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS  WE RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $1.9  MILLION AND  $50.6  MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TRANSFER TO CSL OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE MANUFACTURE OF ANTI-COAGULANT AND SALINE AT OUR UNION, SOUTH CAROLINA FACILITY TO CSL. REFER TO NOTE 4,  DIVESTITURE  , TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS AGREEMENT. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  WE RECORDED OTHER ASSET IMPAIRMENTS TOTALING  $1.9  MILLION.  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE FROM OUR $350.0 MILLION TERM LOAN AND $350.0 MILLION REVOLVING LOAN ENTERED INTO ON JUNE 15, 2018, WHICH CONSTITUTES THE MAJORITY OF EXPENSE, DECREASED BY  $0.3 MILLION  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 DUE TO HIGHER TERM LOAN BORROWINGS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY  $1.4 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BALANCE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  3.0%.  INCOME TAXES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND REPORT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN ADDITION TO THE UNITED STATES. OUR REPORTED TAX RATE IS IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD AS THE FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE TAX RATES THAT DIFFER FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE.  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , WE REPORTED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $7.9 MILLION AND $6.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 21.0% AND 9.6%, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  INCLUDES DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED FROM EXCESS STOCK COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS OF $3.1 MILLION AND $12.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF EARNINGS AND THE IMPACT OF THE DIVESTITURE OF THE UNION LIQUID SOLUTIONS OPERATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. REFER TO NOTE 4,  DIVESTITURE  , TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THIS DIVESTITURE.  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  , WE REPORTED AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $7.2 MILLION AND $17.6 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 28.2% AND 34.0%, RESPECTIVELY. THE TAX RATE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  INCLUDES A DISCRETE STOCK COMPENSATION WINDFALL BENEFIT OF $1.8 MILLION AND $5.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  WAS HIGHER THAN THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT OF $21.2 MILLION RECORDED IN PRETAX INCOME FOR WHICH NO TAX BENEFIT WAS RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE MAINTAINED AGAINST ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE IMPACTED JURISDICTION.  28  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS CERTAIN KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS WE BELIEVE DEPICT OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW POSITION.  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  MARCH 30,  2019  CASH & CASH EQUIVALENTS  $126,417  $169,351  WORKING CAPITAL  $325,883  $340,362  CURRENT RATIO  2.3  2.4  NET DEBT  (1)  $(245,287  )  $(180,769  )  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING (DSO)  59  67  INVENTORY TURNOVER  1.9  2.5  (1)  NET DEBT POSITION IS THE SUM OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LESS TOTAL DEBT.  IN JULY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE 2020 PROGRAM. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL INCUR AGGREGATE CHARGES BETWEEN $60 MILLION AND $70 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2020 PROGRAM. THESE CHARGES, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WILL RESULT IN CASH OUTLAYS, INCLUDING SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS, WILL BE INCURRED AS THE SPECIFIC ACTIONS REQUIRED TO EXECUTE THESE INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY THE END OF FISCAL 2023. DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY INCURRED  $3.9 MILLION  AND  $6.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY,  OF RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND COSTS UNDER THIS PROGRAM.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND PROCEEDS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. WE BELIEVE THESE SOURCES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR EXPECTED CASH OUTLAYS RELATE PRIMARILY TO INVESTMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION OF THE NEXSYS PCS AND PLASMA PLANT CAPACITY EXPANSIONS, SHARE REPURCHASES, CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT AND RESTRUCTURING AND TURNAROUND INITIATIVES.  AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD  $126.4 MILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS HELD IN THE U.S. OR IN COUNTRIES FROM WHICH IT CAN BE REPATRIATED TO THE U.S. ON JUNE 15, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED FOR A  $350.0 MILLION  TERM LOAN AND A $350.0 MILLION  REVOLVING LOAN. INTEREST ON THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING LOAN IS ESTABLISHED USING LIBOR PLUS  1.13%  -  1.75%  , DEPENDING ON OUR LEVERAGE RATIO. UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CERTAIN LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS OTHER CUSTOMARY NON-FINANCIAL AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS. AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , $328.1 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN WITH AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE OF  3.0%  AND $45.0 MILLION  WAS OUTSTANDING ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE ALSO HAD  $25.4 MILLION  OF UNCOMMITTED OPERATING LINES OF CREDIT TO FUND OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS UNDER WHICH THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019.  WE HAVE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF  $4.4 MILLION  REQUIRED DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE RATIOS SPECIFIED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS ALL OTHER BANK COVENANTS AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019.  CASH FLOWS  NINE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS)  DECEMBER 28,  2019  DECEMBER 29,  2018  INCREASE/  (DECREASE)  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $111,811  $138,643  $(26,832  )  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (12,041  )  (102,931  )  90,890  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (142,580  )  (57,623  )  (84,957  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (1)  (124  )  (3,387  )  3,263  NET CHANGE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(42,934  )  $(25,298  )  (1)  THE BALANCE SHEET IS AFFECTED BY SPOT EXCHANGE RATES USED TO TRANSLATE LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, WE HAVE REMOVED THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY THROUGHOUT OUR CASH FLOW STATEMENT, EXCEPT FOR ITS EFFECT ON OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  29  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $26.8 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW DRIVEN LARGELY BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORY BUILD TO SUPPORT THE LAUNCH OF THE NEXSYS PCS DEVICES, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED PAYROLL AND THE IMPACT OF NET INCOME, AS ADJUSTED FOR DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NON-CASH CHARGES. THE WORKING CAPITAL OUTFLOW WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DUE TO THE TIMING OF COLLECTIONS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $90.9 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD DUE TO SPEND RELATED TO THE NEXSYS PCS LAUNCH AND MANUFACTURING CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS IN OUR PLASMA BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. PROCEEDS RECEIVED RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR PLASMA LIQUID SOLUTIONS OPERATIONS AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE AND OTHER ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BRAINTREE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $85.0 MILLION  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , AS COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BORROWINGS, NET OF PAYMENTS, ON OUR CREDIT FACILITIES AND BY INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.  CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH RESPECT TO TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE GENERALLY LIMITED DUE TO OUR LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THEIR DIVERSITY ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. CERTAIN MARKETS AND INDUSTRIES, HOWEVER, CAN EXPOSE US TO CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE PLASMA BUSINESS UNIT, SALES ARE CONCENTRATED WITH SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS. AS A RESULT, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXTENDED TO ANY ONE OF THESE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL CUSTOMERS CAN BE SIGNIFICANT AT ANY POINT IN TIME. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S. INCLUDE SALES TO GOVERNMENT-OWNED OR SUPPORTED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO PAYMENT DELAYS AND LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. PAYMENT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE FINANCIAL STABILITY AND CREDITWORTHINESS OF THOSE COUNTRIES' NATIONAL ECONOMIES.  WE HAVE NOT INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE ALL RECEIVABLES FOR POTENTIAL COLLECTION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING AND REIMBURSEMENT PRACTICES. IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF CUSTOMERS OR THE COUNTRIES' HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DETERIORATE SUCH THAT THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN, ALLOWANCES MAY BE REQUIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS.  INFLATION  WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED. HISTORICALLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION BY IMPROVING OUR MANUFACTURING AND PURCHASING EFFICIENCIES, BY INCREASING EMPLOYEE PRODUCTIVITY AND BY ADJUSTING THE SELLING PRICES OF PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR INFLATION PRESSURES GENERALLY AND RAW MATERIALS INDICES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PROCUREMENT AND PRODUCTION COSTS. INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF PETROLEUM DERIVATIVES COULD RESULT IN CORRESPONDING INCREASES IN OUR COSTS TO PROCURE PLASTIC RAW MATERIALS.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  ,  35.4%  AND  35.3%  , RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR SALES WERE GENERATED OUTSIDE THE U.S., GENERALLY IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, YET OUR REPORTING CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR. WE ALSO INCUR CERTAIN MANUFACTURING, MARKETING AND SELLING COSTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN LOCAL CURRENCY. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES RELATE TO SALES DENOMINATED IN EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CHINESE YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS. WE ALSO HAVE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE RELATED TO MANUFACTURING AND OTHER OPERATIONAL COSTS DENOMINATED IN SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS, MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT. THE YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXPOSURE IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND SOURCING PRODUCTS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.  SINCE OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED YEN, EURO, YUAN AND AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SALES EXCEED THE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND, CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THE YEN, EURO, YUAN OR AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SWISS FRANCS, CANADIAN DOLLARS MEXICAN PESOS AND MALAYSIAN RINGGIT OUR PRIMARY CASH FLOWS RELATE TO PRODUCT COSTS OR COSTS AND EXPENSES OF LOCAL OPERATIONS. WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS RELATIVE TO THESE FOREIGN CURRENCIES, THERE IS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. CONVERSELY, WHENEVER THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS RELATIVE TO THESE CURRENCIES, THERE IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  30  WE HAVE A PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT IS DESIGNED TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THAT PROGRAM INCLUDES THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MINIMIZE, FOR A PERIOD OF TIME, THE UNFORESEEN IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. WE UTILIZE FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY JAPANESE YEN AND EURO, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SWISS FRANCS, AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS, CANADIAN DOLLARS AND MEXICAN PESOS. THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE VOLATILITY OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, BUT BECAUSE WE GENERALLY ENTER INTO FORWARD CONTRACTS ONE YEAR OUT, RATES ARE FIXED FOR A ONE-YEAR PERIOD, THEREBY FACILITATING FINANCIAL PLANNING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THESE CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE FINAL IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON THE LOCAL CURRENCY AMOUNTS HEDGED AND THE ACTUAL LOCAL CURRENCY RESULTS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  STANDARDS TO BE IMPLEMENTED  IN JUNE 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\"FASB\") ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\"ASC\") UPDATE NO. 2016-13, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES (TOPIC 326). ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS INTENDED TO REPLACE THE CURRENT INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS MEASURED AT AMORTIZED COST WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT REFLECTS EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES AND REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF A BROADER RANGE OF REASONABLE AND SUPPORTABLE INFORMATION, INCLUDING FORECASTED INFORMATION, TO DEVELOP CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES. ASC UPDATE NO. 2016-13 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15, INTANGIBLES, GOODWILL AND OTHER - INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE (SUBTOPIC 350-40). THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL ALIGN THE ACCOUNTING IMPLEMENTATION COSTS INCURRED IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE LICENSES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ALL ENTITIES, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING ASC UPDATE NO. 2018-15 IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2019, THE FASB ISSUED ASC UPDATE NO. 2019-12, INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740). THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL IMPROVE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF AND SIMPLIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY REMOVING CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPALS IN TOPIC 740. ASC UPDATE NO. 2019-12 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2020, AND IS APPLICABLE TO US IN FISCAL 2022. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE EFFECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. AS DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION TITLED \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,\u201d THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS THAT, IF THEY NEVER MATERIALIZE OR PROVE INCORRECT, COULD CAUSE OUR RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THESE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, PARTICULARLY THOSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d DISCUSSED UNDER PART II, ITEM 1A BELOW.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) PROVIDER OF VOICE, VIDEO, CHAT, CONTACT CENTER, AND ENTERPRISE-CLASS API SOLUTIONS POWERED BY ONE GLOBAL CLOUD COMMUNICATIONS PLATFORM. FROM OUR PROPRIETARY CLOUD TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ALL THEIR LOCATIONS AND EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCESS TO UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, TEAM COLLABORATION, VIDEO CONFERENCING, CONTACT CENTER, DATA AND ANALYTICS, COMMUNICATION APIS, AND OTHER SERVICES, ENABLING THEM TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND RESPONSIVE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.  OUR CUSTOMERS RANGE FROM SMALL BUSINESSES TO LARGE ENTERPRISES AND THEIR USERS ARE SPREAD ACROSS MORE THAN 150 COUNTRIES. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR UP-MARKET FOCUS ON THE MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMER SECTORS.  WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS THAT ARE SUBSCRIPTION BASED, MADE AVAILABLE AT DIFFERENT RATES VARYING BY THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITIES, SERVICES AND NUMBER OF USERS. WE GENERATE SERVICE REVENUE FROM SOFTWARE SERVICE SUBSCRIPTIONS, PLATFORM USAGE, AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. WE GENERATE PRODUCT REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OFFICE PHONES AND OTHER HARDWARE EQUIPMENT. WE DEFINE A \u201cCUSTOMER\u201d AS ONE OR MORE LEGAL ENTITIES TO WHICH WE PROVIDE SERVICES PURSUANT TO A SINGLE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT. IN SOME CASES, WE MAY HAVE MULTIPLE BILLING RELATIONSHIPS WITH A SINGLE CUSTOMER (FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE WE ESTABLISH SEPARATE BILLING ACCOUNTS FOR A PARENT COMPANY AND EACH OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES).  OUR FLAGSHIP SERVICE IS OUR 8X8 X SERIES, A NEXT GENERATION SUITE OF UCAAS AND CCAAS SOLUTIONS, WHICH CONSIST OF SERVICE PLANS DESIGNATED X1, X2, ETC., THROUGH X8. WITH 8X8 X SERIES, WE PROVIDE GLOBAL VOICE, CHAT, VIDEO AND CONTACT CENTER FUNCTIONALITIES FROM A SINGLE PLATFORM, WITH A SINGLE INTERFACE, IN THE HIGH-END SET OF OUR SERVICE PLANS (X5 THROUGH X8). WE ALSO OFFER MORE BASIC, COST-EFFICIENT UCAAS IN X1 THROUGH X4 AND A STAND-ALONE CCAAS OFFERING CALLED 8X8 CONTACT CENTER. IN JULY 2019, WE ACQUIRED WAVECELL PTE. LTD., AN ASIAN-BASED GLOBAL CPAAS PROVIDER OF SMS, MESSAGING, VOICE AND VIDEO APIS TO ENTERPRISES. ALSO IN JULY 2019, WE LAUNCHED A NEW SELF-SERVICE E-COMMERCE PLATFORM CALLED 8X8 EXPRESS.  PRIOR TO THE LAUNCH OF 8X8 X SERIES IN 2018, OUR CUSTOMERS SUBSCRIBED TO VIRTUAL OFFICE AND VIRTUAL CONTACT CENTER SOLUTIONS. WE HAVE NOW BEGUN MIGRATING THESE CUSTOMERS FROM THESE LEGACY SOLUTIONS TO OUR 8X8 X SERIES PRODUCT SUITE, AND WE INTEND TO ACCELERATE THE PACE OF MIGRATIONS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 AND INTO FISCAL 2021. THESE MIGRATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO INCUR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES COSTS THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, BUT WE BELIEVE WE WILL REALIZE OTHER BENEFITS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PLATFORMS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO SUPPORT.  SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK  OUR  THIRD  QUARTER FISCAL 2020 RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THE FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH IN OUR CLOUD COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE REVENUE, WHICH FOR THE QUARTER WAS  $113.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING REVENUE FROM OUR CPAAS OFFERINGS, AND REFLECTS GROWTH OF  32.2%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR. WE CONTINUED TO SHOW AN INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE ANNUAL SERVICE REVENUE PER CUSTOMER, AS WE ARE SELLING MORE TO MID-MARKET AND ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS.  IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2018, WE DE-EMPHASIZED PROFITABILITY AS A SHORT-TERM CORPORATE GOAL FOCUSED INSTEAD ON MAKING INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE REVENUE GROWTH. THIS DECISION WAS BASED, IN PART, ON OUR BELIEF THAT THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET IS AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN THE SHIFT OF BUSINESSES FROM LEGACY ON-PREMISE SOLUTIONS TO CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY TREND WILL CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2020 AND BEYOND. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IN THE COMPANY'S INTEREST TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH. WITH RECENT SUCCESSES DRIVING GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS, WE ARE ALSO NOW FOCUSED ON MANAGING THE BUSINESS TO ACHIEVE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THIS ENABLES THE COMPANY TO SCALE AND CAPTURE MARKET SHARE DURING THIS PHASE OF INDUSTRY DISRUPTION IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY AND SUPPORT THE COMPANY IN PURSUIT OF ITS PATH TO PROFITABILITY.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ACTIVITIES TO ACQUIRE MORE CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING INVESTING IN OUR DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS, SALES FORCE, E-COMMERCE, AND OUTBOUND MARKETING EFFORTS. WE ALSO INTEND TO CONTINUE INVESTING IN OUR INDIRECT CHANNEL TO ACQUIRE MORE THIRD-PARTY SELLING AGENTS TO HELP SELL OUR SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENTS IN OUR VALUE ADDED RESELLERS (\"VARS\") AND MASTER AGENT PROGRAMS. SHOULD THESE UPFRONT INVESTMENTS NOT RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REVENUE FROM NEW OR EXISTING CUSTOMERS, AND/OR THESE COST REDUCTION AND EFFICIENCY EFFORTS NOT RESULT IN MEANINGFUL SAVINGS, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  COMPONENTS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  SERVICE REVENUE  SERVICE REVENUE CONSISTS OF SOFTWARE SERVICE SUBSCRIPTIONS, PLATFORM USAGE REVENUE, AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE FROM OUR UCAAS, CCAAS AND CPAAS OFFERINGS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR BUSINESS TO INCREASE SERVICE REVENUE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INCREASED SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THROUGH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESSES.  PRODUCT REVENUE  PRODUCT REVENUE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF REVENUES FROM HARDWARE SALES OF IP TELEPHONES IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CLOUD TELEPHONY SERVICE.

WE ALSO ALLOCATE OVERHEAD COSTS SUCH AS  FACILITIES AND IT TO COST OF SERVICE, AS WELL AS TO EACH OF THE OPERATING EXPENSE CATEGORIES. OUR FACILITIES COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE LEASE AND RELATED EXPENSES AND IT COSTS INCLUDE COSTS FOR IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND COMPENSATION OF IT PERSONNEL. WE EXPECT THAT COST OF SERVICE REVENUE WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN FUTURE PERIODS AND VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.

WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO HIRE EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE CAPABILITIES AND SCOPE OF OUR PLATFORM AND ENHANCE THE USER EXPERIENCE. WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE EXPECT THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN FUTURE PERIODS AND VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.  SALES AND MARKETING  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL AND RELATED COSTS, SALES COMMISSIONS, TRADE SHOWS, ADVERTISING AND OTHER MARKETING, DEMAND GENERATION, CHANNEL, AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES AND MARKETING TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN CUSTOMERS ON OUR PLATFORM AND INCREASE OUR BRAND AWARENESS. WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE EXPECT THAT SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN FUTURE PERIODS AND VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL AND RELATED COSTS FOR FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, LEGAL AND GENERAL MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS PROFESSIONAL FEES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR COST STRUCTURE AND ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES, WE EXPECT THAT OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE GROW OUR BUSINESS AND VARY FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, OFFSET BY INCOME EARNED ON OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF STATE MINIMUM TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES. AS WE EXPAND THE SCALE OF OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, ANY CHANGES IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN TAXATION OF SUCH ACTIVITIES MAY INCREASE OUR OVERALL PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE FUTURE. WE HAVE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR OUR U.S. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS, OR NOLS. WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN THIS VALUATION ALLOWANCE UNTIL IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE BENEFIT OF OUR FEDERAL AND STATE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED BY WAY OF EXPECTED FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN THE UNITED STATES.

FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $0.7 MILLION  AND  $0.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THESE TAXES WERE RELATED TO STATE MINIMUM TAXES AND INCOME TAXES FROM OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  (0.6)%  AND (0.5)% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  (0.6)%  EACH OF THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  2018.  WE ESTIMATE OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. IN ESTIMATING THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WE CONSIDER, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ANNUAL PRE-TAX INCOME, PERMANENT TAX DIFFERENCES, THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF PRE-TAX INCOME AND THE APPLICATION AND INTERPRETATIONS OF EXISTING TAX LAWS. WE RECORD THE TAX EFFECT OF CERTAIN DISCRETE ITEMS, WHICH ARE UNUSUAL OR OCCUR INFREQUENTLY, IN THE INTERIM PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR, INCLUDING CHANGES IN JUDGMENT ABOUT DEFERRED TAX VALUATION ALLOWANCES. THE DETERMINATION OF THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE REFLECTS TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFIT GENERATED IN CERTAIN DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. HOWEVER, JURISDICTIONS WITH A YEAR-TO-DATE LOSS WHERE NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $235.2 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS.

BY COMPARISON, AT  MARCH 31, 2019  , WE HAD  $346.5 MILLION  OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS A  $8.1 MILLION  IN DEPOSIT AS RESTRICTED CASH. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND OUR ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED ALL INVESTMENTS AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ON ITS BALANCE SHEET, AS THE COMPANY COULD LIQUIDATE THESE INVESTMENTS AT ANY TIME AND DID NOT LIMIT ITS LIQUIDATION OF INVESTMENTS BY CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE. GIVEN THE RECENT ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES, AND THE ASSOCIATED INCREASED CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO HOLD CERTAIN INVESTMENTS FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS FROM THE REPORTING DATE AND RECORDS THESE INVESTMENTS IN LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES.  PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD CHANGES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  WAS  $62.8 MILLION  , PRIMARILY DUE TO MAKING INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE REVENUE GROWTH. FOR COMPARISON,  $6.7 MILLION  WAS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  .

NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $84.8 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $4.7 MILLION  PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO  $58.9 MILLION  USED IN THE ACQUISITION OF WAVECELL, A  $0.9 MILLION  PAYMENT RELEASED FROM ESCROW HELD FOR MARIANALQ ACQUISITION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, COMBINED WITH PURCHASES OF  $22.9 MILLION  OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT INVESTMENTS AND CAPITALIZED INTERNAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $22.8 MILLION  . THESE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $19.7 MILLION  OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS.

THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  , EXCEPT FOR OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 2 AND 7 OF THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF  OPERATIONS IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A READER OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS WITH A NARRATIVE REPORT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY. THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ATTACHED UNAUDITED CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND OUR ANNUAL  REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, INCLUDING THE  AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO. THE  FOLLOWING DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT  INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SUCH AS STATEMENTS OF OUR PLANS,  OBJECTIVES, EXPECTATIONS, AND INTENTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD  DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS. PLEASE ALSO SEE THE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE AT THE  BEGINNING OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS.  THE DISCUSSIONS OF OUR RESULTS AS PRESENTED IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT INCLUDE USE OF THE NON-GAAP TERM \u201cGROSS MARGIN,\u201d  AS WELL AS OTHER NON-GAAP MEASURES DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL UNDER  THE HEADING \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\u201d GROSS MARGIN  IS DETERMINED BY DEDUCTING THE COST OF SALES FROM OPERATING  REVENUE. COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING DIRECT AND INDIRECT  LABOR, MATERIALS, SERVICES, FIXED COSTS FOR RENT, UTILITIES AND  DEPRECIATION, AND VARIABLE OVERHEAD. GROSS MARGIN SHOULD NOT BE  CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO OPERATING INCOME OR NET INCOME, WHICH  ARE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT GROSS  MARGIN, ALTHOUGH A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS USEFUL AND  MEANINGFUL TO INVESTORS AS A BASIS FOR MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS.  IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH INFORMATION THAT DEMONSTRATES OUR COST  STRUCTURE AND PROVIDES FUNDS FOR OUR TOTAL COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE  USE GROSS MARGIN IN MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND  HAVE HISTORICALLY ANALYZED AND REPORTED GROSS MARGIN INFORMATION  PUBLICLY. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE GROSS MARGIN IN A DIFFERENT  MANNER.  INTRODUCTION  WE WERE INCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1992 AS THE SUCCESSOR TO  LIGHTPATH TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, A NEW MEXICO LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP, FORMED IN 1989, AND ITS PREDECESSOR, INTEGRATED SOLAR  TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, A NEW MEXICO CORPORATION, FORMED IN 1985.  TODAY, LIGHTPATH IS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH MAJOR FACILITIES IN THE  UNITED STATES, THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE  REPUBLIC OF LATVIA.  OUR CAPABILITIES INCLUDE PRECISION MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING  OPTICS AND CUSTOM DESIGNED OPTICS. THESE CAPABILITIES ALLOW US TO  MANUFACTURE OPTICAL COMPONENTS AND HIGHER-LEVEL ASSEMBLIES,  INCLUDING PRECISION MOLDED GLASS ASPHERIC OPTICS, MOLDED AND  DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED ASPHERIC LENSES AND OTHER OPTICAL MATERIALS  USED TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT MANIPULATE LIGHT. WE DESIGN, DEVELOP,  MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE OPTICAL COMPONENTS AND ASSEMBLIES  UTILIZING ADVANCED OPTICAL MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE SERVE A WIDE  AND DIVERSE NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING DEFENSE AND SECURITY,  OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND COMPONENTS, DATACOM/TELECOM, INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY, LIFE SCIENCES, MACHINE VISION AND PRODUCTION  TECHNOLOGY. OUR PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED INTO A VARIETY OF  APPLICATIONS BY OUR BROAD AND DIVERSE CUSTOMER BASE. THESE  APPLICATIONS INCLUDE DEFENSE PRODUCTS, MEDICAL DEVICES, LASER AIDED  INDUSTRIAL TOOLS, AUTOMOTIVE SAFETY APPLICATIONS, BARCODE SCANNERS,  OPTICAL DATA STORAGE, HYBRID FIBER COAX DATACOM, TELECOMMUNICATION  OPTICAL NETWORKS, MACHINE VISION AND SENSORS, AMONG OTHERS. ALL THE  PRODUCTS WE PRODUCE ENABLE LASERS AND IMAGING DEVICES TO FUNCTION  MORE EFFECTIVELY.  SUBSIDIARIES  IN  NOVEMBER 2005,  WE FORMED  LPOI, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, LOCATED IN  JIADING, PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. LPOI PROVIDES SALES AND  SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. IN DECEMBER 2013, WE FORMED LPOIZ, A  WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY LOCATED IN THE NEW CITY DISTRICT, OF THE  JIANGSU PROVINCE, OF THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.  LPOIZ\u2019S 55,000 SQUARE FOOT MANUFACTURING FACILITY (THE  \u201cZHENJIANG FACILITY\u201d) SERVES AS OUR PRIMARY  MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CHINA AND PROVIDES A LOWER COST STRUCTURE  FOR PRODUCTION OF LARGER VOLUMES OF OPTICAL COMPONENTS AND  ASSEMBLIES. LATE IN FISCAL 2019, THIS FACILITY WAS EXPANDED FROM  39,000 TO 55,000 SQUARE FEET TO ADD CAPACITY FOR POLISHING TO  SUPPORT OUR GROWING INFRARED BUSINESS.  IN DECEMBER 2016, WE ACQUIRED ISP, AND ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY,  ISP LATVIA. ISP IS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MANUFACTURER OFFERING A  FULL RANGE OF INFRARED PRODUCTS FROM CUSTOM INFRARED OPTICAL  ELEMENTS TO CATALOG AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE LENS ASSEMBLIES.  HISTORICALLY, ISP\u2019S IRVINGTON FACILITY FUNCTIONED AS ITS  GLOBAL HEADQUARTERS FOR OPERATIONS, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING  MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES, OPTICAL COATINGS, AND OPTICAL AND  MECHANICAL DESIGN, ASSEMBLY, AND TESTING. IN JUNE 2019, WE  COMPLETED THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON FACILITY TO OUR EXISTING  ORLANDO FACILITY AND RIGA FACILITY. ISP LATVIA IS A MANUFACTURER OF  HIGH PRECISION OPTICS AND OFFERS A FULL RANGE OF INFRARED PRODUCTS,  INCLUDING CATALOG AND CUSTOM INFRARED OPTICS. ISP LATVIA\u2019S  RIGA FACILITY FUNCTIONS AS ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITY.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE REFER TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  RECENT ORGANIZATIONAL AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES  TO ENSURE WE FULLY LEVERAGE THE EXPANDED CAPABILITIES AND MANAGE  THE BROADER PRODUCT PORTFOLIO THAT WE NOW HAVE, WE BEGUN  INTRODUCING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES IN JULY 2019. WE CREATED AND  FILLED THE POSITION OF CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER. THIS POSITION  COMBINES ALL OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING, SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS  UNDER ONE LEADER TO ENSURE THE CLOSEST POSSIBLE TIES BETWEEN DEMAND  AND SUPPLY OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL ENSURE THE BEST  COORDINATION BETWEEN TECHNICAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS. THE  POSITION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING ANNUAL PLAN OBJECTIVES,  I.E.  , REVENUES, GROSS MARGIN, CONTROLLABLE OPERATING  INCOME AND RETURN ON ASSET OBJECTIVES. WE HAVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A  PRODUCT MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, WITH A PRODUCT MANAGER FOR EACH OF OUR  MAJOR PRODUCT CAPABILITIES: MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS  AND CUSTOM DESIGNED OPTICS. PRODUCT MANAGEMENT IS PRINCIPALLY A  PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT PROCESS THAT ANALYZES PRODUCTS WITHIN THE  PRODUCT CAPABILITY AREAS AS DEFINED ABOVE. THIS FUNCTION WILL  FACILITATE CHOOSING INVESTMENT PRIORITIES AND ENSURING SUCCESSFUL  PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT. WE HAVE ALSO DEFINED, BUT NOT  FILLED, THE POSITION OF SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, STRATEGIC BUSINESS  ASSESSMENT. THIS PERSON WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR STRATEGICALLY  ALIGNING LIGHPATH\u2019S COMPETENCIES WITH STRATEGIC INDUSTRY  REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, AND WILL MANAGE THE PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  FUNCTION.  21  PRODUCT GROUPS AND MARKETS  IN FISCAL 2019, WE REORGANIZED OUR BUSINESS INTO THREE PRODUCT  GROUPS: PMO, INFRARED PRODUCTS AND SPECIALTY PRODUCTS. THESE  PRODUCT GROUPS ARE SUPPORTED BY OUR MAJOR PRODUCT CAPABILITIES.  MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS, AND CUSTOM DESIGNED  OPTICS.  OUR PMO PRODUCT GROUP CONSISTS OF VISIBLE PRECISION MOLDED OPTICS  WITH VARYING APPLICATIONS. OUR INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP IS COMPRISED  OF INFRARED OPTICS, BOTH MOLDED AND DIAMOND-TURNED, AND THERMAL  IMAGING ASSEMBLIES. THIS PRODUCT GROUP ALSO INCLUDES BOTH  CONVENTIONAL AND CNC GROUND AND POLISHED LENSES. BETWEEN THESE TWO  PRODUCT GROUPS, WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE LENSES FROM  VERY SMALL (WITH DIAMETERS OF SUB-MILLIMETER) TO OVER 300  MILLIMETERS, AND WITH FOCAL LENGTHS FROM APPROXIMATELY 0.4MM TO  OVER 2000MM. IN ADDITION, BOTH PRODUCT GROUPS OFFER BOTH CATALOG  AND CUSTOM DESIGNED OPTICS.  OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCT GROUP IS COMPRISED OF VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS,  SUCH AS OPTICAL SUBSYSTEMS, ASSEMBLIES, AND COLLIMATORS, AND  NON-RECURRING ENGINEERING (\u201cNRE\u201d) PRODUCTS, CONSISTING  OF THOSE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP PURSUANT TO PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  AGREEMENTS THAT WE ENTER INTO WITH CUSTOMERS. TYPICALLY, CUSTOMERS  APPROACH US AND REQUEST THAT WE DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS OR  APPLICATIONS FOR OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS TO FIT THEIR PARTICULAR  NEEDS OR SPECIFICATIONS. THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF ANY SUCH PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT IS OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL.  WE HAVE ALSO ALIGNED OUR MARKETING EFFORTS BY OUR CAPABILITIES  (  I.E.,  MOLDED OPTICS, THERMAL IMAGING OPTICS, AND CUSTOM  OPTICS), AND THEN BY INDUSTRY. WE CURRENTLY SERVE THE FOLLOWING  MAJOR MARKETS: DEFENSE AND SECURITY, OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND  COMPONENTS, DATACOM/TELECOM, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, LIFE SCIENCES,  MACHINE VISION AND PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY. CUSTOMERS IN EACH OF  THESE MARKETS MAY SELECT THE BEST OPTICAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT SUIT  THEIR NEEDS FROM OUR ENTIRE SUITE OF PRODUCTS, AVAILING US TO  CROSS-SELLING OPPORTUNITIES, PARTICULARLY WHERE WE CAN LEVERAGE OUR  KNOWLEDGE BASE AGAINST OUR EXPANDING DESIGN LIBRARY. WITHIN OUR  PRODUCT GROUPS, WE HAVE VARIOUS APPLICATIONS THAT SERVE OUR MAJOR  MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR INFRARED PRODUCTS CAN BE USED FOR GAS  SENSING DEVICES, SPECTROMETERS, NIGHT VISION SYSTEMS, ADVANCED  DRIVER-ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS (\u201cADAS\u201d), THERMAL WEAPON GUN  SIGHTS, AND INFRARED COUNTER MEASURE SYSTEMS, AMONG  OTHERS.  THE PHOTONICS MARKET DRIVES OUR GROWTH AND IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT  APPLICATION AREAS: INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY,  DISPLAY, LIGHTING, PHOTOVOLTAIC, PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY, LIFE  SCIENCES, AND MEASUREMENT AND AUTOMATED VISION. IN 2018, THE MARKET  SIZE FOR THESE APPLICATIONS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL WAS ESTIMATED AT  APPROXIMATELY $556 BILLION. LIGHTPATH HAS PRODUCT APPLICATIONS IN  SIX OF THE EIGHT APPLICATION AREAS, ALL EXCEPT FOR DISPLAYS AND  PHOTOVOLTAIC. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST MARKETS AND MARKETS SURVEY,  THESE SIX APPLICATION AREAS HAD AN ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE OF  APPROXIMATELY $401 BILLION AND ARE GROWING AT A 7% COMPOUND ANNUAL  GROWTH RATE. WITHIN THE LARGER OVERALL MARKETS, WE BELIEVE THERE IS  A MARKET OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION FOR OUR CURRENT PRODUCTS AND  CAPABILITIES. WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE OUR PRODUCTS WILL PROVIDE  SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS AND,  THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO TARGET SPECIFIC APPLICATIONS IN EACH  OF THESE MAJOR MARKETS. IN ADDITION TO THESE MAJOR MARKETS, A LARGE  PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM SALES TO UNAFFILIATED  COMPANIES THAT PURCHASE OUR PRODUCTS TO FULFILL THEIR  CUSTOMERS\u2019 ORDERS, AS WELL AS UNAFFILIATED COMPANIES THAT  OFFER OUR PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN THEIR CATALOGS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO  LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY, KNOW-HOW, ESTABLISHED LOW-COST  MANUFACTURING CAPABILITY AND PARTNERSHIPS TO GROW OUR BUSINESS. OUR  PRODUCT MANAGERS FOCUS ON PURSUING CUSTOMER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES  WHERE OUR DIFFERENTIAL ADVANTAGES COINCIDE WITH KEY CUSTOMER  NEEDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FISCAL SECOND QUARTER: THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019,  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  REVENUES.  REVENUE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $9.6 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 MILLION, OR 12%, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. REVENUE  GENERATED BY INFRARED PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION IN  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.3 MILLION, OR 34%, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE TIMING OF ORDER SHIPMENTS AGAINST A LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL  CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, REVENUE FROM THIS CONTRACT WAS LOWER, AS WE  HAD SHIPPED THE BALANCE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT BEFORE THE RENEWAL  WAS FINALIZED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CUSTOMER  REQUESTED THAT WE ACCELERATE SHIPMENTS THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD  PREVIOUSLY DELAYED IN THE PRECEDING QUARTER BECAUSE OF DELAYS IT  EXPERIENCED FOR OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN; THUS, ORDER  SHIPMENTS RELATED TO THIS LARGE CONTRACT WERE HIGHER IN THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019. ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, THESE ORDERS CANNOT  BE DELAYED BEYOND MARCH 31, 2020 AND, THEREFORE, THE BALANCE OF  THIS ORDER MUST SHIP NEXT QUARTER. REVENUE GENERATED BY PMO  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $3.7 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO $4.1 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $416,000, OR 10%.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN  SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET, AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE  AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS  WAS APPROXIMATELY $885,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN  INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $193,000, OR 28%, COMPARED TO $693,000 IN  THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS  PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL  AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.  22  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $3.9 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $3.5  MILLION IN SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL COST OF  SALES WAS APPROXIMATELY $5.7 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $5.0 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE INCREASES IN GROSS MARGIN AND COST OF SALES  ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASE IN SALES. GROSS MARGIN AS A  PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 41% FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, CONSISTENT WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. GIVEN THE  SHIFT IN REVENUE TOWARD INFRARED PRODUCTS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE  LOWER MARGINS THAN PMO PRODUCTS, THIS ACTUALLY REFLECTS AN OVERALL  IMPROVEMENT IN GROSS MARGINS, DUE TO OUR IMPROVED COST STRUCTURE  AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE IRVINGTON  FACILITY RELOCATION IN JUNE 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) COSTS  WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.2 MILLION FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 13%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $2.5 MILLION IN THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. SG&A  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY  $200,000 OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE RELOCATION OF THE  IRVINGTON FACILITY TO OUR EXISTING ORLANDO FACILITY AND RIGA  FACILITY. THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECTS SAVINGS FROM  THE ABSENCE OF THESE NON-RECURRING COSTS, AS WELL AS REDUCED  PERSONNEL AND OVERHEAD COSTS RESULTING FROM THE RESTRUCTURING  ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON FACILITY. WE EXPECT  FUTURE SG&A COSTS TO CONTINUE TO REFLECT REDUCED OPERATING AND  OVERHEAD COSTS AS A RESULT OF THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR  MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $469,000 IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF 10%, AS COMPARED TO  APPROXIMATELY $519,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THIS DECREASE IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE A  DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRUCTURING PERSONNEL  FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO OUR NEWLY CREATED PRODUCT MANAGEMENT  FUNCTION, FOR WHICH EXPENSES ARE NOW INCLUDED IN SG&A  COSTS.  THIS DECREASE IN  PERSONNEL COSTS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PATENT  APPLIATION FILING EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  APPROXIMATELY $89,000, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $153,000 IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST  EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH  THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019. WE EXPECT THAT INTEREST EXPENSE WILL REMAIN NEAR  CURRENT LEVELS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME, NET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $123,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE, NET, OF APPROXIMATELY  $48,000 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RESULTING  FROM NET GAINS AND LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE  TRANSACTIONS. WE EXECUTE ALL FOREIGN SALES FROM OUR U.S. FACILITIES  AND INTER-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS, PARTIALLY  MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-UNITED STATES CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY  THE CHINESE YUAN AND EURO, ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF EXCHANGE  PREVAILING ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE  TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE YEAR. DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE  INCURRED NET FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTION GAINS OF  APPROXIMATELY $119,000, COMPARED TO NET FOREIGN CURRENCY  TRANSACTION LOSSES OF $50,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR.  INCOME TAXES.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX  EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $322,000, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCOME  TAXES FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN CHINA AND CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES  ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND DECLARED BY LPOIZ DURING  THE QUARTER. WHILE THIS REPATRIATION TRANSACTION RESULTED IN SOME  ADDITIONAL CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES, LPOIZ CURRENTLY QUALIFIES FOR  A REDUCED CHINESE INCOME TAX RATE; THEREFORE, THE TOTAL TAX ON  THOSE EARNINGS WAS STILL BELOW THE NORMAL INCOME TAX RATE. THIS  COMPARES TO A NET INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $23,000  RECORDED FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH WAS COMPRISED  OF A TAX BENEFIT ON LOSSES IN THE U.S. JURISDICTION, OFFSET BY TAX  EXPENSE ON INCOME GENERATED IN CHINA. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE  8,  INCOME  TAXES  , IN THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET INCOME.  NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $769,000, OR $0.03 BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, COMPARED  TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $16,000, OR $0.00 BASIC AND DILUTED  EARNINGS PER SHARE, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE  INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS  COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN SALES, RESULTING IN HIGHER GROSS  MARGIN, COUPLED WITH A DECREASE IN EXPENSES FOR SG&A AND  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES. THESE DIFFERENCES INCREASED OPERATING  INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $863,000 FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. IN  ADDITION, THERE WERE FAVORABLE DIFFERENCES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND  FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS AND LOSSES, OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE  DIFFERENCE OF $345,000 IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES.  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON STOCK SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE 25,837,903  AND 27,361,273 BASIC AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 25,781,941 AND 27,397,239 BASIC  AND DILUTED, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE BASIC COMMON STOCK SHARES, AND  DECREASE IN WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DILUTED COMMON STOCK SHARES, WAS DUE  TO THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014  ESPP AND UPON THE EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS.  23  FISCAL FIRST HALF: SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  REVENUES.  REVENUE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY $17.1  MILLION, AN INCREASE OF LESS THAN 1%, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME  PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. REVENUE GENERATED BY INFRARED  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $9.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, AN INCREASE OF 3%, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $8.7 MILLION IN  THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INFRARED  PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF MOLDED  INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6  MATERIAL. REVENUES FROM SHIPMENTS AGAINST THE LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL  CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS DURING THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2020 WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019.  REVENUE GENERATED BY PMO PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $6.9 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF 5%, AS COMPARED TO  $7.2 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE  DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES  TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE MARKETS, PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND  TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS. REVENUE GENERATED BY OUR SPECIALTY  PRODUCTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 11%, AS COMPARED TO $1.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS  PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL  AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF  SPECIALTY PRODUCTS TO A MEDICAL CUSTOMER, DUE TO TIMING OF  ORDERS.  COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $6.3 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 4%, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $6.6  MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. TOTAL COST OF  SALES WAS APPROXIMATELY $10.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, COMPARED TO $10.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 37% FOR  THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 39% FOR THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES, AND DECREASE IN  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, IS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS  THAT IMPACTED THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WHICH WERE SUBSTANTIALLY  MITIGATED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FIRST, GROSS  MARGINS FOR OUR PMO PRODUCTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER  DUTIES AND FREIGHT CHARGES RESULTING FROM INCREASED TARIFFS  BEGINNING IN JUNE 2019. THESE ADDITIONAL COSTS INCREASED COST OF  SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020; HOWEVER, THESE COSTS  WERE MITIGATED IN THE SECOND QUARTER BY THE STRATEGIES WE  IMPLEMENTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. SECOND, GROSS MARGINS FOR  INFRARED PRODUCTS WERE IMPACTED BY YIELD ISSUES RELATED TO OUR BD6  PRODUCTS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER COSTS DURING THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. YIELDS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS A RESULT OF ACTIONS TAKEN EARLY IN  THE SECOND QUARTER. VOLUMES CONTINUE TO INCREASE FOR OUR BD6-BASED  INFRARED MOLDED PRODUCTS, AND WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD CONVERTING  GERMANIUM-BASED DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS TO OUR BD6  MATERIAL, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE OUR INFRARED  MARGINS OVER TIME.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, SG&A COSTS WERE  APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9%, AS  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. SG&A FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019  INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $291,000 OF NON-RECURRING EXPENSES RELATED  TO THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON FACILITY TO OUR EXISTING ORLANDO  FACILITY AND RIGA FACILITY. THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 REFLECTS  SAVINGS FROM THE ABSENCE OF THESE NON-RECURRING COSTS, AS WELL AS  REDUCED PERSONNEL AND OVERHEAD COSTS RESULTING FROM THE  RESTRUCTURING ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELOCATION OF THE IRVINGTON  FACILITY.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $897,000 IN THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 9%, AS  COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $989,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR  FISCAL YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RESTRUCTURING  OF PERSONNEL FROM PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO OUR NEWLY CREATED PRODUCT  MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, FOR WHICH EXPENSES ARE NOW INCLUDED IN  SG&A. THE DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  INCREASES IN PATENT EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF  FISCAL 2020.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  APPROXIMATELY $188,000, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $298,000 IN THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST  EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH  THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WE ENTERED INTO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019.  OTHER EXPENSE, NET, WAS APPROXIMATELY $393,000 IN THE FIRST HALF OF  FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $387,000 IN THE FIRST HALF  OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM NET LOSSES ON FOREIGN  EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS. WE EXECUTE ALL FOREIGN SALES FROM OUR U.S.  FACILITIES AND INTER-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS,  PARTIALLY MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-UNITED STATES CURRENCIES,  PRIMARILY THE CHINESE YUAN AND EURO, ARE TRANSLATED AT RATES OF  EXCHANGE PREVAILING ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, AND REVENUES AND  EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE FOR THE YEAR.  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE INCURRED NET FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSACTION LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $376,000, COMPARED TO  $388,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  24  INCOME TAXES.  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECORDED INCOME TAX  EXPENSE OF $470,000, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCOME TAXES FROM OUR  OPERATIONS IN CHINA, AND CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH  THE INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND DECLARED BY LPOIZ DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER. THIS COMPARES TO A NET INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $202,000 RECORDED FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH WAS  COMPRISED OF A TAX BENEFIT ON LOSSES IN THE U.S. JURISDICTION,  OFFSET BY TAX EXPENSE ON INCOME GENERATED IN CHINA. PLEASE REFER TO  NOTE 8,  INCOME  TAXES  , IN THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  NET INCOME (LOSS).  NET LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020 WAS APPROXIMATELY  $606,000, OR $0.02 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE, COMPARED TO A  NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $567,000, OR $0.02 BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS  PER SHARE, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE SLIGHT INCREASE  IN NET LOSS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019, IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE  UNFAVORABLE DIFFERENCE OF $673,000 IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME  TAXES, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $529,000 IN OPERATING INCOME,  COUPLED WITH A DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE OF  $111,000.  WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON STOCK SHARES OUTSTANDING WERE TO  25,832,337, FOR BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL  2020, COMPARED TO 25,777,330, FOR BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED, IN THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE  BASIC COMMON STOCK SHARES WAS DUE THE ISSUANCE OF SHARES OF CLASS A  COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP AND UPON THE EXERCISES OF STOCK  OPTIONS AND RSUS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY $12.5  MILLION AND TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.3  MILLION, OF WHICH, GREATER THAN 50% OF OUR CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE  GENERATED IN CHINA AND LATVIA AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.  BEFORE ANY FUNDS CAN BE REPATRIATED FROM CHINA THROUGH DIVIDENDS,  THE RETAINED EARNINGS OF THE LEGAL ENTITY MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 50%  OF ITS REGISTERED CAPITAL. BASED ON RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE END OF THE PRIOR STATUTORY TAX YEAR, LPOIZ  HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.5 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION AND LPOI  DID NOT HAVE ANY EARNINGS AVAILABLE FOR REPATRIATION.  DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE DECLARED AN  INTERCOMPANY DIVIDEND OF $2 MILLION PAYABLE FROM LPOIZ TO US AS ITS  PARENT COMPANY, OF WHICH $1 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID TO US AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE REMAINING $1 MILLION WILL BE PAID TO US IN A  FUTURE PERIOD. THIS DIVIDEND IS FROM EARNINGS ACCUMULATED PRIOR TO  JANUARY 1, 2019. WE CURRENTLY INTEND TO PERMANENTLY INVEST EARNINGS  GENERATED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2019, AND, THEREFORE, HAVE NOT PROVIDED  FOR FUTURE CHINESE WITHHOLDING TAXES ON SUCH RELATED  EARNINGS.  LOANS PAYABLE CONSISTS OF THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN PURSUANT TO THE  AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT. THE AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT ALSO PROVIDES  FOR A BANKUNITED REVOLVING LINE AND A GUIDANCE LINE. AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2019, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN WAS  APPROXIMATELY $5.3 MILLION, AND WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON  THE BANKUNITED REVOLVING LINE OR GUIDANCE LINE.  THE AMENDED LOAN AGREEMENT INCLUDES CERTAIN CUSTOMARY COVENANTS. AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS. FOR  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 12,  LOANS  PAYABLE  , TO THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY  REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE GENERALLY RELY ON CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND EQUITY AND DEBT  OFFERINGS, TO THE EXTENT AVAILABLE, TO SATISFY OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND TO MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO REPAY THE BANKUNITED TERM LOAN.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT COULD RESULT IN THE NEED TO  RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN REVENUE OR A LACK OF  ANTICIPATED SALES GROWTH, INCREASED MATERIAL COSTS, INCREASED LABOR  COSTS, PLANNED PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS NOT BEING  REALIZED, INCREASES IN PROPERTY, CASUALTY, BENEFIT AND LIABILITY  INSURANCE PREMIUMS, AND INCREASES IN OTHER COSTS. WE WILL ALSO  CONTINUE EFFORTS TO KEEP COSTS UNDER CONTROL AS WE SEEK RENEWED  SALES GROWTH. OUR EFFORTS ARE DIRECTED TOWARD GENERATING POSITIVE  CASH FLOW AND PROFITABILITY. IF THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL,  WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. SHOULD CAPITAL NOT BE  AVAILABLE TO US AT REASONABLE TERMS, OTHER ACTIONS MAY BECOME  NECESSARY IN ADDITION TO COST CONTROL MEASURES AND CONTINUED  EFFORTS TO INCREASE SALES. THESE ACTIONS MAY INCLUDE EXPLORING  STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE SALE OF THE COMPANY, THE SALE OF CERTAIN  PRODUCT LINES, THE CREATION OF JOINT VENTURES OR STRATEGIC  ALLIANCES UNDER WHICH WE WILL PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, THE  CREATION OF LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR TECHNOLOGY,  OR OTHER ALTERNATIVES.  CASH FLOWS \u2013 FINANCINGS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $489,000 IN  THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY  $872,000 USED IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH USED IN  FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020  REFLECTED APPROXIMATELY $501,000 IN PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR LOANS  AND FINANCE LEASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY APPROXIMATELY $12,000 IN  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CLASS A COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019 WAS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY $897,000 IN PRINCIPAL  PAYMENTS ON OUR LOANS AND CAPITAL LEASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  APPROXIMATELY $25,000 IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF CLASS A COMMON  STOCK UNDER THE 2014 ESPP AND FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK  OPTIONS.  25  CASH FLOWS \u2013 OPERATING.  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS WAS APPROXIMATELY $938,000 FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO CASH USED IN  OPERATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $398,000 FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019.  THE INCREASE IN  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN INVENTORY, COMPARED TO AN  INCREASE IN INVENTORY DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL  YEAR, AND COLLECTIONS ON OTHER RECEIVABLES DURING THE FIRST SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE ANTICIPATE IMPROVEMENT IN OUR CASH FLOWS  PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IN FUTURE YEARS BASED ON OUR FORECASTED  SALES GROWTH AND ANTICIPATED MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS BASED ON  PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, INCLUDING THE RELOCATION OF OUR IRVINGTON  FACILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MARGINAL INCREASES IN SALES AND  MARKETING AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT  EXPENDITURES.  CASH FLOWS \u2013 INVESTING.  DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE  EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION IN INVESTMENTS  IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION,  INCLUDING EQUIPMENT FINANCED THROUGH CAPITAL LEASES, IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WERE RELATED TO  EXPANSION OF OUR BD6 MATERIAL PRODUCTION AND OUR INFRARED COATING  CAPACITY.  OVERALL, WE  ANTICIPATE THAT THE LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL  2020 WILL BE LOWER THAN IN FISCAL 2019, HOWEVER, THE TOTAL AMOUNT  EXPENDED WILL DEPEND ON OPPORTUNITIES AND  CIRCUMSTANCES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, OUR PRINCIPAL COMMITMENTS CONSISTED OF  OBLIGATIONS UNDER OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES AND DEBT AGREEMENTS.  NO MATERIAL CHANGES OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020  IN OUR CONTRACTUAL CASH OBLIGATIONS TO REPAY DEBT OR TO MAKE  PAYMENTS UNDER OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES, OR IN OUR CONTINGENT  LIABILITIES AS DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE  YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES INVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST  ENTITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OTHER THAN THE POLICY CHANGES DISCLOSED IN NOTE 2,  SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  , TO THE  UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF  PART I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL  CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 FROM THOSE DISCLOSED IN ITEM  7, MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2,  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  , TO THE UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS AND ACCOUNTING CHANGES.  26  HOW WE OPERATE  WE HAVE CONTINUING SALES OF TWO BASIC TYPES: SALES VIA AD-HOC  PURCHASE ORDERS OF MOSTLY STANDARD PRODUCT CONFIGURATIONS (OUR  \u201cTURNS\u201d BUSINESS) AND THE MORE CHALLENGING AND  POTENTIALLY MORE REWARDING BUSINESS OF CUSTOMER PRODUCT  DEVELOPMENT. IN THIS LATTER TYPE OF BUSINESS, WE WORK WITH  CUSTOMERS TO HELP THEM DETERMINE OPTICAL SPECIFICATIONS AND EVEN  CREATE CERTAIN OPTICAL DESIGNS FOR THEM, INCLUDING COMPLEX  MULTI-COMPONENT DESIGNS THAT WE CALL \u201cENGINEERED  ASSEMBLIES.\u201d THIS IS FOLLOWED BY \u201cSAMPLING\u201d SMALL  NUMBERS OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 TEST AND  EVALUATION. THEREAFTER, SHOULD A CUSTOMER CONCLUDE THAT OUR  SPECIFICATION OR DESIGN IS THE BEST SOLUTION TO THEIR PRODUCT NEED;  WE NEGOTIATE AND \u201cWIN\u201d A CONTRACT (SOMETIMES CALLED A  \u201cDESIGN WIN\u201d) \u2013 WHETHER OF A \u201cBLANKET  PURCHASE ORDER\u201d TYPE OR A SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE STRATEGY IS  TO CREATE AN ANNUITY REVENUE STREAM THAT MAKES THE BEST USE OF OUR  PRODUCTION CAPACITY, AS COMPARED TO THE TURNS BUSINESS, WHICH IS  UNPREDICTABLE AND UNEVEN. THIS ANNUITY REVENUE STREAM CAN ALSO  GENERATE LOW-COST, HIGH-VOLUME TYPE ORDERS. A KEY BUSINESS  OBJECTIVE IS TO CONVERT AS MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS TO THE DESIGN WIN  AND ANNUITY MODEL AS IS POSSIBLE. WE FACE SEVERAL CHALLENGES IN  DOING SO.  \u25cf  MAINTAINING AN  OPTICAL DESIGN AND NEW PRODUCT SAMPLING CAPABILITY, INCLUDING A  HIGH-QUALITY AND RESPONSIVE OPTICAL DESIGN ENGINEERING  STAFF;  \u25cf  THE FACT THAT AS  OUR CUSTOMERS TAKE PRODUCTS OF THIS NATURE INTO HIGHER VOLUME,  COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION (FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF MOLDED OPTICS,  THIS MAY BE VOLUMES OVER ONE MILLION PIECES PER YEAR) THEY BEGIN TO  WORK SERIOUSLY TO REDUCE COSTS \u2013 WHICH OFTEN LEADS THEM TO  TURN TO LARGER OR OVERSEAS PRODUCERS, EVEN IF SACRIFICING QUALITY;  AND  \u25cf  OUR SMALL BUSINESS  MASS MEANS THAT WE CAN ONLY OFFER A MODERATE AMOUNT OF TOTAL  PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY BEFORE WE REACH FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED  BY THE NEED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \u2013 IN  OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE OF OUR LIMITED CASH RESOURCES AND CASH FLOW,  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SERVICE EVERY OPPORTUNITY THAT PRESENTS  ITSELF IN OUR MARKETS WITHOUT ARRANGING FOR SUCH ADDITIONAL CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES.  DESPITE THESE CHALLENGES TO WINNING MORE \u201cANNUITY\u201d  BUSINESS, WE NEVERTHELESS BELIEVE WE CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN PROCURING  THIS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF OUR UNIQUE CAPABILITIES IN OPTICAL DESIGN  ENGINEERING THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE ON THE MERCHANT MARKET, A MARKET  THAT WE BELIEVE IS UNDERSERVED IN THIS AREA OF SERVICE OFFERING.  ADDITIONALLY, WE BELIEVE THAT WE OFFER VALUE TO SOME CUSTOMERS AS A  SOURCE OF SUPPLY IN THE U.S. SHOULD THEY BE UNWILLING TO COMMIT TO  PURCHASE THEIR SUPPLY OF A CRITICAL COMPONENT FROM FOREIGN MERCHANT  PRODUCTION SOURCES. FOR INFORMATION REGARDING REVENUE RECOGNITION  RELATED TO OUR VARIOUS REVENUE STREAMS, REFER TO  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K DATED JUNE 30,  2019.  OUR KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS.  USUALLY ON A WEEKLY BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS A NUMBER OF  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE. THESE  INDICATORS CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND  CHALLENGES IN THE BUSINESS CHANGE. THESE INDICATORS ARE USED TO  DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING ACTIONS AND CHANGES. WE BELIEVE THAT  OUR NON-FINANCIAL PRODUCTION INDICATORS, SUCH AS THOSE NOTED, ARE  PROPRIETARY INFORMATION.  FINANCIAL INDICATORS THAT ARE CONSIDERED KEY AND REVIEWED REGULARLY  ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u25cf  SALES  BACKLOG;  \u25cf  REVENUE  DOLLARS AND UNITS BY PRODUCT GROUP; AND  \u25cf  OTHER  KEY INDICATORS.  THESE INDICATORS ARE ALSO USED TO DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING  ACTIONS AND CHANGES AND ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL  BELOW.  27  SALES BACKLOG  WE BELIEVE OUR SALES GROWTH HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE OUR BEST  INDICATOR OF SUCCESS. OUR BEST VIEW INTO THE EFFICACY OF OUR SALES  EFFORTS IS IN OUR \u201cORDER BOOK.\u201d OUR ORDER BOOK EQUATES  TO SALES \u201cBACKLOG.\u201d IT HAS A QUANTITATIVE AND A  QUALITATIVE ASPECT: QUANTITATIVELY, OUR BACKLOG\u2019S PROSPECTIVE  DOLLAR VALUE AND QUALITATIVELY, WHAT PERCENT OF THE BACKLOG IS  SCHEDULED BY THE CUSTOMER FOR DATE-CERTAIN DELIVERY. WE DEFINE OUR  \u201c12-MONTH BACKLOG\u201d AS THAT WHICH IS REQUESTED BY THE  CUSTOMER FOR DELIVERY WITHIN ONE YEAR AND WHICH IS REASONABLY  LIKELY TO REMAIN IN THE BACKLOG AND BE CONVERTED INTO REVENUES.  THIS INCLUDES CUSTOMER PURCHASE ORDERS AND MAY INCLUDE AMOUNTS  UNDER SUPPLY CONTRACTS IF THEY MEET THE AFOREMENTIONED CRITERIA.  GENERALLY, A HIGHER 12-MONTH BACKLOG IS BETTER FOR US.  OUR 12-MONTH BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $19.1  MILLION, AN INCREASE OF 7%, AS COMPARED TO $18.1 MILLION AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018. COMPARED TO THE END OF FISCAL 2019, OUR 12-MONTH  BACKLOG INCREASED BY 12% DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020. BACKLOG GROWTH RATES FOR THE LAST FIVE FISCAL QUARTERS  ARE.  QUARTER  BACKLOG  ($ 000)  CHANGE  FROM PRIOR YEAR END  CHANGE  FROM PRIOR QUARTER END  Q2 2019  $18,145  41%  30%  Q3 2019  $17,137  34%  -6%  Q4 2019  $17,121  33%  0%  Q1 2020  $15,390  -10%  -10%  Q2 2020  $19,095  12%  24%  THE INCREASE IN OUR 12-MONTH BACKLOG FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020 TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS LARGELY DUE TO  THE RENEWAL OF A LARGE ANNUAL CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED  PRODUCTS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, WHICH WE WILL BEGIN SHIPPING  AGAINST IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AFTER SHIPMENTS  AGAINST THE PREVIOUS CONTRACT ARE COMPLETED. THE TIMING OF THIS  RENEWAL IS SIMILAR TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. DURING THE FOURTH  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE BOOKED NEW ANNUAL CONTRACTS FOR MOLDED  INFRARED PRODUCTS.  THESE ANNUAL  CONTRACTS ARE EXPECTED TO RENEW DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE  CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. THE TIMING OF EACH OF THESE ANNUAL CONTRACT  RENEWALS MAY VARY, AND MAY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE BACKLOG LEVELS AT  THE TIME THE ORDERS ARE RECEIVED, AND BACKLOG WILL SUBSEQUENTLY BE  DRAWN DOWN AS SHIPMENTS ARE MADE AGAINST THESE  ORDERS.  WE HAVE EXPERIENCED STRONG DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS USED IN THE  INDUSTRIAL, DEFENSE AND FIRST RESPONDER SECTORS. DEMAND FOR  INFRARED PRODUCTS IS BEING FURTHER FUELED BY INTEREST IN LENSES  MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6 MATERIAL. WE EXPECT TO MAINTAIN MODERATE  GROWTH IN OUR VISIBLE PMO PRODUCT GROUP BY CONTINUING TO DIVERSIFY  AND OFFER NEW APPLICATIONS, WITH A COST COMPETITIVE STRUCTURE. OVER  THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BROADENED OUR CAPABILITIES TO  INCLUDE ADDITIONAL GLASS TYPES AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE MUCH LARGER  LENSES, PROVIDING LONG-TERM OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY  ROADMAP AND MARKET SHARE EXPANSION. BASED ON OUR BACKLOG AND RECENT  QUOTE ACTIVITY, WE EXPECT INCREASES IN REVENUE FROM SALES OF BOTH  MOLDED AND TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2020.  REVENUE DOLLARS AND UNITS BY PRODUCT GROUP  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH REVENUE DOLLARS AND UNITS FOR OUR  THREE PRODUCT GROUPS FOR THE THREE AND SIX-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018.

REVENUE FROM THE PMO PRODUCT GROUP DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  $416,000, OR 10%, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE  IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES TO  CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET, AS WELL AS THE DEFENSE AND  INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. SALES OF PMO UNITS INCREASED BY 20%, AS  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, HOWEVER, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES  DECREASED 25%. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IS DUE TO A  SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS UNIT SALES,  WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE HIGHER VOLUMES AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING  PRICES. REVENUE FROM SALES OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS DECREASED  BY APPROXIMATELY 7%, WHILE UNIT VOLUMES FOR THESE PRODUCTS MORE  THAN DOUBLED FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP INCREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION, OR 34%, FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO SAME QUARTER OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN INFRARED PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE  TIMING OF ORDER SHIPMENTS AGAINST A LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL CONTRACT  FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019, REVENUE FROM THIS CONTRACT WAS LOWER, AS WE HAD  SHIPPED THE BALANCE OF THE EXISTING CONTRACT BEFORE THE RENEWAL WAS  FINALIZED. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CUSTOMER  REQUESTED THAT WE ACCELERATE SHIPMENTS THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD  PREVIOUSLY DELAYED IN THE PRECEDING QUARTER BECAUSE OF DELAYS IT  EXPERIENCED FOR OTHER COMPONENTS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN; THUS, ORDER  SHIPMENTS RELATED TO THIS LARGE CONTRACT WERE HIGHER IN FISCAL  2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, THE BALANCE OF THESE  ORDERS MUST SHIP BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  SALES OF MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR  NEW BD6 MATERIAL, ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS ARE HIGHER IN VOLUME  AND LOWER IN PRICES THAN DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS.  ACCORDINGLY, SALES OF INFRARED UNITS INCREASED BY 91% DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  PERIOD, AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DECREASED 30%. INDUSTRIAL  APPLICATIONS, FIREFIGHTING CAMERAS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY  APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED  DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY OUR THERMAL IMAGING  ASSEMBLIES.  OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REVENUE INCREASED BY $193,000, OR 28%, IN  THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER  OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW  NRE PROJECTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL  MARKETS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  OUR REVENUE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $54,000, OR LESS THAN 1%,  FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR  PERIOD, WITH INCREASES IN INFRARED AND SPECIALTY PRODUCT SALES,  OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN PMO PRODUCT SALES.  REVENUE FROM THE PMO PRODUCT GROUP DECREASED APPROXIMATELY  $343,000, OR 5%, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, AS COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IS PRIMARILY  ATTRIBUTED TO DECREASES IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN THE COMMERCIAL AND  DEFENSE MARKETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SALES TO  CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS. SALES OF  PMO UNITS INCREASED BY 25%, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE  PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, HOWEVER, AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DECREASED 24%,  DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS SALES,  WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE HIGHER VOLUMES AND LOWER AVERAGE SELLING  PRICES. THE UNIT VOLUME FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 MORE THAN DOUBLED, AS COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.  REVENUE GENERATED BY THE INFRARED PRODUCT GROUP INCREASED BY  APPROXIMATELY $273,000, OR 3%, FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020,  AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOR THE  FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, REVENUES FROM SHIPMENTS AGAINST THE  LARGE-VOLUME ANNUAL CONTRACT FOR DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS  WERE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE IN  INFRARED PRODUCT REVENUE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF  MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS MADE WITH OUR NEW BD6  MATERIAL. MOLDED INFRARED PRODUCTS ARE HIGHER IN VOLUME AND LOWER  IN PRICES THAN DIAMOND-TURNED INFRARED PRODUCTS. ACCORDINGLY,  DURING THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, SALES OF INFRARED UNITS  INCREASED BY 59%, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, AND AVERAGE  SELLING PRICES DECREASED 35%. INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS, FIREFIGHTING  CAMERAS AND OTHER PUBLIC SAFETY APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO BE THE  PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE INCREASED DEMAND FOR INFRARED PRODUCTS,  PARTICULARLY OUR THERMAL IMAGING ASSEMBLIES.  IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2020, OUR SPECIALTY PRODUCTS REVENUE  INCREASED BY $124,000, OR 11%, AS COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NEW NRE PROJECTS FOR  CUSTOMERS IN THE MEDICAL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS. THIS INCREASE IS  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS TO A  MEDICAL CUSTOMER, DUE TO TIMING OF ORDERS.  OTHER KEY INDICATORS  OTHER KEY INDICATORS INCLUDE VARIOUS OPERATING METRICS, SOME OF  WHICH ARE QUALITATIVE AND OTHERS ARE QUANTITATIVE. THESE INDICATORS  CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AS THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE  BUSINESS CHANGE. THEY ARE MOSTLY NON-FINANCIAL INDICATORS, SUCH AS  ON-TIME DELIVERY TRENDS, UNITS OF SHIPPABLE OUTPUT BY MAJOR PRODUCT  LINE, PRODUCTION YIELD RATES BY MAJOR PRODUCT LINE, AND THE OUTPUT  AND YIELD DATA FROM SIGNIFICANT INTERMEDIARY MANUFACTURING  PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT THE PRODUCTION OF THE FINISHED SHIPPABLE  PRODUCT. THESE INDICATORS CAN BE USED TO CALCULATE SUCH OTHER  RELATED INDICATORS AS FULLY-YIELDED UNIT PRODUCTION PER-SHIFT,  WHICH VARIES BY THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT AND OUR STATE OF AUTOMATION  IN PRODUCTION OF THAT PRODUCT AT ANY GIVEN TIME. HIGHER UNIT  PRODUCTION PER SHIFT MEANS LOWER UNIT COST AND, THEREFORE, IMPROVED  MARGINS OR IMPROVED ABILITY TO COMPETE, WHERE DESIRABLE, FOR PRICE  SENSITIVE CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. THE DATA FROM THESE REPORTS IS  USED TO DETERMINE TACTICAL OPERATING ACTIONS AND CHANGES.  MANAGEMENT ALSO ASSESSES BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKES BUSINESS  DECISIONS REGARDING OUR OPERATIONS USING CERTAIN NON-GAAP MEASURES.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW UNDER  THE HEADING \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\u201d  29  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE REPORT OUR HISTORICAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP; HOWEVER,  OUR MANAGEMENT ALSO ASSESSES BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKES  BUSINESS DECISIONS REGARDING OUR OPERATIONS USING CERTAIN NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS THAT IS  SUPPLEMENTARY TO OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP; HOWEVER, WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS. AS SUCH,  YOU SHOULD NOT VIEW THESE DISCLOSURES AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR RESULTS  DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THEY ARE NOT NECESSARILY  COMPARABLE TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT OTHER COMPANIES  USE.  EBITDA  EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE USED BY MANAGEMENT, LENDERS,  AND CERTAIN INVESTORS AS A SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE IN THE EVALUATION  OF SOME ASPECTS OF A CORPORATION'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND CORE  OPERATING PERFORMANCE. INVESTORS SOMETIMES USE EBITDA, AS IT ALLOWS  FOR SOME LEVEL OF COMPARABILITY OF PROFITABILITY TRENDS BETWEEN  THOSE BUSINESSES DIFFERING AS TO CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CAPITAL  INTENSITY BY REMOVING THE IMPACTS OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  EBITDA ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE CHANGES IN MAJOR WORKING CAPITAL  ITEMS, SUCH AS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY AND PAYABLES, WHICH CAN ALSO  INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR, OR SOURCE OF, CASH. SINCE  DECISIONS REGARDING CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND FINANCING AND CHANGES IN  WORKING CAPITAL COMPONENTS CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CASH  FLOW, EBITDA IS NOT NECESSARILY A GOOD INDICATOR OF A BUSINESS'S  CASH FLOWS. WE USE EBITDA FOR EVALUATING THE RELATIVE UNDERLYING  PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE OPERATIONS AND FOR PLANNING PURPOSES.

THE INCREASE IN EBITDA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020 WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN, AND LOWER  OPERATING EXPENSES.  OUR EBITDA FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS  APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $1.2  MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN  EBITDA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO  LOWER OPERATING EXPENSES AND IMPROVED OPERATING  PERFORMANCE.  ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THIS COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, FILED WITH THE SEC ON JUNE 11, 2019.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT  TESSCO ARCHITECTS AND DELIVERS INNOVATIVE PRODUCT AND VALUE CHAIN SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT WIRELESS BROADBAND SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH WE SELL PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS IN MANY COUNTRIES, APPROXIMATELY 97% OF OUR SALES ARE MADE TO CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND OFFICE FACILITIES IN HUNT VALLEY, MARYLAND, RENO, NEVADA AND SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS.  THE COMPANY EVALUATES ITS BUSINESS WITHIN TWO SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING CUSTOMER MARKETS:  (1) PUBLIC CARRIERS, THAT ARE GENERALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR BUILDING AND MAINTAINING THE INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEM AND PROVIDE AIRTIME SERVICE TO INDIVIDUAL SUBSCRIBERS; AND (2) VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS, WHICH RESULTS FROM THE CONSOLIDATION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, GOVERNMENT CHANNELS AND PRIVATE SYSTEM OPERATOR MARKETS, AND REFLECTS IMPLEMENTATION OVER THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR OF AN ENHANCED GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY. THIS GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY AND THE CORRESPONDING CONSOLIDATION OF THESE CUSTOMER MARKETS IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE SALES OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS THE CONSOLIDATED MARKETS, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE BETTER COVERAGE TO CUSTOMERS AND TO BETTER ALIGN TERRITORIES WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT CONSISTS OF THE RETAIL MARKET WHICH INCLUDES RETAILERS, INDEPENDENT DEALER AGENTS AND CARRIERS.  WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED INTO FOUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES: BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE; NETWORK SYSTEMS; INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE; AND MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES. BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD, REPAIR AND UPGRADE WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS. SALES OF TRADITIONAL BASE STATION INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS BASE STATION RADIOS, CABLE AND TRANSMISSION LINES AND ANTENNAS ARE IN PART DEPENDENT ON CAPITAL SPENDING IN THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. NETWORK SYSTEMS PRODUCTS ARE USED TO BUILD AND UPGRADE COMPUTING AND INTERNET NETWORKS. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN GROWING OUR OFFERING OF WIRELESS BROADBAND, DISTRIBUTED ANTENNAS SYSTEMS (DAS), NETWORK EQUIPMENT, SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE NOT AS DEPENDENT ON THE OVERALL CAPITAL SPENDING OF THE INDUSTRY. INSTALLATION, TEST AND MAINTENANCE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO INSTALL, TUNE, AND MAINTAIN WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT. THIS CATEGORY IS MADE UP OF SOPHISTICATED ANALYSIS EQUIPMENT AND VARIOUS FREQUENCY, VOLTAGE AND POWER-MEASURING DEVICES, REPLACEMENT PARTS AND COMPONENTS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF TOOLS, HARDWARE AND SUPPLIES REQUIRED BY SERVICE TECHNICIANS.  MOBILE DEVICE ACCESSORIES PRODUCTS INCLUDE CELLULAR PHONE AND DATA DEVICE ACCESSORIES.  OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS LOOKING TO US FOR PRODUCT AND SUPPLY CHAIN SOLUTIONS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS. THE TERMS, AND ACCORDINGLY THE FACTORS, APPLICABLE TO EACH RELATIONSHIP OFTEN DIFFER. AMONG THESE FACTORS ARE THE STRENGTH OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S OR SUPPLIER\u2019S BUSINESS, THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE, INCLUDING PRICE STABILITY, CHANGING CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER REQUIREMENTS, AND OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT THE CUSTOMER OR SUPPLIER AND TO CONTINUALLY DEMONSTRATE THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH OUR CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED ARE TYPICALLY OF LIMITED DURATION, TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON SEVERAL MONTHS OR OTHERWISE RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE. OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY WIRELESS CARRIER CONSOLIDATION OR THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY IS COMPETITIVE AND FRAGMENTED AND IS COMPRISED OF SEVERAL NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS. IN ADDITION, MANY MANUFACTURERS SELL DIRECT. BARRIERS TO ENTRY FOR DISTRIBUTORS ARE RELATIVELY LOW, PARTICULARLY IN THE MOBILE DEVICES AND ACCESSORIES MARKET, AND THE RISK OF NEW COMPETITORS ENTERING THE MARKETPLACE IS HIGH. CONSOLIDATION OF LARGER WIRELESS CARRIERS HAS AND WILL MOST LIKELY CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMER BASE. OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS IS SUBJECT TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND CHALLENGES. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR STRENGTH IN SERVICE, THE BREADTH AND DEPTH OF OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM, INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE, AND OUR LARGE CUSTOMER BASE AND PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH APPROXIMATELY 400 MANUFACTURERS, PROVIDE US WITH A SIGNIFICANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OVER NEW ENTRANTS TO THE MARKETPLACE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 8.3% COMPARED WITH THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCREASED BY 1.9%.  REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET INCREASED BY 12.5%.  REVENUES IN THE VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECLINED 3.6%, IN PART BECAUSE WE ARE NOT YET REALIZING THE FULL BENEFITS OF OUR SALES STRATEGY REFINEMENTS. REVENUES IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 27.4%. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF CONTINUED OVERALL SOFTNESS IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 25.6% COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 20.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 16.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET DECREASED FROM 13.6% TO 11.9% DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED FROM 24.5% TO 24.0%. THIS DECLINE WAS DUE TO A CHANGE IN PRODUCT MIX. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.5% TO 8.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS, LARGELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE MARKET SOFTNESS AND THE DISCONTINUANCE OF SEVERAL OEM PHONE DEVICES. TOTAL INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS WERE $4.3 MILLION AND $1.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT OFTEN DIFFER FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $1.0 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED FROM 18.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TO 19.0% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DUE TO LOWER REVENUES.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.1 MILLION  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND $0.6 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES WERE LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED A $2.6 MILLION NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE HAD BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $446,800 AND $478,400 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $247,900 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $367,900 FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 16.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO 20.8% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS THE RESULT OF THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDING NON-RECURRING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO A CHANGE IN TAX LAW AND A REDUCTION IN THE GROSS BALANCE OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST, DUE TO A LAPSE IN THE RELATED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. NET INCOME DECREASED 285.7% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 284.4% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019  TOTAL REVENUES.  REVENUES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED 10.8% COMPARED WITH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. REVENUE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 3.2%. REVENUES IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED BY 2.8% AND 3.4%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PROJECT-ORIENTED NATURE OF THIS BUSINESS. SEVERAL LARGE CUSTOMERS ADJUSTED THEIR FORECASTS OR PUSHED OUT THEIR PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. REVENUES IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT DECREASED BY 26.7%. THE DECLINE IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF OVERALL SOFTNESS IN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER REVENUES FROM ONE OF OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT RETAIL CUSTOMERS FOLLOWING ITS CHANGE IN BUSINESS MODEL AND SUBSEQUENT TRANSITION OF ITS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  TOTAL GROSS PROFIT.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 19.8% COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME COMBINED WITH THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS. OVERALL GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 20.2% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 18.1% IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WITHIN OUR COMMERCIAL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN IN OUR PUBLIC CARRIER MARKET AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS AND INTEGRATORS MARKET DECREASED FROM 13.2% TO 12.3%, AND 24.5% TO 24.1%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO CHANGES IN CUSTOMER MIX. WITHIN OUR RETAIL SEGMENT, GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED FROM 19.7% TO 13.4 % IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND INVENTORY WRITE-OFFS.  AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER THE HEADING \u201cBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT,\u201d OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO EARN REVENUES AND GROSS PROFITS FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS WHICH OFTEN DIFFER  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR EACH RELATIONSHIP. AGREEMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS ON WHICH THESE RELATIONSHIPS ARE BASED TYPICALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OBLIGATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SPECIFIC PRODUCT PURCHASE OR SALE, ARE OF LIMITED DURATION, AND ARE TERMINABLE BY EITHER PARTY UPON RELATIVELY SHORT NOTICE. WE HAVE BEEN AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE PAST BY THE LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS HABITS OF SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL AGAIN BE SO AFFECTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE FUTURE.  SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.  TOTAL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED BY $5.6 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED FROM 18.6% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, TO 19.5% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OVERALL REVENUES AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $1.6 MILLION INCREASE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THESE DECREASES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $2.6 MILLION IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE, $2.0 MILLION IN REWARDS EXPENSE, AND $1.9 MILLION IN FREIGHT EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED A $0.5 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RELATED TO SEVERANCE EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AND A $2.6 MILLION NON-CASH GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE AN APPROPRIATE RESERVE BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE ALSO EVALUATE THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF PROSPECTIVE AND CURRENT CUSTOMERS AND MAKE DECISIONS REGARDING EXTENSION OF CREDIT TERMS TO SUCH CUSTOMERS BASED ON THIS EVALUATION. WE INCURRED BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $474,200 AND $1,499,700 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  INTEREST, NET.  NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED FROM $667,100 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO $911,700 FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND INTEREST EXPENSE UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q). WE EXPECT THIS HIGHER LEVEL OF INTEREST EXPENSE TO CONTINUE FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL QUARTERS.  INCOME TAXES, NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FROM 22.1% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 TO 22.2% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. NET INCOME DECREASED 248.2% AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 249.2% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2019  DECEMBER 30, 2018  CASH FLOW (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(2,998,800)  $3,254,400  CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (6,831,700)  (4,286,300)  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  9,801,000  1,014,100  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(29,500)  $(17,800)  WE USED $3.0 MILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED WITH NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THIS FISCAL 2020 OUTFLOW WAS DUE TO A NET LOSS, NET OF DEPRECIATION AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $4.3 MILLION USED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH USED IN BOTH PERIODS WAS DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES LARGELY COMPRISED OF INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $9.8 MILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $1.0 MILLION PROVIDED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE UTILIZED OUR ASSET BASED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND 2019, LEADING TO A CASH INFLOW OF $15.0 MILLION AND $6.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THOSE PERIODS. WE HAD CASH OUTFLOWS OF $5.1 MILLION DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF BOTH FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, DUE TO CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS.  ON OCTOBER 19, 2017, THE COMPANY AND ITS PRIMARY OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, AS CO-BORROWERS, ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AS A LENDER (THE \u201cAMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d), WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED THE TERMS OF A PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND WHICH RESULTED IN, AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY\u2019S BORROWING LIMIT TO UP TO $75 MILLION, FROM THE PREVIOUS BORROWING LIMIT OF UP TO $35 MILLION.  IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE BORROWING LIMIT, AND AMONG OTHER MODIFICATIONS, THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT EXTENDED THE APPLICABLE MATURITY DATE TO OCTOBER 19, 2021. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, BORROWINGS UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TOTALED $29.4 MILLION; THEREFORE, WE THEN HAD $45.6 MILLION AVAILABLE, SUBJECT TO THE BORROWING BASE LIMITATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE OTHER APPLICABLE TERMS OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. BORROWINGS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT ACCRUE INTEREST AT THE RATES, AND THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY A MONTHLY COMMITMENT FEE, AS ALSO DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE ENTERING INTO OF THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER COMPANY AFFILIATE BORROWERS UNDER THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND OTHER SUBSIDIARIES, REFERRED TO COLLECTIVELY AS THE LOAN PARTIES, EXECUTED AND DELIVERED TO SUNTRUST BANK, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, A REAFFIRMATION AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE LOAN PARTIES UNDER THE GUARANTY AND SECURITY AGREEMENT PREVIOUSLY DELIVERED BY THE LOAN PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS PREVIOUSLY EXISTING (INCLUDING THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GUARANTY BY THE LOAN PARTIES NOT OTHERWISE BORROWERS AND THE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GRANT BY THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER LOAN PARTIES OF A CONTINUING FIRST  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS, AND ON ALL DOCUMENTS, INSTRUMENTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, LETTER OF CREDIT RIGHTS, AND ALL PROCEEDS) WERE RATIFIED AND CONFIRMED AS RESPECTS THE OBLIGATIONS ARISING FROM TIME TO TIME UNDER THE SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED FOR PURSUANT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE HAVE MADE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010. A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.20 PER SHARE WAS PAID IN NOVEMBER 2019. ON JANUARY 21, 2020, OUR BOARD DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.02 PER SHARE, PAYABLE ON FEBRUARY 26, 2020 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF FEBRUARY 12, 2020.  ANY FUTURE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY CORRESPONDING RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES REMAINS SUBJECT TO FURTHER DETERMINATION FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH, PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, OUR POLICY IS TO APPLY EXCESS AVAILABLE CASH TO REDUCE THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING FROM TIME TO TIME ON OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR INCREASED FOCUS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL QUARTERS ON BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES FOR SALES TO OUR PUBLIC CARRIER CUSTOMERS LED TO THE RECENT EXPANSION OF OUR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AND HAS AT TIMES RESULTED IN INCREASED BORROWINGS AND DEPENDENCE ON THAT FACILITY. WE EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE, ALTHOUGH AT PRESENT WE HAVE NO PLANS FOR ANY FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE FACILITY.  IF WE WERE TO UNDERTAKE AN ACQUISITION OR OTHER MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES THAT REQUIRE FUNDS IN EXCESS OF EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD LOOK TO SOURCES OF FUNDING FROM ADDITIONAL CREDIT FACILITIES, DEBT AND/OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS.  IN ADDITION, OUR LIQUIDITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DECREASING REVENUES AND PROFITS RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR A REDUCTION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY OUR CUSTOMERS, OR BY THE WEAKENED FINANCIAL CONDITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS, IN EACH CASE AS A RESULT OF A DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  A DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, ALL MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS NECESSARY TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR SUCH PERIODS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q. ALL SUCH ADJUSTMENTS ARE OF A NORMAL RECURRING NATURE. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR INTERIM PERIODS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON PIONEERING THE DEVELOPMENT OF BIOPRINTED HUMAN TISSUES THAT EMULATE HUMAN BIOLOGY AND DISEASE. WE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING OUR  IN VIVO  LIVER TISSUES TO TREAT END-STAGE LIVER DISEASE AND A SELECT GROUP OF LIFE-THREATENING, ORPHAN DISEASES, FOR WHICH THERE ARE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS OTHER THAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION.  RECENT EVENTS  ON DECEMBER 13, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TARVEDA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (\u201cTARVEDA\u201d), A PRIVATELY OWNED BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, AND OPAL MERGER SUB, INC. (\u201cOPAL\u201d), A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OURS. THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, UPON THE TERMS AND SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, OPAL WILL MERGE WITH AND INTO TARVEDA, WITH TARVEDA AS THE SURVIVING CORPORATION, BECOMING A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF OURS. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF TARVEDA CAPITAL STOCK WILL BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE WILL ISSUE, AND TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE, IN A TAX-FREE EXCHANGE, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK SUCH THAT TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE COMBINED COMPANY ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT) AND OUR SECURITYHOLDERS WILL OWN APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE COMBINED COMPANY ON A FULLY DILUTED BASIS (AS DEFINED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT). THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE EXCHANGE RATIO FOR TARVEDA\u2019S CAPITAL STOCK ARE SUBJECT TO UPWARD AND DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT BASED ON OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. IF OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS BELOW $22 MILLION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR ADJUSTING THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO FORMER TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS. AS A RESULT, TARVEDA\u2019S SECURITY HOLDERS MAY RECEIVE ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS MERGER CONSIDERATION, AND CONSEQUENTLY OUR SECURITYHOLDERS MAY BE FURTHER DILUTED AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. IF OUR NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS ABOVE $22 MILLION, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR ADJUSTING THE EXCHANGE RATIO TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK ISSUED TO FORMER TARVEDA SECURITYHOLDERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MERGER AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEBT OF EACH OF THE PARTIES. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON OTHER ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL, AND, TO THE EXTENT THESE ASSUMPTIONS PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, TARVEDA\u2019S SECURITYHOLDERS MAY RECEIVE A LARGER OR SMALLER PERCENTAGE OF THE COMBINED COMPANY\u2019S PRO FORMA FULLY DILUTED CAPITALIZATION. IF TARVEDA\u2019S NET CASH BALANCE AT THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER IS BELOW $15 MILLION, WE MAY ELECT TO NOT CONSUMMATE THE MERGER.  22  THE MERGER IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING APPROVAL BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF THE ISSUANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE MERGER  , AS WELL  AS  A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT OF OUR COMMON SHARES. WE ANTICIPATE THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE  FISCAL  FOURTH QUARTER OF 2020. THE MERGER AGREEMENT CONTAINS CERTAIN TERMINATION RIGHTS FOR BOTH US AND TARVEDA, AND FURTHER PROVIDES THAT, UPON TERMINATION O  F THE MERGER AGREEMENT UNDER SPECIFIED CIRCUMSTANCES, EITHER PARTY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE OTHER PARTY A TERMINATION FEE RANGING BETWEEN $1.0 MILLION (PLUS REIMBURSEMENT OF $0.3 MILLION OF EXPENSES) AND $2.0 MILLION (PLUS REIMBURSEMENT OF $0.5 MILLION O  F EXPENSES), DEPENDING ON THE CAUSE OF THE TERMINATION.  PRIOR TO EXECUTION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT, WE SOLICITED BIDS FROM POTENTIAL PURCHASERS FOR OUR OPERATING ASSETS, WHICH WE HAD SOUGHT TO SELL OR OTHERWISE DISPOSE OF IN ONE OR MORE STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THAT PROCESS, WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH LIFENET HEALTH (\u201cLIFENET\u201d) ON NOVEMBER 7, 2019 TO SELL CERTAIN EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY OF OUR SAMSARA SCIENCES, FOR $1.5 MILLION IN CASH, WHICH WAS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME. IN ADDITION, ON JANUARY 26, 2020, WE AND TARVEDA AGREED TO AMEND THE MERGER AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE THAT WE WOULD BE CREDITED WITH $1.5 MILLION FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING THE NUMBER OF SHARES TO BE ISSUED TO TARVEDA STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER IF WE DO NOT SELL OR TRANSFER OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND REMAINING ASSETS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER. OUR REMAINING ASSETS FOLLOWING THESE ACTIONS WILL CONSIST PRIMARILY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTEREST RECEIVABLES, RESTRICTED CASH AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS RELATED TO OUR CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION, OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, OUR LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, OUR REMAINING ASSETS, OUR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET AND THE MERGER AGREEMENT WITH TARVEDA. IN ADDITION, THE MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TERMINATED, EXCEPT FOR SIX GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL.  AS A RESULT OF THE SALE TRANSACTION WITH LIFENET, ASIDE FROM THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, REMAINING ASSETS, AND LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, ALL OF OUR BUSINESS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MERGER WILL BE THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY TARVEDA IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE MERGER, IF THE MERGER CLOSES. ACCORDINGLY, BECAUSE OF THE PENDING MERGER WITH TARVEDA AND THE ACTIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORICAL OPERATING RESULTS ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CLOSE THE PENDING MERGER WITH TARVEDA ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IN A TIMELY MANNER OR AT ALL.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES, AND JUDGMENTS  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, THE MOST CRITICAL OF WHICH ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  EXPENSE,  THE VALUATION OF IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  , AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS  . WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN. BESIDES THE ESTIMATES IDENTIFIED ABOVE THAT ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, WE MAKE MANY OTHER ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES. ALL ESTIMATES, WHETHER OR NOT DEEMED CRITICAL, AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AS WELL AS DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE ALSO BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. MATERIALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS CAN OCCUR AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES KNOWN, EVEN FOR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT ARE NOT DEEMED CRITICAL.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SINCE MARCH 31, 2019, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CHANGES MADE UPON ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) 2016-02, LEASES (\u201cASC 842\u201d) AND THE RELATED SUPPLEMENTAL ASUS.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 DECREASED 66% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO A $0.2 MILLION DECREASE IN REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND A $0.3 MILLION DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE. WE HAD NO GRANT REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION IN PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AS WE REDUCED OUR ACTIVITIES DURING THE QUARTER.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE  TO THE WIND-DOWN OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO OUR LIVER TISSUES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. IN ADDITION, WE SOLD  PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS AND RELATED PRODUCTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RESERVED.

THIS ACTION CAUSED A $1.6 MILLION REDUCTION OF PERSONNEL RELATED COSTS, A $0.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN LAB SUPPLY COSTS, A $0.7 MILLION REDUCTION IN FACILITIES COSTS, AND A $0.6 MILLION REDUCTION IN ALL OTHER COSTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S AVERAGE FULL-TIME RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAFF DECREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF FORTY-FOUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO AN AVERAGE OF ZERO FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  .

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS RELATED TO LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENT WRITE-OFFS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EARLY TERMINATION OF OUR LEASE AND $0.3 MILLION OF SEVERANCE RELATED COSTS DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER IN CONNECTION WITH RESTRUCTURING THE BUSINESS FOLLOWING OUR DECISION TO PURSUE OUR STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES. THESE ACTIONS CAUSED A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN CORPORATE COSTS, A $0.6 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS, A $0.4 MILLION INCREASE IN ALLOCATED FACILITIES COSTS, WHICH WERE OFFSET BY A $0.1 MILLION DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT WAS EIGHT FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO TWENTY-THREE FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 CONSISTING OF $1.2 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF SAMSARA ASSETS, $0.5 MILLION OF GAIN ON OUR LEASE TERMINATION, $0.1 MILLION OF INCOME FROM THE SALE OF OTHER ASSETS, AND $0.1 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME. OTHER INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND CONSISTED OF $0.2 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME, OFFSET BY A $0.1 MILLION LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS. INTEREST INCOME DECREASED FROM THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE YIELDS AND INVESTMENT BALANCES.  COMPARISON OF THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).

PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 INCREASED 20% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO A $0.4 MILLION INCREASE IN SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS AND LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION DECREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDED THE RECOGNITION OF THE $0.5 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE UP-FRONT FEE REFERENCED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN PRODUCT REVENUES OCCURRED AFTER OUR CUSTOMERS LEARNED THAT WE INTENDED TO CEASE OFFERING PRIMARY HUMAN LIVER CELLS. GRANT REVENUE DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AS WE CEASED ACTIVITIES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  25  COSTS AND EXPENSES  COST OF REVENUES  COST OF PRODUCT AND SERVICE REVENUES, WHICH REFLECTS EXPENSES RELATED TO MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AND DELIVERING SERVICES WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO  A $0.2 MILLION WRITE-OFF OF INVENTORY RELATED TO THE WIND-DOWN OF OUR COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES RELATED TO OUR LIVER TISSUES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE  LOWER SALES FROM LIVER TISSUE RESEARCH SERVICES VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

IN ADDITION, WE ALSO INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $0.8 MILLION OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS RELATED TO LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENT WRITE-OFFS IN CONNECTION WITH THE EARLY TERMINATION OF OUR LEASE. THESE ACTIONS CAUSED A $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN PERSONNEL RELATED COSTS, A $1.1 MILLION INCREASE IN CORPORATE COSTS, A $0.5 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS, AND A $0.4 MILLION INCREASE IN FACILITIES COSTS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT WAS FOURTEEN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO TWENTY-FOUR FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  26  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 CONSISTING OF $1.1 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE SALE OF SAMSARA ASSETS, $0.5 MILLION OF GAIN ON LEASE TERMINATION, $0.5 MILLION OF INCOME FROM THE SALE OF OTHER ASSETS AND $0.5 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME. OTHER INCOME WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF INTEREST INCOME. INTEREST INCOME WAS COMPARABLE TO THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019.  FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  UNTIL OUR RECENT DECISION TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES AND MERGE WITH TARVEDA, WE HAD PRIMARILY DEVOTED OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY TO PRODUCE AND STUDY LIVING TISSUES THAT EMULATE KEY ASPECTS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY AND DISEASE, RAISING CAPITAL AND BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE. FOLLOWING THE DECISION TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, ULTIMATELY LEADING TO THE DECISION TO MERGE WITH TARVEDA, WE HAVE  TAKEN STEPS TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES AND EXTEND OUR CASH RUNWAY, INCLUDING REDUCING  ALL COMMERCIAL AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LABORATORY ACTIVITIES, EXCEPT FOR SALES OF PRIMARY HUMAN CELLS OUT OF INVENTORY, NEGOTIATING AN EXIT FROM OUR LONG-TERM FACILITY LEASE, SELLING LAB EQUIPMENT AND INVENTORY, AND REDUCING OUR WORKFORCE TO THE MINIMUM LEVEL NECESSARY TO  EXPLORE AND SUPPORT THESE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES AND MAINTAIN OUR CORE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, LICENSES AND COLLABORATIONS WITH RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND UNIVERSITIES, AND TO MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE DELIVER IN THE PROPOSED MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $30.5 MILLION AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $276.7 MILLION. WE ALSO HAD NEGATIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $11.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $36.5 MILLION AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $260.8 MILLION.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $31.1 MILLION AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $2.4 MILLION, RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $28.7 MILLION. AT MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $38.6 MILLION AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.8 MILLION, RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $34.8 MILLION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A SUMMARY OF THE PRIMARY SOURCES AND USES OF CASH FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(11,673  )  $(15,298  )  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  728  (34  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  4,935  6,830  NET DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $(6,010  )  $(8,502  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY $11.7 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $15.3 MILLION USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS $3.6 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH USAGE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED ENTIRELY TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN THE NET LOSS LESS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, RESULTING FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S RESTRUCTURING AND REDUCTION OF HEADCOUNT, AS THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN WORKING CAPITAL BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS WAS $0.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION OF CASH USAGE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.9 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $6.8 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. FINANCING IN BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH AT-THE-MARKET (\u201cATM\u201d) OFFERINGS.  27  OPERATIONS FUNDING REQUIREMENTS  THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE SALE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH PUBLIC AND ATM OFFERINGS, AND FROM REVENUE DERIVED FROM GRANTS AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS, COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENTS, PRODUCT SALES AND RESEARCH-BASED SERVICES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLAN AND AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES, WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS AS CURRENTLY PLANNED FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  ASIDE FROM THE MAINTENANCE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO, LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, REMAINING ASSETS, AND LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET, OUR REMAINING CASH REQUIREMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE MERGER INCLUDING FEES PAYABLE TO FINANCIAL ADVISORS, CONSULTING FEES, LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING SUPPORT, INSURANCE PREMIUMS, KEY EMPLOYEE RETENTION, SEVERANCE AND CHANGE OF CONTROL BENEFITS AND ONGOING COMPENSATION OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SIX GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL THAT REMAIN WITH US THROUGH THE DATE THE SALE TRANSACTION IS COMPLETED, IF THE MERGER CLOSES. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE INCURRING APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION IN TRANSACTION RELATED COSTS AND $3.5 MILLION IN SEVERANCE RELATED COSTS TO COMPLETE THE MERGER.  WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 (FILE NO. 333-222929), OR THE 2018 SHELF, THAT REGISTERED $100,000,000 OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK, WARRANTS AND UNITS, OR ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOREGOING, WHICH EXPIRES ON FEBRUARY 22, 2021. ON MARCH 16, 2018, WE FILED A PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT TO THE 2018 SHELF TO REGISTER THE SALE OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT MAY BE ISSUED IN AT-THE-MARKET OFFERINGS PURSUANT TO AN EQUITY OFFERING SALES AGREEMENT WE ENTERED INTO WITH TWO INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS AS OF THE SAME DATE. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE SOLD 6,087,382 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN AT-THE-MARKET OFFERINGS, WITH NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5.0 MILLION UNDER THE 2018 SHELF.  BASED ON OUR USE OF THE 2018 SHELF THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE CAN OFFER AN AGGREGATE OF $81.3 MILLION IN FUTURE OFFERINGS UNDER THE 2018 SHELF, INCLUDING THE $31.3 MILLION REMAINING AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE THROUGH ITS AT-THE-MARKET PROGRAM, PRIOR TO ITS EXPIRATION DATE ON FEBRUARY 22, 2021.  WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY FURTHER FINANCING ACTIVITIES PENDING THE COMPLETION OF THE MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  HAVING INSUFFICIENT FUNDS MAY REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH RIGHTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGY OR PURSUE OR CONSUMMATE A STRATEGIC TRANSACTION ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE CHOOSE. FAILURE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE FINANCING COULD EVENTUALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE AS A GOING CONCERN. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES, THERE WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL DILUTION TO OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY INCURRING DEBT FINANCING, THE TERMS OF THE DEBT MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CASH PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS COVENANTS AND SPECIFIC FINANCIAL RATIOS THAT MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.  ON JUNE 25, 2019, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE LETTER FROM THE LISTING QUALIFICATIONS STAFF OF THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) INDICATING THAT, BASED UPON THE CLOSING BID PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE LAST 30 CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, WE NO LONGER MEET THE REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM CLOSING BID PRICE OF $1 PER SHARE, AS SET FORTH IN NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5450(A)(1). ON DECEMBER 26, 2019, WE OBTAINED AN ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PERIOD OF 180 CALENDAR DAYS BY ELECTING TO TRANSFER TO THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE PERIOD OFFERED ON THAT MARKET. TO QUALIFY, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MEET THE CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENT FOR MARKET VALUE OF PUBLICLY HELD SHARES AND ALL OTHER INITIAL LISTING STANDARDS FOR THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. IN CONNECTION WITH OUR PROPOSED MERGER WITH TARVEDA, WE ARE ALSO SEEKING TO EFFECT A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, WHICH WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE PRIOR APPROVAL OF OUR STOCKHOLDERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT OR MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE OTHER LISTING REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR US TO MAINTAIN THE LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET. OUR FAILURE TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE DURING THIS SECOND COMPLIANCE PERIOD COULD RESULT IN DELISTING AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THE MERGER WITH TARVEDA.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD 130,497,563 TOTAL ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.  IN ADDITION, OUR 2008 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 896,256 SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK AND THE 2012 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO 28,553,986 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH 6,547,442 OPTIONS AND 7,015,674 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS REMAIN OUTSTANDING AND 10,482,484 SHARES REMAIN AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, ADVISORY BOARD MEMBERS, EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS.

WE HAVE CERTAIN WARRANTS AND OPTIONS OUTSTANDING BUT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO RECEIVE SUFFICIENT PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS UNLESS AND UNTIL THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES ARE REGISTERED, AND/OR ALL RESTRICTIONS ON TRADING, IF ANY, ARE REMOVED, AND IN EITHER CASE THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE APPLICABLE EXERCISE PRICES OF THE OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "ORGANOVO HOLDINGS, INC.", "CIK": 1497253, "Date": "2020-02-10T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ONVO", "Name": "Organovo Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE MKT", "SIC": 2836.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 271488943.0, "key": "20200210ONVO", "labelr1": 2.9411764705882213, "labelr2": -5.714285714285704, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.58731556, "prof1": 0.41268438, "return1&2": 1.0260504201680671, "return1&2&3": 1.0260504201680671, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0260504201680671, "return2": 1.057142857142857, "return1": 0.9705882352941178, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 2.9411764705882253, "cumulative_return1": 0.18873623901898928, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3680, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9631920252341655, "cumreturn1b": 0.8867144657880915, "cumreturn1c": 0.9808624349124604, "cumreturndow": 1.0334973100638951, "cumreturnsp500": 1.030863913530317}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3691, "level_0": 3787, "index": 19545, "text": "ITEM 2.

OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY WAS FORMED IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA ON JULY 13, 1993, AND WAS A CLOSED-END INVESTMENT COMPANY LICENSED BY THE SBA  AS AN SBIC. THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY MADE EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN AND PROVIDED LOANS TO, SMALL BUSINESSES TO FINANCE THEIR GROWTH,  EXPANSION, AND DEVELOPMENT. UNDER APPLICABLE SBA REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS RESTRICTED TO INVESTING ONLY IN QUALIFIED SMALL  BUSINESSES AS CONTEMPLATED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT ACT OF 1958. AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT  COMPANY ACT, THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE WAS TO PROVIDE ITS SHAREHOLDERS WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF INCOME, WITH CAPITAL  APPRECIATION AS A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE. THE COMPANY MADE ITS FIRST INVESTMENT IN A SMALL BUSINESS IN OCTOBER 1996.  15  IN  MAY 2014 THE COMPANY EFFECTIVELY CEASED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY CONSENTED TO A COURT ORDER APPOINTING THE SBA AS RECEIVER OF THE  COMPANY TO MARSHAL AND LIQUIDATE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER ALL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS. THAT ORDER ALSO ENTERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR  OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ON BEHALF OF THE SBA, AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE AMOUNT OF $11,770,722. THE SBA WAS APPOINTED  RECEIVER EFFECTIVE MAY 28, 2014.  OVER  THE COURSE OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY WAS LIMITED TO THE LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSETS BY THE  RECEIVER AND THE PAYMENT OF THE PROCEEDS THEREFROM TO THE SBA AND FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE RECEIVERSHIP. THE SBIC LICENSE GRANTED  TO THE COMPANY BY THE SBA WAS REVOKED BY THE SBA EFFECTIVE MARCH 20, 2017. ON JUNE 28, 2017, THE RECEIVERSHIP WAS TERMINATED.  THE FINAL ORDER SPECIFICALLY STATED THAT \u201cCONTROL OF WATERSIDE SHALL BE UNCONDITIONALLY TRANSFERRED AND RETURNED TO ITS  SHAREHOLDERS C/O RORAN CAPITAL, LLC (\u201cRORAN\u201d) UPON NOTIFICATION OF ENTRY OF THIS ORDER.  UPON  TERMINATION OF THE RECEIVERSHIP, RORAN TOOK POSSESSION OF ALL BOOKS AND RECORDS MADE AVAILABLE TO IT BY THE SBA. WITH NO ASSETS  AND NO SBIC LICENSE FROM THE SBA, NO INCOME, AND LIABILITIES, AT THAT TIME, IN EXCESS OF $10,000,000, IT BECAME CLEAR TO THE COMPANY  THAT CONTINUING TO OPERATE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY WAS IMPOSSIBLE. THE COMPANY AND RORAN ENTERED IN TO A CONVERTIBLE  LOAN AGREEMENT ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2017, AS AMENDED, TO FUND THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPENSES WHILE IT SOUGHT A NEW BUSINESS TO  UNDERTAKE OR TO MERGE WITH AN EXISTING BUSINESS. THE NEW BOARD HAS CONTINUED TO WORK TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT GOAL.  THE  COMPANY IS NO LONGER OPERATING AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT. THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED AND  INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE, QUALIFIED PROFESSIONALS AND PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO BRING THE COMPANY CURRENT IN ITS SEC FILINGS  AND AUDITS. THE COMPANY FILED ALL DELINQUENT SEC FILINGS AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES  THAT AS OF JUNE 28, 2017, IT CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY SO IT DID NOT FILE AS A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2017. INSTEAD, THE COMPANY FILED A FORM 10-K FOR THAT PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE FILING OF THAT 10-K,  ON JANUARY 18, 2018, THE COMPANY FILED WITH THE SEC AN APPLICATION PURSUANT TO SECTION 8(F) OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940  FOR AN ORDER DECLARING THAT THE COMPANY HAS CEASED TO BE A REGISTERED INVESTMENT COMPANY. IN RESPONSE TO THAT FILING, THE SEC  ISSUED TO THE COMPANY COMMENTS IN A LETTER DATED MAY 16, 2018. THE COMPANY RESPONDED TO THOSE COMMENTS WITH THE FILING OF AN AMENDED  APPLICATION ON JUNE 4, 2018. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS QUARTERLY STATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED A FIFTH AMENDED APPLICATION  AND EXPECTS RESOLUTION SOON.  FROM  TIME-TO-TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d), OR OTHER  STANDARD-SETTING BODIES, RELATING TO THE TREATMENT AND RECORDING OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTING TRANSACTIONS. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED  HEREIN, THE MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THESE RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT  ON THE FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IN PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF  CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING  THE REPORTING PERIODS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES ARE ESTIMATES FOR WHICH (A) THE NATURE OF THE ESTIMATE IS MATERIAL DUE TO THE LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVITY AND  JUDGMENT NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS OR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF SUCH MATTERS TO CHANGE AND (B) THE IMPACT  OF THE ESTIMATE ON FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS MATERIAL.  16  THESE  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS BEAR THE RISK OF CHANGE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES ATTACHED  TO THESE ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS, AND CERTAIN ESTIMATES OR ASSUMPTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE OR VALUE.  MANAGEMENT  BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE IN RELATION TO THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TAKEN AS A WHOLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT  THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  MANAGEMENT  REGULARLY EVALUATES THE KEY FACTORS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DEVELOP THE ESTIMATES UTILIZING CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, CHANGES  IN FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS. AFTER SUCH EVALUATIONS, IF DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THOSE  ESTIMATES ARE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.  ACTUAL  RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  WHILE  OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 OF OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT, WE BELIEVE THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL TO THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES USED IN THE PREPARATION  OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASSUMPTION  AS A GOING CONCERN  MANAGEMENT  PREPARES THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON THE BASIS THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH CONTEMPLATES  CONTINUITY OF OPERATIONS, THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS, AND LIQUIDATION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. HOWEVER,  GIVEN OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL POSITION AND LACK OF LIQUIDITY, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  CONVERTIBLE  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY BIFURCATES CONVERSION OPTIONS FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS AND ACCOUNTS FOR THEM AS FREE-STANDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS IF CERTAIN CRITERIA ARE MET. THE CRITERIA INCLUDE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH (A) THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS  OF THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT ARE NOT CLEARLY AND CLOSELY RELATED TO THE ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS AND RISKS OF THE HOST  CONTRACT, (B) THE HYBRID INSTRUMENT THAT EMBODIES BOTH THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AND THE HOST CONTRACT IS NOT RE-MEASURED  AT FAIR VALUE UNDER OTHERWISE APPLICABLE GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS  AS THEY OCCUR AND (C) A SEPARATE INSTRUMENT WITH THE SAME TERMS AS THE EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A DERIVATIVE  INSTRUMENT. AN EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS WHEN THE HOST INSTRUMENT IS DEEMED TO BE CONVENTIONAL, AS THAT TERM IS DESCRIBED UNDER  APPLICABLE GAAP.  WHEN  THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTIONS SHOULD NOT BE BIFURCATED FROM THEIR HOST INSTRUMENTS, DISCOUNTS  ARE RECORDED FOR THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF CONVERSION OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THE INSTRUMENTS BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE EMBEDDED  IN THE INSTRUMENT.  BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE  THE  ISSUANCE OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT ISSUED BY THE COMPANY (DESCRIBED IN NOTE 3 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) GENERATED A BENEFICIAL  CONVERSION FEATURE (\u201cBCF\u201d), WHICH ARISES WHEN A DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITY IS ISSUED WITH AN EMBEDDED CONVERSION OPTION  THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO THE INVESTOR OR IN THE MONEY AT INCEPTION BECAUSE THE CONVERSION OPTION HAS AN EFFECTIVE STRIKE PRICE THAT  IS LESS THAN THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK AT THE COMMITMENT DATE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE BCF BY ALLOCATING THE  INTRINSIC VALUE OF THE CONVERSION OPTION, WHICH IS THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AVAILABLE UPON CONVERSION MULTIPLIED BY  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE CONVERSION PRICE PER SHARE AND THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMON STOCK PER SHARE ON THE COMMITMENT  DATE, RESULTING IN A DISCOUNT ON THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT (RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL).  17  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  THE  COMPANY FOLLOWS PARAGRAPH 825-10-50-10 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION FOR DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AND HAS ADOPTED PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cPARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37\u201d)  TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE  IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP), AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENTS. TO INCREASE CONSISTENCY AND COMPARABILITY IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES, PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37  ESTABLISHES A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE  (3) BROAD LEVELS. THE THREE (3) LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DEFINED BY PARAGRAPH 820-10-35-37 ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.  LEVEL  1: QUOTED MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  2: PRICING INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS INCLUDED IN LEVEL 1, WHICH ARE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  OBSERVABLE AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  LEVEL  3: PRICING INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND NOT CORROBORATED BY MARKET DATA.  FINANCIAL  ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED LEVEL 3 WHEN THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED USING PRICING MODELS, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGIES OR  SIMILAR TECHNIQUES AND AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT MODEL ASSUMPTION OR INPUT IS UNOBSERVABLE.  THE  FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY GIVES THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  AND THE LOWEST PRIORITY TO UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. IF THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE THE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FALL WITHIN  MORE THAN ONE LEVEL DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE CATEGORIZATION IS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT OF THE INSTRUMENT.  TRANSACTIONS  INVOLVING RELATED PARTIES CANNOT BE PRESUMED TO BE CARRIED OUT ON AN ARMS-LENGTH BASIS, AS THE REQUISITE CONDITIONS OF COMPETITIVE,  FREE-MARKET DEALINGS MAY NOT EXIST. REPRESENTATIONS ABOUT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES, IF MADE, SHALL NOT IMPLY THAT THE  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS WERE CONSUMMATED ON TERMS EQUIVALENT TO THOSE THAT PREVAIL IN ARM\u2019S-LENGTH TRANSACTIONS UNLESS  SUCH REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE SUBSTANTIATED.  DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS AND INCOME TAXES PROVISION  THE  COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 OF THE FASB ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION. PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13  WHICH ADDRESSES THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER TAX BENEFITS CLAIMED OR EXPECTED TO BE CLAIMED ON A TAX RETURN SHOULD BE RECORDED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13, THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION  ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON  THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED  BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT (50%) LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.  PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DE-RECOGNITION, CLASSIFICATION, INTEREST, AND PENALTIES ON INCOME TAXES, ACCOUNTING  IN INTERIM PERIODS AND REQUIRES INCREASED DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED  INCOME TAX BENEFITS ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF PARAGRAPH 740-10-25-13.  THE  ESTIMATED FUTURE TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  BALANCE SHEETS, AS WELL AS TAX CREDIT CARRY-BACKS AND CARRY-FORWARDS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REVIEWS THE RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED  TAX ASSETS RECORDED ON ITS BALANCE SHEETS AND PROVIDES VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS MANAGEMENT DEEMS NECESSARY.  MANAGEMENT  MAKES JUDGMENTS AS TO THE INTERPRETATION OF THE TAX LAWS THAT MIGHT BE CHALLENGED UPON AN AUDIT AND CAUSE CHANGES TO PREVIOUS  ESTIMATES OF TAX LIABILITY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OPERATES WITHIN MULTIPLE TAXING JURISDICTIONS AND IS SUBJECT TO AUDIT IN  THESE JURISDICTIONS. IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION, ADEQUATE PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL YEARS. IF ACTUAL  TAXABLE INCOME BY TAX JURISDICTION VARIES FROM ESTIMATES, ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES OR REVERSALS OF RESERVES MAY BE NECESSARY.  18  MANAGEMENT  ASSUMES THAT THE REALIZATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RESULTING FROM ITS NET OPERATING LOSS (\u201cNOL\u201d)  CARRYFORWARDS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES THAT MAY BE OFFSET AGAINST FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME WAS NOT CONSIDERED MORE LIKELY  THAN NOT AND ACCORDINGLY, A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE OFFSETS THE POTENTIAL TAX BENEFITS OF THE NET LOSS CARRY-FORWARDS. MANAGEMENT  MADE THIS ASSUMPTION BASED ON (A) THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES AND PRESENTLY HAS NO REVENUE-PRODUCING BUSINESS, (B)  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND (C) ITS ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT ITS DAILY OPERATIONS BY WAY OF A PUBLIC  OR PRIVATE OFFERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.  COMPARISON  OF THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018  DURING  THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY OPERATIONS, AND THEREFORE, THERE  WERE NO REVENUES. EXPENSES WERE LIMITED TO MAINTAINING THE COMPANY IN GOOD STANDING AND STAYING CURRENT, RESPECTIVELY, IN ITS  FILING OBLIGATIONS WITH THE SEC.  ADMINISTRATIVE  EXPENSE  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $19,655 AND $21,876 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEE EXPENSE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE EFFICIENT USE OF PROFESSIONALS.  PROFESSIONAL  FEES TOTALED $32,452 AND $30,100 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEE EXPENSE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FEES EXPENDED IN CONVERTING THE ISSUER FROM A 1940 ACT COMPANY TO A 1934 ACT COMPANY.  INTEREST  EXPENSE  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $7,239 AND $28,412 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  DUE TO THE LOAN FORGIVENESS OF THE JUDGEMENT PAYABLE WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE.  INTEREST  EXPENSE TOTALED $29,900 AND $49,577 FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  DUE TO THE LOAN FORGIVENESS OF THE JUDGEMENT PAYABLE WHICH REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE.  NET  LOSS  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $26,895 AND $50,288 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS  WAS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  WE  REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $62,352 AND $79,677 DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS WAS  DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  19  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE INCURRED RECURRING OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN FISCAL 2018 AND THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, AND WE  EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR OPERATING LOSSES AND NEGATIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEAR FUTURE. WE HAVE OBTAINED  FUNDING THROUGH A CONVERTIBLE LOAN FACILITY OF UP TO $250,000 TO MEET OUR MOST CRITICAL CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND OF THIS  AMOUNT, WE HAVE DRAWN APPROXIMATELY $190,768 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE  LOAN FACILITY MATURES ON JUNE  19, 2020.  AS  A RESULT OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON OUR FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019, DO NOT CONTAIN ANY ADJUSTMENTS FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY. IN RESPONSE TO OUR COMPANY\u2019S CASH NEEDS, WE RAISED  FUNDING AS DESCRIBED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS RAISED WILL BE USED FOR OUR FUTURE INVESTING AND OPERATING  CASH FLOW NEEDS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS OF FINANCING.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S  PLANS  WE  PLAN TO SEEK, INVESTIGATE, AND CONSUMMATE A MERGER OR OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATION, PURCHASE OF ASSETS OR OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTION  (I.E., A MERGER) WITH A CORPORATION, PARTNERSHIP, LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY OR OTHER OPERATING BUSINESS ENTITY, OR ENTER INTO  A NEW BUSINESS (COLLECTIVELY, A \u201cBUSINESS TARGET\u201d) DESIRING THE PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY REPORTING  AND PUBLICLY HELD CORPORATION. WE HAVE NO OPERATING BUSINESS, AND CONDUCT MINIMAL OPERATIONS NECESSARY TO MEET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  OUR ABILITY TO COMMENCE ANY OPERATIONS IS CONTINGENT UPON OBTAINING ADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES.  WE  ARE NOT CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. THE COSTS OF INVESTIGATING AND ANALYZING BUSINESS  COMBINATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE PAID WITH MONEY BORROWED FROM RORAN.  DURING  THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO (I) FILING OF EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS; AND, (II) IDENTIFYING AND  CONSUMMATING A TRANSACTION WITH A BUSINESS TARGET. WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH THE USE OF FUNDS BORROWED  FROM RORAN, OR OTHER AMOUNTS TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OTHER INVESTORS.  WE  MAY CONSIDER A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION  INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING  FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND NEEDS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION  OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING  MARKET FOR ITS SHARES, WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH  MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  ZINDEL  ZELMANOVITCH IS OUR PRESIDENT, SECRETARY, AND OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. MR. ZELMANOVITCH IS ONLY REQUIRED TO DEVOTE A SMALL  PORTION OF HIS TIME TO OUR AFFAIRS ON A PART-TIME OR AS-NEEDED BASIS. NO COMPENSATION HAS BEEN PAID TO MR. ZELMANOVITCH FOR HIS  SERVICES AS AN OFFICER AND DIRECTOR. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HIRING ANY FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES AS LONG AS WE ARE SEEKING AND EVALUATING  BUSINESS TARGETS.  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD ONLY $10,333 CASH ON HAND. SINCE WE HAVE NO REVENUE OR PLANS TO GENERATE ANY REVENUE, WE WILL BE DEPENDENT  UPON LOANS TO FUND EXPENSES INCURRED IN EXCESS OF OUR CASH. ALSO, RELATED PARTY OBLIGATIONS TOTALING $224,781, WHICH INCLUDES  CONVERTIBLE NOTE OUTSTANDING AND ACCRUED INTEREST PAYABLE, ARE DUE AND PAYABLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THERE  ARE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION,  CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES  THAT ARE MATERIAL TO INVESTORS.  20", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "WATERSIDE CAPITAL CORP", "CIK": 924095, "Date": "2020-02-11T00:00:00", "Ticker": "WSCC", "Name": "Waterside Capital Corp", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": null, "Business": "VA", "Incorporated": "VA", "IRS": 541694665.0, "key": "20200211WSCC", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -35.622317596566525, "labelr3": 33.11111111111112, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6456295, "prof1": 0.3543705, "return1&2": 1.356223175965665, "return1&2&3": 0.9071626132570338, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9071626132570338, "return2": 1.356223175965665, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 0.6688888888888889, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.294000897023162, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3691, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9896921072603869, "cumreturn1b": 0.8775743081840846, "cumreturn1c": 0.9870610214357165, "cumreturndow": 1.040176437749702, "cumreturnsp500": 1.040549896383786}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3699, "level_0": 3795, "index": 76682, "text": "ITEM 2  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS  22", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Isoray, Inc.", "CIK": 728387, "Date": "2020-02-12T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ISR", "Name": "Isoray Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE MKT", "SIC": 3841.0, "Business": "WA", "Incorporated": "MN", "IRS": 411458152.0, "key": "20200212ISR", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": -1.075268817204302, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 4.3478260869565135, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6347147, "prof1": 0.36528534, "return1&2": 1.010752688172043, "return1&2&3": 1.010752688172043, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9668069191210846, "return2": 1.010752688172043, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 0.9565217391304348, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.2759260563243823, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3699, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.006403151232598, "cumreturn1b": 0.8831935491972297, "cumreturn1c": 0.9655409152036998, "cumreturndow": 1.0384804864390251, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0360389728060393}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3708, "level_0": 3806, "index": 667, "text": "ITEM 2.

RECENT  HIGHLIGHTS  \u25cf  ON JANUARY 29, 2020 WE ANNOUNCED THE PUBLICATION OF PREVIOUSLY RELEASED INTERIM CLINICAL DATA IN THE FEBRUARY 2020 ISSUE OF PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL, GLIOMA.  THE ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS RESULTS FROM THE FIRST 22 PATIENTS OF OUR ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDY INVESTIGATING THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT OF VAL-083 WITH RADIATION THERAPY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME (\u201cGBM\u201d) BEING CONDUCTED AT SUN YAT-SEN UNIVERSITY CANCER CENTER (\u201cSYSUCC\u201d).  \u25cf  ON NOVEMBER 22, 2019 AT THE SOCIETY FOR NEURO-ONCOLOGY (\u201cSNO\u201d) ANNUAL MEETING WE PRESENTED POSITIVE INTERIM CLINICAL DATA IN TWO POSTERS UPDATING RESULTS FROM OUR TWO ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF GBM.  IN ADDITION, WE HOSTED A KEY OPINION LEADER (\u201cKOL\u201d) EVENT WHICH INCLUDED OUR SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD (\u201cSAB\u201d) AS WELL MEMBERS OF OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM.  THE KOL EVENT FEATURED OUR SAB AND MANAGEMENT IN A PANEL DISCUSSION OF OUR GBM CLINICAL STUDIES. A RECORDING AND TRANSCRIPT OF THE KOL EVENT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE \u201cPUBLICATIONS AND ABSTRACTS\u201d TAB OF THE \u201cNEWS & MEDIA\u201d SECTION OF OUR WEBSITE, LOCATED AT WWW.DELMARPHARMA.COM.  THE  UPDATED CLINICAL DATA WE PRESENTED AT SNO INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.  \u25cf  THE FIRST POSTER OUTLINED THE OPEN-LABEL, PHASE 2 STUDY OF VAL-083 AS A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, UNMETHYLATED GBM.  \u25cf  THE SECOND POSTER OUTLINED INTERIM DATA FROM TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS RECEIVING VAL-083 IN THE OPEN-LABEL, PHASE 2 STUDY IN RECURRENT AND ADJUVANT UNMETHYLATED GBM SETTINGS.  22  \u25cf  ON  AUGUST 16, 2019, WE COMPLETED A FINANCING RAISING APPROXIMATELY $6.6 MILLION IN NET PROCEEDS.  WE BELIEVE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THIS OFFERING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COMPLETE FULL ENROLLMENT  IN ALL THREE PATIENT GROUPS OF OUR TWO ONGOING PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES WHICH IS EXPECTED  TO OCCUR BY THE FOURTH QUARTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020.  VAL-083  CLINICAL STUDIES  WE  ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING VAL-083, A NOVEL DNA-TARGETING AGENT FOR THE TREATMENT OF GBM AND POTENTIALLY OTHER SOLID TUMORS, INCLUDING  OVARIAN CANCER. OUR RECENT RESEARCH HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION AND  ITS POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS BY FOCUSING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS EXHIBIT BIOLOGICAL FEATURES  THAT MAKE THEM RESISTANT TO, OR UNLIKELY TO RESPOND TO, CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THERAPIES. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING  VAL-083\u2019S ACTIVITY IN GBM IS INDEPENDENT OF THE MGMT METHYLATION STATUS ALLOWS US TO FOCUS PATIENT SELECTION BASED ON THIS  IMPORTANT BIOMARKER.  THE  EVALUATION OF MGMT PROMOTER METHYLATION STATUS HAS INCREASINGLY BECOME COMMON PRACTICE IN THE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT OF GBM. IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK (\u201cNCCN\u201d) UPDATED ITS GUIDELINES FOR THE STANDARD TREATMENT  OF GBM BASED ON MGMT METHYLATION STATUS. WE BELIEVE THESE GUIDELINES PROVIDE FOR ENHANCED OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO CAPITALIZE ON  VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION BY UTILIZING MGMT METHYLATION AS A BIOMARKER TO OPTIMIZE PATIENT SELECTION FOR OUR  NOVEL DNA-TARGETING AGENT TO FOCUS ON THE MAJORITY OF GBM PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH MGMT-UNMETHYLATED TUMORS.  OUR  CURRENT PRIORITY IS TO LEVERAGE THIS RESEARCH, AND VAL-083\u2019S UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION, TO EFFICIENTLY ADVANCE VAL-083  FOR THE MOST PROMISING INDICATIONS, INCLUDING.  \u25cf  MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  GBM, CURRENTLY COMPRISING TWO ONGOING SEPARATE PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES FOR.  O  GBM  PATIENTS IN TWO STUDY ARMS AT MDACC.  \u25a0  AS  ADJUVANT THERAPY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING CHEMORADIATION; AND  \u25a0  IN  AVASTIN  \u00ae  -NAI\u0308VE RECURRENT GBM PATIENTS;  O  NEWLY  DIAGNOSED GBM PATIENTS (ONGOING STUDY AT SYSUCC); AND  \u25cf  POTENTIAL  FUTURE INDICATIONS INCLUDING OVARIAN CANCER, NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (\u201cNSCLC\u201d),  AND OTHER SOLID TUMOR INDICATIONS.  23  PHASE  2 STUDY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, WE INITIATED A SINGLE ARM, BIOMARKER DRIVEN, OPEN-LABEL PHASE 2 STUDY IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM  PATIENTS AT SYSUCC IN GUANGZHOU, CHINA. THE STUDY IS BEING CONDUCTED UNDER OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH GUANGXI WUZHOU PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY.  IN THIS PHASE 2 STUDY, VAL-083 IS BEING COMBINED WITH RADIOTHERAPY  AS A POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMORADIATION WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE IN PATIENTS WITH MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM. THE GOALS  OF THE STUDY ARE TO CONFIRM THE SAFETY OF THE THREE-DAY VAL-083 DOSING REGIMEN IN COMBINATION WITH RADIOTHERAPY AND TO INVESTIGATE  EFFICACY OUTCOMES OF THE COMBINATION OF VAL-083 AND RADIOTHERAPY IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS.  WE  PLAN TO ENROLL UP TO 30 NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS IN THIS STUDY. THE EFFICACY ENDPOINTS OF THE STUDY  INCLUDE TUMOR RESPONSE, AS ASSESSED BY THE RESPONSE ASSESSMENT IN NEUROONCOLOGY (\u201cRANO\u201d), AND PROGRESSION-FREE  SURVIVAL (\u201cPFS\u201d), PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL AT SIX MONTHS (\u201cPFS6\u201d), AND OVERALL SURVIVAL  (\u201cOS\u201d), COMPARED TO HISTORICAL RESULTS IN THE TARGET POPULATION. THE STUDY IS BEING CONDUCTED IN TWO PARTS: (1)  DOSE-CONFIRMATION: VAL-083 IN COHORTS (20, 30 AND 40 MG/M  2  /DAY IV DAILY X 3 EVERY 21 DAYS) TO ASSESS SAFETY AND  ACTIVITY WHEN ADMINISTERED CONCURRENTLY WITH X-RAY THERAPY (\u201cXRT\u201d) TO CONFIRM THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE  (\u201cMTD\u201d), AND (2) EXPANSION: VAL-083 WILL BE STUDIED IN UP TO 20 ADDITIONAL PATIENTS AT THE TARGET DOSE, AS  DETERMINED BY THE DOSE-CONFIRMATION PART OF THE STUDY, ADMINISTERED CONCURRENTLY WITH XRT. ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY AND  TOLERABILITY WILL BE USED TO SUPPORT FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF VAL-083 IN COMBINATION WITH RADIOTHERAPY.  PHARMACOKINETIC ASSESSMENTS OF VAL-083 IN PLASMA AND CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID (\u201cCSF\u201d) WILL BE USED TO CORRELATE DRUG  EXPOSURE IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH PATIENT OUTCOMES.  DOSE-CONFIRMING COHORTS STUDYING 20, 30, AND 40 MG/M  2  /DAY  X THREE EVERY 21 DAYS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. BASED ON THE DOSE CONFIRMATION PHASE OF THE STUDY, WE HAVE SELECTED 30 MG/M  2  /DAY  FOR COMBINATION WITH IRRADIATION FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEWLY-DIAGNOSED MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS.  THIS STUDY HAS ENROLLED 23 OUT OF A PLANNED 30 PATIENTS AS OF  THE DATA CUT-OFF DATE OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019. FOR THE 22 PATIENTS WHO HAD COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE CYCLE OF TREATMENT AS OF THAT DATE,  MEDIAN PFS WITH VAL-083 WAS 9.9 MONTHS (CI 7.3-12.0 MONTHS).  FOR THE 18 PATIENTS INITIALLY RECEIVING THE INTENDED TREATMENT  DOSE (30 MG/M  2  /DAY ON DAYS 1, 2 AND 3 OF A 21-DAY CYCLE) MEDIAN PFS WAS 10.4 MONTHS (CI 6.0-12.0 MONTHS). WHILE THIS  IS NOT A HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDY, HISTORICALLY, TEMOZOLOMIDE (\u201cTMZ\u201d) HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE 6.9 MONTHS PFS IN UNMETHYLATED  GBM PATIENTS. OTHER DOSES WERE ALSO EXAMINED AS PART OF THE DOSE ESCALATION ASPECT OF THE STUDY, AND ALL BUT THE 20 MG/M  2  /DAY  DOSE ALSO DEMONSTRATED SUPERIOR PFS TO THE HISTORICAL COMPARATOR. A MEDIAN OF EIGHT CYCLES OF TREATMENT HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY ALL  PATIENTS WHO HAD EITHER COMPLETED TREATMENT, OR REMAIN IN ACTIVE TREATMENT.  NINE PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED TEN OR MORE CYCLES.  THROUGH OUR RESEARCH, AND THAT OF THE NCI, WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED  THAT VAL-083 CROSSES THE BLOOD BRAIN BARRIER. PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE SYSUCC STUDY INDICATE THAT THE CONCENTRATION OF VAL-083  IS GENERALLY AS HIGH IN CSF AS IN PLASMA AT TWO HOURS POST-INFUSION.  CONCENTRATION  OF VAL-083 \u2014 TWO HOURS POST DOSE  MEAN  CONCENTRATIONS (NG/ML)  CONC.  RATIO @ 2 HOURS  DOSE  (MG/M  2  )  N  PLASMA  (2 HOURS POST DOSE)  CSF  (2 HOURS POST DOSE)  CSF/PLASMA  20  1  110  154  1.40  30  3  97  134  1.41  40  3  170  190  1.13  BY COMPARISON, TEMOZOLOMIDE IS TYPICALLY 80% LOWER IN THE CSF  THAN THE PLASMA (SCHRECK ET AL. 2018, ONCOLOGY (WILLISTON PARK)). THE ACCUMULATION OF VAL-083 IN THE CSF FURTHER VALIDATES THAT  VAL-083 CROSSES THE BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THERAPEUTIC DRUG CONCENTRATIONS IN THE CSF ARE ACHIEVABLE FOR EXTENDED  PERIODS OF TIME.  24  PHASE  2 STUDY IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM IN COLLABORATION WITH UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER  IN FEBRUARY 2017, WE INITIATED A BIOMARKER DRIVEN, OPEN-LABEL,  SINGLE-ARM PHASE 2 STUDY IN COLLABORATION WITH MDACC. THIS BIOMARKER-DRIVEN STUDY (TESTING FOR MGMT METHYLATION STATUS) HAS BEEN  AMENDED TO ENROLL UP TO 83 PATIENTS (35 WITH A STARTING DOSE OF 40 MG/M  2  /DAY AND 48 WITH A STARTING DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY)  TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL OF VAL-083 TREATMENT TO IMPROVE OVERALL SURVIVAL IN GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS HAVE RECURRED FOLLOWING  TREATMENT WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE. THESE PATIENTS WILL NOT HAVE BEEN TREATED PREVIOUSLY WITH AVASTIN  \u00ae  . IN ADDITION, THIS  STUDY HAS BEEN AMENDED TO ADD A NEW ADJUVANT PATIENT ARM. THIS ARM WILL INCLUDE 24 PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY TREATED WITH TMZ IN COMBINATION  WITH RADIATION WHO, RATHER THAN BEING TREATED WITH ADDITIONAL CYCLES OF TMZ, WILL BEGIN TREATMENT WITH VAL-083.  RECURRENT  STUDY ARM  THE PATIENTS IN THE RECURRENT STUDY ARM ARE RECEIVING SECOND-LINE  THERAPY WITH VAL-083 FOLLOWING TMZ FAILURE.  SIXTY-TWO PATIENTS (OUT OF A PLANNED 83) HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AS OF NOVEMBER 15,  2019, WITH 35 PATIENTS (WITH NO ADDITIONAL PATIENTS PLANNED) HAVING RECEIVED AN INITIAL DOSE OF 40 MG/M  2  /DAY AND 27  (OUT OF A PLANNED 48) HAVING RECEIVED AN INITIAL DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY (ON DAYS 1, 2 AND 3 OF A 21-DAY CYCLE). MOS FOR  THE 60 PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE CYCLE OF TREATMENT WAS 7.5 MONTHS (CI 6.0-11.5 MONTHS). FOR THE 25 OF THOSE PATIENTS  WHO INITIALLY RECEIVED THE INTENDED TREATMENT DOSE OF 30 MG/M  2  /DAY, MOS WAS 10.6 MONTHS (CI 5.8-10.6 MONTHS). WHILE  THIS IS NOT A HEAD-TO-HEAD STUDY, HISTORICALLY LOMUSTINE, WHICH IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED CHEMOTHERAPY FOR THESE RECURRENT PATIENTS,  HAS DEMONSTRATED A MOS OF 7.2 MONTHS (EORTC 26101, MGMT-UNMETHYLATED LOMUSTINE ARM).  THE SAFETY PROFILE HAS BEEN WELL WITHIN THE EXISTING SAFETY  MONITORING GUIDELINES DESCRIBED IN THE PRESENT STUDY PROTOCOL. HOWEVER, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AT MDACC,  WE HAVE AMENDED THE PROTOCOL FOR THIS CLINICAL STUDY TO MODIFY THE STARTING DOSE OF VAL-083 TO 30 MG/M  2  /DAY ON DAYS  1, 2 AND 3, OF A 21-DAY CYCLE. THIS MODIFICATION MAY IMPROVE TOLERANCE IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION AND THEREBY POTENTIALLY INCREASE  OVERALL EXPOSURE TO VAL-083 BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF CYCLES OF DRUG PATIENTS MAY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE. WE HAVE MODIFIED THE PATIENT  SCREENING PLATELET COUNT, FROM 100,000/\u039cL TO 125,000/\u039cL, FOR THE SAME REASONS. SAFETY DATA FROM THIS STUDY WILL BECOME  PART OF THE OVERALL SAFETY DOSSIER TO SUPPORT FUTURE FILINGS WITH THE FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES.  IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THIS GBM PATIENT POPULATION, WHICH HAS BEEN  HEAVILY PRE-TREATED WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE, TO BE ABLE TO BE TREATED WITH MULTIPLE CYCLES OF VAL-083 WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT HEMATOLOGICAL  TOXICITIES. WE BELIEVE THE MODIFIED DOSE OF VAL-083, IN ADDITION TO THE CHANGE IN PATIENT ELIGIBILITY PLATELET COUNTS, SHOULD HELP  PROVIDE FOR ENHANCED PATIENT SAFETY. WE BELIEVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME FROM THIS STUDY CAN ESTABLISH A POSITION FOR VAL-083 IN THE  TREATMENT OF MGMT-UNMETHYLATED RECURRENT GBM.  A  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS STUDY CAN BE FOUND AT CLINICATRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER NUMBER: NCT02717962.  ADJUVANT  STUDY ARM  ON JULY 24, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE ENROLLMENT OF THE FIRST PATIENT  IN THE ADJUVANT ARM OF THE PHASE 2 STUDY BEING CONDUCTED AT MDACC. THE ADJUVANT ARM WILL INCLUDE UP TO 24 PATIENTS. THESE PATIENTS  WILL HAVE HAD INITIAL CYCLES OF TEMOZOLOMIDE CONCOMITANT WITH RADIATION BUT WILL NOT HAVE YET STARTED SUBSEQUENT CYCLES OF TMZ  (I.E. MAINTENANCE STAGE TMZ PATIENTS). PUBLISHED DATA FROM TANGUTURI ET AL (2017 NERO-ONCOLOGY) INDICATES THAT MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  PATIENTS RECEIVING CURRENT STANDARD OF CARE HAVE A MEDIAN PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL OF 6.9 MONTHS. AS OF NOVEMBER 15, 2019, FIVE  PATIENTS (OUT OF A PLANNED 24) HAVE BEEN ENROLLED AND ALL PATIENTS REMAIN ALIVE ON CONTINUED THERAPY.  AS  NOTED ABOVE, PATIENTS IN THE RECURRENT ARM OF THE MDACC CLINICAL STUDY HAVE BEEN HEAVILY PRE-TREATED WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE. BASED  ON PUBLISHED DATA FROM OUR MDACC AND SYSUCC CLINICAL STUDIES, WE BELIEVE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO TREAT GBM PATIENTS  IN THE PRE-TEMOZOLOMIDE MAINTENANCE STAGE (I.E., ADJUVANT). AT THE AACR\u2019S ANNUAL MEETING IN APRIL 2019, WE REPORTED THAT  MYELOSUPPRESSION (THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND NEUTROPENIA) IS THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH VAL-083. THE HIGHER POTENTIAL  FOR MYELOSUPPRESSION WITH THE 40 MG/M  2  /DAY OF VAL-083 IN THIS STUDY APPEARS TO BE CORRELATED WITH THE NUMBER OF CYCLES  OF PRIOR TMZ MAINTENANCE THERAPY (> 5 CYCLES).  SAFETY ACROSS STUDIES  FOUR SUBJECTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT (\u201cSAE\u201d)  POSSIBLY RELATED TO VAL-083 IN THE NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GROUP, ELEVEN SUBJECTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A POSSIBLY DRUG-RELATED SAE IN THE  RECURRENT GROUP, AND NO PATIENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED A POSSIBLY DRUG-RELATED SAE IN THE ADJUVANT GROUP AS OF THE RELEVANT DATA CUT-OFF  DATES.  25  FAST  TRACK DESIGNATION  THE FDA HAS GRANTED US FAST TRACK DESIGNATION FOR VAL-083 IN  RECURRENT GBM.  FAST  TRACK DESIGNATION IS DESIGNED TO EXPEDITE THE REVIEW OF DRUGS THAT SHOW PROMISE IN TREATING LIFE-THREATENING DISEASES AND  ADDRESS UNMET MEDICAL NEEDS, WITH THE GOAL OF GETTING NEW TREATMENTS TO PATIENTS EARLIER. FAST TRACK DESIGNATION PROVIDES  SPONSORS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INCREASED FREQUENCY FOR COMMUNICATION WITH THE FDA TO ENSURE AN OPTIMAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN AND  TO COLLECT APPROPRIATE DATA NEEDED TO SUPPORT DRUG APPROVAL. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE FAST TRACK DESIGNATION MAY INCLUDE AN  ACCELERATED APPROVAL, A PRIORITY REVIEW, AND A ROLLING REVIEW. ACCELERATED APPROVAL IS GRANTED TO DRUGS THAT DEMONSTRATE AN  EFFECT ON A SURROGATE, OR INTERMEDIATE ENDPOINTS, REASONABLY LIKELY TO PREDICT CLINICAL BENEFIT. PRIORITY REVIEW SHORTENS THE  FDA REVIEW PROCESS FOR A NEW DRUG FROM TEN MONTHS TO SIX MONTHS AND IS APPROPRIATE FOR DRUGS THAT DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANT  IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF AN EXISTING THERAPY. ROLLING REVIEW PROVIDES A DRUG COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO  SUBMIT COMPLETED SECTIONS OF ITS NEW DRUG APPLICATION (\u201cNDA\u201d) FOR REVIEW BY THE FDA. TYPICALLY, NDA REVIEWS DO  NOT COMMENCE UNTIL THE DRUG COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED THE ENTIRE APPLICATION TO THE FDA. THROUGH THE FAST TRACK DESIGNATION, THE  FDA ATTEMPTS TO ENSURE THAT QUESTIONS RAISED DURING THE DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROCESS ARE RESOLVED QUICKLY, OFTEN LEADING TO  EARLIER APPROVAL AND INCREASED ACCESS FOR PATIENTS.  MGMT-UNMETHYLATED  GBM  GBM  IS THE MOST COMMON AND THE MOST LETHAL FORM OF GLIOMA. ACCORDING TO THE CENTRAL BRAIN TUMOR REGISTRY OF THE UNITED STATES, GBM  OCCURS WITH AN INCIDENCE OF 3.20 PER 100,000 PERSON-YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 13,000 NEW CASES OF GBM WERE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED  STATES AND 16,000 IN EUROPE DURING 2017. WITHIN THE GBM PATIENT POPULATION, APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF PATIENTS ARE UNMETHYLATED  WITH RESPECT TO THEIR MGMT STATUS.  MEASUREMENT OF MGMT (O6-METHYL GUANINE METHYLTRANSFERASE) METHYLATION  STATUS HAS BECOME ROUTINE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AS A BIOMARKER THAT CORRELATES WITH RESISTANCE TO THE STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY  WITH TMZ (TEMODAR  \u00ae  ), AND PATIENT OUTCOMES IN GBM. APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF GBM PATIENTS\u2019 TUMORS ARE CHARACTERIZED  AS \u201cMGMT-UNMETHYLATED\u201d AND EXHIBIT A HIGH EXPRESSION OF MGMT, A NATURALLY OCCURRING DNA-REPAIR ENZYME, THE ACTIVITY  OF WHICH NULLIFIES THE CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC ACTIVITY OF TMZ. THE LACK OF SPECIFIC THERAPIES FOR MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM IS A SIGNIFICANT  UNMET MEDICAL NEED. IMPORTANTLY, THE 2017 UPDATE TO THE NCCN GUIDELINES STATES THAT THE TREATMENT BENEFIT OF TMZ IS LIKELY TO  BE LOWER IN GBM PATIENTS WITH AN UNMETHYLATED MGMT PROMOTER.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT VAL-083\u2019S ANTI-TUMOR MECHANISM  IS ACTIVE INDEPENDENT FROM THE MGMT STATUS  IN VITRO  . WE BELIEVE THIS SUGGESTS THE POTENTIAL OF VAL-083 AS A REPLACEMENT  FOR THE CURRENT STANDARD-OF-CARE CHEMOTHERAPY, TEMOZOLOMIDE, IN MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM. WE ARE THEREFORE UTILIZING MGMT-METHYLATION  STATUS TO IDENTIFY GBM PATIENTS WHO ARE UNLIKELY TO RESPOND TO TEMOZOLOMIDE AND INCLUDING ONLY MGMT-UNMETHYLATED PATIENTS IN OUR  CURRENT CLINICAL STUDIES OF VAL-083.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR RESEARCH, IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 2017 UPDATE TO THE NCCN GUIDELINES, HIGHLIGHTS THIS UNMET NEED AND THE OPPORTUNITY  FOR VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL NEW STANDARD-OF-CARE IN THE TREATMENT OF MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM.  CURRENT  TREATMENTS FOR GLIOMAS AND GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME  GLIOMAS  ARE A TYPE OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (\u201cCNS\u201d) TUMOR THAT ARISES FROM GLIAL CELLS IN THE BRAIN OR SPINE. GLIAL CELLS  ARE THE CELLS SURROUNDING NERVES. THEIR PRIMARY FUNCTION IS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND PROTECTION FOR NEURONS IN THE CNS.  GBM  IS THE MOST COMMON AND THE MOST LETHAL FORM OF GLIOMA. ACCORDING TO THE CENTRAL BRAIN  TUMOR REGISTRY OF THE UNITED STATES, GBM OCCURS WITH AN INCIDENCE OF 3.20 PER 100,000  PERSON-YEARS. APPROXIMATELY 13,000 NEW CASES OF GBM WERE DIAGNOSED IN THE UNITED STATES  AND 16,000 IN EUROPE DURING 2017.  26  COMMON  SYMPTOMS OF GBM INCLUDE HEADACHES, SEIZURES, NAUSEA, WEAKNESS, PARALYSIS AND PERSONALITY OR COGNITIVE CHANGES SUCH AS LOSS OF  SPEECH OR DIFFICULTY IN THINKING CLEARLY. GBM PROGRESSES QUICKLY AND PATIENTS\u2019 CONDITIONS DETERIORATE RAPIDLY PROGRESSING  TO DEATH. THE OUTLOOK FOR GBM PATIENTS IS GENERALLY POOR. THE OVERALL MEDIAN SURVIVAL IN NEWLY DIAGNOSED GBM PATIENTS WITH BEST  AVAILABLE TREATMENTS IS LESS THAN 15 MONTHS, AND TWO-YEAR AND FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES ARE APPROXIMATELY 30% AND 10%, RESPECTIVELY.  MEDIAN OVERALL SURVIVAL IN NEWLY-DIAGNOSED, UNMETHYLATED GBM PATIENTS IS 12.2 MONTHS.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE NCCN UPDATED TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR GBM. THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT REGIMEN FOR GBM INCLUDES SURGICAL RESECTION  TO REMOVE AS MUCH OF THE TUMOR AS POSSIBLE (\u201cDEBULKING\u201d) FOLLOWED BY RADIOTHERAPY WITH CONCOMITANT AND ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY  WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE WITH OR WITHOUT TUMOR TREATING FIELDS (\u201cTTF\u201d). GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS EXHIBIT AN UNMETHYLATED  PROMOTER FOR THE GENE ENCODING THE DNA REPAIR ENZYME MGMT, A BIOMARKER CORRELATED WITH RESISTANCE TO TEMOZOLOMIDE, MAY BE TREATED  WITH RADIATION ALONE FOLLOWING SURGERY.  PATIENTS  WITH AN UNMETHYLATED MGMT PROMOTER HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF MGMT, A NATURALLY-OCCURRING DNA REPAIR ENZYME THAT REPAIRS TUMOR-FIGHTING  LESIONS INDUCED BY TMZ THUS ALLOWING A PATIENT\u2019S TUMOR TO CONTINUE TO GROW DESPITE TREATMENT, WHICH LEADS TO POOR OUTCOMES.  MEASUREMENT OF MGMT METHYLATION STATUS HAS BECOME ROUTINE IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AS BIOMARKER THAT CORRELATES WITH RESPONSE TO TMZ  AND PATIENT OUTCOMES IN GBM.  PROBABILITY  OF GBM PATIENT SURVIVAL CORRELATED TO EXPRESSION OF MGMT ENZYME  (UNMETHYLATED PROMOTER = HIGH MGMT EXPRESSION AND SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER SURVIVAL)  TTF  (OPTUNE  \u00ae  ) IS A NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ADULTS WITH GBM. TTF USES ALTERNATING ELECTRICAL FIELDS TO DISRUPT TUMOR  CELL DIVISION, OR CAUSE CELL DEATH, THEREBY PREVENTING THE TUMOR FROM GROWING OR SPREADING AS QUICKLY. A CLINICAL STUDY REPORTED  THAT GBM PATIENTS TREATED WITH TTF COMBINED WITH TMZ EXPERIENCED LONGER SURVIVAL THAN THOSE TREATED WITH TMZ ALONE.  THE  MAJORITY OF GBM PATIENTS\u2019 TUMORS RECUR WITHIN 6 \u2013 12 MONTHS OF INITIAL TREATMENT. EXPERIMENTAL THERAPY THROUGH CLINICAL  STUDIES IS RECOMMENDED UNDER NCCN GUIDELINES FOR ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. NCCN GUIDELINES ALSO RECOMMEND TREATMENT WITH SYSTEMIC CHEMOTHERAPY,  SUCH AS LOMUSTINE (\u201cCCNU\u201d). FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ADDITIONAL SURGICAL DEBULKING, LOCAL CHEMOTHERAPY WITH  CARMUSTINE (\u201cBCNU\u201d) WAFERS MAY BE EMPLOYED. CCNU AND BCNU TARGET THE SAME DNA-SITE AS TMZ AND ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO  MGMT-RELATED RESISTANCE.  27  AVASTIN  (AVASTIN  \u00ae  , AN ANTI-VEGF ANTIBODY) RECENTLY RECEIVED FULL APPROVAL IN THE US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND JAPAN AS A  SINGLE AGENT FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT GBM FOLLOWING PRIOR THERAPY. AVASTIN CARRIES AN FDA \u201cBLACK-BOX WARNING\u201d RELATED  TO SEVERE, SOMETIMES FATAL, SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS GASTROINTESTINAL PERFORATIONS, WOUND HEALING COMPLICATIONS AND HEMORRHAGE. THERE  ARE NO DATA DEMONSTRATING AN IMPROVEMENT IN DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS OR INCREASED SURVIVAL FOR GBM PATIENTS TREATED WITH AVASTIN.  RECURRENT  GBM PATIENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHOSE TUMORS PROGRESS FOLLOWING TREATMENT WITH AVASTIN, HAVE LIMITED OR NO TREATMENT OPTIONS AND  A VERY POOR PROGNOSIS. ACCORDING TO PUBLISHED LITERATURE, THE MEDIAN SURVIVAL FOR GBM PATIENTS WHOSE TUMORS PROGRESS FOLLOWING  AVASTIN IS LESS THAN FIVE MONTHS.  VAL-083  MECHANISM OF ACTION  CHEMOTHERAPY  FORMS THE BASIS OF TREATMENT IN NEARLY ALL CANCERS. WE BELIEVE THAT VAL-083 MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING TUMORS EXHIBITING BIOLOGICAL  FEATURES THAT CAUSE RESISTANCE TO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE CHEMOTHERAPY, PARTICULARLY FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE FAILED, OR BECOME RESISTANT  TO, OTHER TREATMENT REGIMENS.  BASED  ON PUBLISHED RESEARCH AND OUR OWN DATA, THE CYTOTOXIC FUNCTIONAL GROUPS, AND THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF VAL-083 ARE FUNCTIONALLY  DIFFERENT FROM ALKYLATING AGENTS COMMONLY USED IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. VAL-083 HAS PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED ACTIVITY IN CELL-LINES  THAT ARE RESISTANT TO OTHER TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. NO EVIDENCE OF CROSS-RESISTANCE HAS BEEN REPORTED IN PUBLISHED CLINICAL STUDIES.  OUR  RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT VAL-083 ATTACKS CANCER CELLS VIA A UNIQUE MECHANISM OF ACTION WHICH IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER CHEMOTHERAPIES  USED IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT VAL-083 FORMS INTER-STRAND CROSSLINKS AT THE N  7  POSITION OF  GUANINE ON THE DNA OF CANCER CELLS. OUR DATA ALSO INDICATE THAT THIS CROSSLINK FORMS RAPIDLY AND IS NOT EASILY REPAIRED BY THE  CANCER CELL RESULTING IN CELL-CYCLE ARREST AND LETHAL DOUBLE-STRAND DNA BREAKS IN CANCER CELLS. VAL-083 READILY CROSSES THE BLOOD  BRAIN BARRIER. PUBLISHED PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL RESEARCH DEMONSTRATE THAT VAL-083 IS ABSORBED MORE READILY IN TUMOR CELLS THAN  IN NORMAL CELLS.  IN  VITRO  , OUR DATA ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT VAL-083\u2019S DISTINCT MECHANISM MAY BE ABLE TO OVERCOME DRUG RESISTANCE AGAINST A  RANGE OF CANCERS. FOR EXAMPLE, VAL-083 IS ACTIVE AGAINST MGMT-UNMETHYLATED GBM CELLS WHICH ARE RESISTANT TO TREATMENT WITH TEMOZOLOMIDE  AND NITROSOUREAS. VAL-083 ALSO RETAINS A HIGH LEVEL OF ACTIVITY IN P53 MUTATED NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (\u201cNSCLC\u201d),  OVARIAN CANCER AND MEDULLOBLASTOMA CELL LINES THAT ARE RESISTANT TO PLATINUM-BASED CHEMOTHERAPY.  IMPORTANTLY,  CLINICAL ACTIVITY AGAINST EACH OF THE TUMORS MENTIONED ABOVE WAS ESTABLISHED IN PRIOR NCI-SPONSORED PHASE 2 CLINICAL STUDIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HISTORICAL CLINICAL DATA AND OUR OWN RESEARCH SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL NEW TREATMENT  FOR MULTIPLE TYPES OF CANCER.  THE  MAIN DOSE-LIMITING TOXICITY (\u201cDLT\u201d) RELATED TO THE ADMINISTRATION OF VAL-083 IN PREVIOUS NCI-SPONSORED CLINICAL STUDIES  AND OUR OWN CLINICAL STUDIES IS MYELOSUPPRESSION, PARTICULARLY THROMBOCYTOPENIA. MYELOSUPPRESSION, INCLUDING THROMBOCYTOPENIA,  IS A COMMON SIDE EFFECT OF CHEMOTHERAPY. MYELOSUPPRESSION IS THE DECREASE IN CELLS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING IMMUNITY, CARRYING  OXYGEN, AND CAUSING NORMAL BLOOD CLOTTING. THROMBOCYTOPENIA IS A REDUCTION IN PLATELET COUNTS WHICH ASSIST IN BLOOD CLOTTING.  MODERN MEDICINE ALLOWS FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF MYELOSUPPRESSIVE SIDE EFFECTS. WE BELIEVE THIS OFFERS THE POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY  TO IMPROVE UPON THE DRUG\u2019S ALREADY ESTABLISHED EFFICACY PROFILE BY SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING THE DOSE OF VAL-083 THAT CAN  BE SAFELY ADMINISTERED TO CANCER PATIENTS.  THERE  IS NO EVIDENCE OF LUNG, LIVER, OR KIDNEY TOXICITY EVEN WITH PROLONGED TREATMENT BY VAL-083. DATA FROM THE CHINESE MARKET WHERE  THE DRUG HAS BEEN APPROVED FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS SUPPORTS THE SAFETY FINDINGS OF THE NCI STUDIES.  28  OTHER  INDICATIONS FOR VAL-083 \u2014 POTENTIAL FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES  OVARIAN  CANCER  OVARIAN  CANCER IS THE FIFTH MOST COMMON CANCER IN WOMEN AND IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH GYNECOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES.  IN 2016, APPROXIMATELY 22,300 WOMEN IN THE US WERE DIAGNOSED WITH OVARIAN CANCER AND 14,300 DIED FROM THEIR DISEASE.  VAL-083\u2019S  ACTIVITY AGAINST OVARIAN EPITHELIAL ADENOCARCINOMA (\u201cOEA\u201d) AND SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF THE CERVIX (\u201cSCC\u201d)  WAS REPORTED IN PRIOR NCI-SPONSORED CLINICAL STUDIES. IMPORTANTLY, NCI-RESEARCHERS RECOMMENDED VAL-083 FOR FURTHER ADVANCED STUDIES  IN THE TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CANCER.  WE  HAVE PRESENTED DATA DEMONSTRATING THAT VAL-083\u2019S DISTINCT MECHANISM OF ACTION ALLOWS ACTIVITY IN TUMORS THAT ARE RESISTANT  TO OTHER THERAPIES. WE HAVE SHOWN THAT CYTOTOXICITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST OVARIAN CANCER IS INDEPENDENT OF SENSITIVITY TO CISPLATIN  OR P53 STATUS  IN VITRO.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT VAL-083 IS ACTIVE IN PT-RESISTANT OVARIAN CELLS HARBORING A RANGE OF  P53-MUTATIONS.  IN  APRIL 2016, THE FDA GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF OVARIAN CANCER.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, WE FILED AN IND FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN OVARIAN CANCER, ALONG WITH A PROTOCOL FOR A PHASE 1/2, OPEN-LABEL, MULTICENTER,  STUDY OF VAL-083 IN PATIENTS WITH  RE  CURRENT  P  LATINUM  R  ESISTANT  OV  ARIAN  CANCER (THE REPROVE STUDY).  THE  FDA HAS ALLOWED THIS STUDY TO BEGIN ENROLLING PATIENTS, BUT BASED ON ONGOING EVALUATION AND INPUT FROM OUR OVARIAN CLINICAL ADVISORY  BOARD, WE ARE REASSESSING THE OVARIAN CANCER PROGRAM. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING THE BEST PATH FORWARD IN OVARIAN CANCER  AND ARE LOOKING AT VARIOUS STRATEGIC OPTIONS INCLUDING COMBINATION WITH PARP INHIBITORS. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE INACTIVATED THE  IND WHILE WE EXPLORE ALTERNATIVE STUDY DESIGNS.  LUNG  CANCER  LUNG  CANCER IS A LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATH AROUND THE WORLD AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR LUNG CANCER REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL  UNMET NEED DESPITE ADVANCES IN THERAPY. INCIDENCE OF LUNG CANCER IN THE UNITED STATES IS APPROXIMATELY 47 PER 100,000 WITH THE  MAJORITY (85%) BEING NSCLC, THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF LUNG CANCER. GLOBALLY, THE MARKET FOR LUNG CANCER TREATMENT MAY EXCEED $24  BILLION BY 2033 ACCORDING TO A REPORT PUBLISHED BY EVALUATE PHARMA.  THE  ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST SOLID TUMORS, INCLUDING LUNG CANCER, HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN BOTH PRECLINICAL AND HUMAN CLINICAL STUDIES  CONDUCTED BY THE NCI. DELMAR HAS DEVELOPED NEW NONCLINICAL DATA TO SUPPORT THE UTILITY OF VAL-083 IN THE MODERN TREATMENT OF LUNG  CANCER. IN AN ESTABLISHED MURINE XENOGRAFT MODEL OF NSCLC, THE ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 WAS COMPARED TO STANDARD PLATINUM-BASED THERAPY  WITH CISPLATIN AGAINST HUMAN NSCLC CELL LINES A549 (TKI-SENSITIVE) AND H1975 (TKI-RESISTANT). IN THE STUDY, VAL-083 DEMONSTRATED  SUPERIOR EFFICACY AND SAFETY IN THE TREATMENT OF TKI-SUSCEPTIBLE (A549) TUMORS AND IN TKI-RESISTANT (H1975) TUMORS.  CENTRAL  NERVOUS SYSTEM METASTASES OF SOLID TUMORS  THE  SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC TUMORS BY MODERN TARGETED THERAPIES HAS LED TO INCREASED INCIDENCE OF MORTALITY DUE TO CNS METASTASES  OF LUNG CANCER AND OTHER SOLID TUMORS. IN JUNE 2013, WE SPLIT OUR PHASE 1/2 CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL INTO TWO SEPARATE STUDIES.  ONE FOCUSING SOLELY ON REFRACTORY GBM AND THE OTHER FOCUSING ON SECONDARY BRAIN CANCERS CAUSED BY OTHER TUMORS THAT HAVE SPREAD  TO THE BRAIN.  BASED  ON HISTORICAL CLINICAL ACTIVITY AND OUR OWN RESEARCH, WE BELIEVE THAT VAL-083 MAY BE SUITABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH  CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM METASTASES WHO CURRENTLY HAVE LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS. SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AND OPERATING  RESOURCES, WE MAY DEVELOP A SEPARATE PROTOCOL FOR THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF VAL-083 IN PATIENTS WITH SECONDARY BRAIN CANCER  CAUSED BY A SOLID TUMOR SPREADING TO THE BRAIN.  PEDIATRIC  BRAIN TUMORS  TUMORS  OF THE BRAIN AND SPINE MAKE UP APPROXIMATELY 20% OF ALL CHILDHOOD CANCERS AND THEY ARE THE SECOND MOST COMMON FORM OF CHILDHOOD  CANCER AFTER LEUKEMIA.  THE  ACTIVITY OF VAL-083 AGAINST CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENT BRAIN TUMORS HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED IN BOTH PRECLINICAL AND HUMAN CLINICAL  STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE NCI. WE HAVE PRESENTED DATA INDICATING THAT VAL-083 OFFERS POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ALTERNATIVES FOR THE  TREATMENT OF PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMORS INCLUDING SHH-P53 MUTATED MEDULLOBLASTOMA. IN MARCH 2016, THE FDA GRANTED ORPHAN DRUG DESIGNATION  FOR THE USE OF VAL-083 IN THE TREATMENT OF MEDULLOBLASTOMA. SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES, WE INTEND TO COLLABORATE  WITH LEADING ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS FOR THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF VAL-083 AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF CHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS.  29  CORPORATE  HISTORY  WE ARE A NEVADA CORPORATION FORMED ON JUNE 24, 2009 UNDER THE  NAME BERRY ONLY, INC.

THE DECREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY, PRECLINICAL RESEARCH, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES. WITH RESPECT TO NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WE  RECOGNIZED $27,495 AND $25,744 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 RESPECTIVELY. FOR BOTH PERIODS, THE  AMOUNT RECOGNIZED RELATED TO STOCK OPTION EXPENSE AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES.  32  EXCLUDING  THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $684,698 DURING THE  CURRENT QUARTER FROM $921,505 FOR THE PRIOR QUARTER DUE TO LOWER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRECLINICAL  RESEARCH, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE COMPLETION OF THE MANUFACTURING  OF OUR FIRST LOT OF GMP DRUG PRODUCT WHICH WAS COMPLETED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. CLINICAL  DEVELOPMENT COSTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, PATIENT ENROLLMENT,  HOW A PATIENT REACTS TO TREATMENT, AND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENT CYCLES A PATIENT RECEIVES.  INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COSTS DECREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AS WE HAVE REFINED OUR PATENT PORTFOLIO BY FOCUSING ON OUR  MOST IMPORTANT PATENT CLAIMS IN THE MOST STRATEGIC JURISDICTIONS. PATENT COSTS CAN VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING ON THE FILING OF  NEW PATENTS, CONVERSION OF THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATIONS TO PCT APPLICATIONS, FOREIGN OFFICE ACTIONS, AND ACTUAL FILING COSTS. PRECLINICAL  RESEARCH COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN THE CURRENT QUARTER DUE TO THE COMPLETION, OR DEFERRAL, OF STUDIES THAT WERE ONGOING IN THE PRIOR  PERIOD. PERSONNEL COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEAD COUNT.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED TO $1,053,747  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 FROM $874,884 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION  OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OFFICE AND SUNDRY EXPENSES. IN RELATION TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $170,373 RELATING TO  WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE WHILE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED NON-CASH,  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $158,279 RELATING TO STOCK OPTION AND PERFORMANCE STOCK UNIT EXPENSES, AND WARRANTS ISSUED  FOR SERVICES. ALL PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS WERE CANCELED ON APRIL 30, 2019 SO THERE WAS NO RELATED EXPENSE INCURRED DURING THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $883,374 FROM $716,605 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROFESSIONAL FEES AND OFFICE AND SUNDRY EXPENSES IN  THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER ACCOUNTING AND LEGAL FEES AND INCREASED  INVESTOR OUTREACH EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OFFICE AND SUNDRY HAS INCREASED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER COSTS OF DIRECTORS\u2019 AND OFFICERS\u2019 LIABILITY INSURANCE.

EXCLUDING  THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED TO $1,393,177 DURING  THE CURRENT PERIOD FROM $1,908,035 FOR THE PRIOR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE MANUFACTURING,  AND RELATED COSTS, OF OUR FIRST LOT OF GMP API AND DRUG PRODUCT WHICH WAS COMPLETED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018. ALSO, WE INCURRED HIGHER PATIENT COSTS IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS SAMPLING ANALYSIS AS THE NUMBER OF TOTAL ENROLLED  PATIENTS IN OUR PHASE 2 STUDIES HAS INCREASED OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, THE FORMATION OF OUR SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY BOARD OCCURRED  IN JUNE 2019 RESULTING IN FEES INCURRED IN 2019 THAT WERE NOT INCURRED IN 2018. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS CAN VARY  SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD DUE TO THE TIMING OF MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES, PATIENT ENROLLMENT, HOW A PATIENT REACTS TO  TREATMENT, AND THE NUMBER OF TREATMENT CYCLES A PATIENT RECEIVES.  PRECLINICAL RESEARCH COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN  THE PERIOD DUE TO THE COMPLETION, OR DEFERRAL, OF STUDIES THAT WERE ONGOING IN THE PRIOR PERIOD.

PERSONNEL COSTS HAVE DECREASED IN SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN FULL-TIME EMPLOYEE HEAD COUNT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, OFFICE AND SUNDRY,  AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR PERIOD. IN RELATION TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE  INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE $213,205 RELATING TO WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES AND STOCK OPTION  EXPENSE WHILE DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $354,905 RELATING TO PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS, WARRANTS ISSUED FOR SERVICES, AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ALL PERFORMANCE SHARE  UNITS WERE CANCELED ON APRIL 30, 2019 SO THERE WAS NO RELATED EXPENSE INCURRED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019.  34  EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $1,754,170 FROM $1,506,449 FOR THE SIX  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER PROFESSIONAL FEES, OFFICE AND SUNDRY, AND PERSONNEL EXPENSES  IN THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIOD. PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING ACCOUNTING  AND LEGAL FEES AND INCREASED INVESTOR OUTREACH EXPENSES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. OFFICE AND SUNDRY HAS INCREASED IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018 DUE PRIMARILY TO COSTS OF HIGHER DIRECTORS\u2019 AND OFFICERS\u2019 LIABILITY INSURANCE.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE FROM A USE OF CASH FROM A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES  OF $993,766 AND A REDUCTION IN RELATED PARTY PAYABLES OF $48,534. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL FOR THE SIX MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS CASH FROM A REDUCTION IN PREPAID EXPENSES AND DEPOSITS LARGELY DUE TO A PARTIAL REFUND OF A CLINICAL  STUDY DEPOSIT OF $728,276 AND CASH USED IN A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF $420,679.  FINANCING  ACTIVITIES  DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WE RECEIVED $6,582,966 IN NET PROCEEDS FROM THE COMPLETION OF AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC  OFFERING BY US OF COMMON STOCK, PRE-FUNDED WARRANTS, AND COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECEIVED $26,550  PURSUANT TO THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE RECEIVED  $784,961 FROM THE EXERCISE OF WARRANTS.

FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE REPORTED A LOSS  OF $3,345,922 AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS OF $3,976,058. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $63,933,043  AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $6,348,038. WE ARE A DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY AND HAVE NOT GENERATED ANY REVENUES TO DATE. WE  DO NOT HAVE THE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING REVENUES UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE IS COMMERCIALIZED, OR PARTNERED, WHICH  MAY NOT EVER OCCUR. IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MAINTAIN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  PROJECTS, AND FOR GENERAL OPERATIONS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT EXISTS ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A  GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF FILING THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CONSEQUENTLY,  MANAGEMENT IS PURSUING VARIOUS FINANCING ALTERNATIVES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS SO WE CAN CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. MANAGEMENT  PLANS TO SECURE THE NECESSARY FINANCING THROUGH THE ISSUE OF NEW EQUITY AND/OR THE ENTERING INTO OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS.  WE MAY TAILOR OUR DRUG CANDIDATE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE ARE ABLE TO RAISE IN THE FUTURE. NEVERTHELESS,  THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.  THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT GIVE EFFECT TO ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATION OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT MAY  BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD BE MATERIAL.  OUR  FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u25cf  THE  RATE OF PROGRESS AND COST OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND OTHER DISCOVERY AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ESTABLISHING MANUFACTURING AND COMMERCIALIZATION CAPABILITIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS OF ACQUIRING OR INVESTING IN BUSINESSES, PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND TECHNOLOGIES;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS;  \u25cf  THE  COSTS AND TIMING OF SEEKING AND OBTAINING FDA AND OTHER REGULATORY APPROVALS;  \u25cf  THE  EFFECT OF COMPETING TECHNOLOGICAL AND MARKET DEVELOPMENTS;  \u25cf  THE  ECONOMIC AND OTHER TERMS AND TIMING OF ANY COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER ARRANGEMENTS INTO WHICH WE MAY ENTER; AND  \u25cf  THE  IMPACT OF US BEING A PUBLIC ENTITY.  UNTIL WE CAN GENERATE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF  PRODUCT REVENUE TO FINANCE OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WE MAY NEVER DO, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE FUTURE CASH NEEDS PRIMARILY THROUGH  PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OFFERINGS, OR STRATEGIC COLLABORATIONS. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT  IN DILUTION TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND CERTAIN OF THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR SHARES OF CAPITAL STOCK.  IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK, CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING, THESE  SECURITIES OR OTHER DEBT COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. ANY OTHER THIRD-PARTY FUNDING ARRANGEMENT  COULD REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS AND ACTIVITY IN EQUITY  MARKETS. WE DO NOT KNOW WHETHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SECURE  ADDITIONAL FUNDING WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY HAVE TO DELAY, REDUCE THE SCOPE OF OR ELIMINATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR MAKE CHANGES TO OUR OPERATING PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE MAY HAVE TO SEEK A PARTNER FOR ONE OR MORE OF  OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE PROGRAMS AT AN EARLIER STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT, WHICH WOULD LOWER THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF THOSE PROGRAMS TO US.  36  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES, REQUIRES  COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO MAKE ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT BOTH THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF THE RECORDING OF ASSETS,  LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. SOME OF THESE ESTIMATES REQUIRE JUDGMENTS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND  THEREFORE ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  A  DETAILED PRESENTATION OF ALL OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE ESTIMATES DERIVED THEREFROM IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 2  TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019 CONTAINED IN OUR FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SEC ON SEPTEMBER  9, 2019. WHILE ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE  FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE ESTIMATES DERIVED THEREFROM ARE CRITICAL.  \u25cf  WARRANTS  AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES  \u25cf  STOCK  OPTIONS  \u25cf  DERIVATIVE  LIABILITY  \u25cf  ACCRUALS  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND CLINICAL TRIALS  WARRANTS  AND SHARES ISSUED FOR SERVICES  WE  HAVE ISSUED EQUITY INSTRUMENTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY EMPLOYEES AND NONEMPLOYEES. THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE FAIR  VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT GRANTED.  STOCK  OPTIONS  WE  ACCOUNT FOR THESE AWARDS UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 718, \u201cCOMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION\u201d  (\u201cASC 718\u201d). ASC 718 REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF COMPENSATION COST FOR ALL STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE  OF GRANT AND RECOGNITION OF COMPENSATION OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD FOR AWARDS EXPECTED TO VEST. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR  UNVESTED OPTIONS TO NON-EMPLOYEES IS REVALUED AT EACH PERIOD END AND IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE OPTIONS.  THE DETERMINATION OF GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS IS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, WHICH INCLUDES  VARIABLES SUCH AS THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF OUR SHARE PRICE, THE ANTICIPATED EXERCISE BEHAVIOR OF ITS GRANTEE, INTEREST RATES,  AND DIVIDEND YIELDS. THESE VARIABLES ARE PROJECTED BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL DATA, EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN ANY  OF THESE VARIABLES COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS. SUCH VALUE IS RECOGNIZED  AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, NET OF ACTUAL FORFEITURES, USING THE ACCELERATED ATTRIBUTION METHOD. WE RECOGNIZE  FORFEITURES AS THEY OCCUR. THE ESTIMATION OF STOCK AWARDS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY VEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT ACTUAL  RESULTS, OR UPDATED ESTIMATES, DIFFER FROM CURRENT ESTIMATES, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT IN THE PERIOD  ESTIMATES ARE REVISED.  DERIVATIVE  LIABILITY  WE  ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN WARRANTS UNDER THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO, AND  POTENTIALLY SETTLED IN, A COMPANY\u2019S OWN STOCK, ON THE UNDERSTANDING THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS,  THE WARRANTS REQUIRE THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES UPON EXERCISE AND DO NOT SUFFICIENTLY PRECLUDE AN IMPLIED RIGHT TO NET CASH SETTLEMENT.  WE CLASSIFY THESE WARRANTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY WHICH IS FAIR VALUED AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD SUBSEQUENT  TO THE INITIAL ISSUANCE. WE HAVE USED A BINOMIAL MODEL AS WELL AS A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL (BASED ON A CLOSED-FORM  MODEL THAT USES A FIXED EQUATION) TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE WARRANTS. DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE FAIR-VALUE MODEL  AND CALCULATING THE FAIR VALUE OF WARRANTS REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE JUDGMENT. ANY CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATES (SPECIFICALLY PROBABILITIES  AND VOLATILITY) USED MAY CAUSE THE VALUE TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THAT REPORTED. THE ESTIMATED VOLATILITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK  AT THE DATE OF ISSUANCE, AND AT EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING PERIOD, IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL VOLATILITY. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST  RATE IS BASED ON RATES PUBLISHED BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR BONDS WITH A MATURITY SIMILAR TO THE EXPECTED REMAINING LIFE OF THE WARRANTS  AT THE VALUATION DATE. THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE WARRANTS IS ASSUMED TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THEIR REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM.  37  ACCRUALS  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AND CLINICAL TRIALS  AS PART OF THE PROCESS OF PREPARING OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE OUR EXPENSES RESULTING FROM OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER CONTRACTS WITH VENDORS, CLINICAL RESEARCH  ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSULTANTS, AND UNDER CLINICAL SITE AGREEMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS. THE FINANCIAL  TERMS OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATIONS, WHICH VARY FROM CONTRACT TO CONTRACT AND MAY RESULT IN PAYMENT TERMS THAT  DO NOT MATCH THE PERIODS OVER WHICH MATERIALS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED UNDER SUCH CONTRACTS. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REFLECT THE APPROPRIATE  EXPENSES IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BY MATCHING THOSE EXPENSES WITH THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PERFORMED AND EFFORTS ARE  EXPENDED. WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE EXPENSES ACCORDING TO THE TIMING OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE EXPENSES. WE DETERMINE ACCRUAL ESTIMATES  BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DISCUSSION WITH APPLICABLE PERSONNEL AND OUTSIDE SERVICE PROVIDERS AS TO THE PROGRESS OF CLINICAL TRIALS,  OR THE SERVICES COMPLETED. DURING THE COURSE OF A CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ADJUST OUR CLINICAL EXPENSE RECOGNITION IF ACTUAL RESULTS  DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. WE MAKE ESTIMATES OF OUR ACCRUED EXPENSES AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  KNOWN TO US AT THAT TIME. OUR CLINICAL TRIAL ACCRUALS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE TIMELY AND ACCURATE REPORTING OF CONTRACT RESEARCH  ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY VENDORS. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT EXPECT OUR ESTIMATES TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM AMOUNTS ACTUALLY  INCURRED, OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE STATUS AND TIMING OF SERVICES PERFORMED RELATIVE TO THE ACTUAL STATUS AND TIMING OF SERVICES  PERFORMED MAY VARY AND MAY RESULT IN US REPORTING AMOUNTS THAT ARE TOO HIGH OR TOO LOW FOR ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR THE THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR PRIOR PERIOD ESTIMATES OF ACCRUED EXPENSES  FOR CLINICAL TRIALS.  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  38", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "DelMar Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "CIK": 1498382, "Date": "2020-02-13T00:00:00", "Ticker": "DMPI", "Name": "Delmar Pharmaceuticals Inc", "Exchange": "OTCBB", "SIC": 2834.0, "Business": "A1", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 990360497.0, "key": "20200213DMPI", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": -0.18181818181820214, "labelr4": 5.646630236794177, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.58204806, "prof1": 0.41795197, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.001818181818182, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9452492134459348, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.001818181818182, "return4": 0.9435336976320582, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.2336009662557855, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3708, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0037444066826715, "cumreturn1b": 0.8865005850249362, "cumreturn1c": 0.9531399955897093, "cumreturndow": 1.0403949599100029, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0351505700838362}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3720, "level_0": 3819, "index": 72893, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTS THE  PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT HAVE AFFECTED OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS WELL AS OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FOR THE PERIODS DESCRIBED. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. PLEASE SEE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d  ABOVE.  HISTORICAL OPERATIONS  GULFSLOPE ENERGY, INC. IS AN INDEPENDENT  OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WHOSE INTERESTS ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE UNITED STATES, GULF OF MEXICO FEDERAL  WATERS OFFSHORE LOUISIANA IN 450 FEET OR LESS OF WATER DEPTH. THE COMPANY HAS UNDER LEASE SEVEN FEDERAL OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF  BLOCKS (REFERRED TO AS \u201cLEASES\u201d IN THIS REPORT) AND LICENSED 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3-D) SEISMIC DATA  IN ITS AREA OF CONCENTRATION. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THIS DATA HAS BEEN REPROCESSED UTILIZING REVERSE TIME MIGRATION (RTM) TO MORE  ACCURATELY DEFINE THE IMAGING BELOW SALT. SINCE MARCH 2013, WE HAVE BEEN SINGULARLY FOCUSED ON IDENTIFYING HIGH-POTENTIAL OIL AND  NATURAL GAS PROSPECTS LOCATED ON THE SHELF IN THE U.S. GOM. WE HAVE EVALUATED OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA USING ADVANCED INTERPRETATION  TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT OF THESE ANALYSES, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND ACQUIRED LEASES ON MULTIPLE PROSPECTS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY CONTAIN  ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE HYDROCARBON DEPOSITS, AND WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT MORE REFINED ANALYSES OF OUR PROSPECTS AS WELL  AS TARGET ADDITIONAL LEASE AND PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS. WE HAVE GIVEN PREFERENCE TO AREAS WITH WATER DEPTHS OF 450 FEET OR LESS WHERE  PRODUCTION INFRASTRUCTURE ALREADY EXISTS, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR ANY DISCOVERIES TO BE DEVELOPED RAPIDLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY WITH  THE GOAL TO REDUCE ECONOMIC RISK WHILE INCREASING RETURNS. RECENT ACTIONS OF THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT (\u201cBOEM\u201d)  HAVE REDUCED THE ROYALTY RATE FOR LEASES ACQUIRED IN FUTURE LEASE SALES IN WATER DEPTHS OF LESS THAN 200 METERS (APPROXIMATELY  656 FEET) FROM 18.75% TO 12.5%, WHICH FURTHER ENHANCES THE ECONOMICS FOR THE DRILLING OF ANY LEASES ACQUIRED AFTER AUGUST 2017  IN THESE WATER DEPTHS. THIS REDUCED ROYALTY APPLIES TO THREE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES.  THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL  PERSON HOURS IN THE REPROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION OF SEISMIC DATA. WE BELIEVE THE PROPRIETARY REPROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION  AND THE CONTIGUOUS NATURE OF OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE OVER OTHER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION (\u201cE&P\u201d)  COMPANIES OPERATING IN OUR CORE AREA.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY OPERATED OUR BUSINESS  WITH WORKING CAPITAL DEFICITS AND THESE DEFICITS HAVE BEEN FUNDED BY EQUITY AND DEBT INVESTMENTS AND LOANS FROM MANAGEMENT. AS  OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD $3.8 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND, $3.1 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS FOR THE PAYMENT OF JOINT PAYABLES FROM  DRILLING OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL NEED TO RAISE A MINIMUM OF $10.0 MILLION TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS AND PLANNED  EXPENDITURES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021. THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCINGS.  THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WITH ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES  EXPERIENCED  MANAGEMENT  . OUR MANAGEMENT HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE IN FINDING AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS. OUR TEAM HAS A TRACK  RECORD OF DISCOVERING AND DEVELOPING MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PROJECTS WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS OVER 200  YEARS OF COMBINED INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE EXPLORING, DISCOVERING, AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS. WE SUCCESSFULLY DEPLOYED A TECHNICAL  TEAM WITH OVER 150 YEARS OF COMBINED INDUSTRY EXPERIENCE EXPLORING FOR AND DEVELOPING OIL AND NATURAL GAS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND  EXECUTION OF OUR TECHNICAL STRATEGY. WE BELIEVE THE APPLICATION OF ADVANCED GEOPHYSICAL TECHNIQUES ON A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA  WITH UNIQUE GEOLOGIC FEATURES SUCH AS CONVENTIONAL RESERVOIRS WHOSE TRAPPING CONFIGURATIONS HAVE BEEN OBSCURED BY OVERLYING SALT  LAYERS PROVIDES US WITH A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.  ADVANCED  SEISMIC IMAGE PROCESSING  . COMMERCIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN 3-D SEISMIC DATA IMAGING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED PROCESSING  ALGORITHMS, INCLUDING PRE-STACK DEPTH, BEAM, AND REVERSE TIME MIGRATION HAVE ALLOWED THE INDUSTRY TO BETTER DISTINGUISH HYDROCARBON  TRAPS AND IDENTIFY PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN PROSPECTS. SPECIFICALLY, ADVANCED PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IMPROVE THE DEFINITION OF THE SEISMIC  DATA FROM A SCALE OF TIME TO A SCALE OF DEPTH, THUS CORRECTLY LOCATING THE IMAGES IN THREE DIMENSIONS. OUR TECHNICAL TEAM HAS SIGNIFICANT  EXPERIENCE UTILIZING ADVANCED SEISMIC IMAGE PROCESSING TECHNIQUES IN OUR CORE AREA, AND WE APPLY THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MOST ADVANCED  NOISE REDUCTION TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE CLEARER IMAGES.  INDUSTRY  LEADING POSITION IN OUR CORE AREA  . WE HAVE LICENSED 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF 3D SEISMIC DATA WHICH COVERS OVER 440 OCS FEDERAL  LEASE BLOCKS ON THE HIGHLY PROLIFIC LOUISIANA OUTER SHELF, OFFSHORE GULF OF MEXICO. WE BELIEVE THE PROPRIETARY AND STATE-OF-THE-ART  REPROCESSING OF OUR LICENSED 3-D SEISMIC DATA, ALONG WITH OUR PROPRIETARY AND LEADING-EDGE GEOLOGIC DEPOSITIONAL RESERVOIR SAND  AND PETROLEUM TRAPPING MODELS, GIVES US AN ADVANTAGE IN ASSEMBLING A HIGH-QUALITY DRILLING PORTFOLIO IN OUR CORE AREA. WE CONTINUOUSLY  WORK TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL LEASING OPPORTUNITIES TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR DRILLING PORTFOLIO.  TECHNICAL STRATEGY  WE BELIEVE THAT  A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL HYDROCARBON ACCUMULATIONS GLOBALLY HAS BEEN THE INABILITY OF SEISMIC TECHNOLOGY TO ACCURATELY  IMAGE DEEPER GEOLOGIC FORMATIONS BECAUSE OF OVERLYING MASSIVE, EXTENSIVE, AND COMPLEX SALT BODIES. LARGE AND THICK LATERALLY EXTENSIVE  SUBSURFACE SALT LAYERS HIGHLY DISTORT THE SEISMIC RAY PATHS TRAVELING THROUGH THEM, WHICH OFTEN HAS LED TO MISINTERPRETATION OF  THE UNDERLYING GEOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL MAJOR ACCUMULATIONS OF OIL AND GAS. WE BELIEVE THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS FOR A TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN  COMPANY TO EXTENSIVELY APPLY ADVANCED SEISMIC ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES, WITH THE GOAL OF ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE COMMERCIAL  DISCOVERY RATES FOR EXPLORATORY WELLS, AND THEIR SUBSEQUENT APPRAISAL AND DEVELOPMENT, POTENTIALLY HAVING A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT  ON RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL. THESE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DEEP WATER EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION  WORLDWIDE, AND WE ARE USING THEM TO DRILL TARGETS BELOW THE SALT BODIES IN AN AREA OF THE SHALLOWER WATERS OF THE GOM WHERE INDUSTRY  ACTIVITY HAS LARGELY BEEN ABSENT FOR OVER 20 YEARS. IN FACT, GULFSLOPE MANAGEMENT LED THE EARLY INDUSTRY TEAMS IN THEIR SUCCESSFUL  EFFORTS TO DISCOVER AND DEVELOP FIVE NEW FIELDS BELOW THE EXTENSIVE SALT BODIES IN OUR CORE AREA DURING THE 1990\u2019S, WHICH  HAVE PRODUCED OVER 125 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT.  14  OUR TECHNICAL  APPROACH TO EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT IS TO DEPLOY A TEAM OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED GEO-SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE CURRENT AND EXTENSIVE  UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGY AND GEOPHYSICS OF THE PETROLEUM SYSTEM WITHIN OUR CORE AREA, THEREBY DECREASING THE TRADITIONAL TIMING  AND EXECUTION RISKS OF ADVANCING UP A LEARNING CURVE. FOR DATA LICENSING, RE-PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION, OUR TECHNICAL STAFF  HAS PRIORITIZED SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WITHIN OUR 2.2 MILLION ACRES OF SEISMIC COVERAGE, WITH THE GOAL TO OPTIMIZE INITIAL CAPITAL  OUTLAYS.  MODERN 3-D SEISMIC  DATASETS WITH ACQUISITION PARAMETERS THAT ARE OPTIMAL FOR IMPROVED IMAGING AT MULTIPLE DEPTHS ARE READILY AVAILABLE IN MANY OF  THESE SUB-BASINS ACROSS OUR CORE AREA, AND THEY CAN BE LICENSED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. THE APPLICATION OF STATE-OF-THE-ART  SEISMIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY IS NECESSARY TO OPTIMIZE DELINEATION OF PROSPECTIVE STRUCTURES AND TO DETECT THE PRESENCE OF HYDROCARBON-CHARGED  RESERVOIRS BELOW MANY COMPLEX SALT BODIES. AN EXAMPLE OF SUCH A SEISMIC TECHNOLOGY IS REVERSE TIME MIGRATION, WHICH WE BELIEVE  TO BE THE MOST ACCURATE, FASTEST, AND YET AFFORDABLE, SEISMIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY FOR CRITICAL DEPTH IMAGING AVAILABLE TODAY.  LEASE AND ACQUISITION  STRATEGY  OUR PROSPECT IDENTIFICATION  AND ANALYTICAL STRATEGY IS BASED ON A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGIC TRENDS WITHIN OUR CORE AREA. EXPLORATION EFFORTS HAVE  BEEN FOCUSED IN AREAS WHERE LEASE ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES ARE READILY AVAILABLE. WE ENTERED INTO TWO MASTER 3-D LICENSE AGREEMENTS,  TOGETHER COVERING APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION ACRES AND WE HAVE COMPLETED ADVANCED PROCESSING ON SELECT AREAS WITHIN THIS LICENSED  SEISMIC AREA EXCEEDING ONE MILLION ACRES. WE CAN EXPAND THIS COVERAGE AND PERFORM FURTHER ADVANCED PROCESSING, BOTH WITH CURRENTLY  LICENSED SEISMIC DATA AND SEISMIC DATA TO BE ACQUIRED. WE HAVE SOUGHT TO ACQUIRE AND REPROCESS THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION DATA AVAILABLE  IN THE POTENTIAL PROSPECT\u2019S DIRECT VICINITY. THIS INCLUDES ADVANCED IMAGING INFORMATION TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF A  PARTICULAR RESERVOIR\u2019S CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING BOTH TRAPPING MECHANICS AND FLUID MIGRATION PATTERNS. REPROCESSING IS ACCOMPLISHED  THROUGH A SERIES OF MODEL BUILDING STEPS THAT INCORPORATE THE GEOMETRY OF THE GEOLOGY TO OPTIMIZE THE FINAL IMAGE. OUR INTEGRATION  OF EXISTING GEOLOGIC UNDERSTANDING AND ENHANCED SEISMIC PROCESSING AND INTERPRETATION PROVIDES US WITH UNIQUE INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES  ON EXISTING PRODUCING AREAS AND ESPECIALLY UNDEREXPLORED FORMATIONS BELOW AND ADJACENT TO SALT BODIES THAT ARE HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE  FOR HYDROCARBON PRODUCTION.  WE CURRENTLY  HOLD SEVEN LEASES THAT COMPRISE FIVE PROSPECTS AND WE INTEND TO EVALUATE ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL SOURCES FOR GROWTH  OPPORTUNITIES WITH COMPANIES THAT HOLD ACTIVE LEASES IN OUR CORE AREA. OUR LEASES HAVE A FIVE-YEAR PRIMARY TERM, EXPIRING IN  2020, 2022 AND 2023. BOEM\u2019S REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PROVIDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS FOR LEASEHOLDERS TO APPLY TO RECEIVE  EXTENSIONS OF LEASE TERMS UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS. GULFSLOPE IS EXPLORING ALL OPTIONS CONTAINED IN BOEM\u2019S REGULATORY  FRAMEWORK TO EXTEND THE TERMS OF THE LEASES. ADDITIONAL PROSPECTIVE ACREAGE CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH LEASE SALES, FARM-IN, OR  PURCHASE. AS IS CONSISTENT WITH A PRUDENT AND SUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION APPROACH, WE BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL SEISMIC LICENSING,  ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, AND/OR INTERPRETATION MAY BECOME HIGHLY ADVANTAGEOUS, IN ORDER TO MORE PRECISELY DEFINE THE MOST  OPTIMAL DRILLABLE LOCATION(S), PARTICULARLY FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DISCOVERIES.  WE CONTINUE TO  EVALUATE POTENTIAL PRODUCING PROPERTY ACQUISITIONS IN THE OFFSHORE GOM, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR HIGHLY SPECIALIZED SUBSURFACE AND  ENGINEERING CAPABILITIES, KNOWLEDGE, AND EXPERTISE TO IDENTIFY ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. ANY MERGER OR ACQUISITION IS LIKELY TO  BE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY.  DRILLING AND  OTHER EXPLORATORY AND DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES  WITH OUR SUCCESS  IN THE LEASING OF OUR TARGETED PROSPECTS, OUR PLAN HAS BEEN TO PARTNER WITH OTHER ENTITIES WHICH COULD INCLUDE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES  AND/OR FINANCIAL INVESTORS. OUR GOAL IS TO DIVERSIFY RISK AND MINIMIZE CAPITAL EXPOSURE TO EXPLORATION DRILLING COSTS. WE EXPECT  A PORTION OF OUR EXPLORATION COSTS TO BE PAID BY OUR PARTNERS THROUGH THESE TRANSACTIONS, IN RETURN FOR OUR PREVIOUS INVESTMENT  IN PROSPECT GENERATION AND DELIVERY OF AN IDENTIFIED PROSPECT ON ACREAGE WE CONTROL. SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ARE A COMMONLY ACCEPTED  INDUSTRY METHOD OF PROPORTIONATELY RECOUPING PRE-DRILL COST OUTLAYS FOR SEISMIC, LAND, AND ASSOCIATED INTERPRETATION EXPENSES.  WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ENTER INTO ANY SUCH ARRANGEMENTS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS. IN ANY DRILLING,  WE EXPECT THAT OUR RETAINED WORKING INTEREST WILL BE ADJUSTED BASED UPON FACTORS SUCH AS GEOLOGIC RISK AND WELL COST. EARLY MONETIZATION  OF A DISCOVERED ASSET OR A PORTION OF A DISCOVERED ASSET IS AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY AS A MEANS TO FUND DEVELOPMENT OR ADDITIONAL  EXPLORATION PROJECTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO POTENTIAL EQUITY OR DEBT OFFERINGS. HOWEVER, IF A REASONABLE VALUE WERE NOT RECEIVED  FROM THE MARKET AT THE DISCOVERY STAGE, THEN WE MAY ELECT TO RETAIN (SUBJECT TO LEASE TERMS) THE DISCOVERY ASSET UNDEVELOPED, UNTIL  A REASONABLE OFFER IS RECEIVED IN LINE WITH OUR PERCEIVED MARKET VALUE, OR WE MAY ELECT TO SEEK DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS ON A PROMOTED  BASIS IN ORDER TO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL ALSO EVALUATE AND SEEK TO ACQUIRE PRODUCING PROPERTIES  THAT HAVE A STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP TO OUR CORE AREA.  15  CURRENT OPERATIONS  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN CONDUCTING PRE-DRILL  OPERATIONS FOR TWO PROSPECTS TO INCLUDE THE TAU PROSPECT WHICH IS ANTICIPATED TO BE REDRILLED IN 2020. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT  ITS CURRENT CLAIM UNDER THE POLICY WILL PROVIDE FOR A REPLACEMENT WELL WITH ALL COSTS COVERED TO THE DEPTH OF 15,254 FEET. THE  COMPANY WILL CONTINUE DRILLING OPERATIONS TO A TOTAL DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 21,000 FEET WITH INCREMENTAL COSTS TO BE BORNE BY THE  WORKING INTEREST PARTICIPANTS IN THE WELL. THE EXPLORATION PLAN AND THE APD FOR THIS WELL HAVE BEEN FILED WITH BOEM AND ARE PENDING  APPROVAL.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BE ACTIVE IN THE  EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS THAT IT DEEMS TO BE ATTRACTIVE OPPORTUNITIES. ANY SUCH MERGER OR ACQUISITION IS  LIKELY TO BE FINANCED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF DEBT AND EQUITY.  ON JANUARY 8, 2018, THE COMPANY SIGNED  COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTS RELATED TO PARTNERING WITH DELEK AND TEXAS SOUTH TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DRILLING OF NINE CURRENTLY LEASED  PROSPECTS. THE INITIAL PHASE (PHASE I) CONSISTS OF A COMMITMENT TO DRILL THE CANOE PROSPECT (VR378) AND THE TAU PROSPECT (SS336  AND SS351). THE COMPANY COMMENCED DRILLING OPERATIONS AT THE CANOE PROSPECT IN AUGUST 2018. THE WELL COMPLETED DRILLING IN AUGUST  2018 AND BASED ON LOGGING-WHILE-DRILLING (LWD) AND ISOTUBE ANALYSIS OF HYDROCARBON SAMPLES, OIL SANDS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN THE NORTHWEST  CENTER OF THE BLOCK. THE WELL WAS DRILLED TO A TOTAL OF 5,765 FEET MEASURED DEPTH (5,700 FEET TRUE VERTICAL DEPTH) AND ENCOUNTERED  NO PROBLEMS WHILE DRILLING. A FULL INTEGRATION OF THE WELL INFORMATION AND SEISMIC DATA IS BEING PERFORMED FOR FURTHER EVALUATION  OF THE SHALLOW POTENTIAL OF THE WELLBORE AND THE BLOCK, AND TO DEFINE COMMERCIALITY OF THESE OIL PAYS. THE WELL WAS TEMPORARILY  ABANDONED, AND MULTIPLE OPEN HOLE PLUGS WERE SET ACROSS SEVERAL INTERVALS. THE WELL IS EQUIPPED WITH A MUD-LINE SUSPENSION SYSTEM  FOR POSSIBLE FUTURE RE-ENTRY. A DEEPER SUBSALT PROSPECT ON THE CANOE LEASE BLOCK, FOR WHICH THE BLOCK WAS ORIGINALLY LEASED, IS  DRILL-READY, DUE TO FURTHER SEISMIC ENHANCEMENT.  THE TAU PROSPECT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY  SIX MILES NORTHEAST OF THE MAHOGANY FIELD, DISCOVERED IN 1993. THE MAHOGANY FIELD IS RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST COMMERCIAL DISCOVERY  BELOW ALLOCTHONOUS SALT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE TAU PROSPECT IS DEFINED BY MAPPING OF 3D SEISMIC REPROCESSED BY RTM METHODS.  DRILLING OPERATIONS ON THE TAU SUBSALT PROSPECT COMMENCED IN SEPTEMBER 2018. THE WELLBORE IS DESIGNED TO TEST MULTIPLE MIOCENE  HORIZONS TRAPPED AGAINST A WELL-DEFINED SALT FLANK, INCLUDING EQUIVALENT RESERVOIR SANDS DISCOVERED AND DEVELOPED AT THE NEARBY  MAHOGANY FIELD. THE SURFACE LOCATION FOR TAU IS LOCATED IN 305 FEET OF WATER. IN JANUARY 2019, THE TAU WELL EXPERIENCED AN UNDERGROUND  CONTROL OF WELL EVENT AND AS A RESULT, WE FILED AN INSURANCE CLAIM WITH ITS INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS FOR A NET AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY  $10.8 MILLION FOR 100% WORKING INTEREST. THE INSURANCE CLAIM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED. ON MAY 13, 2019, GULFSLOPE ANNOUNCED THE  TAU WELL WAS DRILLED TO A MEASURED DEPTH OF 15,254 FEET, AS COMPARED TO THE ORIGINALLY PERMITTED 29,857 FOOT MEASURED DEPTH. PRODUCIBLE  HYDROCARBON ZONES WERE NOT ESTABLISHED TO THE CURRENT DEPTH, BUT HYDROCARBON SHOWS WERE ENCOUNTERED. COMPLEX GEOMECHANICAL CONDITIONS  REQUIRED TWO BY-PASS WELLBORES, ONE SIDETRACK WELLBORE, AND EIGHT CASING STRINGS TO REACH THE CURRENT DEPTH. EQUIPMENT LIMITATIONS  PREVENT FURTHER DRILLING AT THIS TIME. IN ADDITION, THE DRILLING RIG HAD CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO ANOTHER OPERATOR. DUE  TO THESE FACTORS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO TEMPORARILY ABANDON THIS WELL IN A MANNER THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR RE-ENTRY AT A LATER  TIME. THE COMPANY IS PLANNING FOR A REDRILL OF THETAU PROSPECT IN 2020.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE COMPANY USES THE FULL COST METHOD OF  ACCOUNTING FOR ITS OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. UNDER THE FULL COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED  WITH SUCCESSFUL AND UNSUCCESSFUL EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CAPITALIZED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS INTO A SINGLE  COST CENTER (\u201cFULL COST POOL\u201d). SUCH COSTS INCLUDE PROPERTY ACQUISITION COSTS, GEOLOGICAL AND GEOPHYSICAL (\u201cG&G\u201d)  COSTS, CARRYING CHARGES ON NON-PRODUCING PROPERTIES, COSTS OF DRILLING BOTH PRODUCTIVE AND NON-PRODUCTIVE WELLS. OVERHEAD COSTS,  WHICH INCLUDES EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCURRED THAT ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO ACQUISITION,  EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE CAPITALIZED. INTEREST EXPENSE IS CAPITALIZED RELATED TO UNEVALUATED PROPERTIES AND WELLS  IN PROCESS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INCURRING COSTS AND EXPENDING RESOURCES TO GET THE PROPERTIES READY FOR THEIR  INTENDED PURPOSE. FOR SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT BEING CURRENTLY  DEPRECIATED, DEPLETED, OR AMORTIZED AND ON WHICH EXPLORATION OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE IN PROGRESS, INTEREST COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED.  PROCEEDS FROM PROPERTY SALES WILL GENERALLY BE CREDITED TO THE FULL COST POOL, WITH NO GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED, UNLESS SUCH A SALE  WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAPITALIZED COSTS AND THE PROVED RESERVES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT  ALTERATION WOULD TYPICALLY INVOLVE A SALE OF 25% OR MORE OF THE PROVED RESERVES RELATED TO A SINGLE FULL COST POOL.  PROVED PROPERTIES ARE AMORTIZED ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY  BASIS USING THE UNITS OF PRODUCTION METHOD (\u201cUOP\u201d), WHEREBY CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER TOTAL PROVED RESERVES.  THE AMORTIZATION BASE IN THE UOP CALCULATION INCLUDES THE SUM OF PROVED PROPERTY, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND  AMORTIZATION (\u201cDD&A\u201d), ESTIMATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENT COSTS (FUTURE COSTS TO ACCESS AND DEVELOP PROVED RESERVES),  AND ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS, LESS RELATED SALVAGE VALUE.  16  THE COSTS OF UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND RELATED  CAPITALIZED COSTS (SUCH AS G&G COSTS) ARE WITHHELD FROM THE AMORTIZATION CALCULATION UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THEY ARE EITHER DEVELOPED  OR ABANDONED. UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST QUARTERLY AND ARE DETERMINED  THROUGH AN EVALUATION CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, SEISMIC DATA, REQUIREMENTS TO RELINQUISH ACREAGE, DRILLING RESULTS, REMAINING  TIME IN THE COMMITMENT PERIOD, REMAINING CAPITAL PLAN, AND POLITICAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IN COUNTRIES WHERE PROVED  RESERVES EXIST, EXPLORATORY DRILLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DRY HOLES ARE TRANSFERRED TO PROVED PROPERTIES IMMEDIATELY UPON DETERMINATION  THAT A WELL IS DRY AND AMORTIZED ACCORDINGLY. IN COUNTRIES WHERE A RESERVE BASE HAS NOT YET BEEN ESTABLISHED, IMPAIRMENTS ARE CHARGED  TO EARNINGS.  COMPANIES THAT USE THE FULL COST METHOD  OF ACCOUNTING FOR OIL AND NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM A CEILING TEST CALCULATION  EACH QUARTER. THE FULL COST CEILING TEST IS AN IMPAIRMENT TEST PRESCRIBED BY SEC REGULATION S-X RULE 4-10. THE CEILING TEST IS  PERFORMED QUARTERLY, ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS, UTILIZING THE AVERAGE OF PRICES IN EFFECT ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH FOR  THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THE COST CENTER CEILING IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF (A) ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES, DISCOUNTED  AT 10% PER ANNUM, FROM PROVED RESERVES, (B) THE COST OF PROPERTIES NOT BEING AMORTIZED, IF ANY, AND (C) THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET  VALUE OF UNPROVED PROPERTIES INCLUDED IN THE COST BEING AMORTIZED. IF SUCH CAPITALIZED COSTS EXCEED THE CEILING, THE COMPANY WILL  RECORD A WRITE-DOWN TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH EXCESS AS A NON-CASH CHARGE TO EARNINGS. ANY SUCH WRITE-DOWN WILL REDUCE EARNINGS IN  THE PERIOD OF OCCURRENCE AND RESULTS IN A LOWER DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION RATE IN FUTURE PERIODS. A WRITE-DOWN MAY  NOT BE REVERSED IN FUTURE PERIODS EVEN THOUGH HIGHER OIL AND NATURAL GAS PRICES MAY SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASE THE CEILING.  THE  COMPANY CAPITALIZES EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS INTO OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES UNTIL A DETERMINATION IS MADE THAT THE WELL HAS EITHER FOUND  PROVED RESERVES OR IS IMPAIRED. IF PROVED RESERVES ARE FOUND, THE CAPITALIZED EXPLORATORY WELL COSTS ARE RECLASSIFIED TO PROVED  PROPERTIES. THE WELL COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE IF THE EXPLORATORY WELL IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY HAS DRILLED  TWO WELL BORES AND IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING SUCH WELLS FOR PROVED RESERVES. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH COSTS ARE INCLUDED AS SUSPENDED  WELL COSTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT A FINAL ANALYSIS WILL BE COMPLETED IN THE NEXT NINE MONTHS AT WHICH TIME  THE COSTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE FULL COST POOL.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES CONSISTED OF WELLS IN PROCESS, CAPITALIZED EXPLORATION AND ACQUISITION COSTS FOR UNPROVED PROPERTIES AND  NO PROVED RESERVES.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE CARRIED AT COST.  WE ASSESS THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE  THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  THERE HAS BEEN NO CHANGE TO OUR CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES  AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON DECEMBER 30, 2019.  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  THERE WAS NO REVENUE DURING THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OVERHEAD REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR WORKING INTEREST PARTNERS. INTEREST EXPENSE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.02 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 NET OF APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE CAPITALIZED TO UNEVALUATED OIL  AND NATURAL GAS PROPERTIES, AS COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY  $0.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND NIL FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THIS INCREASE WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOAN EXTINGUISHMENT AND RESTRUCTURE PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST CONVERSIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON  STOCK FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. GAIN ON DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT WAS $1.2 MILLION AND A LOSS OF $0.2  MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE  UNDERLYING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED ACCUMULATED LOSSES  FOR THE PERIOD FROM INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 2019, OF APPROXIMATELY $55.7 MILLION, AND HAS A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $19.6  MILLION. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED LOSSES OF $0.2 MILLION AND NET CASH FLOWS FROM  OPERATIONS OF $1.8 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD $3.8 MILLION OF CASH ON HAND, $3.1 MILLION OF THIS AMOUNT IS FOR JOINT  PAYABLES FROM DRILLING OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT IT WILL NEED TO RAISE A MINIMUM OF $10 MILLION TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS  AND PLANNED EXPENDITURES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021. THE $10 MILLION IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL PROJECT EXPENDITURES AS WELL  AS GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. IT DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY AMOUNTS DUE UNDER OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH AMOUNTED  TO $13.3 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE COMPANY PLANS TO FINANCE ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS.  OUR POLICY HAS BEEN TO PERIODICALLY RAISE FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY ON A LIMITED BASIS, TO AVOID UNDUE DILUTION WHILE AT  THE EARLY STAGES OF EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN. SHORT TERM NEEDS HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY FUNDED THROUGH LOANS FROM EXECUTIVE  MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE WITH ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. IF THE COMPANY IS NOT SUCCESSFUL  IN OBTAINING FINANCING, OPERATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CURTAILED OR CEASED. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  17  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION OF NET CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $0.4  MILLION OF NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $5.8 MILLION  DECREASE IN RECEIVABLES OFFSET BY A $4.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

THIS INCREASE IS DUE TO DEBT PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE PURCHASE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS  TO COVER EXPENDITURES PLANNED AFTER FEBRUARY 2020, AS WELL AS ANY ADDITIONAL, UNEXPECTED EXPENDITURES THAT WE MAY ENCOUNTER. FUTURE  EQUITY FINANCINGS MAY BE DILUTIVE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF FUTURE FINANCINGS MAY INCLUDE PREFERENCES OR RIGHTS  SUPERIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK. DEBT FINANCINGS MAY INVOLVE A PLEDGE OF ASSETS AND WILL RANK SENIOR TO OUR COMMON STOCK. WE HAVE  HISTORICALLY FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH PRIVATE EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY CREDIT OR EQUITY FACILITIES  AVAILABLE WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, STOCKHOLDERS OR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON BEST EFFORTS FINANCINGS.  THE FAILURE TO RAISE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL COULD CAUSE US TO CEASE OPERATIONS, OR THE COMPANY WOULD NEED TO SELL ASSETS OR CONSIDER  ALTERNATIVE PLANS UP TO AND INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING.

OTHER INCOME, NET INCREASED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF THE $14 MILLION GAIN WE REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF THESE SECURITIES, WHILE IT INCREASED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 10.2% COMPARED TO 12.6% FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES REFLECT THE IMPACT OF A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR EARNINGS, PRIMARILY INCOME FROM OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS, BEING TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT RATES BELOW THE U.S. STATUTORY TAX RATE.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE LAPSE OF STATUES OF LIMITATIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES IN DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SAME ITEMS THAT IMPACTED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN FISCAL 2019.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d) WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM INCLUDING A REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%, THE IMPOSITION OF A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND THE CREATION OF NEW TAXES ON CERTAIN FOREIGN-SOURCED EARNINGS.  AS OF APRIL 26, 2019, WE HAD COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, HOWEVER, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON OUR BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND RECOGNIZE ANY ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED.  WE RECOGNIZED A $50 MILLION DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE LAPSE OF CERTAIN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING STANDARD AND, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 25, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A $34 MILLION DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS RESULTING FROM THE RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THE NEW REVENUE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $187 MILLION OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. INCLUSIVE OF PENALTIES, INTEREST AND CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS, $165 MILLION WOULD AFFECT OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IF RECOGNIZED, AND $167 MILLION HAS BEEN RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES AND THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF THE EXPECTED EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IN VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT EITHER CERTAIN AUDITS WILL CONCLUDE, CERTAIN STATUTES OF LIMITATIONS WILL LAPSE, OR BOTH. AS A RESULT OF UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TAX AUDITS AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, AN ESTIMATE OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE IMPACTS TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS CANNOT BE MADE AT THIS TIME.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.3 BILLION PAID FOR THE REPURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $400 MILLION USED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF OUR SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 2019, $334 MILLION USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $100 MILLION IN PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $443 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, $96 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTIES, AND $677 MILLION OF CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED BY $1.0 BILLION TO $0.7 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 COMPARED TO APRIL 26, 2019 PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE DECREASES IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH CONVERSION CYCLE.

DSO IS BASED ON ENDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET REVENUE FOR EACH PERIOD. DSO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY AVERAGE NET REVENUE PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER (91 DAYS FOR EACH OF THE QUARTERS PRESENTED ABOVE). DSO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019, WHILE IT DECREASED COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO LOWER SEASONAL INVOICING LEVELS AND MORE FAVORABLE SHIPPING LINEARITY.  (2)  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING, REFERRED TO AS DIO, MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM PROCUREMENT TO SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS. DIO IS BASED ON ENDING INVENTORY AND COST OF REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD. DIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUES PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER. DIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019 AS A RESULT OF HIGHER LEVELS OF ON HAND INVENTORY AND LOWER COST OF REVENUES IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD, WHILE IT WAS RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  (3)  DAYS PAYABLES OUTSTANDING, REFERRED TO AS DPO, CALCULATES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR PAYABLES REMAIN OUTSTANDING BEFORE PAYMENT. DPO IS BASED ON ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND COST OF REVENUES FOR EACH PERIOD. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUES PER DAY FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER. DPO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF FISCAL 2019, WHILE IT DECREASED COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PURCHASES FROM CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS.  (4)  THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE IS THE SUM OF DSO AND DIO LESS DPO. ITEMS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE CASH CONVERSION CYCLE IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD TO DIFFER INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN BUSINESS MIX, CHANGES IN PAYMENT TERMS (INCLUDING EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS FROM SUPPLIERS), THE EXTENT OF SHIPMENT LINEARITY, SEASONAL TRENDS AND THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INVENTORY PURCHASES WITHIN THE PERIOD.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE GENERATED CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $677 MILLION, REFLECTING NET INCOME OF $623 MILLION, ADJUSTED BY NON-CASH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF $146 MILLION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $118 MILLION, AND A GAIN ON SALE OF PROPERTIES OF $38 MILLION, COMPARED TO $942 MILLION OF CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  CHANGES IN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  DECREASED $394 MILLION, REFLECTING LOWER DSO.  \u2022  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  DECREASED $158 MILLION, REFLECTING LOWER DPO.  \u2022  ACCRUED EXPENSES  DECREASED $273 MILLION,  PRIMARILY DUE TO EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PAYOUTS RELATED TO FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMMISSIONS AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS AND PAYMENTS OF INCOME TAXES.  WE EXPECT THAT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES MAY MATERIALLY FLUCTUATE IN FUTURE PERIODS DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SHIPMENT LINEARITY, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS PERFORMANCE, INVENTORY AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, VENDOR PAYMENT INITIATIVES, TAX BENEFITS OR CHARGES FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION AND OTHER PAYMENTS.  37  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE GENERATED $1.3 BILLION FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES, AND PAID $100 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WHILE DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WE GENERATED $661 MILLION FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS, NET OF PURCHASES, AND PAID $138 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE RECEIVED $96 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF LAND IN SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNIA AND PAID $56 MILLION NET TO ACQUIRE A PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANY.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, WE USED $1.3 BILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF 22 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $334 MILLION FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $400 MILLION  FOR THE REPAYMENT OF OUR SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 2019, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $443 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, COMPARED TO $1.6 BILLION USED FOR THE REPURCHASE OF 22 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, $306 MILLION USED FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, AND $221 MILLION USED FOR THE REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, NET, DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  KEY FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOWS INCLUDE CHANGES IN OUR REVENUE MIX AND PROFITABILITY, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, IN PARTICULAR, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INVENTORIES, THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES AND PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS, THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, OUR ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATE ACQUIRED PRODUCTS, BUSINESSES AND TECHNOLOGIES AND THE TIMING OF REPAYMENTS OF OUR DEBT. BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND OUR CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING POTENTIAL FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT, EQUITY OR OTHER SECURITIES, WILL SATISFY OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS, STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH DIVIDENDS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATIONS AND MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OUR LIQUIDITY IS INSUFFICIENT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO CURTAIL SPENDING AND IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL COST SAVING MEASURES AND RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OR ENTER INTO NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE CASH FLOWS AT OR ABOVE CURRENT LEVELS OR THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING, IF NECESSARY, ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL.  LIQUIDITY  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 CONSISTED OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH WE EXPECT TO GENERATE FROM OPERATIONS, AND OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND RELATED CREDIT FACILITY.  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING (IN MILLIONS).

AS A PART OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR PROJECTED GLOBAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND HAVE DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN HISTORICAL AND FUTURE FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL NO LONGER BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.  OUR PRINCIPAL LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SUPPORT ONGOING BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MEET CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS, INVEST IN CRITICAL OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES, SERVICE INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR DEBT, FUND OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND PAY DIVIDENDS, AS AND IF DECLARED.  THE PRINCIPAL OBJECTIVES OF OUR INVESTMENT POLICY ARE THE PRESERVATION OF PRINCIPAL AND MAINTENANCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE DEFAULT RISK BY INVESTING IN HIGH-QUALITY INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES, LIMITING THE TIME TO MATURITY AND MONITORING THE COUNTER-PARTIES AND UNDERLYING OBLIGORS CLOSELY. WE BELIEVE OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE LIQUID AND ACCESSIBLE. WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS OR INVESTMENTS FROM THE VALUES REPORTED AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020.  38  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK DUE TO TRENDS IN THE CREDIT AND CAPITAL MARKETS. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR CURRENT ECONOMIC AND MARKET EVENTS TO MINIMIZE THE MARKET RISK OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  WE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES.  WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. BASED ON PAST PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, WE BELIEVE OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, AND ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS AND COMMITTED CREDIT LINES WILL SATISFY, THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, BOTH IN TOTAL AND DOMESTICALLY, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STOCK REPURCHASES, CASH DIVIDENDS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS, PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS.  WE ALSO HAVE AN AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  (SEC).  WE MAY IN THE FUTURE OFFER AN ADDITIONAL UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DEBT, EQUITY AND OTHER SECURITIES.

AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE BORROWED, REPAID AND RE-BORROWED, WITH THE AGGREGATE FACE OR PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM AT ANY TIME NOT TO EXCEED $1.0 BILLION.  THE MATURITIES OF THE NOTES CAN VARY, BUT MAY NOT EXCEED 397 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. THE NOTES ARE SOLD UNDER CUSTOMARY TERMS IN THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET AND MAY BE ISSUED AT A DISCOUNT FROM PAR OR, ALTERNATIVELY, MAY BE SOLD AT PAR AND BEAR INTEREST AT RATES DICTATED BY MARKET CONDITIONS AT THE TIME OF THEIR ISSUANCE.  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES ARE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES OUTSTANDING WITH AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $694 MILLION, A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 1.97% AND MATURITIES GENERALLY LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, WE HAVE A SENIOR UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 10, 2021. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A $1.0 BILLION REVOLVING UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY THAT SERVES AS A BACK-UP FOR THE PROGRAM. PROCEEDS FROM THE FACILITY MAY ALSO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, PROVIDING ANOTHER POTENTIAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CREDIT FACILITY EXCEEDS THE OUTSTANDING DEBT ISSUED UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO INCLUDES OPTIONS THAT ALLOW US TO REQUEST AN INCREASE IN THE FACILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION AND TO EXTEND ITS MATURITY DATE FOR TWO ADDITIONAL ONE-YEAR PERIODS, BOTH SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL ASSOCIATED COVENANTS IN THIS AGREEMENT. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THIS FACILITY DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING OUR COMMITMENTS RELATED TO FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT, OPERATING LEASES AND INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS THROUGH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS CANNOT BE PRECISELY DETERMINED AND WILL DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING FUTURE DEMAND FOR PRODUCTS, CHANGES IN THE NETWORK STORAGE INDUSTRY, HIRING PLANS AND OUR DECISIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCING OF OUR FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 TO BE BETWEEN $50 MILLION AND $75 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON FEBRUARY 12, 2020, WE DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.48 PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, PAYABLE ON APRIL 22, 2020 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 3, 2020.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $13.6 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  UNDER THIS PROGRAM,  WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK THROUGH SOLICITED OR UNSOLICITED TRANSACTIONS IN THE OPEN MARKET, IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, THROUGH ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, PURSUANT TO A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN OR IN SUCH OTHER MANNER AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY OUR MANAGEMENT.  THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. SINCE THE MAY 13, 2003 INCEPTION OF THIS PROGRAM THROUGH JANUARY 24, 2020, WE REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 335 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $38.76 PER SHARE, FOR AN AGGREGATE PURCHASE PRICE OF $13.0 BILLION. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, THE REMAINING AUTHORIZED AMOUNT FOR STOCK REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM WAS $0.6 BILLION.  39  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS AND FUTURE DIVIDENDS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, CORPORATE BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  PURCHASE ORDERS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE MAKE COMMITMENTS TO OUR THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANAGE MANUFACTURER LEAD TIMES AND MEET PRODUCT FORECASTS, AND TO OTHER PARTIES TO PURCHASE VARIOUS KEY COMPONENTS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REPORTED PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARISING FROM THESE AGREEMENTS CONSISTS OF FIRM, NON-CANCELABLE, AND UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $486 MILLION IN NON-CANCELABLE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR INVENTORY. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR FIRM, NON-CANCELABLE AND UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FOR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF OUR FUTURE DEMAND FORECASTS CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUATION OF OUR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH FORECASTS ARE NOT ACHIEVED, OUR COMMITMENTS AND ASSOCIATED ACCRUALS MAY CHANGE.  IN ADDITION TO INVENTORY COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS, WE HAVE OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS AND CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED GOODS OR SERVICES. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAD $7 MILLION IN CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS AND $234 MILLION IN OTHER PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.  UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, OUR LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WAS $167 MILLION, INCLUDING INTEREST, PENALTIES AND CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS. DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING TAX AUDITS AND THEIR POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATES OF THE PERIOD OF CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.  FINANCING GUARANTEES  WHILE MOST OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR SALES INCLUDE SHORT-TERM PAYMENT TERMS, FROM TIME TO TIME WE PROVIDE LONG-TERM FINANCING TO CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMERS. WE HAVE GENERALLY SOLD RECEIVABLES FINANCED THROUGH THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS TO THIRD PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS WITHIN 10 DAYS OF THE CONTRACTS\u2019 DATES OF EXECUTION, AND WE CLASSIFY THE PROCEEDS FROM THESE SALES AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. WE ACCOUNT FOR THE SALES OF THESE RECEIVABLES AS \u201cTRUE SALES\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ON TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, AS WE ARE CONSIDERED TO HAVE SURRENDERED CONTROL OF THESE FINANCING RECEIVABLES. PROVIDED ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET, WE RECOGNIZE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR THESE ARRANGEMENTS, NET OF ANY PAYMENT DISCOUNTS FROM FINANCING TRANSACTIONS, UPON PRODUCT ACCEPTANCE. WE SOLD $49 MILLION AND $54 MILLION OF RECEIVABLES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH LEASING COMPANIES FOR THE SALE OF OUR HARDWARE SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THESE LEASING COMPANIES, IN TURN, LEASE OUR PRODUCTS TO END-USERS. THE LEASING COMPANIES GENERALLY HAVE NO RECOURSE TO US IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY THE END-USER AND WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON DELIVERY TO THE END-USER CUSTOMER, IF ALL OTHER REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.  SOME OF THE LEASING ARRANGEMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE HAVE BEEN FINANCED ON A RECOURSE BASIS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING INSTITUTIONS. UNDER THE TERMS OF RECOURSE LEASES, WHICH ARE GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS, WE REMAIN LIABLE FOR THE AGGREGATE UNPAID REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS TO THE THIRD-PARTY LEASING COMPANIES IN THE EVENT OF END-USER CUSTOMER DEFAULT. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COLLATERALIZED BY A SECURITY INTEREST IN THE UNDERLYING ASSETS. WHERE WE PROVIDE A GUARANTEE FOR RECOURSE LEASES AND COLLECTABILITY IS PROBABLE, WE ACCOUNT FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AS SALES TYPE LEASES. IF COLLECTABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE, THE CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS A DEPOSIT LIABILITY AND REVENUE IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEEMED COLLECTIBLE. FOR LEASES THAT WE ARE NOT A PARTY TO, OTHER THAN PROVIDING RECOURSE, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN CONTROL IS TRANSFERRED. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020 AND APRIL 26, 2019, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT BY WHICH SUCH CONTINGENCIES EXCEEDED THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES UNDER OUR LEASE FINANCING PROGRAMS OR OTHER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR END-USER CUSTOMERS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. IF A SERVICE CONTRACT IS TERMINATED AS A RESULT OF OUR NON-PERFORMANCE UNDER THE CONTRACT OR OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF THE FINANCING ARRANGEMENT, WE COULD, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, BE REQUIRED TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN ASSETS RELATED TO THE SERVICE CONTRACT OR TO PAY THE AGGREGATE UNPAID PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF JANUARY 24, 2020, WE HAVE NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, AND WE BELIEVE THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING TO ACQUIRE A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF ASSETS OR MAKE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS IS REMOTE. THE PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT THAT REPRESENTS UNEARNED SERVICES REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND FINANCED UNEARNED SERVICES REVENUE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS  WE ENTER INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. GENERALLY, THESE INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS REQUIRE US TO REIMBURSE LOSSES SUFFERED BY THE THIRD-PARTIES DUE TO VARIOUS EVENTS, SUCH AS LAWSUITS ARISING FROM PATENT OR COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. THESE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS ARE CONSIDERED OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS UNDER ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.  40  LEGAL CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS WHICH ARISE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF OUR COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR UNAUDITED  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THE REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF SELECTED EVENTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS.  OVERVIEW  SINO-GLOBAL HAS FOCUSED  ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH CUSTOMIZED SHIPPING AGENCY SERVICES BUT HAS SINCE BEGUN LOOKING AGGRESSIVELY AT DIVERSIFYING ITS REVENUE  AND SERVICE MIX BY SEEKING NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS DUE TO INCREASED MARGIN COMPRESSION. THESE OPPORTUNITIES  HAVE RANGED FROM COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES TO OTHER SERVICE AND PRODUCT INITIATIVES.  WITH THE HOPE OF BRINGING  US BACK TO THE SHIPPING MANAGEMENT BUSINESS, ON APRIL 10, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR. WEIJUN  QIN, CEO OF A SHIPPING MANAGEMENT COMPANY IN CHINA, TO SET UP A JOINT VENTURE IN NEW YORK NAMED STATE PRIESTS MANAGEMENT LTD. (\u201cSTATE  PRIESTS\u201d), OF WHICH WE HOLD 90% EQUITY INTEREST. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED ANY CASH CONTRIBUTION TO THE JOINT VENTURE AND THERE  HAS BEEN NO OPERATION OF THE JOINT VENTURE PENDING THE INTERNATIONAL SHIP SAFETY MANAGEMENT CERTIFICATE FROM THE CHINA CLASSIFICATION  SOCIETY (THE \u201cCERTIFICATE\u201d). WE STARTED PROVIDING SHIPPING MANAGEMENT RELATED SERVICES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE CERTIFICATE  WHICH INCLUDES ARRANGING AND COORDINATION FOR SHIP MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION THIS QUARTER.  ON NOVEMBER 6, 2019,  WE SIGNED A REVISED COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR. QIN TO RESTRUCTURE OUR EQUITY INTEREST IN STATE PRIESTS. DUE TO STATE PRIESTS\u2019  FAILURE TO TIMELY OBTAIN THE NECESSARY APPROVAL FROM RELATED AUTHORITIES, MR. QIN AGREED TO EXCHANGE 80% EQUITY INTEREST IN SEA  CONTINENT MANAGEMENT LTD. (\u201cSEA CONTINENT\u201d), ANOTHER ENTITY HE OWNS, FOR OUR 90% EQUITY INTEREST IN STATE PRIESTS.  SEA CONTINENT ALREADY HAS THE CERTIFICATE FOR ITS OPERATIONS ALTHOUGH IT HAS NO OPERATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019.  TO ADAPT TO THE  CHANGING CHINA MARKET, WHICH HAS A HIGH DEMAND FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND AGRICULTURAL BY-PRODUCTS, ONE OF THE  COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS STRATEGIES IS TO PROVIDE SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PURCHASE OF THE U.S AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS  AND THE SHIPMENT OF THESE PRODUCTS TO CHINA USING ITS OVERALL SUPPLY CHAIN LOGISTICS. ON JANUARY 10, 2020, THE COMPANY  ENTERED INTO A COOPERATION AGREEMENT WITH MR. SHANMING LIANG, A DIRECTOR OF GUANGXI JINQIAO INDUSTRIAL GROUP CO., LTD., TO  SET UP A JOINT VENTURE IN NEW YORK NAMED LSM TRADING LTD. (\u201cLSM TRADING\u201d) TO ENGAGE IN TRADING BUSINESS, OF WHICH  WE HOLD 40% EQUITY INTEREST. NO INVESTMENT HAS BEEN MADE BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT. LSM TRADING WILL  FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF THE AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES AND AGRICULTURAL BY-PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. FOR CUSTOMERS IN CHINA AND  THE COMPANY WILL PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS SOLUTIONS.  COMPANY STRUCTURE  THE COMPANY, FOUNDED  IN 2001, IS A NON-ASSET BASED GLOBAL SHIPPING AND FREIGHT LOGISTICS INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS PROVIDER. WE PROVIDE TAILORED SOLUTIONS  AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES FOR OUR CUSTOMERS TO DRIVE EFFICIENCY AND CONTROL IN RELATED STEPS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE SHIPPING AND  FREIGHT LOGISTICS CHAIN. WE CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN THE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC  OF CHINA (THE \u201cPRC\u201d) (INCLUDING HONG KONG) AND THE U.S., WHERE A MAJORITY OF OUR CLIENTS ARE LOCATED.  WE OPERATE IN FOUR  OPERATING SEGMENTS, INCLUDING (1) SHIPPING AGENCY AND MANAGEMENT SERVICES, OPERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARY IN HONG KONG AND THE U.S.;  (2) INLAND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES, OPERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE U.S.; (3) FREIGHT LOGISTICS SERVICES, OPERATED  BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE PRC AND THE U.S.; AND (4) CONTAINER TRUCKING SERVICES, OPERATED BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN THE PRC AND THE  U.S.  28  OUR CORPORATE STRUCTURE  DIAGRAM AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT IS AS BELOW.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND 2018  REVENUES  REVENUES DECREASED  BY $8,494,163 OR 80.8%, FROM $10,515,287 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $2,021,124 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN CERTAIN FREIGHT LOGISTICS CONTRACTS THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH CUSTOMERS STARTING  FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ONLY ACTED AS AN AGENT AND DID NOT CONTROL THE SERVICES RENDERED TO THE CUSTOMERS  IN ORDER TO REDUCE POSSIBLE RISKS AS A RESULT OF THE UNCERTAINTIES IN CURRENT TRADE ENVIRONMENTS. AS SUCH OUR REVENUES ON THESE  CONTRACTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR ON A NET BASIS. THE DECREASE WAS ALSO DUE TO THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM INLAND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT  SERVICES AS OUR SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS HAVE EXPIRED AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW CUSTOMERS FOR THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES  PRESENT SUMMARY INFORMATION BY SEGMENTS MAINLY REGARDING THE TOP-LINE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2019 AND 2018.

THE DECREASE IN THIS SEGMENT WAS DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE SHIPPING AGENCY SERVICES  PROVIDED, WHERE WE FOCUSED MORE ON SHIPPING MANAGEMENT SERVICES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. OUR INTEGRATED SHIPPING  MANAGEMENT SERVICES INCLUDED ARRANGING AND COORDINATING SHIP MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION, REPAIRS, AND OTHER SERVICES. WITH THE  REQUIRED CERTIFICATION OBTAINED BY OUR 90% OWNED JOINT VENTURE, SEA CONTINENT, WE EXPECT TO PERFORM MORE SERVICES SUCH AS SHIP  INSURANCE, CREW RECRUITMENT, TRAINING AND SUPPLY AND SHIP SPARE PARTS SALES.  30  (2) REVENUES FROM INLAND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, INLAND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SERVICES GENERATED RELATED-PARTY REVENUE OF $0 AND $75,000,  RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE GENERATED FROM TENGDA NORTHWEST FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 AMOUNTED TO $0 AND  $345,000, RESPECTIVELY. THE OVERALL DECREASE IN REVENUES GENERATED FROM THIS SEGMENT AMOUNTED TO $420,000 OR 100.0% DUE TO THE  EXPIRATION OF OUR INLAND TRANSPORTATION MANAGEMENT SERVICE CONTRACTS WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED CUSTOMERS. WE ARE NOT ACTIVELY DEVELOPING  BUSINESS IN THIS SEGMENT AND WILL ONLY PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS ON SHORT TERM CONTRACTS.  (3) REVENUES FROM FREIGHT LOGISTICS SERVICES  FREIGHT LOGISTICS SERVICES  PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CARGO FORWARDING, BROKERAGE AND OTHER FREIGHT SERVICES. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, REVENUES  DECREASED BY $7,475,423 OR APPROXIMATELY 83.3%. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IN CERTAIN FREIGHT LOGISTICS CONTRACTS  THAT WE ENTERED INTO WITH CUSTOMERS STARTING FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE ACTED AS AN AGENT IN ARRANGING THE  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER AND DID NOT CONTROL THE SERVICES RENDERED TO THE CUSTOMER  AS WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY RESPONSIBLE PARTY TO FULFILL THE SERVICES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, GROSS REVENUE  AND GROSS COST OF REVENUE RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $12.9 MILLION AND $12.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER,  DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED REASON, OUR REVENUES ON THESE CONTRACTS WERE ONLY ACCOUNTED FOR ON A NET BASIS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 38.7% FROM APPROXIMATELY 16.5% FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO APPROXIMATELY 55.2% FOR THE  SAME PERIOD IN 2019. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 1) THE AFOREMENTIONED FREIGHT LOGISTICS CONTRACTS  WHERE WE ACTED AS AGENTS; 2) CHANGE IN THE MIX OF SERVICES PROVIDED. EVEN WITH THE SAME CUSTOMER, EVERY TRANSACTION HAS A UNIQUE  GROSS MARGIN DUE TO DIFFERENT SERVICE SCOPES. GENERALLY, AN ENGAGEMENT WHERE WE PROVIDE A BROADER SET OF SERVICES GENERATES A HIGHER  GROSS MARGIN, AND AN ENGAGEMENT OF A MORE LIMITED SCOPE OF SERVICES HAS A LOWER GROSS MARGIN.  (4) REVENUES FROM CONTAINER TRUCKING SERVICES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, REVENUES GENERATED FROM CONTAINER TRUCKING SERVICES WERE $17,624 AND $227,294, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERALL REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT DECREASED BY $209,670 OR APPROXIMATELY 92.2%. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM THIS SEGMENT WAS  PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENT TRADE DYNAMIC BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, WHICH RESULTED IN THE DECREASED CONTAINER SHIPMENTS FROM CHINA  TO THE U.S. THE RELATED GROSS PROFIT INCREASED BY $4,806 FROM GROSS LOSS OF $2,597 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO GROSS PROFIT OF $2,209 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019 AND GROSS PROFIT MARGIN INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 13.6% PERIOD OVER PERIOD.  OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES  OPERATING COSTS AND  EXPENSES DECREASED BY $9,339,829 OR APPROXIMATELY 79.9%, FROM $11,693,948 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 TO $2,354,119  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. THIS DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE, SELLING EXPENSES,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE OVERALL COST OF REVENUES AS A PERCENTAGE OF OUR REVENUES DECREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY 81.4% FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, TO APPROXIMATELY 37.4% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2019. COST OF REVENUES FOR FREIGHT LOGISTICS  AND CONTAINER TRUCKING SERVICES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FREIGHT COSTS TO VARIOUS FREIGHT CARRIERS. THE DECREASE OF COSTS WAS MAINLY  DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED CERTAIN FREIGHT LOGISTIC CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ONLY ACTED AS AN AGENT AND DID NOT CONTROL THE SERVICES  RENDERED TO THE CUSTOMERS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.

OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $40,954 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND $35,230 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WERE OTHER EXPENSES OF $17,157 AND OTHER EXPENSES OF $5,823 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE PUBLICLY ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FOR ANY  REASON, EVEN IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE OR OTHER EVENTS OCCUR IN THE FUTURE.  OUR NET LOSS AND LIMITED WORKING CAPITAL  RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $620,731 DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO RAISE SUBSTANTIAL CAPITAL TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL, AND  OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS SINCE OUR CURRENT CASH ASSETS ARE EXHAUSTED AND WE HAVE GENERATED NO REVENUES TO DATE TO SUSTAIN OUR OPERATIONS.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON RELATED PARTIES TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. WE WILL NEED TO SEEK OTHER FINANCING TO COMPLETE OUR BUSINESS  PLANS. THE SUCCESSFUL OUTCOME OF FUTURE FINANCING ACTIVITIES CANNOT BE DETERMINED AT THIS TIME AND THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT,  IF ACHIEVED, WE WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO EXECUTE OUR INTENDED BUSINESS PLAN OR GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION TO OUR CURRENT DEFICIT, WE  EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL LOSSES DURING THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. UNTIL WE ARE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN. CONSEQUENTLY,  WE WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO CONTINUE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND/OR PUBLIC OFFERINGS NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR WORKING  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT FUNDS GENERATED FROM ANY PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND/OR PUBLIC OFFERINGS ARE INSUFFICIENT,  WE WILL HAVE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS BANK LOANS AND/OR FINANCINGS. NO ASSURANCE CAN  BE GIVEN THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE, OR IF AVAILABLE, WILL BE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  WE ARE INCURRING INCREASED COSTS AS A RESULT  OF BEING A PUBLICLY-TRADED COMPANY. AS A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE INCUR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE DID  NOT INCUR AS A PRIVATE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002, AS WELL AS NEW RULES SUBSEQUENTLY IMPLEMENTED BY THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, HAVE REQUIRED CHANGES IN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PRACTICES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THESE NEW RULES  AND REGULATIONS HAVE INCREASED OUR LEGAL AND FINANCIAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND HAVE MADE SOME ACTIVITIES MORE TIME-CONSUMING AND COSTLY.  FOR EXAMPLE, AS A RESULT OF BECOMING A PUBLIC COMPANY, WE HAVE CREATED ADDITIONAL BOARD COMMITTEES AND HAVE ADOPTED POLICIES REGARDING  INTERNAL CONTROLS AND DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INCURRED ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PUBLIC  COMPANY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, THESE NEW RULES AND REGULATIONS HAVE MADE IT MORE DIFFICULT AND MORE EXPENSIVE FOR  US TO OBTAIN DIRECTOR AND OFFICER LIABILITY INSURANCE, WHICH WE CURRENTLY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO. AS A RESULT OF THE NEW RULES, IT  MAY BECOME MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED PERSONS TO SERVE ON OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS OR AS EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  WE CANNOT PREDICT OR ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL COSTS WE MAY INCUR AS A RESULT OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY OR THE TIMING OF  SUCH COSTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OPERATING REVENUES  DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019, THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUES OF $17,317 AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURED COMPONENTS SOLD TO A MANUFACTURER OF DEEP-ULTRAVIOLET  LIGHT SOURCES WHICH INCLUDED TOTAL COST OF SALES OF $6,611 RESULTING IN A GROSS PROFIT OF $10,706. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY  SALES REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  14  OPERATING EXPENSES  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $420,850 COMPARED TO OPERATING EXPENSES OF $124,959 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE  IN OPERATING EXPENSES WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE OPERATING ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER, AS MOST OF FISCAL 2019 WAS SPENT ON  DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPOSED BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEREAS FISCAL 2020 FOCUSED ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BUSINESS  OPERATIONS. THIS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES OF $295,891.  NET INCOME (LOSS)  NET LOSS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER  30, 2019 WAS $620,731 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $333,016 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE COMPANY ALSO INCURRED  INTEREST EXPENSE OF $210,587 FOR INTEREST ON OUTSTANDING PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE  COMPANY INCURRED INTEREST EXPENSE OF $333,016 RELATING TO INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING PAYROLL TAX LIABILITY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD  A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $14,264,153 AND AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $105,583,960. THE COMPANY HAS FEW REVENUES AND SIGNIFICANT  LOSSES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. CASH PRESENTLY  ON HAND IS IMMATERIAL. WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING $1,000,000 OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO FUND OPERATIONS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR  VIA KITS, DEVELOPMENT OF OUR LIKIDO HEATING & COOLING UNITS, AND THE MANUFACTURING OF OUR EXTRACTION MACHINE. MANAGEMENT IS  PLANNING TO SUPPORT OPERATIONS BY RAISING CAPITAL, AND BY ACCELERATING SALES & MARKETING EFFORTS TO TAKE PRE-ORDERS OF OUR  EXTRACTION MACHINES (RESULTING IN DOWN-PAYMENTS), THE SALES OF HIGH-MARGIN HEATING & COOLING UNITS, PRECISION PARTS, AND HEALTHCARE  VIA KITS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING  NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT BASIS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO  MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING  PERIODS.  WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES  AND ESTIMATES THAT WE USE TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A COMPLETE SUMMARY OF THESE POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE (1) OF  THE NOTES TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN GENERAL, MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, ON INFORMATION FROM  THIRD PARTY PROFESSIONALS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  USE OF ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES  AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES FOR THE REPORTING PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT  AREAS REQUIRING THE USE OF MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES RELATE TO THE VALUATION OF ITS MINERAL LEASES AND CLAIMS AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN  FINAL GOVERNMENT PERMISSION TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY RECORDS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 718,  COMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION  , USING THE FAIR VALUE METHOD. ALL TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH  GOODS OR SERVICES ARE THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE  OF THE CONSIDERATION RECEIVED OR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENT ISSUED, WHICHEVER IS MORE RELIABLY MEASURABLE. EQUITY  INSTRUMENTS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AND THE COST OF THE SERVICES RECEIVED AS CONSIDERATION ARE MEASURED AND RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE  FAIR VALUE OF THE EQUITY INSTRUMENTS ISSUED.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE  TO IMPROVE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES BY REMOVING OR MODIFYING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS AND  ADDING OTHER REQUIREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING  AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. CERTAIN AMENDMENTS SHOULD BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY, WHILE ALL OTHER AMENDMENTS  SHOULD BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE  THAT PERMITS THE COMPANY TO RECLASSIFY DISPROPORTIONATE TAX EFFECTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CAUSED BY THE TAX  CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL  YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE  A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JULY 2017, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2017-11  WHICH SIMPLIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES. THE NEW STANDARD WILL REDUCE INCOME  STATEMENT VOLATILITY FOR COMPANIES THAT ISSUE WARRANTS AND CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS CONTAINING SUCH FEATURES.  17  THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL  IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW CREDIT  LOSS STANDARD THAT REPLACES THE INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT METHODOLOGY IN CURRENT GAAP. THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL REQUIRES IMMEDIATE  RECOGNITION OF ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES EXPECTED TO OCCUR FOR MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER INSTRUMENTS. IT IS EFFECTIVE  FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019 AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS. EARLY ADOPTION  FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018 IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE STANDARD\u2019S PROVISIONS AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT  ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST EFFECTIVE REPORTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING  THE IMPACT OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED NEW LEASE  ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN ASU NO. 2016-02, \u201c  LEASES  \u201d. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WAS INITIATED AS A JOINT PROJECT WITH THE  INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD TO SIMPLIFY LEASE ACCOUNTING AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF AND COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL  INFORMATION FOR USERS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE WOULD ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR \u201cOPERATING LEASES\u201d  FOR LESSEES FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF LEASE CONTRACTS. UNDER ASU NO. 2016-02, AT INCEPTION, A LESSEE MUST CLASSIFY ALL LEASES WITH  A TERM OF OVER ONE YEAR AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING, WITH BOTH CLASSIFICATIONS RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF A DEFINED \u201cRIGHT-OF-USE\u201d  ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET. HOWEVER, RECOGNITION IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WILL DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE LEASE  CLASSIFICATION, WITH FINANCE LEASES RECOGNIZING THE AMORTIZATION OF THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET SEPARATE FROM THE INTEREST ON THE LEASE  LIABILITY AND OPERATING LEASES RECOGNIZING A SINGLE TOTAL LEASE EXPENSE. LESSOR ACCOUNTING UNDER ASU NO. 2016-02 WOULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY  UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS LEASE REQUIREMENTS UNDER GAAP. ASU NO. 2016-02 WILL TAKE EFFECT FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES IN FISCAL YEARS  BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED AND FOR LEASES  EXISTING AT, OR ENTERED INTO AFTER, THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, LESSEES  AND LESSORS MUST APPLY A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE TRANSITION APPROACH. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 AND EXPECTS  IT TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DUE TO LEASE AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN FOOTNOTE  7. THE LEASE COMMENCES OCTOBER 1  ST  2019.  WE HAVE REVIEWED ALL THE RECENTLY ISSUED,  BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE, ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT  ON THE COMPANY OTHER THAN THOSE RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT STAGE ENTITIES AS DISCUSSED BELOW IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE THESE ESTIMATES, INCLUDING INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENT.

SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING EXPENSES ARE EXPLAINED BELOW.

SALARIES  AND WAGES INCREASED BY $1.1 MILLION, OR 9.3%, IN LINE WITH THE INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUES. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SALARIES  AND WAGES WERE 27.3% FROM 27.5% MAINLY DUE TO RELATIVELY FIXED CORPORATE SALARIES.  SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $2.5 MILLION, OR 17.9%, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL  FEES, TAXES AND PERMITS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, UTILITIES, AND REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES INCREASED  DUE TO THE RE-AUDIT CONDUCTED BY OUR EXTERNAL AUDITORS, WHILE TAXES AND PERMITS, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, UTILITIES, AND REPAIRS  AND MAINTENANCE INCREASED DUE TO INCREASE IN UNITS. AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL REVENUES, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED TO 34.2% FROM 31.9% MAINLY DUE TO ACCOUNTING AND PROFESSIONAL FEES.  OUR  ADOPTION OF ASC 842 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019. SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  DEPRECIATION  AND AMORTIZATION INCREASED BY $151,000, OR 7.4% DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COUNT FROM NEW UNITS.  24  OTHER  GAINS, NET OF $26,000 IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO A NET GAIN OF $1.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER WAS MAINLY DUE TO  THE SALE OF TWO REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND A BUSINESS IN THE PRIOR-YEAR FIRST QUARTER.

FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NIGHTCLUBS  $13,776  $15,387  BOMBSHELLS  1,573  119  OTHER  (207  )  (119  )  GENERAL CORPORATE  (5,456  )  (4,255  )  $9,686  $11,132  OPERATING  MARGIN FOR THE NIGHTCLUBS SEGMENT WAS 36.4% AND 40.8% FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE OPERATING  MARGIN FOR BOMBSHELLS WAS 15.2% AND 2.0%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN NIGHTCLUBS OPERATING MARGIN WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE CHANGE  IN NET OTHER GAINS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE INCREASE IN BOMBSHELLS OPERATING MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELIEF FROM PRE-OPENING  EXPENSES IN THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER FROM BOMBSHELLS UNITS THAT WERE UNDER CONSTRUCTION. EXCLUDING NET OTHER GAINS, NIGHTCLUBS WOULD  HAVE HAD NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN OF 36.6% AND 37.8% FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS  MAINLY FROM HIGHER TAXES AND PERMITS AND ADVERTISING AND MARKETING, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. BOMBSHELLS DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL NON-GAAP  ADJUSTMENTS DURING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  NON-OPERATING  ITEMS  INTEREST  EXPENSE DECREASED BY $36,000, OR 1.4%.  OUR  TOTAL OCCUPANCY COSTS, DEFINED AS THE SUM OF LEASE EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WERE 7.3% AND 8.0% OF REVENUE DURING THE QUARTER  ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER OCCUPANCY COSTS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER WERE DUE TO LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE  DOLLARS IN RELATION TO REVENUES.  INCOME  TAXES  INCOME  TAX EXPENSE WAS $1.6 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $1.8 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 22.0% FOR BOTH QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  BOTH YEARS IS AFFECTED BY STATE TAXES, PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND TAX CREDITS, INCLUDING THE FICA TIP CREDIT.  25  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN  ADDITION TO OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, MANAGEMENT USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,  WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE SEC REGULATION G, TO CLARIFY AND ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF PAST PERFORMANCE AND PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE.  GENERALLY, A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE, FINANCIAL POSITION  OR CASH FLOWS THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN OR EXCLUDED FROM THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED  AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE MONITOR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE IT DESCRIBES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF  THE COMPANY AND HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS GAUGE OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FLOW, EXCLUDING (OR INCLUDING) SOME ITEMS THAT  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN (OR EXCLUDED  FROM) THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURES CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. RELATIVE TO EACH OF THE NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE FURTHER SET FORTH OUR RATIONALE AS FOLLOWS.  NON-GAAP  OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN.  WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME AND NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN BY EXCLUDING  THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND OPERATING MARGIN: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) GAINS OR LOSSES ON  SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (C) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, AND (D) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THESE  ITEMS ASSISTS INVESTORS IN EVALUATING PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD CHANGES IN OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN WITHOUT THE IMPACT  OF ITEMS THAT ARE NOT A RESULT OF OUR DAY-TO-DAY BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.  NON-GAAP  NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE  . WE CALCULATE NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND NON-GAAP NET INCOME PER DILUTED  SHARE BY EXCLUDING OR INCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER  SHARE. ADJUSTMENT ITEMS ARE: (A) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES, (B) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (C) GAINS  OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, (D) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, (E) SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS, AND (F) THE INCOME TAX  EFFECT OF THE ABOVE DESCRIBED ADJUSTMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE INCOME TAX EFFECT OF THE ABOVE ADJUSTMENTS IS THE NET EFFECT OF THE  NON-GAAP PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, CALCULATED AT 21.8% AND 22.2% EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF THE PRE-TAX NON-GAAP INCOME BEFORE TAXES  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE GAAP INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT). WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING  AND INCLUDING SUCH ITEMS HELP MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED  EBITDA  . WE CALCULATE ADJUSTED EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE FOLLOWING ITEMS FROM NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS.  (A) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, (B) INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), (C) NET INTEREST EXPENSE, (D) GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF  BUSINESSES AND ASSETS, (E) GAINS OR LOSSES ON INSURANCE, (F) UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES, AND (G) SETTLEMENT  OF LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING FOR SUCH ITEMS HELPS MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BETTER UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES A CORE OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT THAT COMPARES RESULTS WITHOUT THE NEED TO ADJUST FOR FEDERAL,  STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHICH HAVE CONSIDERABLE VARIATION BETWEEN DOMESTIC JURISDICTIONS. THE RESULTS ARE, THEREFORE, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION  OF FINANCING ALTERNATIVES OF CAPITAL EMPLOYED. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE GUIDELINE TO ASSESS OUR UNLEVERAGED PERFORMANCE RETURN  ON OUR INVESTMENTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS ALSO THE TARGET BENCHMARK FOR OUR ACQUISITIONS OF NIGHTCLUBS.  WE  ALSO USE CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. SEE \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d SECTION  FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  26  THE  FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT  PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND PERCENTAGES).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME TO ADJUSTED EBITDA  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  $5,634  $6,344  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  1,593  1,811  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  2,387  2,470  SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS  24  60  GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  (30  )  (1,157  )  UNREALIZED LOSS ON EQUITY SECURITIES  72  447  GAIN ON INSURANCE  (20  )  -  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  2,204  2,053  ADJUSTED EBITDA  $11,864  $12,028  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON SHAREHOLDERS  $5,634  $6,344  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  156  156  SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS  24  60  GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  (30  )  (1,157  )  UNREALIZED LOSS ON EQUITY SECURITIES  72  447  GAIN ON INSURANCE  (20  )  -  NET INCOME TAX EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS ABOVE  (26  )  110  NON-GAAP NET INCOME  $5,810  $5,960  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE TO NON-GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  DILUTED SHARES  9,322  9,713  GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  $0.60  $0.65  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  0.02  0.02  SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS  0.00  0.01  GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  (0.00  )  (0.12  )  UNREALIZED LOSS ON EQUITY SECURITIES  0.01  0.05  GAIN ON INSURANCE  (0.00  )  -  NET INCOME TAX EFFECT OF ADJUSTMENTS ABOVE  (0.00  )  0.01  NON-GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  $0.62  $0.61  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING INCOME TO NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  $9,686  $11,132  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  156  156  SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS  24  60  GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  (30  )  (1,157  )  GAIN ON INSURANCE  (20  )  -  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME  $9,816  $10,191  RECONCILIATION OF GAAP OPERATING MARGIN TO NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS  20.0%  25.3%  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  0.3%  0.4%  SETTLEMENT OF LAWSUITS  0.0%  0.1%  GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  -0.1%  -2.6%  GAIN ON INSURANCE  -0.0%  -  NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN  20.3%  23.1%  *  PER SHARE AMOUNTS AND PERCENTAGES MAY NOT FOOT DUE TO ROUNDING.  THE  ADJUSTMENTS TO RECONCILE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO RCIHH COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF ADJUSTMENTS  RELATED TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, WHICH IS IMMATERIAL.  27  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019, OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $13.2 MILLION COMPARED TO $14.1 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF CASH WE HANDLE, WE HAVE VERY STRINGENT CASH CONTROLS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE  WORKING CAPITAL OF $7.3 MILLION COMPARED TO A NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $2.3 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, EXCLUDING  ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OF $4.8 MILLION AND $2.9 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL FINANCIAL STRENGTHS. OUR NET CASH PROVIDED BY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $10.3 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $11.5 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR OUR BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL CASH FLOWS FROM  OPERATIONS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF THIS REPORT. AS A RESULT OF OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WE  HAVE SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO MEET OUR FINANCIAL COMMITMENTS.  WE  HAVE NOT RECENTLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES. INSTEAD, WE USE DEBT FINANCING TO LOWER OUR OVERALL  COST OF CAPITAL AND INCREASE OUR RETURN ON STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. WE HAVE A HISTORY OF BORROWING FUNDS IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS  AND FROM SELLERS IN ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND HAVE RECENTLY SECURED TRADITIONAL BANK FINANCING ON OUR NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  AND REFINANCING OF OUR EXISTING NOTES PAYABLE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES FROM  THOSE SOURCES. WE ALSO HAVE HISTORICALLY UTILIZED THESE CASH FLOWS TO INVEST IN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, ADULT NIGHTCLUBS AND RESTAURANTS/SPORTS  BARS.  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10,273  $11,452  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (2,718  )  (19,518  )  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (8,493  )  (273  )  NET DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $(938  )  $(8,339  )  CASH  FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOLLOWING  ARE OUR SUMMARIZED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).

FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  $(4,058  )  $(7,295  )  ACQUISITION OF BUSINESSES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED  -  (13,500  )  PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS  51  1,245  PROCEEDS FROM INSURANCE  932  -  PROCEEDS FROM NOTES RECEIVABLE  357  32  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(2,718  )  $(19,518  )  FOLLOWING  IS A BREAKDOWN OF OUR ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NEW FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT  $3,037  $6,919  MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  1,021  376  TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  $4,058  $7,295  THE  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  FOR TWO NEW BOMBSHELLS LOCATIONS AND THE REHABILITATION OF A CLUB THAT WAS DAMAGED BY FIRE, WHILE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING  THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WERE COMPOSED PRIMARILY OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR FOUR NEW BOMBSHELLS LOCATIONS.  VARIANCES IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NUMBER AND TIMING OF NEW, REMODELED, OR RECONCEPTED LOCATIONS UNDER  CONSTRUCTION.  PRIOR  YEAR ACQUISITIONS OF $13.5 MILLION RELATE TO $7.5 MILLION CASH PAID ON THE PITTSBURGH CLUB ACQUISITION AND THE $6.0 MILLION CASH  PAID ON THE CHICAGO CLUB ACQUISITION.  CASH  FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOLLOWING  ARE OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES (IN THOUSANDS).  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  PROCEEDS FROM LONG-TERM DEBT  $318  $5,652  PAYMENTS ON LONG-TERM DEBT  (2,081  )  (5,279  )  PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK  (6,441  )  (355  )  PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS  (279  )  (291  )  DISTRIBUTION TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  (10  )  -  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(8,493  )  $(273  )  WE  PURCHASED 332,671 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.36 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHILE WE  PURCHASED 14,111 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.21 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. WE PAID QUARTERLY  DIVIDENDS OF $0.03 PER SHARE DURING EACH OF THE CURRENT- AND PRIOR-YEAR QUARTERS.  29  MANAGEMENT  ALSO USES CERTAIN NON-GAAP CASH FLOW MEASURES SUCH AS FREE CASH FLOW. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING  ACTIVITIES LESS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE USE FREE CASH FLOW AS THE BASELINE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED  DECEMBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10,273  $11,452  LESS: MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  1,021  376  FREE CASH FLOW  $9,252  $11,076  OUR  FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE CURRENT-YEAR QUARTER DECREASED BY 16.5% COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REMODELING OF AN OLDER BOMBSHELLS UNIT AND ON UPGRADES IN OUR MIAMI CLUBS IN PREPARATION  FOR THE PRO FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP.  OTHER  THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE FINANCING DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY EVENT OR TREND THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECT LIQUIDITY. IN THE EVENT SUCH A TREND DEVELOPS, WE BELIEVE OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS WILL  BE ADEQUATELY MET BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS. IN OUR OPINION, WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT A TRUE INDICATOR OF OUR FINANCIAL STATUS.  TYPICALLY, BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY CARRY CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS BECAUSE BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  RECEIVE SUBSTANTIALLY IMMEDIATE PAYMENT FOR SALES, WITH NOMINAL RECEIVABLES, WHILE INVENTORIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES NORMALLY  CARRY LONGER PAYMENT TERMS. VENDORS AND PURVEYORS OFTEN REMAIN FLEXIBLE WITH PAYMENT TERMS, PROVIDING BUSINESSES IN OUR INDUSTRY  WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO ADJUST TO SHORT-TERM BUSINESS DOWN TURNS. WE CONSIDER THE PRIMARY INDICATORS OF FINANCIAL STATUS TO BE THE  LONG-TERM TREND OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE MIX OF SALES REVENUES, OVERALL CASH FLOW, PROFITABILITY FROM OPERATIONS AND THE LEVEL OF  LONG-TERM DEBT.  30  THE  FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A SUMMARY OF SUCH INDICATORS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31.  INCREASE  INCREASE  2019  (DECREASE)  2018  (DECREASE)  2017  SALES OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES  $20,743  13.3%  $18,310  2.8%  $17,805  SALES OF FOOD AND MERCHANDISE  7,447  30.9%  5,690  7.2%  5,307  SERVICE REVENUES  17,193  -0.8%  17,331  9.1%  15,889  OTHER  3,011  11.8%  2,692  21.8%  2,211  TOTAL REVENUES  48,394  9.9%  44,023  6.8%  41,212  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10,273  -10.3%  $11,452  40.6%  $8,145  ADJUSTED EBITDA*  $11,864  -1.4%  $12,028  8.4%  $11,094  FREE CASH FLOW*  $9,252  -16.5%  $11,076  47.0%  $7,537  LONG-TERM DEBT (END OF PERIOD)  $141,826  -7.4%  $153,095  21.5%  $125,992  *  SEE DEFINITION AND CALCULATION OF ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FREE CASH FLOW ABOVE IN THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUBSECTION OF RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS.  SHARE  REPURCHASE  WE  PURCHASED 332,671 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.36 DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WHILE WE  PURCHASED 14,111 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $25.21 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2020,  THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $10.0 MILLION TO REPURCHASE THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  AS OF FEBRUARY 25, 2020, WE HAVE $13.8 MILLION REMAINING TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OTHER  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE  HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED FINANCING OTHER THAN THE NOTES PAYABLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE, IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE.  WE  BELIEVE THAT THE ADULT ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY STANDARD OF TREATING ENTERTAINERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS PROVIDES US WITH SAFE  HARBOR PROTECTION TO PRECLUDE PAYROLL TAX ASSESSMENT FOR PRIOR YEARS. WE HAVE PREPARED PLANS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROTECT OUR  PROFITABILITY IN THE EVENT THAT THE SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS REQUIRED IN ALL STATES TO CONVERT DANCERS WHO ARE NOW  INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INTO EMPLOYEES.  THE  SEXUALLY-ORIENTED BUSINESS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH RESPECT TO PRICE, SERVICE AND LOCATION, AS WELL AS THE PROFESSIONALISM  OF THE ENTERTAINMENT. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THE FUTURE, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH LEVEL OF NAME RECOGNITION AND PRESTIGE WITHIN THE MARKETPLACE.  IMPACT  OF INFLATION  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL OVERALL IMPACT FROM INFLATION IN OUR OPERATIONS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED  BY COMPETITION, WE HAVE MANAGED TO RECOVER INCREASED COSTS THROUGH PRICE INCREASES AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO. HOWEVER, THERE CAN  BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.  31  SEASONALITY  OUR  NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY SEASONAL FACTORS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED REDUCED REVENUES FROM APRIL THROUGH SEPTEMBER  (OUR FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS) WITH THE STRONGEST OPERATING RESULTS OCCURRING DURING OCTOBER THROUGH MARCH (OUR FISCAL  FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS). OUR REVENUES IN CERTAIN MARKETS ARE ALSO AFFECTED BY SPORTING EVENTS THAT CAUSE UNUSUAL CHANGES IN  SALES FROM YEAR TO YEAR.  CAPITAL  ALLOCATION STRATEGY  OUR  CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY PROVIDES US WITH DISCIPLINED GUIDELINES ON HOW WE SHOULD USE OUR FREE CASH FLOWS; PROVIDED HOWEVER,  THAT WE MAY DEVIATE FROM THIS STRATEGY IF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. WE CALCULATE FREE CASH FLOW AS NET CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING  ACTIVITIES MINUS MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. USING THE AFTER-TAX YIELD OF BUYING OUR OWN STOCK AS BASELINE, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES  THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE BETTER INVESTMENT DECISIONS.  BASED  ON OUR CURRENT CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY.  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER BUYING  BACK OUR OWN STOCK IF THE AFTER-TAX YIELD ON FREE CASH FLOW IS ABOVE 10%;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER DISPOSING  OF UNDERPERFORMING UNITS TO FREE UP CAPITAL FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE USE;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER ACQUIRING  OR DEVELOPING OUR OWN CLUBS OR RESTAURANTS THAT WE BELIEVE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM CASH ON CASH RETURN OF  25%-33%, ABSENT AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE;  \u25cf  WE CONSIDER PAYING  DOWN OUR MOST EXPENSIVE DEBT IF IT MAKES SENSE ON A TAX ADJUSTED BASIS, OR THERE IS AN OTHERWISE STRATEGIC RATIONALE.  GROWTH  STRATEGY  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR NIGHTCLUB OPERATIONS CAN CONTINUE TO GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC  SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH POTENTIAL. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INVOLVES THE FOLLOWING: (I) TO ACQUIRE EXISTING UNITS IN LOCATIONS THAT  ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR GROWTH AND INCOME TARGETS AND WHICH APPEAR RECEPTIVE TO THE UPSCALE CLUB FORMULA WE HAVE DEVELOPED; (II)  TO OPEN NEW UNITS AFTER MARKET ANALYSIS; (III) TO FRANCHISE OUR BOMBSHELLS BRAND; (IV) TO FORM JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS  TO REDUCE START-UP AND OPERATING COSTS, WITH US CONTRIBUTING EQUITY IN THE FORM OF OUR BRAND NAME AND MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE; (V)  TO DEVELOP NEW CLUB CONCEPTS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR MANAGEMENT AND MARKETING SKILLS; (VI) TO DEVELOP AND OPEN OUR RESTAURANT  CONCEPTS AS OUR CAPITAL AND MANPOWER ALLOW; AND (VII) TO CONTROL THE REAL ESTATE IN CONNECTION WITH CLUB OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH  SOME UNITS MAY BE IN LEASED PREMISES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT BOMBSHELLS CAN GROW ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH CAREFUL ENTRY INTO MARKETS AND DEMOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS WITH HIGH GROWTH  POTENTIAL. ALL NINE OF THE EXISTING BOMBSHELLS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 ARE LOCATED IN TEXAS. OUR GROWTH STRATEGY IS TO DIVERSIFY  OUR OPERATIONS WITH THESE UNITS WHICH DO NOT REQUIRE SOB LICENSES, WHICH ARE SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WHILE WE ARE SEARCHING  FOR ADULT NIGHTCLUBS TO ACQUIRE, WE ARE ABLE TO ALSO SEARCH FOR RESTAURANT/SPORTS BAR LOCATIONS THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR INCOME  TARGETS.  WE  OPENED ONE BOMBSHELLS UNIT DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. IN JANUARY 2020, SUBSEQUENT TO THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2019, WE OPENED ANOTHER BOMBSHELLS UNIT.  ON  NOVEMBER 5, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT ITS SUBSIDIARIES HAVE SIGNED DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS TO ACQUIRE THE ASSETS AND RELATED  REAL ESTATE OF A WELL-ESTABLISHED, TOP GENTLEMEN\u2019S CLUB LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR FOR $15.0 MILLION. UNDER THE TERMS  OF THE AGREEMENTS, COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES WILL PAY $7.2 MILLION FOR THE CLUB AND $7.8 MILLION FOR THE REAL ESTATE USING $4.0 MILLION  IN SELLER FINANCING AT 6.0% FOR THE CLUB WITH THE BALANCE OF CASH FROM AN ANTICIPATED $11.0 MILLION BANK LOAN AT A BLENDED RATE  OF 6.25%. AS OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT, CLOSING OF THIS TRANSACTION IS STILL PENDING SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS.  WE  CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO ACQUIRE NEW NIGHTCLUBS AND ANTICIPATE ACQUIRING NEW LOCATIONS THAT FIT OUR BUSINESS MODEL  AS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST. THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL CLUBS MAY REQUIRE US TO TAKE ON ADDITIONAL DEBT OR ISSUE OUR COMMON  STOCK, OR BOTH. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON REASONABLE TERMS IN THE FUTURE,  IF AT ALL, SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. AN INABILITY TO OBTAIN SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROWTH  STRATEGY.  32", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "RCI HOSPITALITY HOLDINGS, INC.", "CIK": 935419, "Date": "2020-02-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "RICK", "Name": "Ricks Cabaret International Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 5810.0, "Business": "TX", "Incorporated": "TX", "IRS": 760037324.0, "key": "20200227RICK", "labelr1": -4.366397721879458, "labelr2": 8.982630272952868, "labelr3": -3.460837887067402, "labelr4": -0.14150943396225274, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5833611, "prof1": 0.41663885, "return1&2": 0.9499155008532352, "return1&2&3": 0.98279053640189, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9841812777269868, "return2": 0.9101736972704714, "return1": 1.0436639772187946, "return3": 1.0346083788706741, "return4": 1.0014150943396225, "1_day_return": -4.366397721879456, "cumulative_return1": 0.024825633601645285, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 3746, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9825003894622997, "cumreturn1b": 1.0621023953677464, "cumreturn1c": 0.8282984349333548, "cumreturndow": 0.9092929471716293, "cumreturnsp500": 0.8947017210889143}, {"Unnamed: 0": 3747, "level_0": 3853, "index": 39205, "text": "ITEM 2.

RISK FACTORS\u201d AND \u201cPART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d AND THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN OUR OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"GAAP\").  THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT.  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS AFFECTING THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO TOTAL COSTS ON LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AND EXTENDED MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BAD DEBTS, EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY, INCOME TAXES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND CONTINGENCIES.  OUR ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OVERVIEW  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE AND SELL A WIDE RANGE OF DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.  WE FOCUS OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS ON MARKETS, GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS AND PRODUCTS.  OUR FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONSIST OF FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS AND THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  THE FOUR DOMESTIC BUSINESS UNITS CONSIST OF COMMERCIAL, LIVE EVENTS, HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION, AND TRANSPORTATION, ALL OF WHICH INCLUDE THE GEOGRAPHIC TERRITORIES OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  DISCLOSURES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE PROVIDED IN \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT.  OUR NET SALES AND PROFITABILITY HISTORICALLY HAVE FLUCTUATED DUE TO THE IMPACT OF UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, SUCH AS DISPLAY SYSTEMS FOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS FACILITIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND SPECTACULAR PROJECTS IN THE COMMERCIAL AREA, AS WELL AS THE SEASONALITY OF THE SPORTS MARKET.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS CAN INCLUDE SEVERAL DISPLAYS, CONTROLLERS, AND SUBCONTRACTED STRUCTURE BUILDS, EACH OF WHICH CAN OCCUR ON VARIED SCHEDULES PER THE CUSTOMER'S NEEDS.  OUTDOOR INSTALLATION SALES CAN BE IMPACTED BY OUTDOOR WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE CONSTRUCTION SEASON.  OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER TENDS TO BE A SLOWER QUARTER BECAUSE IT INCLUDES TWO HOLIDAYS, IT IS AFFECTED BY SPORTS SEASONALITY, AND GENERALLY LESS OUTDOOR CONSTRUCTION WORK OCCURS DUE TO WEATHER CONDITIONS.  OUR GROSS MARGINS TEND TO FLUCTUATE MORE ON UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS THAN ON LIMITED CONFIGURED ORDERS.  UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS INVOLVING COMPETITIVE BIDDING AND SUBSTANTIAL SUBCONTRACT WORK FOR PRODUCT INSTALLATION GENERALLY HAVE LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ALTHOUGH WE FOLLOW THE OVER TIME METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUES FOR UNIQUELY CONFIGURED ORDERS, WE NEVERTHELESS HAVE EXPERIENCED FLUCTUATIONS IN OPERATING RESULTS AND EXPECT OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR FLUCTUATIONS.  OUR REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS (\"BACKLOG\") CONSIST OF CONTRACTUALLY BINDING SALES AGREEMENTS OR PURCHASE ORDERS FOR INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DISPLAY SYSTEMS AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICE.  ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG WHEN WE ARE IN RECEIPT OF AN EXECUTED CONTRACT AND ANY REQUIRED DEPOSITS OR SECURITY.  AS A RESULT, CERTAIN ORDERS FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR CONTRACTS WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN BACKLOG UNTIL ALL REQUIRED CONTRACTUAL DOCUMENTS AND DEPOSITS ARE RECEIVED.  BACKLOG CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO LARGE ORDER BOOKINGS AND THE TIMING AND SEASONALITY OF NET SALES.  BECAUSE ORDER BACKLOG FLUCTUATES AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO EXTENDED DELIVERY SCHEDULES, ORDERS MAY BE CANCELED AND HAVE VARIED ESTIMATED PROFITABILITY.  OUR BACKLOG IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE NET SALES OR NET INCOME.  BACKLOG IS NOT A MEASURE DEFINED BY GAAP, AND OUR METHODOLOGY FOR DETERMINING BACKLOG MAY VARY FROM THE METHODOLOGY USED BY OTHER COMPANIES IN DETERMINING THEIR BACKLOG AMOUNTS.  GENERAL  OUR MISSION IS TO BE THE WORLD LEADER AT INFORMING AND ENTERTAINING AUDIENCES THROUGH DYNAMIC AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS.  WE ORGANIZE INTO BUSINESS UNITS TO FOCUS ON CUSTOMER LOYALTY OVER TIME TO EARN NEW AND REPLACEMENT BUSINESS BECAUSE OUR PRODUCTS HAVE A FINITE LIFETIME.  SEE \"  NOTE 5. SEGMENT REPORTING  \" OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  OUR STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE CREATION OF A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS AND SYSTEMS AND OUR ABILITY TO CREATE AND LEVERAGE PLATFORM DESIGNS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  THESE STRATEGIES ALIGN US TO EFFECTIVELY DELIVER VALUE TO OUR VARIED CUSTOMERS AND THEIR MARKET NEEDS, WHILE SERVING OUR STAKEHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  WE FOCUS ON CREATING LOCAL CAPABILITIES FOR SALES, SERVICE, AND MANUFACTURING IN GEOGRAPHIES WITH EXPECTED DIGITAL MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE BELIEVE CONSISTENTLY GENERATING PROFITABLE GROWTH WILL PROVIDE VALUE TO OUR STAKEHOLDERS (CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES, SHAREHOLDERS, SUPPLIERS, AND COMMUNITIES).  WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS USING A VARIETY OF MEASURES INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR PERCENTAGE OF MARKET SHARE BY COMPARING OUR ESTIMATED REVENUE TO THE TOTAL ESTIMATED GLOBAL DIGITAL DISPLAY REVENUE,  \u2022  OUR ORDER GROWTH COMPARED TO THE OVERALL DIGITAL MARKET ORDER CHANGE,  \u2022  FINANCIAL METRICS SUCH AS ANNUAL ORDER VOLUME AND PROFIT CHANGE AS COMPARED TO OUR PREVIOUS FINANCIAL RESULTS,  \u2022  CUSTOMER RETENTION AND EXPANSION RATES, AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PROFITS OVER THE LONG-TERM TO PROVIDE A SHAREHOLDER RETURN.  CERTAIN FACTORS IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO SUCCEED IN THESE STRATEGIES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS UNITS TO VARYING DEGREES.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE OVERALL COST TO MANUFACTURE AND THE SELLING PRICES OF OUR PRODUCTS HAVE DECREASED OVER THE YEARS AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN THE FUTURE.  OUR COMPETITORS OUTSIDE THE U.S. ARE IMPACTED DIFFERENTLY BY THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT ALLOWING THEM TO AVOID TARIFF COSTS OR REDUCE PRICES.  AS A RESULT, ADDITIONAL COMPETITORS HAVE ENTERED THE MARKET, AND EACH YEAR WE MUST SELL MORE PRODUCT TO GENERATE THE SAME OR GREATER LEVEL OF NET SALES AS IN PREVIOUS FISCAL YEARS.  HOWEVER, THE DECLINE OF DIGITAL SOLUTION PRICING OVER THE YEARS AND INCREASED USER ADOPTION AND APPLICATIONS HAVE INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GLOBAL MARKET.  IN THE NEAR-TERM, ORDERS AND SALES TIMING MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE CORONAVIRUS SITUATION (\"COVID-19\") POTENTIALLY CAUSING CUSTOMER ORDER DELAYS AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS.  COMPETITOR OFFERINGS, ACTIONS AND REACTIONS ALSO CAN VARY AND CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN CERTAIN CUSTOMER SITUATIONS.  PROJECTS WITH MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR REVENUE POTENTIAL ATTRACTS COMPETITION, AND COMPETITORS CAN USE MARKETING OR OTHER TACTICS TO WIN BUSINESS.  EACH OF OUR BUSINESS UNIT'S LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE CAN BE IMPACTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND TO DIFFERENT DEGREES.  THE EFFECTS OF AN ADVERSE ECONOMY ARE GENERALLY LESS SEVERE ON OUR SPORTS RELATED BUSINESS AS COMPARED TO OUR OTHER BUSINESSES, ALTHOUGH IN SEVERE ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, THE SPORTS BUSINESS CAN ALSO BE SERIOUSLY IMPACTED.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM EVENTS LIKE THE U.S. ADMINISTRATIVE TRADE ACTIONS IN 2018 OR A NUMBER OF OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE DISCLOSED IN \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\" INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  APRIL 27, 2019.  THE OUTLOOK AND UNIQUE KEY GROWTH DRIVERS AND CHALLENGES BY OUR BUSINESS UNITS INCLUDE.  COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCT MARKET GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, WHICH DRIVE MARKETPLACE EXPANSION.  STANDARD DISPLAY PRODUCTS ARE USED TO ATTRACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH CUSTOMERS AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS OF RETAIL, COMMERCIAL, AND OTHER ESTABLISHMENTS.  PRICING AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR SUCCESS IN THIS BUSINESS UNIT.  WE UTILIZE A RESELLER NETWORK TO DISTRIBUTE OUR STANDARD PRODUCTS.  \u2022  NATIONAL ACCOUNTS STANDARD DISPLAY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES DUE TO CUSTOMERS' DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE THEIR MESSAGE, ADVERTISING AND CONTENT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTRY.  INCREASED DEMAND IS POSSIBLE FROM NATIONAL RETAILERS, QUICK SERVE RESTAURANTS, PETROLEUM RETAILERS, AND OTHER NATIONWIDE ORGANIZATIONS.  \u2022  ADDITIONAL STANDARD DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LIGHT EMITTING DIODE (\"LED\") DESIGNS.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LIQUID CRYSTAL DISPLAY (\"LCD\") TECHNOLOGY BY EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  INCREASING INTEREST IN SPECTACULARS, WHICH INCLUDE VERY LARGE AND SOMETIMES HIGHLY CUSTOMIZED DISPLAYS AS PART OF ENTERTAINMENT VENUES SUCH AS CASINOS, SHOPPING CENTERS, CRUISE SHIPS AND TIMES SQUARE TYPE LOCATIONS.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS DEMAND GROWTH DUE TO MARKET ADOPTION AND EXPANDED USE OF THIS TECHNOLOGY.  \u2022  THE USE OF ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, WHICH REAL ESTATE OWNERS USE TO ADD ACCENTS OR EFFECTS TO AN ENTIRE SIDE OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF A BUILDING TO COMMUNICATE MESSAGES OR TO DECORATE THE BUILDING.  \u2022  THE CONTINUED DEPLOYMENT OF DIGITAL BILLBOARDS AS OUT-OF-HOME (\"OOH\") ADVERTISING COMPANIES CONTINUE DEVELOPING NEW SITES AND REPLACING DIGITAL BILLBOARDS REACHING END OF LIFE.  THIS IS DEPENDENT ON NO ADVERSE CHANGES OCCURRING IN THE DIGITAL BILLBOARD REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT RESTRICTING FUTURE BILLBOARD DEPLOYMENTS, AS WELL AS MAINTAINING OUR CURRENT MARKET SHARE IN A BUSINESS THAT IS CONCENTRATED IN A FEW LARGE OOH COMPANIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE LIVE EVENTS BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  FACILITIES SPENDING MORE ON LARGER DISPLAY SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE THE GAME-DAY AND EVENT EXPERIENCE FOR ATTENDEES.  \u2022  LOWER PRODUCT COSTS, DRIVING AN EXPANSION OF THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL MICRO-LED OFFERINGS WHICH REMAIN THE MOST INTEGRATED AND COMPREHENSIVE OFFERINGS IN THE INDUSTRY.  \u2022  THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF SPORTS TEAMS, WHICH STRIVE TO OUT-PERFORM THEIR COMPETITORS WITH DISPLAY SYSTEMS.  \u2022  THE DESIRE FOR HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO DISPLAYS, WHICH TYPICALLY DRIVES LARGER DISPLAYS OR HIGHER RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, BOTH OF WHICH INCREASE THE AVERAGE TRANSACTION SIZE.  \u2022  DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEM NEEDS THROUGHOUT A SPORTS FACILITY.  \u2022  INCREASING USE OF LED TECHNOLOGIES REPLACING SIGNAGE PREVIOUSLY USING LCD TECHNOLOGY IN AND SURROUNDING LIVE EVENTS FACILITIES.  \u2022  REPLACEMENT CYCLES WITHIN EACH OF THESE AREAS.  HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PARK AND RECREATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR VIDEO SYSTEMS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS REALIZE THE REVENUE GENERATING POTENTIAL OF THESE DISPLAYS COMPARED TO TRADITIONAL SCOREBOARDS AND THESE SYSTEMS' ABILITY TO PROVIDE OR ENHANCE ACADEMIC CURRICULUM OFFERINGS FOR STUDENTS.  \u2022  INCREASED DEMAND FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF DISPLAYS AND DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS, SUCH AS MESSAGE CENTERS AT SCHOOLS TO COMMUNICATE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY.  \u2022  LOWER SYSTEM COSTS DRIVING THE USE OF MORE SOPHISTICATED DISPLAYS IN SCHOOL ATHLETIC FACILITIES, SUCH AS LARGE INTEGRATED VIDEO SYSTEMS.  \u2022  EXPANDING CONTROL SYSTEM OPTIONS TAILORED FOR THE MARKETS' NEEDS.  TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM INCREASING APPLICATIONS AND ACCEPTANCE OF ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS TO MANAGE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, INCLUDING ROADWAY, AIRPORT, PARKING, TRANSIT AND OTHER APPLICATIONS.  EFFECTIVE USE OF THE UNITED STATES TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIRES INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS.  THIS GROWTH IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GOVERNMENT SPENDING, PRIMARILY BY STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS, ALONG WITH THE CONTINUING ACCEPTANCE OF PRIVATE/PUBLIC PARTNERSHIPS AS AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCE.  GROWTH IS ALSO EXPECTED IN DYNAMIC MESSAGING SYSTEMS FOR ADVERTISING AND WAYFINDING  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USE IN PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND AIRPORT TERMINALS DUE TO EXPANDED MARKET USAGE AND DISPLAYS, WITH LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT.  OVER THE LONG-TERM, WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THE INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS UNIT WILL RESULT FROM ACHIEVING GREATER PENETRATION IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIES AND BUILDING PRODUCTS MORE SUITED TO INDIVIDUAL MARKETS.  WE CONTINUE TO BROADEN OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INTO THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST.  WE ALSO FOCUS ON SPORTS FACILITY, SPECTACULAR-TYPE, OOH ADVERTISING PRODUCTS, AND ARCHITECTURAL LIGHTING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND THE FACTORS LISTED IN EACH OF THE OTHER BUSINESS UNITS TO THE EXTENT THEY APPLY OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA.  ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES EXIST WITH EXPANDED MARKET USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY DUE TO PRICE CONSIDERATIONS, USAGE OF LED TECHNOLOGY REPLACING PRIOR LCD INSTALLATIONS AND ADDITIONAL DISPLAY OFFERINGS USING MICRO-LEDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DAKTRONICS, INC. OPERATES ON A 52- OR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR, WITH OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO APRIL 30 OF EACH YEAR.  WHEN APRIL 30 FALLS ON A WEDNESDAY, THE FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE PRECEDING SATURDAY.  WITHIN EACH FISCAL YEAR, EACH QUARTER IS COMPRISED OF 13-WEEK PERIODS FOLLOWING THE BEGINNING OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  IN EACH 53-WEEK YEAR, AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS ADDED TO THE FIRST QUARTER, AND EACH OF THE LAST THREE QUARTERS IS COMPRISED OF A 13-WEEK PERIOD.
