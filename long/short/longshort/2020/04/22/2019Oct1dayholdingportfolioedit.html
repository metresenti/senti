OUR PRINCIPAL USES OF CASH ARE TO PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL FOR OPERATIONS, TO SERVICE OUR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON DEBT AND TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL LIQUIDITY AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $1,400.9 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF REVOLVER BORROWING CAPACITY OF $1,366.8 MILLION AND INVESTED CASH OF $34.1 MILLION.  \u200b  CREDIT FACILITIES  \u200b  ON DECEMBER 20, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW SENIOR SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT, CONSISTING OF A NEW $2.7 BILLION SENIOR SECURED ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\u201cSENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) AND A NEW $450.0 MILLION \u201cFIRST-IN, LAST OUT\u201d SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (\u201cSENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN\u201d) (COLLECTIVELY THE \u201cNEW FACILITIES\u201d). PROCEEDS FROM THE NEW FACILITIES WERE USED TO REFINANCE OUR PRIOR $2.7 BILLION AMENDED AND RESTATED SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY DUE JANUARY 2020 (THE \u201cOLD FACILITY\u201d, THE NEW FACILITIES AND THE OLD FACILITY ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFACILITIES\u201d). THE NEW FACILITIES EXTEND OUR DEBT MATURITY PROFILE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY. THE NEW FACILITIES MATURE IN DECEMBER 2023, SUBJECT TO AN EARLIER MATURITY ON DECEMBER 31, 2022 IF WE HAVE NOT REPAID OR REFINANCED OUR EXISTING 6.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 PRIOR TO SUCH DATE. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO REPAY OR REFINANCE OUR EXISTING 6.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 PRIOR TO THE EARLY MATURITY BECOMING EFFECTIVE. OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 125 TO 175 BASIS POINTS (OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE PLUS 25 TO 75 BASIS POINTS), DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY. OUR NEW SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 300 BASIS POINTS (OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE PLUS 200 BASIS POINTS).  \u200b  OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES IS BASED UPON A SPECIFIED BORROWING BASE CONSISTING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND PRESCRIPTION FILES. AT AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD $1,700.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AGAINST THE NEW FACILITIES OF $83.2 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL BORROWING CAPACITY OF $1,366.8 MILLION. IF AT ANY TIME THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES AND THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR OTHER SENIOR OBLIGATIONS EXCEED THE BORROWING BASE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN OTHER MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS TO ELIMINATE SUCH SHORTFALL.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES RESTRICT US AND ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT GUARANTEE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND UNSECURED GUARANTEED NOTES (THE \u201cSUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATING CASH ON HAND IN EXCESS OF $200.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME WHEN REVOLVING LOANS ARE OUTSTANDING (NOT INCLUDING CASH LOCATED IN OUR STORE AND LOCKBOX DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND CASH NECESSARY TO COVER OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES). THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO STATE THAT IF AT ANY TIME (OTHER THAN FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF REMEDIES OR ACCELERATION OF ANY SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OR SECOND PRIORITY DEBT AND RECEIPT OF A TRIGGERING NOTICE BY THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OR THE SECOND PRIORITY DEBT) EITHER (I) AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES OR (II) THE SUM OF REVOLVER AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND CERTAIN AMOUNTS HELD ON DEPOSIT WITH THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT IN A CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT IS LESS THAN $275.0 MILLION FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS OR LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO $200.0 MILLION ON ANY DAY (A \u201cCASH SWEEP PERIOD\u201d), THE FUNDS IN OUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WILL BE SWEPT TO A CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT WITH THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT AND WILL BE APPLIED FIRST TO REPAY OUTSTANDING REVOLVING LOANS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES, AND THEN HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THE SENIOR OBLIGATIONS UNTIL SUCH CASH SWEEP PERIOD IS RESCINDED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR NEW FACILITIES.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES ALLOW US TO HAVE OUTSTANDING, AT ANY TIME, UP TO $1.5 BILLION IN SECURED SECOND PRIORITY DEBT, SPLIT-PRIORITY TERM LOAN DEBT, UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK IN ADDITION TO BORROWINGS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, PROVIDED THAT NOT IN EXCESS OF $750.0 MILLION OF SUCH SECURED SECOND PRIORITY DEBT, SPLIT-PRIORITY TERM LOAN DEBT, UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK SHALL MATURE OR REQUIRE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL PRIOR TO 90 DAYS AFTER THE LATEST OF (I) THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEW FACILITIES AND (II) THE LATEST MATURITY DATE OF ANY TERM LOAN OR OTHER REVOLVING COMMITMENT (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE NEW FACILITIES). SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED IN CLAUSES (I) AND (II) OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE, THE NEW FACILITIES ADDITIONALLY ALLOW US TO ISSUE OR INCUR AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK SO LONG AS A FINANCIAL COVENANT EFFECTIVENESS PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE NEW FACILITIES) IS NOT IN EFFECT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF UNSECURED DEBT THAT CAN BE INCURRED IF CERTAIN INTEREST COVERAGE LEVELS ARE NOT MET AT THE TIME OF INCURRENCE OR OTHER EXEMPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO CONTAIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF SECURED FIRST PRIORITY DEBT WE ARE ABLE TO INCUR. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO ALLOW FOR THE VOLUNTARY REPURCHASE OF ANY DEBT OR OTHER CONVERTIBLE DEBT, SO LONG AS THE NEW FACILITIES ARE NOT IN DEFAULT AND WE MAINTAIN AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVER OF MORE THAN $365.0 MILLION.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES HAVE A FINANCIAL COVENANT THAT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.00 TO 1.00 (I) ON ANY DATE ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS LESS THAN $200.0 MILLION OR (II) ON THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS LESS THAN $250.0 MILLION AND, IN EACH CASE, ENDING ON AND EXCLUDING THE FIRST DAY THEREAFTER, IF ANY, WHICH IS THE 30TH CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $250.0 MILLION. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES OF $1,366.8 MILLION, OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS GREATER THAN 1.00 TO 1.00, AND WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW FACILITIES\u2019 FINANCIAL COVENANT. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO CONTAIN COVENANTS WHICH PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT, THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, SALE OF ASSETS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND THE GRANTING OF LIENS.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES PROVIDE FOR CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT INCLUDING NONPAYMENT, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH OF COVENANTS AND BANKRUPTCY. IT IS ALSO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT IF WE FAIL TO MAKE ANY REQUIRED PAYMENT ON DEBT HAVING A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF $50.0 MILLION OR ANY EVENT OCCURS THAT ENABLES, OR WHICH WITH THE GIVING OF NOTICE OR THE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LAPSE OF TIME WOULD ENABLE, THE HOLDER OF SUCH DEBT TO ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OR REQUIRE THE REPAYMENT REPURCHASE, REDEMPTION OR DEFEASANCE OF SUCH DEBT.  \u200b  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS OUR GUARANTEED UNSECURED NOTES CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SECURED AND UNSECURED DEBT THAT CAN BE INCURRED BY US. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SECURED DEBT THAT COULD BE INCURRED UNDER THE MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANT OF THE INDENTURE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION (WHICH AMOUNT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS). ASSUMING A FULLY DRAWN REVOLVER AND THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WE COULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL $350.0 MILLION IN SECURED DEBT. THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL UNSECURED DEBT UNDER THE INDENTURE IS GENERALLY GOVERNED BY AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO TEST. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL UNSECURED DEBT UNDER OUR OTHER INDENTURES.  \u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY/USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $330.0 MILLION AND $300.9 MILLION FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR HIGH LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD: (I) LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING; (II) LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY; (III) PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH LESS DEBT; (IV) RENDER US MORE VULNERABLE TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS; AND (V) REQUIRE US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW TO SERVICE OUR DEBT. BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVELS OF OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT SERVICE AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. BASED ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN STRONG THROUGHOUT THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE SUBJECT TO THE FIXED CHARGE COVENANT IN OUR NEW FACILITIES IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.

WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INCOME TAXES, INTEREST EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, LIFO ADJUSTMENTS (WHICH REMOVES THE ENTIRE IMPACT OF LIFO, AND EFFECTIVELY REFLECTS THE RESULTS AS IF WE WERE ON A FIFO INVENTORY BASIS), CHARGES OR CREDITS FOR FACILITY CLOSING AND IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO STORE CLOSINGS, LOSS ON DEBT RETIREMENTS, THE WBA MERGER TERMINATION FEE, AND OTHER ITEMS (INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, MERGER AND ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, A NON-RECURRING LITIGATION SETTLEMENT (AS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW), SEVERANCE, RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS AND COSTS RELATED TO FACILITY CLOSURES AND GAIN OR LOSS ON SALE OF ASSETS). WE REFERENCE THIS PARTICULAR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE FREQUENTLY IN OUR DECISION-MAKING BECAUSE IT PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT FACILITATES INTERNAL COMPARISONS TO THE HISTORICAL PERIODS AND EXTERNAL COMPARISONS TO COMPETITORS.

REVENUE IN CONSTANT CURRENCY IS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IN THE BILLING CURRENCY USING THEIR COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER TO BETTER ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND OUR BASE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARING RESULTS WITH PREVIOUS PERIODS AND FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY MONITORS THE BUSINESS ADJUSTED FOR THESE ITEMS IN ADDITION TO GAAP RESULTS. MANAGEMENT ALSO USES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO ESTABLISH OPERATIONAL GOALS AND, IN SOME CASES, FOR MEASURING PERFORMANCE FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES. AS THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES EMPLOYED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

INCOME TAXES FOR THE INTERIM PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON THE BASIS OF AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DECREASED, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (\u201cTCJA\u201d) AND  THE MIX OF INCOME EARNED IN DIFFERENT TAX JURISDICTIONS  . THE DECREASE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS ALSO DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE NONTAXABLE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION GAIN RELATED TO THE WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION AND THE DISCRETE IMPACT OF A PROVISIONAL NET TAX CHARGE OF $24.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE TCJA RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  AUGUST 31, 2018  (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (A)  $6,203,659  $4,822,268  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  (B)  3,452,976  2,727,276  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  (C) = (B)/((A)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  51  52  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING  COST OF REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (D)  $5,477,669  $4,392,151  INVENTORIES  (E)  2,787,159  1,927,713  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING  (F) = (E)/((D)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  47  40  DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING  COST OF REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (G)  $5,477,669  $4,392,151  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  (H)  2,932,046  2,235,139  DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING  (I) = (H)/((G)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  49  47  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  (J) = (C)+(F)-(I)  49  45  CASH FLOWS  OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IS WORKING CAPITAL INTENSIVE. OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE PRIMARILY TO FINANCE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY. WE  RELY HEAVILY ON TERM LOANS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS, AND OUR REVOLVER PROGRAMS FOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH AND CASH NEEDS TO DATE PRIMARILY THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. AS A GENERAL RULE, WHEN SALES VOLUMES ARE INCREASING, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY INCREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN DECREASED CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONVERSELY, WHEN SALES VOLUME DECREASES, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY DECREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASES IN CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONCENTRIX WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR CASH CONVERSION CYCLE WAS 49 DAYS AND 45 DAYS AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SHIPMENTS WAS DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REVENUE RECOGNITION RULES, AS WELL AS HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE AND BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY FURTHER EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE FUNDED PRIMARILY BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, OR THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $202.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $324.7 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $295.1 MILLION, AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $148.1 MILLION. THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $390.0 MILLION, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $119.6 MILLION, AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $69.1 MILLION.  THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND PAYMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS ALSO LOWER DUE TO LOWER DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR  SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WHERE WE CARRY HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORIES, AND HIGHER ANTICIPATED SEASONAL DEMAND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION  AND DEPRECIATION, PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, A $19.0 MILLION GAIN RECORDED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AND DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $40.4  MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO  A DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $387.5 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $83.3 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN VENDOR RECEIVABLE OF $55.8 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET INCOME OF $184.8 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $140.5  MILLION, A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $103.4 MILLION AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $57.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND VENDOR RECEIVABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING AND HIGHER DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUE IN THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 COMPARED TO A SEASONALLY HIGH FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. IN ADDITION, INVENTORIES WERE LOWER IN OUR SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS DUE TO HIGHER STOCKING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO COMPONENT SHORTAGES. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY TIMING OF  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PAYMENTS. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. TAX RATE DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $102.3 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $93.4 MILLION RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN BOTH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND $8.6 MILLION OF CASH PAID RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS ASSUMED UNDER THE  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $74.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $75.5 MILLION, RELATED SUBSTANTIALLY TO OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MADE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $8.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TIGERSPIKE AND RECEIVED A REFUND OF $2.3 MILLION FROM DATATEC TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION INTRA-DATATEC GROUP TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  WAS $298.4 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS OF $214.1 MILLION. CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WAS USED TO PAY DOWN REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW THE LAST TRANCHE OF $250.0 MILLION UNDER A TERM LOAN FACILITY OBTAINED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ASSUMED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION AND THE REMAINDER WAS USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL. THE COMPANY ALSO RETURNED CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $57.5 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS,  $15.2  MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON  STOCK. $14.0 MILLION OF CASH WAS USED TO PAY THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $223.1 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $114.8 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND A RETURN OF CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $56.0 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND $41.8 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE PAID $8.0 MILLION IN FEES TO LENDERS TO SECURE TERM LOAN COMMITMENTS TO FUND THE  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $262.3 MILLION AND $454.7 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019  AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OF OUR TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE CASH HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $193.8 MILLION AND $301.1 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL TAX ON REPATRIATION INTO THE UNITED STATES. REPATRIATION OF SOME FOREIGN BALANCES IS RESTRICTED BY LOCAL LAWS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FULLY UTILIZED AND REINVESTED ALL FOREIGN CASH TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION. IF IN THE FUTURE OUR INTENTIONS CHANGE, AND WE REPATRIATE THE CASH BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IMPACT OF STATE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DEPENDING UPON THE PLANNED TIMING AND MANNER OF SUCH REPATRIATION. PRESENTLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY WITHIN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENT AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES, THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IN ALL GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FOR OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED CONVERGYS BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR LONGER-TERM WORKING CAPITAL, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ANTICIPATED STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SATISFIED THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, FROM OUR BORROWING FACILITIES AND FUTURE FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE RENEWED OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM AND OUR U.S. CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT DESCRIBED BELOW ON, OR PRIOR TO, THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPIRATION DATES. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WILL NOT BE RENEWED AS WE  CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING WITH THE PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE HAD SIMILAR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT OUR YEARS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY.

WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  AMYRIS, INC. (THE COMPANY,  AMYRIS, WE, US OR OUR) IS A LEADING INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT APPLIES ITS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENGINEER, MANUFACTURE  AND SELL HIGH PERFORMANCE, NATURAL, SUSTAINABLY-SOURCED PRODUCTS INTO THE HEALTH & WELLNESS, CLEAN BEAUTY, AND FLAVOR &  FRAGRANCE MARKETS. OUR PROVEN TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ENABLES US TO RAPIDLY ENGINEER MICROBES AND USE THEM AS CATALYSTS TO METABOLIZE  RENEWABLE, PLANT-SOURCED SUGARS INTO LARGE VOLUME, HIGH-VALUE INGREDIENTS. OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND INDUSTRIAL FERMENTATION  PROCESS REPLACE EXISTING COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED OUR TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND  PRODUCE EIGHT DISTINCT MOLECULES AT COMMERCIAL VOLUMES, LEADING TO MORE THAN 15 COMMERCIAL INGREDIENTS USED BY THOUSANDS OF LEADING  GLOBAL BRANDS.  WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRIAL  SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY REPRESENTS A THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, BRINGING TOGETHER BIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING TO GENERATE NEW, MORE SUSTAINABLE  MATERIALS TO MEET THE GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BIO-BASED REPLACEMENTS FOR PETROLEUM-BASED AND TRADITIONAL ANIMAL- OR PLANT-DERIVED  INGREDIENTS. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD DEMAND FOR OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE SALES NETWORK PROVIDED BY OUR  COLLABORATION PARTNERS THAT REPRESENT LEADING COMPANIES FOR OUR TARGET MARKET SECTORS. WE ALSO HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF DIRECT SALES  AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO SUPPORT OUR CLEAN BEAUTY MARKET. VIA OUR PARTNERSHIP MODEL, OUR PARTNERS INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EACH  MOLECULE TO BRING IT FROM THE LAB TO COMMERCIAL SCALE AND USE THEIR EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE TO SELL OUR INGREDIENTS AND FORMULATIONS  TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THEIR CORE BUSINESS. WE CAPTURE LONG-TERM REVENUE BOTH THROUGH THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF THE MOLECULE  TO OUR PARTNERS AND THROUGH ROYALTY REVENUES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) FROM OUR PARTNERS' PRODUCT SALES TO THEIR  CUSTOMERS.  WE WERE FOUNDED IN 2003  IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA BY A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY. OUR FIRST MAJOR MILESTONE CAME  IN 2005 WHEN, THROUGH A GRANT FROM THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION, WE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE OF CREATING MICROBIAL  STRAINS THAT PRODUCE ARTEMISINIC ACID, WHICH IS A PRECURSOR OF ARTEMISININ, AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-MALARIAL DRUG. IN 2008, WE GRANTED  ROYALTY-FREE LICENSES TO ALLOW SANOFI-AVENTIS TO PRODUCE ARTEMISINIC ACID USING OUR TECHNOLOGY. BUILDING ON OUR SUCCESS WITH ARTEMISINIC  ACID, IN 2007 WE BEGAN APPLYING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND SELL SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES TO A BROAD RANGE  OF MARKETS.  WE FOCUSED OUR  INITIAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS PRIMARILY ON THE PRODUCTION OF BIOFENE\u00ae, OUR BRAND OF RENEWABLE FARNESENE, A LONG-CHAIN, BRANCHED  HYDROCARBON MOLECULE THAT WE MANUFACTURE THROUGH FERMENTATION USING ENGINEERED MICROBES. OUR FARNESENE DERIVATIVES ARE SOLD IN  THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS AS NUTRACEUTICALS, SKINCARE PRODUCTS, FRAGRANCES, SOLVENTS, POLYMERS, AND LUBRICANT INGREDIENTS. THE COMMERCIALIZATION  OF FARNESENE PUSHED US TO CREATE A MORE COST EFFICIENT, FASTER AND ACCURATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN THE LAB AND DRIVE MANUFACTURING  COSTS DOWN. THIS INVESTMENT HAS ENABLED OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP MICROBIAL STRAINS AND COMMERCIALIZE TARGET MOLECULES.  IN 2014, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING ADDITIONAL MOLECULES FOR THE FLAVOR & FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY; IN 2015 WE BEGAN INVESTING TO EXPAND  OUR CAPABILITIES TO OTHER SMALL MOLECULE CHEMICAL CLASSES BEYOND TERPENES VIA OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH  PROJECTS AGENCY (DARPA); AND IN 2016 WE EXPANDED INTO PROTEINS.  WE HAVE INVESTED OVER  $600 MILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE MICROBES THAT PRODUCE MOLECULES FROM SUGAR OR OTHER FEEDSTOCKS AT COMMERCIAL  SCALE. THIS PLATFORM HAS BEEN USED TO DESIGN, BUILD, OPTIMIZE AND UPSCALE STRAINS PRODUCING EIGHT DISTINCT MOLECULES AT COMMERCIAL  VOLUMES, LEADING TO MORE THAN 15 COMMERCIAL INGREDIENTS USED BY THOUSANDS OF LEADING GLOBAL BRANDS. OUR TIME TO MARKET FOR MOLECULES  HAS DECREASED FROM SEVEN YEARS TO LESS THAN A YEAR FOR OUR MOST RECENT MOLECULE, MAINLY DUE TO OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM WE HAVE BUILT.  35  OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM  HAS BEEN IN ACTIVE USE SINCE 2007 AND HAS BEEN INTEGRATED WITH OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION SINCE 2011, CREATING AN ORGANISM DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS THAT WE BELIEVE MAKES US AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN THE SUCCESSFUL SCALE-UP AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF BIOTECH-PRODUCED INGREDIENTS.  THE KEY PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR PLATFORM THAT WE BELIEVE DIFFERENTIATE US INCLUDE OUR PROPRIETARY COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS,  STRAIN CONSTRUCTION TOOLS, SCREENING AND ANALYTICS TOOLS, AND ADVANCED LAB AUTOMATION AND DATA INTEGRATION. HAVING THIS FULLY INTEGRATED  WITH OUR LARGE-SCALE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND CAPABILITY ENABLES US TO ALWAYS ENGINEER WITH THE END SPECIFICATION AND REQUIREMENTS  GUIDING OUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES INDUSTRY-LEADING STRAIN ENGINEERING AND LAB AUTOMATION LOCATED  IN EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA, PILOT SCALE PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND CAMPINAS, BRAZIL, A DEMONSTRATION-SCALE  FACILITY IN CAMPINAS, BRAZIL AND A COMMERCIAL-SCALE PRODUCTION FACILITY IN LELAND, NORTH CAROLINA, WHICH IS OWNED AND OPERATED  BY OUR APRINNOVA JOINT VENTURE TO CONVERT OUR BIOFENE INTO SQUALANE AND OTHER FINAL PRODUCTS.  WE ARE ABLE TO USE A  WIDE VARIETY OF FEEDSTOCKS FOR PRODUCTION, BUT HAVE FOCUSED ON ACCESSING BRAZILIAN SUGARCANE FOR OUR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION BECAUSE  OF ITS RENEWABILITY, LOW COST AND RELATIVE PRICE STABILITY. WE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY USED OTHER FEEDSTOCKS SUCH AS SUGAR BEETS,  CORN DEXTROSE, SWEET SORGHUM AND CELLULOSIC SUGARS AT VARIOUS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WE  MADE THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO TRANSITION OUR BUSINESS MODEL FROM COLLABORATING AND COMMERCIALIZING MOLECULES IN LOW MARGIN COMMODITY  MARKETS TO HIGHER MARGIN SPECIALTY MARKETS. WE BEGAN THE TRANSITION BY FIRST COMMERCIALIZING AND SUPPLYING FARNESENE-DERIVED SQUALANE  AS A COSMETIC INGREDIENT SOLD TO FORMULATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AND SUPPLY AGREEMENTS FOR THE  DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MOLECULES WITHIN THE FLAVOR & FRAGRANCE AND CLEAN BEAUTY MARKETS WHERE WE UTILIZE OUR  STRAIN GENERATION TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP MOLECULES THAT MEET THE CUSTOMER\u2019S RIGOROUS SPECIFICATIONS.  DURING THIS TRANSITION,  WE SOLIDIFIED THE BUSINESS MODEL OF PARTNERING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE, HIGH PERFORMING, LOW-COST MOLECULES THAT  REPLACE AN INGREDIENT IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMMERCIALLY SCALE AND MANUFACTURE THOSE MOLECULES, AND SHARE IN THE PROFITS EARNED  BY OUR CUSTOMERS ONCE OUR CUSTOMER SELLS ITS PRODUCT INTO THESE SPECIALTY MARKETS. THESE THREE STEPS CONSTITUTE OUR COLLABORATION  REVENUES, RENEWABLE PRODUCT REVENUES, AND ROYALTY REVENUES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE REVENUES).  DURING 2017, WE COMPLETED  SEVERAL DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH DSM AND OTHERS FOR NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS VITAMIN A, A HUMAN NUTRITION MOLECULE AND OTHERS, AND  IN LATE 2018 WE BEGAN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF A NEW SWEETENER PRODUCT DEVELOPED FROM THE REB M MOLECULE, WHICH IS  A SUPERIOR SWEETENER AND SUGAR REPLACEMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO BRING TWO TO THREE NEW MOLECULES PER YEAR TO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN  THE FUTURE.  IN 2017, WE DECIDED  TO MONETIZE THE USE OF ONE OF OUR LOWER MARGIN MOLECULES, FARNESENE, IN THE VITAMIN E AND LUBRICANTS SPECIALTY MARKETS WHILE RETAINING  ANY ASSOCIATED ROYALTIES, AND LICENSED FARNESENE TO KONINKLIJKE DSM N.V. (DSM) FOR USE IN THESE FIELDS. ALSO IN 2017, WE SOLD TO  DSM OUR SUBSIDIARY AMYRIS BRASIL LTDA. (AMYRIS BRASIL), WHICH OPERATED OUR PURPOSE-BUILT, LARGE-SCALE MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED  IN BROTAS, BRAZIL.  THE BROTAS FACILITY  WAS BUILT TO BATCH MANUFACTURE ONE COMMODITY PRODUCT AT A TIME (ORIGINALLY FOR HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS, A BUSINESS AMYRIS  HAS EXITED), WHICH IS AN INEFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT IS NOT SUITED FOR THE HIGH MARGIN SPECIALTY MARKETS IN WHICH WE  OPERATE TODAY. WE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURE NINE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS AND EXPECT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE  BY TWO TO THREE PRODUCTS A YEAR. THE INEFFICIENCIES WE EXPERIENCED INCLUDED HAVING TO IDLE THE FACILITY FOR TWO WEEKS AT A TIME  TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PRODUCT BATCH MANUFACTURE. THESE INEFFICIENCIES CAUSED OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.  WE ARE BUILDING A NEW PURPOSE-BUILT, LARGE-SCALE SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PLANT IN BRAZIL, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL ALLOW FOR THE  MANUFACTURE OF FIVE PRODUCTS CONCURRENTLY AND OVER 10 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ANNUALLY. AS PART OF THE DECEMBER 2017 SALE OF BROTAS,  WE CONTRACTED WITH DSM FOR THE USE OF BROTAS TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR US TO FULFILL OUR PRODUCT SUPPLY COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS  UNTIL OUR NEW PRODUCTION FACILITY BECOMES OPERATIONAL.  IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE  OBTAINED THE NECESSARY PERMITS AND BROKE GROUND ON OUR SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PLANT (SIP). WE EXPECT THE FACILITY TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL  IN Q1 OF 2021. THIS FACILITY WILL ALLOW US TO MANUFACTURE FIVE PRODUCTS AT ONCE AND TO PRODUCE BOTH OUR SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PORTFOLIO  AND OUR NEW SWEETENER PRODUCT. DURING CONSTRUCTION, WE ARE MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AT FOUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SITES IN BRAZIL,  THE U.S. AND SPAIN.  IN ADDITION, IN MAY  2019 WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH RAIZEN ENERGIA S.A. (RAIZEN) FOR THE FORMATION AND OPERATION OF A JOINT VENTURE RELATING  TO THE PRODUCTION, SALE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ALTERNATIVE SWEETENER PRODUCTS WHEREBY THE PARTIES WOULD CONSTRUCT A MANUFACTURING  FACILITY EXCLUSIVELY FOR SWEETENER MOLECULES ON LAND OWNED BY RAIZEN AND LEASED TO THE JOINT VENTURE; SEE NOTE 12, \u201cSUBSEQUENT  EVENTS\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR MORE DETAILS.  36  ALSO, IN MAY 2019, WE  CONSUMMATED A $300 MILLION RESEARCH, COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH LAVVAN, INC., A NEWLY FORMED INVESTMENT-BACKED COMPANY  (LAVVAN), FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CANNABINOIDS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE WOULD PERFORM RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND LAVVAN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE CANNABINOIDS DEVELOPED UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  THE CANNABINOID AGREEMENT IS BEING PRINCIPALLY FUNDED ON A MILESTONE BASIS, WITH AMYRIS ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTARY  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM LAVVAN. WE COULD RECEIVE AGGREGATE FUNDING OF UP TO $300 MILLION OVER THE TERM OF THE CANNABINOID  AGREEMENT IF ALL OF THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED. ADDITIONALLY, THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR PROFIT SHARE TO AMYRIS ON LAVVAN'S GROSS  PROFIT MARGIN ONCE PRODUCTS ARE COMMERCIALIZED; THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.  SALES AND REVENUE  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  FROM PRODUCT SALES, LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES, AND GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  WE HAVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION  ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH WE RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM OUR COLLABORATORS, WHICH INCLUDE DARPA, DSM, FIRMENICH SA (FIRMENICH), GIVAUDAN  INTERNATIONAL SA (GIVAUDAN), AND OTHERS. SOME OF OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE FOR ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO US IN CONSIDERATION  FOR GRANTS OF EXCLUSIVITY OR RESEARCH EFFORTS THAT WE WILL PERFORM. IN 2017 WE SIGNED COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS FOR AN INFANT NUTRITION  INGREDIENT, AND IN 2018 WE SIGNED A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT FOR TWO VITAMINS THAT WE EXPECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COLLABORATION  REVENUE AND ULTIMATELY PRODUCT SALES. OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO ACHIEVE MILESTONES PRIOR TO RECEIVING  PAYMENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) IF AND WHEN  THEY ARE COMMERCIALIZED. SEE NOTE 10, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.  ALL OF OUR NON-GOVERNMENT  PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL TERMS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MOLECULES WE SUCCESSFULLY UPSCALE AND PRODUCE AT COMMERCIAL VOLUMES. THE  FIRST MOLECULE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR US OUTSIDE OF FARNESENE WAS A FRAGRANCE MOLECULE LAUNCHED IN 2015. SINCE THE LAUNCH, THE  PRODUCT HAS CONTINUED TO GROW IN SALES YEAR OVER YEAR. IN 2016, WE LAUNCHED OUR SECOND FRAGRANCE MOLECULE AND IN 2017, WE LAUNCHED  OUR THIRD FRAGRANCE MOLECULE AS WELL AS OUR FIRST COSMETIC ACTIVE INGREDIENT. OUR PARTNERS FOR THESE MOLECULES ARE INDICATING CONTINUED  STRONG GROWTH DUE TO THEIR COST ADVANTAGED POSITION, HIGH PURITY AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION METHOD. WE ARE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY  NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO APPLY OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DELIVER SUSTAINABLE ACCESS TO KEY MOLECULES. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE A PIPELINE THAT  WE BELIEVE CAN DELIVER TWO TO THREE NEW MOLECULES EACH YEAR OVER THE COMING YEARS WITH A FLAVOR INGREDIENT, A COSMETIC ACTIVE INGREDIENT  AND A FRAGRANCE MOLECULE. IN 2019, WE ARE COMMERCIALLY PRODUCING AND SHIPPING OUR REB M PRODUCT THAT IS A SUPERIOR SWEETENER AND  SUGAR REPLACEMENT FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  AS PART OF THE DSM ACQUISITION  IN 2017 OF OUR FARNESENE FOR VITAMIN E BUSINESS, WE WOULD RECEIVE A ROYALTY PAYMENT ON CERTAIN SALES BY NENTER & CO., INC.  OF VITAMIN E UTILIZING FARNESENE PRODUCED AND SOLD BY DSM FROM OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, DSM WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY US MINIMUM  ROYALTIES TOTALING $18.1 MILLION FOR 2019 AND 2020, OF WHICH WE RECEIVED $9.3 MILLION AS A DISCOUNTED ACCELERATED PAYMENT (FROM  AN ORIGINAL PAYMENT AMOUNT OF $10.0 MILLION) DURING 2018. IN APRIL 2019, WE ASSIGNED THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SUCH ROYALTY PAYMENTS  TO DSM; SEE NOTE 12, \u201cSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\u201d IN PART 1, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER  COLLABORATION MOLECULES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WITH PARTNERS INCLUDING DSM, GIVAUDAN AND FIRMENICH THAT WE EXPECT WILL CONTRIBUTE  REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) IF AND WHEN THEY ARE COMMERCIALIZED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN  PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP). WE BELIEVE THAT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE  THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGEMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS  THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.  \u2022  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE INCLUDING ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS;  \u2022  VALUATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF COMPLEX RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  THE VALUATION OF FREESTANDING AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, WHICH IMPACTS GAINS OR LOSSES ON SUCH DERIVATIVES,  THE CARRYING VALUE OF DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK, INTEREST EXPENSE AND DEEMED DIVIDENDS; AND  \u2022  THE VALUATION OF DEBT FOR WHICH WE HAVE ELECTED FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING.  37  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES AND POLICIES, SEE NOTE 1, \"BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\" IN PART I,  ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2018 10-K/A.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO A $7.8 MILLION DECREASE IN LICENSES AND ROYALTIES REVENUE AND $2.3 MILLION DECREASE IN GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS REVENUE,  MOSTLY OFFSET BY A $6.7 MILLION INCREASE IN RENEWABLE PRODUCTS REVENUE.  RENEWABLE PRODUCTS REVENUE  INCREASED BY 129% TO $11.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WITH INCREASES  AMONG ALL RENEWABLE PRODUCTS, LED BY REBM, SQUALENE AND BIOSSANCE.  LICENSES AND ROYALTIES  REVENUE DECREASED BY 99% TO $0.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PRIMARILY  DUE TO NEGATIVE $0.4 MILLION OF ROYALTY REVENUE FROM DSM (RELATED TO AN EARLY PAYMENT DISCOUNT) DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED  TO $7.9 MILLION DURING THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS  REVENUE DECREASED BY 50% TO $2.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PRIMARILY  DUE TO $0 REVENUE FROM GIVAUDAN IN 2019 AS COMPARED TO $1.5 MILLION IN 2018, AND A $0.7 MILLION DECREASE IN COLLABORATION REVENUE  FROM DARPA.

THE DECREASE IN LOSS FROM CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WAS DUE TO THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF CERTAIN  EQUITY-RELATED DERIVATIVES IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WHICH ARE NO LONGER IMPACTING THE 2019 QUARTERS, AND IN PART  AS THE RESULT OF ADOPTING ASU 2017-11, \"EARNINGS PER SHARE (TOPIC 260); DISTINGUISHING LIABILITIES FROM EQUITY (TOPIC 480);  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN ROUND FEATURES\" WHICH ELIMINATED  THE NEED TO RECORD A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY FOR EQUITY INSTRUMENTS WITH DOWN-ROUND ANTI-DILUTION PROVISIONS. SEE NOTE 1, \"BASIS  OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\" AND NOTE 3, \"FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\" FOR A DISCUSSION  OF THE ADOPTION IMPACT TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE RECORDED $0 PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES.  N  O  ADDITIONAL PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES HAS BEEN MADE, NET OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE, DUE TO CUMULATIVE LOSSES SINCE THE COMMENCEMENT  OF OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION, AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES AND NEGATIVE  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING ISSUANCE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  . AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL,  EXCLUDING CASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  , OF $199.4 MILLION, (COMPARED TO NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL  (EXCLUDING CASH) OF $119.5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018), AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $1.6 BILLION, AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  OF $5.2 MILLION (COMPARED TO $45.4 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018).  AS  OF MARCH 31,  2019, OUR DEBT (INCLUDING RELATED PARTY DEBT), NET OF DEFERRED DISCOUNT AND ISSUANCE COSTS OF $13.5 MILLION, TOTALED $215.8 MILLION,  OF WHICH $153.8 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT. OUR  DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS THROUGH MARCH 31, 2020 ARE $179.8 MILLION  ,  INCLUDING $23.5 MILLION OF ANTICIPATED CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS  . OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN  VARIOUS COVENANTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO BE AT RISK OF DEFAULTS, SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS  ON ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND CROSS-DEFAULT CLAUSES. A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS  , OR CURE NON-COMPLIANCE OR  OBTAIN WAIVERS FOR COVENANTS VIOLATIONS,  AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING  ANY FAILURE TO MAKE A PAYMENT WHEN REQUIRED, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER SUCH INSTRUMENTS, WHICH COULD PERMIT  ACCELERATION OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS. IF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS IS ACCELERATED, IT WOULD GENERALLY ALSO CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT  UNDER OUR OTHER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS,  PERMITTING ACCELERATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS.  ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2019,  WE FAILED TO PAY AN AGGREGATE OF $63.6 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE WHEN DUE.  THE FAILURE RESULTED IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE AND ALSO TRIGGERED CROSS-DEFAULTS UNDER OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS  OF AMYRIS WHICH PERMITTED THE HOLDERS OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS TO ACCELERATE THE AMOUNTS OWING UNDER SUCH INSTRUMENTS. WE SUBSEQUENTLY  RECEIVED WAIVERS FROM SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HOLDERS OF SUCH OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ACCELERATE. AS A RESULT, THE  INDEBTEDNESS WITH RESPECT TO WHICH AMYRIS HAS OBTAINED SUCH WAIVERS CONTINUES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  THE INDEBTEDNESS REFLECTED BY THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE CONTINUES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT DEFAULT, THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE TERMS OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE.  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO  REPAY THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE. TO DATE, NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HOLDER OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE  HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A FAVORABLE OUTCOME FOR US WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE EXECUTED A TERM  SHEET WITH AN EXISTING INVESTOR FOR A TERM LOAN, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WOULD BE USED TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE  NOTE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ITS EXPECTED TIMELINE, OR ON ACCEPTABLE  TERMS, IF AT ALL. EVEN IF WE DO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING, IT WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO REPAY THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE IN FULL  WITHOUT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WHICH WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO SOURCE. THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH  CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. DUE TO THE FACTORS DESCRIBED  ABOVE, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THESE CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR ABILITY  TO EXTEND EXISTING DEBT MATURITIES BY RESTRUCTURING A MAJORITY OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WHICH IS UNCERTAIN AND OUTSIDE MANAGEMENT'S  CONTROL. THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS  UNCERTAINTY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS  A GOING CONCERN, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ACCELERATION  OF OUR OBLIGATION TO REPAY ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THOSE FACILITIES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS. IN SUCH  A SCENARIO, THE VALUES WE RECEIVE FOR OUR ASSETS IN LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE VALUES REFLECTED  IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR OPERATING PLAN FOR  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS CONTEMPLATES A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR NET CASH OUTFLOWS, RESULTING FROM (I) REVENUE GROWTH FROM SALES  OF EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTS WITH POSITIVE GROSS MARGINS, (II) REDUCED PRODUCTION COSTS AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING AND TECHNICAL  DEVELOPMENTS, AND (III) CASH INFLOWS FROM GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO  GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PRODUCT SALES, LICENSES AND ROYALTIES, AND PAYMENTS FROM EXISTING AND NEW COLLABORATION  PARTNERS, AND NEW FINANCING COMMITMENTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS, WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING  FROM EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, AGREE TO BURDENSOME COVENANTS,  GRANT FURTHER SECURITY INTERESTS IN OUR ASSETS, ENTER INTO COLLABORATION AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH  COMMERCIAL RIGHTS, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE.  40  IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE  OUR PLANNED OPERATING RESULTS, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WOULD BE JEOPARDIZED AND WE MAY NEED TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING  ACTIONS TO SUPPORT OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  \u2022  SHIFT FOCUS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT  EFFORTS;  \u2022  REDUCE EXPENDITURES FOR THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING CONSULTANTS, PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS AND OTHER VENDORS;  \u2022  REDUCE OR DELAY UNCOMMITTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING OF THE  NEW PRODUCTION FACILITY IN BRAZIL, NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITY AND LAB EQUIPMENT, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS; AND  \u2022  CLOSELY MONITOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, AS WELL AS SUSPEND OPERATIONS AT PILOT PLANTS AND  DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES.  IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN  COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS AS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,  DELAYS OR FAILURES IN OUR ABILITY TO.  \u2022  ACHIEVE PLANNED PRODUCTION LEVELS;  \u2022  DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS WITHIN PLANNED TIMELINES OR AT PLANNED SCALES; AND  \u2022  CONTINUE OTHER CORE ACTIVITIES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND OPERATIONS  FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH CASH AND INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY ON HAND, CASH INFLOWS FROM COLLABORATIONS, GRANTS, PRODUCT SALES,  LICENSE AND ROYALTIES AND EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY. SOME OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS  ARE SUBJECT TO RISK THAT WE MAY NOT MEET MILESTONES. FUTURE EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, IF NEEDED, ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR PLANNED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE NEEDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 ARE DEPENDENT ON SIGNIFICANT INFLOWS OF CASH FROM RENEWABLE PRODUCT SALES, LICENSE  AND ROYALTIES AND EXISTING COLLABORATION PARTNERS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM NEW COLLABORATIONS.  CASH FLOWS DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  CASH  FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR PRIMARY USES OF  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE COSTS RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENDITURES,  OFFSET BY CASH RECEIVED FROM RENEWABLE PRODUCT SALES, LICENSES AND ROYALTIES, AND GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $37.0 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF A $66.2 MILLION NET LOSS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $16.3 MILLION OF FAVORABLE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS THAT WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $4.6 MILLION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION, $3.5  MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND A $2.1 MILLION LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A $13.0 MILLION  DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $25.2 MILLION, CONSISTING OF A $92.8 MILLION NET LOSS, $67.3  MILLION OF FAVORABLE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS AND A $0.4 MILLION DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS WERE PRIMARILY  COMPRISED OF A $58.4 MILLION LOSS FROM CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND $4.8 MILLION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION.  CASH FLOWS FROM  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.0 MILLION, AND $1.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED OF PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH FLOWS FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.2 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $0.6 MILLION OF DEBT  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $0.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT ISSUANCE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.7 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $6.5 MILLION OF DEBT  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS.  41  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2019,  WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K.

FIXED  AND VARIABLE INTEREST RATES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5, \"DEBT\" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K/A.  FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS SHOWN ABOVE FOR VARIABLE-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF INTEREST RATES FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIXED INTEREST RATES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5, \"DEBT\" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF  THE 2018 10-K/A.  42  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES  WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED UNDER RULE 13A-15(E) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE  ACT). IN DESIGNING AND EVALUATING THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT ANY DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES,  AND MANAGEMENT NECESSARILY IS REQUIRED TO APPLY ITS JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE COST-BENEFIT OF POSSIBLE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION  OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR PRINCIPAL  EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE  AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THIS CONCLUSION WAS BASED ON THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DESCRIBED IN PART II, ITEM 9A \u201cCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\u201d OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K/A FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A). THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES HAVE NOT BEEN REMEDIATED  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IS A DEFICIENCY, OR COMBINATION  OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING SUCH THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL OR INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF NOT REMEDIATED, THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DESCRIBED IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A COULD  RESULT IN A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF OUR ANNUAL OR INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT WOULD NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED  ON A TIMELY BASIS.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING  DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS  ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS  OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW  WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM\u2019S OBJECTIVES WILL  BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS  MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION  OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND  INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT  THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER  ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO  RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE  WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.  43  PART II  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  ON APRIL 3, 2019, A SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  WAS FILED AGAINST AMYRIS AND OUR CEO, JOHN G. MELO, AND FORMER CFO (AND CURRENT CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICER), KATHLEEN VALIASEK, IN  THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED  CLASS THAT WOULD COMPRISE ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES THAT PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED OUR SECURITIES BETWEEN MARCH 15, 2018 AND  MARCH 19, 2019. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS BASED ON STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY DURING SUCH  PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF THE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT DESCRIBED ABOVE, ON JUNE 21, 2019 AND OCTOBER 1, 2019,  RESPECTIVELY, TWO SEPARATE PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT  OF CALIFORNIA (BONNER V. DOERR, ET AL., CASE NO. 4:19-CV-03621 AND CARLSON V. DOERR, ET AL., CASE NO. 4:19-CV-06230) BASED ON SIMILAR  ALLEGATIONS TO THOSE MADE IN THE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS NAME AMYRIS, INC.  AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT AND NAME A NUMBER OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS.  THE LAWSUITS SEEK TO RECOVER, ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY SUSTAINED BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH  ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S SECURITIES FILINGS. THE DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS  ALSO SEEK A SERIES OF CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES, RESTITUTION TO THE COMPANY FROM THE INDIVIDUAL  DEFENDANTS, AND AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES. THESE CASES ARE IN THE INITIAL PLEADINGS STAGE. WE BELIEVE THE COMPLAINTS LACK  MERIT, AND INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY. GIVEN THE EARLY STAGE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY  DETERMINE ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY THAT COULD RESULT FROM THESE MATTERS.  WE MAY BE INVOLVED,  FROM TIME TO TIME, IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO  MANY UNCERTAINTIES AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE  WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  THE RISKS DESCRIBED  IN PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND  THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE; OUR OPERATIONS  COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.  DUE TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OUR PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE,  AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE 2019 AND 2018 THREE FISCAL QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE  THIRTY-SIX-WEEK  PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 8, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 9, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,500 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THE SAME STORE SALES GROWTH FOR THESE STORES IS REFLECTED IN U.S. FRANCHISE STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED GLOBAL RETAIL SALES GROWTH AND POSITIVE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. OUR U.S. CARRYOUT BUSINESS EXPERIENCED CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH. WHILE OUR OVERALL U.S. DELIVERY BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, OUR U.S. DELIVERY SAME STORE SALES GROWTH HAS BEEN PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE AS WELL AS FROM AGGRESSIVE COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY.  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 214 NET NEW STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, BRINGING OUR  YEAR-TO-DATE  TOTAL TO 614. WE OPENED 174 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 40 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES, INCREASED 5.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 5.2% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $34.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $117.7 MILLION, OR 5.0%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $10.6 MILLION, OR 8.0%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $33.4 MILLION, OR 8.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. A  PRE-TAX  GAIN OF $5.9 MILLION RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF 12 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $2.3 MILLION, OR 2.7%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $21.1 MILLION, OR 8.4%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. THESE INCREASES IN NET INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2019 RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A SLIGHTLY HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING OUR DEBT RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d).

THESE DECREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.3% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES  REVENUES FROM U.S. FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $7.6 MILLION, OR 8.5%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $23.0 MILLION, OR 8.6%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER SAME STORE SALES AND AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISED STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD DUE TO NET STORE GROWTH AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE. U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 3.2% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD, AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.3% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $9.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $21.6 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 9.0%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $7.7 MILLION, OR 6.2%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $0.2 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $4.1 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $4.2 MILLION, OR 8.3%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $9.9 MILLION, OR 6.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $8.1 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $21.0 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $66.5 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $3.3 MILLION, OR 4.2%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $11.5 MILLION, OR 4.6%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. A  PRE-TAX  GAIN OF $5.9 MILLION RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF 12 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER ADVERTISING EXPENSES, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.0 MILLION, OR 8.5%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $21.5 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $0.4 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 2.2%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE WAS 4.1% IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AND WAS 4.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND 4.0% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED $8.7 MILLION, OR 57.5%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $10.2 MILLION, OR 23.3%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED TO 21.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED TO 16.6% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.9% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME AND LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $2.3 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $177.3 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $109.5 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $104.9 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $66.7 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $140.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.2 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $177.3 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\u2019S INVESTIGATION FOCUSED PRINCIPALLY ON CERTAIN  CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY DURING FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2018.  ON JANUARY 14, 2019, THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\u2019S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED, THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, AND THE REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION.  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUES RELATED TO FISCAL QUARTERS OCCURRING DURING THE 2017 AND 2018 FISCAL YEARS OF THE COMPANY.  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S FORMER INDEPENDENT AUDITOR NOTIFIED THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF ITS RESIGNATION. THE FORMER AUDITOR ALSO INDICATED THAT RELIANCE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON: (I) THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM DATED AUGUST 22, 2017 RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017; AND (II) THE COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEWS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE AUDITOR ALSO RECALLED ITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AUDIT REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017.  ON FEBRUARY 4, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND BASED UPON THE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUES PROPOSED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, DETERMINED THAT THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON: (1) THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017; AND (2) THE QUARTERLY AND YEAR-TO-DATE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR SEPTEMBER 30, 2017, DECEMBER 31, 2017, AND MARCH 31, 2018. THE BOARD ALSO DETERMINED THAT RELATED PRESS RELEASES, EARNINGS RELEASES, MANAGEMENT\u2019S REPORT ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2017, AND INVESTOR COMMUNICATIONS DESCRIBING THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THESE PERIODS SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON.  ON MARCH 8, 2019, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVED THE ENGAGEMENT OF BDO USA, LLP AS THE COMPANY\u2019S NEW INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM EFFECTIVE AS OF THE SAME DATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE SERVES AS A USEFUL METRIC FOR OUR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ENABLE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF OUR CORE BUSINESS AND FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS OVER MULTIPLE PERIODS, AND WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER WITH THE CORRESPONDING GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND OUR RECONCILIATIONS, ENHANCE INVESTORS\u2019 OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY UTILIZES NON-GAAP NET LOSS AS A METRIC IN ITS EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLANS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $17.1 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED OF  $1.9 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  .  THE CHANGE REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN NET EXPENSE FOR NON-CASH OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $2.1 MILLION  , AND NET CASH USED BY THE CHANGE IN VARIOUS OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF  $10.5 MILLION  . THE CHANGE IN NON-CASH EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CANTALOUPE IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF  $18.9 MILLION  OVER THE TWO SIX-MONTH PERIODS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.7 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $66.8 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  .  THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET CASH CONSIDERATION PAID FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CANTALOUPE IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.9 MILLION  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED OF  $67.5 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  .  THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $39.9 MILLION OF CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN A PUBLIC OFFERING AND $35.1 MILLION OF NET CASH PROCEEDS RESULTING FROM OUR TERM LOAN AND LINE OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER OUR NOVEMBER 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DELAY IN FILING ITS PERIODIC REPORTS, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE DELIVERY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RELATED COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE NOVEMBER 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE LENDER BY NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2019. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY INCURRED EXTENSION FEES DUE TO THE LENDER,  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTALING  $0.2 MILLION  , BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 AND JUNE 30, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THE COMPANY PREPAID  $20.0 MILLION  OF THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN,  $0.6 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS APPLIED TO THE INSTALLMENT PAYMENT DUE ON MARCH 31, 2019 AND THE REMAINDER OF WHICH WAS APPLIED TO THE LAST REPAYMENT INSTALLMENT OBLIGATIONS DUE UNDER THE TERM LOAN. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PREPAID THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE TERM LOAN OF $1.5 MILLION AND AGREED TO PERMANENTLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO $10 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTED THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE DATE THEREOF. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO PROVIDE THAT THE COMPANY CANNOT INCUR ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITHOUT THE LENDER\u2018S PRIOR CONSENT. FURTHER, THE PARTIES AGREED THAT THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE LIBOR PLUS  4%  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COMPANY DELIVERS CERTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON MARCH 29, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY OBTAINED WAIVERS OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE EVENT OF DEFAULT IS THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY HAVING MAINTAINED DEPOSITS ON ACCOUNT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS PERMITTED BY THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND NOT HAVING TRANSFERRED CERTAIN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS TO THE LENDER. THE WAIVER REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO REMEDY THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY MARCH 31, 2020 BY WHICH TIME THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNDERLYING COVENANT. ALTHOUGH AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 EXTENSION AGREEMENT, THE LENDER AGREED THAT ANY SUCH FAILURE WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT PENDING THE DELIVERY TO THE LENDER OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES BY NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN AS CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  JUNE 30, 2018.  PURSUANT TO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED OCTOBER 9, 2019 BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ANTARA CAPITAL MASTER FUND LP (\u201cANTARA\u201d), ON OCTOBER 9, 2019, THE COMPANY SOLD TO ANTARA 3,800,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $5.25 PER SHARE FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $19,950,000. ON OCTOBER 9, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COMMITMENT LETTER (\u201cCOMMITMENT LETTER\u201d) WITH ANTARA, PURSUANT TO WHICH ANTARA HAS COMMITTED TO EXTEND TO THE COMPANY A $30 MILLION SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (\u201cTERM FACILITY\u201d). THE TERM FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER 31, 2019. PURSUANT TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE COMPANY WOULD DRAW $15 MILLION OF THE TERM FACILITY CONCURRENTLY WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION, AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION, WOULD DRAW AN ADDITIONAL $15 MILLION DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE NINE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY AND TERMINATING ON THE EIGHTEEN-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXECUTION OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION.  THE COMPANY HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY SOURCES OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE: (1) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND OF  $63.2 MILLION  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WHICH WAS $27.5 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019; (2) THE CASH WHICH MAY BE PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR; (3) POTENTIAL SALES TO THIRD PARTY LENDERS OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR FINANCE RECEIVABLES; AND (4) GROSS CASH PROCEEDS OF $19,950,000 FROM THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SHARES TO ANTARA AS REFERRED TO ABOVE; AND (5) AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $30 MILLION UNDER THE TERM FACILITY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  AS MORE FULLY SET FORTH IN THE 2019 FORM 10-K THAT HAS BEEN FILED CONCURRENTLY WITH THIS FORM 10-Q, MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT, DURING THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY ITS BANK DEBT OF $10.0 MILLION, SALES TAX LIABILITY ESTIMATED TO BE NO MORE THAN $16 MILLION, AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF PREPARING THE 2019 FORM 10-K AND RELATED ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL BE INCURRED PRIMARILY DURING THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT HAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED EFFICIENCIES IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR CASH BALANCES.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO OPERATE ITS ANTICIPATED BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "USA TECHNOLOGIES INC", "CIK": 896429, "Date": "2019-10-09T00:00:00", "Ticker": "USAT", "Name": "USA Technologies Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3578.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "PA", "IRS": 232679963.0, "key": "20191009USAT", "labelr1": -14.722222222222225, "labelr2": 6.840390879478827, "labelr3": 10.0609756097561, "labelr4": 0.4155124653739647, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5787213999999999, "prof1": 0.42127857, "return1&2": 1.0687477379659789, "return1&2&3": 0.961221288719402, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9572272944449444, "return2": 0.9315960912052116, "return1": 1.1472222222222224, "return3": 0.899390243902439, "return4": 0.9958448753462604, "1_day_return": -14.722222222222225, "cumulative_return1": 0.013509176693149057, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 2455, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9521592891058729, "cumreturn1b": 0.9249385532045116, "cumreturn1c": 0.9811006760827843, "cumreturndow": 0.9992789330839211, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9971260667318125}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2460, "level_0": 2525, "index": 79370, "text": "ITEM 2.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2019, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS TO BETTER REFLECT THE WAY THE COMPANY NOW MANAGES ITS BUSINESS. TO REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S REVISED PERSPECTIVE, THE COMPANY NOW CLASSIFIES ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND BIOMETRICS. PRIOR YEAR SEGMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR SEGMENT INFORMATION.  PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN THESE SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS INCLUDE.  \u25aa  MOBILE MULTI-MEDIA VIDEO PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IN-DASH, OVERHEAD AND HEADREST SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  AUTOSOUND PRODUCTS INCLUDING RADIOS AND AMPLIFIERS,  \u25aa  SATELLITE RADIOS INCLUDING PLUG AND PLAY MODELS AND DIRECT CONNECT MODELS,  \u25aa  SMART PHONE TELEMATICS APPLICATIONS,  33  \u25aa  AUTOMOTIVE SECURITY, VEHICLE ACCESS AND REMOTE ST  ART SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  AUTOMOTIVE POWER ACCESSORIES,  \u25aa  REAR OBSERVATION AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  DRIVER DISTRACTION PRODUCTS, AND  \u25aa  POWER LIFT GATES.

WE BELIEVE OUR SEGMENTS MAY HAVE EXPANDING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WITH CERTAIN LEVELS OF VOLATILITY RELATED TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, NEW CAR SALES, INCREASED COMPETITION BY MANUFACTURERS, PRIVATE LABELS, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  ALSO, ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS WHICH COULD AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF INVENTORIES AND GROSS MARGINS IN THE FUTURE.  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING NEW BRANDS, EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND APPLYING THIS TO A CONTINUED STREAM OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT SHOULD INCREASE GROSS MARGINS AND IMPROVE OPERATING INCOME. IN ADDITION, IT IS OUR INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE SYNERGISTIC COMPANIES THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE OUR OVERHEAD, PENETRATE NEW MARKETS AND EXPAND EXISTING PRODUCT CATEGORIES THROUGH OUR BUSINESS CHANNELS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY ARISES, THE COMPANY WILL EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL DIVESTITURE OF A PRODUCT LINE OR BUSINESS.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  THERE WERE NO ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE JUDGMENTS CAN BE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE TO REVENUE RECOGNITION; ACCRUED SALES INCENTIVES; ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVES; INVENTORY VALUATION; VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS; VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL, TRADEMARKS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS; WARRANTIES; STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION; RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS; AND THE RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS IDENTIFIED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CHANGES TO THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES RELATED TO THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF THE DISCRETE METHOD OF ESTIMATING ITS U.S. TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT) BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 (SEE NOTE 12).  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS YOU READ THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, REFER TO THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME, WHICH PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS DATA FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018.  35  NET SALES  AUGUST 31,  2019  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  $26,845  $40,006  $(13,161  )  (32.9  )%  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS  63,034  68,328  (5,294  )  (7.7  )%  BIOMETRICS  254  184  70  38.0%  CORPORATE  113  349  (236  )  (67.6  )%  TOTAL NET SALES  $90,246  $108,867  $(18,621  )  (17.1  )%  SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  $56,487  $79,652  $(23,165  )  (29.1  )%  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS  126,687  129,232  (2,545  )  (2.0  )%  BIOMETRICS  260  412  (152  )  (36.9  )%  CORPORATE  266  426  (160  )  (37.6  )%  TOTAL NET SALES  $183,700  $209,722  $(26,022  )  (12.4  )%  AUTOMOTIVE SALES REPRESENTED 29.7% AND 30.7% OF THE NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 36.7% AND 38.0% IN THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES IN THIS SEGMENT DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EVO REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT LINE, WHICH WAS DUE IN PART TO LAUNCH DELAYS FOR CERTAIN VEHICLE MODELS, AS WELL AS SLOWER SALES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT BEGAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SOFTENING OF GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY SALES IN BOTH PERIODS. THE COMPANY\u2019S OEM SECURITY AND REMOTE START SALES ALSO DECLINED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, AS WELL AS THE DISCONTINUATION OF PASSIVE ENTRY PROGRAMS WITH ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, SALES OF AFTERMARKET SATELLITE RADIO AND HEADREST PRODUCTS HAVE DECLINED IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN STANDARD FACTORY EQUIPPED VEHICLES WITH THESE OPTIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO PRICE COMPETITION FOR AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCTS. OFFSETTING THE SALES DECLINES IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WERE INCREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SAFETY AND SECURITY PRODUCTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SALES REPRESENTED 69.8% AND 69.0% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 62.8% AND 61.6% IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THE ITS PROJECT NURSERY LINE, AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF BABY VIDEO MONITORS, AND IN WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, DUE A REDUCTION IN PRODUCT PLACEMENT WITH ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LARGER CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES BY ANOTHER. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUED TO SEE A DECLINE IN SALES OF CERTAIN HOOK-UP AND POWER PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS HEADPHONES AND REMOTES, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGY, AND DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING RATIONALIZATION OF SKU\u2019S WITH THE GOAL OF LIMITING SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS. WITHIN EUROPE, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN SALES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, AS WELL AS IN THE DIY BUSINESS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THERE WAS ALSO A DECREASE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCTS, AS A RESULT OF PRIOR YEAR LOAD-IN SALES OF TWO NEW PRODUCT LINES THAT LAUNCHED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD. OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES, THE COMPANY HAD AN INCREASE IN SALES WITHIN BOTH OF ITS PREMIUM MOBILITY AND PREMIUM WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKER CATEGORIES AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF NEW LINES OF SOUNDBARS AND WIRELESS EARBUDS, AS WELL AS STRONGER SALES OF SEVERAL EXISTING PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM COMMERCIAL SPEAKER PRODUCTS HAVE ALSO HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. BOTH RECEPTION AND KARAOKE PRODUCT SALES WERE UP FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF EXPANDED SKU OFFERINGS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND STRONGER MARKET SHARE, AND SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTIVITY BANDS HAVE INCREASED YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF INCREASED MOTION PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE APPLE WATCH. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCT SALES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF ITS NEW DOMESTIC PRODUCT LINES THAT LAUNCHED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  BIOMETRICS SALES REPRESENTED 0.3% AND 0.1% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 0.2% IN BOTH OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN SALES OF ITS NANO NXT PERIMETER ACCESS PRODUCT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE PRODUCT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING ITS EXT OUTDOOR PERIMETER ACCESS PRODUCT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE SEGMENT DID NOT HAVE INVENTORY AS  36  THE NNXT PRODUCT SOLD OUT IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS RESULTED IN THE OVERALL DECREASE IN SALES FOR THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT FOR T  HE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT  DECREASED  440 AND 360 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE DECREASE IN MARGINS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINES IN HIGHER MARGIN OEM SECURITY, REMOTE START, AND REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SALES, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN LOWER ABSORPTION OF FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIODS, FURTHER DECREASING MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECLINE IN AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCT SALES, WHICH TYPICALLY GENERATE HIGHER MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. MARGINS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 BY TARIFF INCREASES, AS CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA, WHILE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS WERE RELOCATED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LABOR COSTS. AS AN OFFSET TO THESE MARGIN DECLINES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN SATELLITE RADIO SALES, WHICH CONTRIBUTE LOWER MARGINS TO THE GROUP, WHILE INCREASED SALES OF CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SECURITY PRODUCTS CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO MARGINS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SEGMENT DECREASED 110 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. MARGINS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 BY TARIFF INCREASES, AS CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA, WHILE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS WERE RELOCATED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LABOR COSTS. MARGIN DECLINES WERE ALSO DRIVEN BY DECLINING SALES OF PRODUCTS WITH TYPICALLY HIGHER MARGINS, SUCH AS HOOK-UP AND REMOTES, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECT NURSERY PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL BY SALES DECLINES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND HIGHER WAREHOUSING COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO THE USE OF A THIRD PARTY FOR WAREHOUSING SERVICES IN EUROPE BEGINNING DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. MARGIN INCREASES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WERE DRIVEN PARTIALLY BY INCREASED SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGH MARGIN PREMIUM WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, MOBILITY PRODUCTS, AND COMMERCIAL SPEAKERS, AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S KARAOKE PRODUCTS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, MARGINS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SALES, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTS OFFERED ON OLDER PRODUCT IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT DECREASED 767 AND 385 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF CERTAIN FULLY RESERVED INVENTORY DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF INVENTORY  37  RESERVES AND CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER MARGINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN INVENTORY RESERVES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020,  WHICH HAD A POSITIV  E IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.

SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS RELATED TO FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, LOWER COMMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, AND LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS AND DISPLAY AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AS MANY DISPLAYS AND FIXTURES ARE FULLY AMORTIZED OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THESE EXPENSE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY SALARY INCREASES WITHIN SELLING RESULTING FROM TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES FROM GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN FISCAL 2019, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL HIRES AT THE COMPANY\u2019S KLIPSCH SUBSIDIARY.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY GRANTED 200,000 FULLY VESTED COMMON SHARES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AS WELL AS GRANTED ADDITIONAL SHARES WHICH VEST ON FUTURE DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT SIGNED IN JULY 2019, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,000 FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A REIMBURSEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $2,000 FOR CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE OUTCOME OF A LAWSUIT, WHICH DID NOT REPEAT DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. DISREGARDING THESE SPECIFIC ITEMS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE DECREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. OFFSETTING THE INCREASES TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DISCUSSED ABOVE WERE DECREASES IN SALARY EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN HEADCOUNT AND THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS LOWER OFFICE AND EQUIPMENT RENTAL EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES.  ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, EXPENSES WERE DOWN PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT WERE COMPLETED DURING THE PERIODS, AS WELL AS DUE TO THE MOVEMENT OF CERTAIN PROJECTS UTILIZING OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS TO IN-HOUSE EMPLOYEES AT EYELOCK. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RELATED TO THE START OF NEW PROJECTS AND HIGHER CERTIFICATION FEES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS HIGHER CUSTOMER REIMBURSEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIODS.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATED ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SEVERAL BRANDS IN ITS FORMER CONSUMER ACCESSORY AND AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS BASED ON LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED RESULTS DUE TO LOWER PRODUCT LOAD-INS, INCREASED COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES, A STREAMLINING OF SKU\u2019S, AND ITS MARKETING STRATEGY FOR ONE OF ITS BRANDS. AS A RESULT OF  38  THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL OF ITS TRADEMARKS WERE IMPAIRED  ,  RESULTING IN A TOTAL CHARGE OF $9,814 FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018  .

DURING FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN AMENDMENT TO ITS WELLS FARGO LENDING AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE LINE OF CREDIT WERE LOWERED. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED ITS DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING, THUS RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF THE RELATED FEES.  EQUITY IN INCOME OF EQUITY INVESTEE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INCOME FROM ITS 50% NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASA ELECTRONICS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (\"ASA\"). THE DECREASE IN INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN PRODUCT RECALL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 THAT WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND AN INCREASE IN WARRANTY COSTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.  DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS INVESTMENT IN RXNETWORKS, A NON-CONTROLLED CORPORATION, CONSISTING OF SHARES OF THE INVESTEE\u2019S PREFERRED STOCK. VOXX RECOGNIZED A GAIN DURING FISCAL 2018 FOR THE SALE OF THIS INVESTMENT; HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THE CASH PROCEEDS WERE SUBJECT TO A HOLD-BACK PROVISION, WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GAIN RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE HOLD-BACK PROVISION EXPIRED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED THE REMAINING PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, RECORDING AN INVESTMENT GAIN FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN VENEZUELA, WHICH ARE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE PROPERTIES AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC DETERIORATION, WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY DEVALUATION IN AUGUST OF 2018. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 REPRESENTING THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES.  OTHER, NET INCLUDES NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, INTEREST INCOME, RENTAL INCOME, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OTHER, NET INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PROCEEDS FROM A KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE POLICY IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,000, RELATED TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF KLIPSCH GROUP, INC. THAT VOXX BECAME THE BENEFICIARY OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF KLIPSCH IN FISCAL 2012.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  THE COMPANY\u2019S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES CONSISTS OF FEDERAL, FOREIGN AND STATE TAXES NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE COMPANY\u2019S YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION WITH THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE RATE THAT IT EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE FOR THE FULL YEAR.  AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND RECORDS CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ALLOWS USE OF THE YEAR-TO-DATE (THE \u201cDISCRETE METHOD\u201d) WHEN A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CANNOT BE MADE. DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE USE OF THE DISCRETE METHOD FOR U.S. OPERATIONS IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAN THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE METHOD DUE TO SENSITIVITY TO SMALL CHANGES TO PROJECTED PRE-TAX EARNINGS, WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE  39  CUSTOMARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND PRETAX INCOME.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED A FOREIGN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND APPLIED THAT TO ITS FOREIGN YEAR  TO DATE RESULTS  AND HAS CALCULATED THE U.S. TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT)  BASED ON PRE-TAX RESULTS THROUGH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  . THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IS REFLECTED IN THE TAX PROVISION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 18.4% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $6,049 AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 58.9% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $14,164, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CALCULATION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION ON A DISCRETE BASIS, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL ASSETS, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES  . IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED FOR TAX CREDITS AND LOSS JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF 13.8% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $11,066 AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 40.5% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $17,829, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CALCULATION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION ON A DISCRETE BASIS, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL ASSETS, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES RECOGNIZED BY GAAP. EBITDA REPRESENTS NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOXX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE AND BANK CHARGES, TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA ADJUSTED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INVESTMENT GAINS, LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS, AS WELL TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE PRESENT EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE IN THIS FORM 10-Q BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE HELP US TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN GAAP CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT CASH IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN COSTS OR GAINS RELATING TO CERTAIN EVENTS ALLOWS FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD.

WE DISCUSS MANY OF THE RISKS IN GREATER  DETAIL UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. ALSO, THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  REPRESENT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT. EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE ASSUME  NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AFTER THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY OPERATES WITH TWO SALES GROUPS, SURGE COMPONENTS (\u201cSURGE\u201d) AND CHALLENGE ELECTRONICS (\u201cCHALLENGE\u201d).  SURGE IS A SUPPLIER OF ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE CAPACITORS, WHICH ARE ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORAGE  DEVICES, AND DISCRETE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS, SUCH AS RECTIFIERS, TRANSISTORS AND DIODES, WHICH ARE SINGLE FUNCTION LOW POWER  SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE PACKAGED ALONE AS COMPARED TO INTEGRATED CIRCUITS SUCH AS MICROPROCESSORS. THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY  SURGE ARE TYPICALLY UTILIZED IN THE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY OF DIVERSE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUTOMOBILES, AUDIO  PRODUCTS, TEMPERATURE CONTROL PRODUCTS, LIGHTING PRODUCTS, ENERGY RELATED PRODUCTS, COMPUTER RELATED PRODUCTS, VARIOUS TYPES OF  CONSUMER PRODUCTS, GARAGE DOOR OPENERS, HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES, POWER SUPPLIES AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT. THESE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO  BOTH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS OEMS, WHO INCORPORATE THEM INTO THEIR PRODUCTS, AND TO DISTRIBUTORS  OF THE LINES OF PRODUCTS WE SELL, WHO RESELL THESE PRODUCTS WITHIN THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. THESE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED PREDOMINANTLY  IN ASIA BY APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS. WE ACT AS THE MASTER DISTRIBUTION AGENT UTILIZING INDEPENDENT SALES  REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA TO SELL AND MARKET THE PRODUCTS FOR ONE SUCH MANUFACTURER PURSUANT TO A WRITTEN  AGREEMENT. WHEN WE ACT AS A SALES AGENT, OUR SUPPLIER WHO SOLD THE PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER THAT WE INTRODUCED TO OUR SUPPLIER  PAYS US A COMMISSION. THE AMOUNT OF THE COMMISSION IS DETERMINED ON A SALE BY SALE BASIS DEPENDING ON THE PROFIT MARGIN OF THE  PRODUCT. COMMISSION REVENUE TOTALED $462,111 AND $31,968 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY,  WHICH INCREASE WAS DUE TO COMMISSION INCOME ON NEW AND EXISTING ACCOUNTS.  CHALLENGE  IS ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. IN 1999, CHALLENGE BEGAN AS A DIVISION TO SELL AUDIBLE COMPONENTS. WE HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL BECAUSE SOME OF OUR SUPPLIERS INTRODUCED NEW PRODUCTS, AND WE ALSO LOCATED  OTHER PRODUCTS FROM NEW SUPPLIERS. OUR CORE PRODUCTS INCLUDE BUZZERS, SPEAKERS, MICROPHONES, RESONATORS, ALARMS, CHIMES, FILTERS,  AND DISCRIMINATORS. WE NOW ALSO WORK WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE OUR SUPPLIERS CUSTOMIZE MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL FOR MANY  CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OWN DESIGNS AND THOSE THAT WE WORK WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE OUR SUPPLIERS REDESIGN FOR  THEM AT OUR SUPPLIERS\u2019 FACTORIES. WE HAVE AN ENGINEER ON OUR STAFF WHO WORKS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS ON SUCH REDESIGNS AND  ASSISTS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCT LINES. WE ARE CONTINUALLY LOOKING TO EXPAND THE LINE OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL. WE  SELL THESE PRODUCTS THROUGH INDEPENDENT REPRESENTATIVES THAT EARN A COMMISSION ON THE PRODUCTS WE SELL. WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH  LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL THESE PRODUCTS TO LOCAL ACCOUNTS IN EVERY STATE.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2018, WE FILED A U.S. PATENT APPLICATION WITH THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE FOR AN IMPROVED PINPOINT  ALARM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF AN ALARM VERSUS STANDARD SINGLE, MULTI-FREQUENCY,  OR BROADBAND ALARMS. THE IMPROVED ALARM CAN BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING REVERSING VEHICLES, MEDICAL EMERGENCY  NOTIFICATION, AND HARDWARE DEVICES THAT USE BLUETOOTH OR OTHER WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN COMBINATION WITH MOBILE SOFTWARE  APPLICATIONS TO LOCATE LOST ITEMS, INCLUDING PHONES, WALLETS, AND KEYS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE  PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL DO NOT HAVE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS OR COPYRIGHTS REGISTERED IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE  OR IN ANY STATE. WE RELY ON THE KNOW-HOW, EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE  PRODUCTS DO NOT INFRINGE ON ANY PATENTS OR TRADEMARKS OF OTHER PARTIES, OR VIOLATE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT INFRINGEMENT OF EXISTING OR FUTURE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS MAY OCCUR.  THE  COMPANY HAS A HONG KONG OFFICE TO EFFECTIVELY HANDLE THE TRANSFER BUSINESS FROM UNITED STATES CUSTOMERS PURCHASING AND MANUFACTURING  IN ASIA AFTER DESIGNING THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS OFFICE HAS STRENGTHENED THE COMPANY\u2019S GLOBAL POSITION, IMPROVING  OUR CAPABILITIES AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  THE  ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO CHANGE, AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE DECLINED, ESPECIALLY DUE TO TARIFFS, BUT ALSO DUE  TO A DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE COMPANY STARTED TO FEEL SOME BUSINESS DOWNTURN FROM SOME  OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  21  THE  WORLD OF BUSINESS IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING BECAUSE OF \u201cDISRUPTORS,\u201d WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TRADITIONAL BUSINESS  PRACTICES THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY EXIST, SUCH AS TARIFFS.    THESE CHANGES ALSO INCLUDE CUSTOMERS MOVING THEIR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS FROM NORTH AMERICA TO ASIA, AND THE TREND OF GLOBALIZATION. THIS TREND MAKES BUSINESS MORE COMPLICATED AND COSTLY FOR  THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY MUST HAVE A PRESENCE IN ASIA TO SERVICE AND FURTHER DEVELOP THE BUSINESS. FOR THESE REASONS, WE ESTABLISHED  SURGE LTD., OUR ASIA SUBSIDIARY. CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA.  CUSTOMERS HAVE MOVED TO REDUCE THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY. IN SOME MARKET SEGMENTS, DEMAND FOR  ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS HAS DECREASED, AND IN OTHER SEGMENTS, THE DEMAND IS STILL STRONG, SUCH AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. SOME  TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE, WHILE CUSTOMERS DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS USING DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPONENTS.  MANAGEMENT  IS CONCERNED THAT THE REST OF 2019 INTO 2020 WILL BE A YEAR OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. THESE CHALLENGES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY  IN NEGATIVE WAYS, POSSIBLY REDUCING SALES AND OR PROFITABILITY. IN ORDER FOR THE COMPANY TO GROW, WE WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, THE CONTINUED STRENGTH AND GROWTH OF THE ELECTRONICS AND SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRIES, OUR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND INTENSE PRICE  COMPETITION, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT SALES AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO  EXPAND OUR MARKETING CAPABILITIES, OUR ABILITY TO SECURE ADEQUATE SOURCES OF PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE IN DEMAND ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE  TERMS, OUR SUCCESS IN EXECUTING AND MANAGING GROWTH,  INCLUDING MONITORING  AN EXPANDED LEVEL OF OPERATIONS  AND  SYSTEMS, CONTROLLING COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCING, AND OUR ABILITY TO DEAL SUCCESSFULLY, WITH NEW AND FUTURE  DISRUPTORS. THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IS STRONGLY IMPACTED BY THE TARIFFS WHICH ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE GROWTH OF OUR  CUSTOMERS AND MANY OF THE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN CHINA. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL  ADVERSE EFFECT FROM THE TARIFFS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE  THE  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS  AND AN ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK AS WELL AS THE AGING OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF THERE IS A  CHANGE IN ACTUAL DEFAULTS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATES OF RECOVERABILITY OF AMOUNTS  DUE COULD BE AFFECTED AND THE COMPANY WOULD ADJUST THE ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  REVENUE  IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE, COLLECTABILITY  IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS OCCURS WHEN PRODUCT IS SHIPPED FROM  THE COMPANY\u2019S WAREHOUSE. FOR DIRECT SHIPMENTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR CUSTOMER, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PRODUCT IS  SHIPPED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S SUPPLIER. THE COMPANY ACTS AS A SALES AGENT FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS BUYING DIRECT FROM ONE OF ITS  SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANY REPORTS THESE COMMISSIONS AS REVENUES IN THE PERIOD EARNED.  THE  COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAINS RESERVES FOR POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES.  INVENTORY  VALUATION  INVENTORIES  ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORIES TO MARKET VALUE ARE BASED ON STOCK ROTATION, HISTORICAL  SALES REQUIREMENTS AND OBSOLESCENCE AS WELL AS IN THE CHANGES IN THE BACKLOG. RESERVES REQUIRED FOR OBSOLESCENCE WERE NOT MATERIAL  IN ANY OF THE PERIODS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED. IF MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT,  ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORIES COULD BE REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, EACH ADDITIONAL 1% OF OBSOLETE INVENTORY WOULD REDUCE OPERATING  INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $40,000.  THE  COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF ITS VENDORS AND ASSUMES THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF ITS  PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK WITH REGARDS TO THE LACK OF PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS  AS MANY OF ITS INVENTORY ITEMS ARE PURCHASED TO FULFILL PURCHASE ORDERS RECEIVED.  INCOME  TAXES  WE  HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF A DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION  ALLOWANCE RELATING TO DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. OUR ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  NET  SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $1,431,808 OR 6.1%, TO $24,957,943 AS COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $23,526,135  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $1,195,861  OR 12.9%, TO $8,085,849, AS COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $9,281,710 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN BUSINESS WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL BUSINESS WITH EXISTING  CUSTOMERS. WE ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO A DECREASED DEMAND AT CERTAIN  CUSTOMERS DUE TO A DOWNTURN IN BUSINESS DUE TO TARIFFS AS WELL AS A GENERAL DEMAND. WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE TO A DECREASE  IN BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS. NET SALES FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 REFLECT $978,807 AND  $292,166, RESPECTIVELY OF TARIFF COSTS THAT THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO PASS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  22  OUR  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $1,367,740 TO $7,208,904, OR 23.4% AS COMPARED TO $5,841,164  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED TO 28.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 24.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,  2019 INCREASED BY $308,153 TO $2,415,556, OR 14.6% AS COMPARED TO $2,107,403 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED TO 29.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 22.7% FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. THE INCREASES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS BEING SOLD AT A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN. MANAGEMENT  HAS CONTINUED TO TARGET CUSTOMERS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE REDUCED COSTS WITH FACTORIES RESULTING IN  A HIGHER GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE. A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE CAN ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASES IN  COMMISSION INCOME ON NEW AND EXISTING ACCOUNTS. OUR INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PRICE REDUCTIONS.  SOME OF THEM DEMAND PERIODIC PRICE REDUCTIONS ON A QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO ANNUAL FIXED PRICING. WE WORK  WITH ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING SERVICE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS WHO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THEIR  OWN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. AT TIMES WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RECOVER THESE PRICE REDUCTIONS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANY HAS AGREEMENTS  WITH THESE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE PERIODIC COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH REBATES IN THE AMOUNT OF 5%. THESE REDUCTIONS  ONLY AFFECT FUTURE SHIPMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND DO NOT AFFECT EXISTING ORDERS. THESE REDUCTIONS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON  OUR PROFIT MARGINS SINCE THEY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSIONS WE CAN EARN. EVEN THOUGH THIS REBATE CAN IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, THESE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS REPRESENT VERY SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY, BECAUSE THEY CAN  HELP THE COMPANY BECOME AN APPROVED SUPPLIER AT THE CUSTOMERS THEY MANUFACTURE FOR, AND THEY PURCHASE OUR COMPONENTS FOR THESE  CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS AT THESE CUSTOMERS WITHOUT THE HELP OF THESE  SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT FROM TARIFF COSTS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA, WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT AS OF JULY 6, 2018. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN  ABLE TO PASS ALONG THESE COSTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED REVENUES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING SOME CUSTOMER  DELIVERIES DIRECTLY TO HONG KONG IN ORDER TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE COSTS.  SELLING  AND SHIPPING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $2,011,634, AN INCREASE OF $50,157, OR 2.6%, AS COMPARED TO  $1,961,477 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. SELLING AND SHIPPING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  WAS $717,399, AN INCREASE OF $11,761, OR 1.7%, AS COMPARED TO $705,638 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  WE ATTRIBUTE  THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN SELLING EXPENSES SUCH AS SALESMAN COMPENSATION AND  TRAVEL AND AUTO EXPENSES, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN COMMISSION, FREIGHT OUT AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN SALESMAN COMPENSATION AND TRAVEL EXPENSES, OFFSET BY DECREASES IN FREIGHT  OUT, COMMISSION EXPENSES AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $3,458,541, AN INCREASE OF $243,816, OR 7.6%, AS COMPARED  TO $3,214,725 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST  31, 2019 WAS $1,087,154, AN INCREASE OF $65,594, OR 6.4%, AS COMPARED TO $1,021,560 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IS DUE TO INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE, INSURANCE EXPENSE,  AS WELL AS TEMPORARY HELP, BAD DEBT EXPENSES, PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES AND PAYROLL EXPENSES OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COMPUTER EXPENSES,  PROFESSIONAL FEES, CONSULTING EXPENSES, MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND BANK CHARGES. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSES AND INSURANCE EXPENSES AS WELL AS INCREASES TO TEMPORARY HELP EXPENSES, TELEPHONE,  PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES AND BAD DEBT EXPENSES, OFFSET BY DECREASES TO MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, OFFICE EXPENSES AND PAYROLL EXPENSES.  DEPRECIATION  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $28,878, A DECREASE OF $7,852, OR 21.4%, AS COMPARED TO $36,730 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31 2018. DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $9,626, A DECREASE OF $2,618,  OR 21.4%, AS COMPARED TO $12,244 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE TO THE COMPANY PURCHASING  LESS NEW EQUIPMENT DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  OTHER  INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $245, AN INCREASE OF $242 COMPARED TO $3 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST  31, 2018. OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $242, AN INCREASE OF $241 COMPARED TO $1 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  INTEREST  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $2,079, A DECREASE OF $11,251, OR 84.4% COMPARED TO $13,330 FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.

THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, PLEASE REFER TO THE BELOW SECTION OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q TITLED \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, ALL REFERENCES TO \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d, OR \u201cNEUROMETRIX\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q REFER TO NEUROMETRIX, INC.  OVERVIEW  NEUROMETRIX IS A COMMERCIAL STAGE, INNOVATION DRIVEN HEALTHCARE COMPANY COMBINING NEUROSTIMULATION AND DIGITAL MEDICINE. OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING HAS BEEN REFINED OVER NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DESIGNING, BUILDING AND MARKETING MEDICAL DEVICES THAT STIMULATE NERVES AND ANALYZE NERVE RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. WE CREATED THE MARKET FOR POINT-OF-CARE NERVE TESTING AND WERE FIRST TO MARKET WITH SOPHISTICATED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH IN-HOUSE CAPABILITIES SPANNING PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND COMPLIANCE, SALES AND MARKETING, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE DERIVE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND AFTER-MARKET CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT OVERSEAS MARKETS AND ARE CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND REGULATORS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE TWO PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES.  \u2022  WEARABLE NEUROSTIMULATION THERAPEUTIC DEVICES  \u2022  POINT-OF-CARE NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  CHRONIC PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. IT IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AS ANY PAIN LASTING MORE THAN 12 WEEKS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH ACUTE PAIN WHICH IS A NORMAL BODILY RESPONSE TO INJURY OR TRAUMA. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BE TRIGGERED BY AN INJURY OR THERE MAY BE AN ONGOING CAUSE SUCH AS DISEASE OR ILLNESS. THERE MAY ALSO BE NO CLEAR CAUSE. IN INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC PAIN, PAIN SIGNALS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THESE CAN INCLUDE FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, DECREASED APPETITE, AND MOOD CHANGES WHICH CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY AND DESPAIR. IN GENERAL, CHRONIC PAIN CANNOT BE CURED. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING FUNCTION. THE GOAL IS EFFECTIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT.  CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS OVER 100 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN ON HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVER $250 BILLION PER YEAR AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $300 BILLION PER YEAR. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IS PAIN MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANALGESICS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS, BOTH NON-OPIOID AND OPIOID. THE APPROACH TO TREATMENT IS INDIVIDUALIZED, DRUG COMBINATIONS MAY BE EMPLOYED, AND THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN HIT OR MISS. SIDE EFFECTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION ARE REAL AND THE RISKS ARE SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASINGLY, FEDERAL, STATE AND PRIVATE-PAYER RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AS A RESPONSE TO THOSE RISKS. REFLECTING THE COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND THE DIFFICULTY IN TREATING IT, WE BELIEVE THAT INADEQUATE RELIEF LEADS 25% TO 50% OF PAIN SUFFERERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, ACUPUNCTURE, CHIROPRACTIC CARE, NON-PRESCRIPTION ANALGESICS, ELECTRICAL STIMULATORS, BRACES, SLEEVES, PADS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN TOTAL THESE PAIN RELIEF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.  NERVE STIMULATION IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED CATEGORY OF TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC PAIN. THIS TREATMENT APPROACH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION REQUIRING SURGERY WITH ITS ATTENDANT RISKS. NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES INVOLVING TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) HAVE ACHIEVED LIMITED EFFICACY IN PRACTICE DUE TO DEVICE LIMITATIONS, INEFFECTIVE DOSING AND LOW PATIENT ADHERENCE. OUR QUELL WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS AND HAS RESULTED IN QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS FOR MANY CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS WHO HAVE USED THE PRODUCT, WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED THROUGH POST-MARKET ANALYSIS OF USER DATA SUBMITTED TO US FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES VIA THE QUELL APP, CLINICAL STUDIES, AND USER REVIEWS.  DIABETES IS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC WITH AN ESTIMATED AFFECTED POPULATION OF OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND ANOTHER 80 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. THE ANNUAL DIRECT COST OF  14  TREATING DIABETES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DANGEROUS ACUTE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES, THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THE DISEASE IS IN ITS LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, NERVE DISEASE AND RESULTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE AMPUTATION, EYE DISEASE LEADING TO BLINDNESS, AND KIDNEY FAILURE. THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM COMPLICATION OF DIABETES AFFECTING OVER 50% OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION IS NERVE DISEASE OR DIABETIC NEUROPATHY. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (DPN) IS THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING AMPUTATION. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES HAVE A 15-25% LIFETIME RISK OF FOOT ULCERS AND APPROXIMATELY 15% OF FOOT ULCERS LEAD TO AMPUTATION. FOOT ULCERS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES WITH A TYPICAL COST OF $5,000 TO $50,000 PER EPISODE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 16% AND 26% OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN IN THEIR FEET AND LOWER LEGS.  EARLY DETECTION OF DPN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS ONCE THE NERVES HAVE DEGENERATED. TODAY\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DPN RANGE FROM A SIMPLE MONOFILAMENT TEST FOR LACK OF SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE FEET TO A NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY PERFORMED BY A SPECIALIST. OUR DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A POINT-OF-CARE, LOW COST, QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE DISEASE, INCLUDING DPN. IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEED AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MASS SCREENINGS OF POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIKELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DPN. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES.  IN 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATION WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE (\"GSK\"). THE GSK COLLABORATION ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF QUELL, LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AND TO BE LAUNCHED BY GSK INTERNATIONALLY, AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF AREAS OF MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY. THE INITIAL TERM OF THE GSK COLLABORATION RUNS THROUGH 2020. THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GSK HAS PAID US $19.9 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND HAS CONTRIBUTED $1.3 MILLION TOWARD DEVELOPMENT COSTS. A TOTAL OF $5.1 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS, BOTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL, REMAIN OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $3.2 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS LARGELY DEPENDS ON REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, AND ON ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION. A LOW LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST IN QUELL OR DPNCHECK, A DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLES SALES, UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, OR UNANTICIPATED SETBACKS TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GSK MILESTONES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

WE ARE PARTY TO A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT WITH A BANK. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  THIS CREDIT FACILITY PERMITTED US TO BORROW UP TO  $2.5 MILLION  ON A REVOLVING BASIS. AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST EQUAL TO THE PRIME RATE PLUS 0.5% AND ARE COLLATERALIZED BY CASH, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, AND EQUIPMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDES TRADITIONAL LENDING AND REPORTING COVENANTS. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  18  IN MANAGING WORKING CAPITAL, WE FOCUS ON TWO IMPORTANT FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS.

WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $3.2 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES, FUTURE GSK COLLABORATION MILESTONE PAYMENTS, AND THE CASH TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE PRODUCT SALES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN 2020. WE CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY BE CONSUMED MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO (A) DECREASES IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS; (B) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE TO THE BUSINESS THAT AFFECT ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES; (C) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY; (D) REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS; (E) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING PLANS; (F) DELAYS IN THE TIMING OF ACHIEVING GSK MILESTONES; (G) THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND ENFORCEMENT ACTION INVOLVING QUELL; AND (H) OTHER ITEMS AFFECTING OUR FORECASTED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES AND USE OF CASH RESOURCES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCING, COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC COVERING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES FOR SALE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDING WHEN NEEDED OR OTHERWISE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AT PRICES AND ON TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERINGS. PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM S-3, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL SHARES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD, IN AN AMOUNT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, EITHER THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR BY OTHER MEANS, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION, AND THE NEW EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY DELAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION GOALS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cNURO.\u201d ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET IS MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM CLOSING BID PRICE OF $1.00. THE CLOSING BID PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET WAS $0.33 ON OCTOBER 11, 2019.  19  ON JUNE 3, 2019, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM THE LISTING QUALIFICATIONS DEPARTMENT OF THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET INDICATING THAT, FOR THE LAST 30 CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, THE BID PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK HAD CLOSED BELOW THE MINIMUM $1.00 PER SHARE REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED INCLUSION IN THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET UNDER NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5550(A)(2). THE NOTIFICATION LETTER STATES THAT PURSUANT TO NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5810(C)(3)(A), THE COMPANY WILL BE AFFORDED 180 CALENDAR DAYS, OR UNTIL DECEMBER 2, 2019, TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT. IN ORDER TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE, SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM BID CLOSING PRICE OF AT LEAST $1.00 PER SHARE FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. IF WE DO NOT REGAIN COMPLIANCE BY DECEMBER 2, 2019, NASDAQ WILL PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO US THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED. AT THAT TIME, WE MAY APPEAL NASDAQ\u2019S DELISTING DETERMINATION TO A NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATIONS PANEL. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 180 DAY GRACE PERIOD IF WE SATISFY ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER THAN THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT, FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET SET FORTH IN NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5505. THE NOTIFICATION LETTER HAS NO EFFECT AT THIS TIME ON THE LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET.  AS A PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET REQUIREMENTS, WE INTEND TO SEEK SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AUTHORIZING OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO EXECUTE A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, SHOULD THEY DEEM IT ADVISABLE, IN THE RANGE OF 1:4 TO 1:10 AT OUR SPECIAL MEETING SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 12, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.

OVERVIEW  AT INTUITIVE, WE BELIEVE THAT MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE IS LIFE-ENHANCING CARE. INTUITIVE BRINGS MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF LEADERSHIP IN ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS TO ITS OFFERINGS, AND DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES, AND MARKETS THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM. WHILE SURGERY AND ACUTE INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST DECADES, THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND DECREASED VARIABILITY OF THESE OUTCOMES ACROSS CARE TEAMS. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT IS EXERTING A LARGE AND INCREASING BURDEN ON CRITICAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING THE PROFESSIONALS WHO STAFF CARE TEAMS: SURGEONS, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS, NURSES, AND OTHER STAFF. AT THE SAME TIME, GOVERNMENTS ARE STRAINING TO COVER THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THEIR POPULATIONS AND ARE DEMANDING LOWER TOTAL COST PER PATIENT TO TREAT DISEASE. IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES, WE BELIEVE SCIENTIFIC, PROCESS, AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN BIOLOGY, COMPUTING, IMAGING, ALGORITHMS, AND ROBOTICS OFFER THE PROMISE OF NEW METHODS TO SOLVE OLD AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  AT INTUITIVE, WE ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY FOCUSING ON WHAT HOSPITALS HAVE TERMED THE QUADRUPLE AIM. FIRST, WE FOCUS ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DECREASE VARIABILITY IN THE HANDS OF CARE TEAMS. SECOND, WE SEEK TO  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPROVE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE BY MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO LIVES AND CREATING GREATER PREDICTABILITY FOR THE TREATMENT EXPERIENCE. THIRD, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE CARE TEAM SATISFACTION BY CREATING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DEPENDABLE, SMART, AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CARE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY ARE USED. FINALLY, WE SEEK TO LOWER THE TOTAL COST TO TREAT PER PATIENT EPISODE WHEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES, PROVIDING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND VALUE FOR PAYERS.  DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ENABLE SURGEONS TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY (\u201cMIS\u201d) TO MANY PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO A MORE INVASIVE SURGERY BY USING COMPUTATIONAL, ROBOTIC, AND IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO OVERCOME MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL OPEN SURGERY OR CONVENTIONAL MIS. SURGEONS USING A DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM OPERATE WHILE SEATED COMFORTABLY AT A CONSOLE VIEWING A 3D, HIGH-DEFINITION IMAGE OF THE SURGICAL FIELD. THIS IMMERSIVE CONSOLE CONNECTS SURGEONS TO THE SURGICAL FIELD AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHILE SEATED AT THE CONSOLE, THE SURGEON MANIPULATES INSTRUMENT CONTROLS IN A NATURAL MANNER, SIMILAR TO OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH A RANGE OF ARTICULATION OF THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE SURGICAL FIELD ANALOGOUS TO THE MOTIONS OF A HUMAN WRIST, WHILE FILTERING OUT THE TREMOR INHERENT IN A SURGEON\u2019S HAND. IN DESIGNING OUR PRODUCTS, WE FOCUS ON MAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY EASY AND SAFE TO USE.  OUR DA VINCI PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BROAD CATEGORIES: DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS; DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS; DA VINCI STAPLING; DA VINCI ENERGY; AND DA VINCI VISION, INCLUDING FIREFLY FLUORESCENCE IMAGING SYSTEMS AND DA VINCI ENDOSCOPES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF SERVICES, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WITHIN OUR INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM, OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO DECREASE VARIABILITY IN SURGERY BY OFFERING DEPENDABLE, CONSISTENT FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCES FOR SURGEONS SEEKING BETTER OUTCOMES. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC \u2018SYSTEMS\u2019 APPROACH TO OFFER INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE MIS INTERVENTION MORE AVAILABLE AND APPLICABLE.  WE HAVE COMMERCIALIZED THE FOLLOWING DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS: THE DA VINCI STANDARD SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 1999, THE DA VINCI S SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2006, THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2009, AND THE FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2014. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM BY ADDING THE DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH OF OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. OUR PLANS FOR THE ROLLOUT OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN THE HANDS OF EXPERIENCED DA VINCI USERS FIRST WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\"FDA\") CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGICAL AND CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE USED FOR A BROAD SET OF PROCEDURES. WE PLAN TO SEEK U.S. FDA CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS FOR DA VINCI SP OVER TIME. THE SUCCESS OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PROCEDURES FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN CLEARED AS WELL AS SECURING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL CLEARANCES. ALL DA VINCI SYSTEMS INCLUDE A SURGEON\u2019S CONSOLE (OR CONSOLES), IMAGING ELECTRONICS, A PATIENT-SIDE CART, AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  WE OFFER OVER 80 DIFFERENT MULTI-PORT DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE SURGEONS FLEXIBILITY IN CHOOSING THE TYPES OF TOOLS NEEDED TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR SURGERY. THESE MULTI-PORT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY ROBOTICALLY CONTROLLED AND PROVIDE END EFFECTORS (TIPS) THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN EITHER OPEN OR LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY. WE OFFER ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND AND DA VINCI STAPLER PRODUCTS, TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH SOPHISTICATED, COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS TO PRECISELY AND EFFICIENTLY INTERACT WITH TISSUE. DA VINCI X AND DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS SHARE THE SAME INSTRUMENTS WHEREAS THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM USES INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH X OR XI SYSTEMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NINE CORE INSTRUMENTS ON OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM. WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SP INSTRUMENT OFFERING OVER TIME.  TRAINING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE OUR DA VINCI SKILLS SIMULATOR, OUR DA VINCI CONNECT REMOTE CASE OBSERVATION AND MENTORING TOOL, AND OUR DUAL CONSOLE FOR USE IN SURGEON PROCTORING AND COLLABORATIVE SURGERY.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE U.S. FDA CLEARED OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM TO ENABLE MINIMALLY INVASIVE BIOPSY IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG. OUR ION SYSTEM WILL EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING BEYOND SURGERY INTO DIAGNOSTICS WITH THIS FIRST APPLICATION. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH AND HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED BASE. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING, COMPETITION, MARKET AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, THE EFFECTIVE FORECASTING AND MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCT DEMAND, INVENTORY LEVELS, THE MANAGEMENT OF MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY COSTS, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION.  BUSINESS MODEL  OVERVIEW  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, IN SALES OR SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UP-FRONT OR IN OPERATING LEASE TRANSACTIONS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. WE EARN RECURRING  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASES. THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM GENERALLY SELLS FOR BETWEEN $0.5 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, DEPENDING UPON THE MODEL, CONFIGURATION, AND GEOGRAPHY, AND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN PURCHASED. OUR INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES HAVE LIMITED LIVES AND WILL EITHER EXPIRE OR WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE USED IN SURGERY, AT WHICH POINT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE GENERALLY EARN BETWEEN $700 AND $3,500 OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE PER SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES PERFORMED AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS USED. WE TYPICALLY ENTER INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS AT THE TIME SYSTEMS ARE SOLD AT AN ANNUAL FEE BETWEEN $80,000 AND $190,000, DEPENDING UPON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM AND COMPOSITION OF THE SERVICES OFFERED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THESE SERVICE CONTRACTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL CONTRACTUAL SERVICE PERIODS.  THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM PROGRAM HAS A BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTENT WITH THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. CONSISTENT WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, WE INITIALLY PLACE THE ION SYSTEM AS A PIECE OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. ONCE THE SYSTEM IS INSTALLED, WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM SALES OF CONSUMABLES USED IN BIOPSIES AND ONGOING SERVICES. ION SYSTEMS WILL BE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED BASE. FOR 2019, WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION. THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT TO REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT.  RECURRING REVENUE  RECURRING REVENUE CONSISTS OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE, SERVICE REVENUE, AND OPERATING LEASE REVENUE. RECURRING REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.6 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $2.2 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2017, AND $1.9 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2016.  INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN SYSTEMS REVENUE OVER TIME. INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.0 BILLION IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $1.6 BILLION IN 2017 AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2016. THE GROWTH OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE LARGELY REFLECTS CONTINUED PROCEDURE ADOPTION.  SERVICE REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF THE BASE OF INSTALLED DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,986 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018; 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,409 AT DECEMBER 31, 2017; AND 9% TO APPROXIMATELY 3,919 AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED TO $635.1 MILLION IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $572.9 MILLION IN 2017 AND $510.7 MILLION IN 2016.  INTUITIVE SURGICAL DA VINCI SYSTEM LEASING  SINCE 2013, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SALES-TYPE AND OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH CERTAIN QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS AS A WAY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ACQUIRE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THEIR ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY PROGRAMS WHILE LEVERAGING OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE LEASES GENERALLY HAVE COMMERCIALLY COMPETITIVE TERMS AS COMPARED WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES THAT OFFER EQUIPMENT LEASING. WE INCLUDE BOTH OPERATING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES IN OUR SYSTEM SHIPMENT AND INSTALLED BASE DISCLOSURES. WE EXCLUDE OPERATING LEASES AND ION SYSTEMS FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (\u201cASP\u201d) COMPUTATIONS.  IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, WE SHIPPED 272, 139, AND 95 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 229, 108, AND 62 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OPERATING LEASES OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN LARGE CUSTOMERS WHEREBY SYSTEM AND SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SYSTEMS ARE USED. WE SET OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PRICING AT A MODEST PREMIUM RELATIVE TO PURCHASED SYSTEMS REFLECTING THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND, IN THE CASE OF USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, THE RISK THAT SYSTEM UTILIZATION MAY FALL SHORT OF ANTICIPATED LEVELS. THE PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING LEASE METRICS HEREIN. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE HAS GROWN FASTER THAN OVERALL SYSTEMS REVENUE AND WAS $51.4 MILLION, $25.9 MILLION, AND $16.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. GENERALLY, LEASE TRANSACTIONS GENERATE SIMILAR GROSS MARGINS AS OUR SALE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, A TOTAL OF 560 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED AT CUSTOMERS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEM LEASING PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH FLEXIBILITY REGARDING HOW THEY ACQUIRE OR OBTAIN ACCESS TO DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE LEASING AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCING STRUCTURES, SUCH AS USAGE-BASED PAYMENT MODELS, HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-RECEIVED, AND WE ARE WILLING TO EXPAND THE PROPORTION OF THESE STRUCTURES BASED ON CUSTOMER DEMAND. AS REVENUE FOR OPERATING LEASES IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE TERMS, TOTAL SYSTEMS REVENUE GROWTH IS REDUCED IN A PERIOD WHEN THE NUMBER OF OPERATING LEASE PLACEMENTS INCREASES AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  FOR SOME OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE LEASED SYSTEM AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING AND/OR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. REVENUE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cLEASE BUYOUTS\u201d) WAS $48.8 MILLION, $39.5 MILLION, AND $38.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CUSTOMER EXERCISES OF THE BUYOUT OPTIONS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR BUYOUT OPTIONS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE  SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST MARKETS. IN GEOGRAPHIES WHERE DA VINCI PROCEDURE ADOPTION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE, SYSTEM SALES WILL PRECEDE PROCEDURE GROWTH. SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ALSO VARY DUE TO SEASONALITY LARGELY ALIGNED WITH HOSPITAL BUDGETING CYCLES. WE TYPICALLY PLACE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF ANNUAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A LOWER PROPORTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS CUSTOMER BUDGETS ARE RESET. SYSTEM REVENUE GREW 21% TO $1,127.1 MILLION IN 2018; 16% TO $928.4 MILLION IN 2017; AND 11% TO $800.0 MILLION IN 2016. SYSTEMS REVENUE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SYSTEMS PLACED THAT ARE UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, RECURRING OPERATING LEASE REVENUE, OPERATING LEASE BUYOUTS, PRODUCT MIX, ASPS, TRADE-IN ACTIVITIES, AND CUSTOMER MIX.  PROCEDURE MIX / PRODUCTS  OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR SOFT TISSUE SURGERY FOR AREAS OF THE BODY BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE NECK, PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES, PROCEDURES RANGE IN COMPLEXITY FROM CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TO LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TEND TO BE REIMBURSED AT HIGHER RATES THAN LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. THUS, HOSPITALS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING LESS COMPLEX, BENIGN CONDITIONS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE HOSPITALS WITH ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PROCEDURE COMPLEXITY. OUR FULLY FEATURED DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM WITH ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER AND ENDOWRIST STAPLER PRODUCTS, AND OUR INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION PRODUCT TARGETS THE MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURE SEGMENT. OUR DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM AND SINGLE-SITE INSTRUMENTS ARE TARGETED TOWARDS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKETS AND PROCEDURES. OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM COMPLEMENTS THE DA VINCI XI AND X SURGICAL SYSTEMS BY ENABLING SURGEONS TO ACCESS NARROW WORKSPACES.  PROCEDURE SEASONALITY  MORE THAN HALF OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED ARE FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY BENIGN HERNIA REPAIRS, HYSTERECTOMIES, AND CHOLECYSTECTOMIES. THESE BENIGN PROCEDURES AND OTHER SHORT-TERM ELECTIVE PROCEDURES TEND TO BE MORE SEASONAL THAN CANCER OPERATIONS AND SURGERIES FOR OTHER LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. SEASONALITY IN THE U.S. FOR THESE PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER FOURTH QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN MORE PATIENTS HAVE MET ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER FIRST QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN DEDUCTIBLES ARE RESET. SEASONALITY OUTSIDE THE U.S. VARIES AND IS MORE PRONOUNCED AROUND LOCAL HOLIDAYS AND VACATION PERIODS.  DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATIONS IN THE U.S., EUROPE (EXCLUDING SPAIN, PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE, AND MOST EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, INDIA, TAIWAN, AND CHINA. IN MAY AND DECEMBER 2018, WE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS IN INDIA AND TAIWAN, RESPECTIVELY. IN JANUARY 2019, OUR INTUITIVE-FOSUN JOINT VENTURE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. IN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OUS MARKETS, WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  REGULATORY ACTIVITIES  OVERVIEW  OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A LARGE AND GROWING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THAT GOVERN THE PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, ADVERTISING, LABELING, SAFETY REPORTING DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MATERIALS CONTENT AND SOURCING, TESTING, CERTIFICATION, PACKAGING, INSTALLATION, USE, AND DISPOSAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STANDARDS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL SAFETY STANDARDS, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION, AND COMPOSITION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVES. FAILURE TO MEET THESE STANDARDS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE REGIONS THAT REQUIRE COMPLIANCE TO SUCH STANDARDS.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEDICAL DEVICE, PRIVACY, AND OTHER REGULATIONS BY REGIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT TIMELINES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND/OR INDICATIONS MAY BE EXTENDED RELATIVE TO PAST EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATIONS.  CLEARANCES AND APPROVALS  WE HAVE OBTAINED THE CLEARANCES REQUIRED TO MARKET OUR MULTI-PORT PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (STANDARD, S, SI, XI, AND X SYSTEMS) FOR OUR TARGETED SURGICAL SPECIALTIES WITHIN THE U.S., SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND THE EUROPEAN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.  IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD, WHICH ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO (SEE THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS FOR THE DA VINCI X/XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM, DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS  TM  AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF IRIS IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE RECEIVED CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. THE XI CLEARANCE DOES NOT INCLUDE ADVANCED ENERGY, STAPLING, OR WIRELESS TABLE MOTION PRODUCTS THAT ATTACH TO THE XI SYSTEM. SEPARATE CLEARANCES ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS BY CHINA NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION (\u201cNMPA\u201d).  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION PUBLISHED ON ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE THE QUOTA FOR MAJOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO BE IMPORTED AND SOLD IN CHINA THROUGH 2020. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SURGICAL SYSTEMS INTRODUCED BY OTHERS. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS.  IN JULY 2018, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 60, OUR DA VINCI ENDOWRIST 60MM STAPLER. IN JANUARY 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 45.WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN TO MARKET SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45 AND 60 (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45 STAPLERS IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A SINGLE PORT APPROACH (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). IN MARCH 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA IN MAY 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SYSTEMS WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IN APRIL 2018, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN APRIL 2017, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE FOR OUR  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN MAY 2017, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET OUR  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE U.S. WE RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AND APRIL 2018, RESPECTIVELY (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE RECEIVED IN OTHER MARKETS OVER TIME.  THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE (\u201cMHLW\u201d) CONSIDERS REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES IN APRIL OF EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS. THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRES JAPANESE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS AND SURGICAL SOCIETIES, WITH OUR SUPPORT, TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT REQUIRE IN-COUNTRY CLINICAL DATA/ECONOMIC DATA. IN APRIL 2012 AND APRIL 2016, THE MHLW GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS FOR DA VINCI PROSTATECTOMY (\u201cDVP\u201d) AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, RESPECTIVELY. MOST PROSTATECTOMIES AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMIES WERE OPEN PROCEDURES PRIOR TO DA VINCI REIMBURSEMENT. DA VINCI PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY PROCEDURES ARE HIGHER THAN OPEN PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS. AN ADDITIONAL 12 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND WILL BE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE 12 PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURES. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECALLS AND CORRECTIONS  MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES HAVE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS TO CORRECT OR REMOVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE FIELD THAT COULD POSE A RISK TO HEALTH. THE DEFINITION OF \u201cRECALLS AND CORRECTIONS\u201d IS EXPANSIVE AND INCLUDES REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, INSPECTIONS, RELABELING, AND ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OR REINFORCEMENT OF EXISTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND TRAINING WHEN SUCH ACTIONS ARE TAKEN FOR SPECIFIC REASONS OF SAFETY OR COMPLIANCE. THESE FIELD ACTIONS REQUIRE STRINGENT DOCUMENTATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING WORLDWIDE. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIONS THAT A MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER MAY TAKE IN THE FIELD WITHOUT REPORTING INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ROUTINE SERVICING AND STOCK ROTATIONS.  AS WE DETERMINE WHETHER A FIELD ACTION IS REPORTABLE IN ANY REGULATORY JURISDICTION, WE PREPARE AND SUBMIT NOTIFICATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCY FOR THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. REGULATORS CAN REQUIRE THE EXPANSION, RECLASSIFICATION, OR CHANGE IN SCOPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE FIELD ACTION. IN GENERAL, UPON SUBMITTING REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS TO REGULATORS REGARDING A FIELD ACTION THAT IS A RECALL OR CORRECTION, WE WILL NOTIFY CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE FIELD ACTION, PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED IN THEIR NATIONAL LANGUAGE, AND ARRANGE, AS REQUIRED, RETURN OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT OR A FIELD SERVICE VISIT TO PERFORM THE CORRECTION.  FIELD ACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN OUTCOMES FROM REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, DELAYS BY CUSTOMERS OF PURCHASE DECISIONS, REDUCTION OR STOPPAGE OF THE USE OF INSTALLED SYSTEMS, AND REDUCED REVENUE AS WELL AS INCREASED EXPENSES.  PROCEDURES  WE MODEL PATIENT VALUE AS EQUAL TO  PROCEDURE EFFICACY / INVASIVENESS  . IN THIS EQUATION,  PROCEDURE EFFICACY  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE SURGERY IN RESOLVING THE UNDERLYING DISEASE AND  INVASIVENESS  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF PATIENT PAIN AND DISRUPTION OF REGULAR ACTIVITIES. WHEN THE PATIENT VALUE OF A DA VINCI PROCEDURE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM SEEKING OUT SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS THAT OFFER DA VINCI SURGERY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A LOCAL MARKET SHARE SHIFT. ADOPTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES OCCURS PROCEDURE BY PROCEDURE AND MARKET BY MARKET AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PATIENT VALUE AND TOTAL TREATMENT COSTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE SAME DISEASE STATE OR CONDITION.  WORLDWIDE PROCEDURES  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEMS AND INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULATED INDEPENDENTLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THE DISCUSSION OF INDICATIONS FOR USE AND REPRESENTATIVE OR TARGET PROCEDURES IS INTENDED SOLELY TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARKET FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO PROMOTE FOR SALE OR USE ANY INTUITIVE SURGICAL PRODUCT OUTSIDE OF ITS LICENSED OR CLEARED LABELING AND INDICATIONS FOR USE.  THE ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY USING THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW FOR THOSE PROCEDURES THAT OFFER GREATER PATIENT VALUE THAN NON-DA VINCI ALTERNATIVES AND COMPETITIVE TOTAL ECONOMICS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USED PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WE FOCUS OUR ORGANIZATION AND INVESTMENTS ON DEVELOPING, MARKETING, AND TRAINING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR PROCEDURES IN WHICH DA VINCI CAN BRING PATIENT VALUE RELATIVE TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS AND/OR ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GENERAL SURGERY INCLUDE HERNIA REPAIR (BOTH VENTRAL AND INGUINAL) AND COLORECTAL PROCEDURES. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GYNECOLOGY INCLUDE DA VINCI HYSTERECTOMY (\u201cDVH\u201d), FOR BOTH CANCER AND BENIGN CONDITIONS, AND SACROCOLPOPEXY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN UROLOGY INCLUDE DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY. IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE DA VINCI LOBECTOMY AND DA VINCI  MITRAL VALVE REPAIR. IN HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE CERTAIN PROCEDURES RESECTING BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMORS CLASSIFIED AS T1 AND T2. NOT ALL THE INDICATIONS, PROCEDURES, OR PRODUCTS DESCRIBED MAY BE AVAILABLE IN A GIVEN COUNTRY OR REGION OR ON ALL GENERATIONS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. SURGEONS AND THEIR PATIENTS NEED TO CONSULT THE PRODUCT LABELING IN THEIR SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND FOR EACH PRODUCT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CLEARED USES, AS WELL AS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS, RESTRICTIONS, OR CONTRAINDICATIONS.  IN 2018, APPROXIMATELY 1,037,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 877,000 AND 753,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH IN OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2018 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES AND WORLDWIDE UROLOGIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. PROCEDURES  OVERALL U.S. PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 753,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 644,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 563,000 IN 2016. GENERAL SURGERY WAS OUR LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING U.S. SPECIALTY IN 2018 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 325,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 246,000 IN 2017 AND 186,000 IN 2016. GYNECOLOGY WAS OUR SECOND LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2018 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME OF APPROXIMATELY 265,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH 252,000 IN 2017 AND 246,000 IN 2016. U.S. UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME WAS APPROXIMATELY 128,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 118,000 IN 2017 AND 109,000 IN 2016.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROCEDURES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.  OVERALL OUS PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 284,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 233,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 190,000 IN 2016. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST OUS MARKETS WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME, WHICH GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 175,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 149,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 124,000 IN 2016. GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY PROCEDURES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH.  RECENT BUSINESS EVENTS AND TRENDS  PROCEDURES  OVERALL.  TOTAL DA VINCI PROCEDURES GREW APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CONSISTENT YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. YEAR-TO-DATE U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THORACIC PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS MODERATE GROWTH IN MORE MATURE UROLOGIC AND GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORIES.  PROCEDURE VOLUME OUS GREW APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CONSISTENT YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY (PARTICULARLY COLORECTAL), GYNECOLOGY, KIDNEY CANCER, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES. WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THESE GLOBAL MARKETS IS BEING DRIVEN BY INCREASED ACCEPTANCE AMONG SURGEONS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS, SUPPORTED BY EXPANDED GLOBAL EVIDENCE VALIDATING THE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES.  U.S. GENERAL SURGERY.  GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE MAJORITY OF INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. INGUINAL AND VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIRS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST INCREMENTAL CASES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS THEY DID IN 2018 AND 2017. WE BELIEVE THAT GROWTH IN DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR REFLECTS IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES WITHIN CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL COST BENEFITS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS. WE BELIEVE HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE GROWTH IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OF VARIOUS HERNIA PATIENT POPULATIONS AND VARYING SURGEON OPINION REGARDING OPTIMAL SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF AND TO WHAT EXTENT DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURE VOLUME WILL GROW IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT A LARGE PORTION OF HERNIA REPAIRS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED VIA DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF SURGERY.  ADOPTION OF DA VINCI FOR COLORECTAL PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL UNDERLYING PROCEDURES, INCLUDING LOW ANTERIOR RESECTIONS FOR RECTAL CANCERS AND CERTAIN COLON PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN AND CANCEROUS CONDITIONS, HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IS SUPPORTED BY OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE DA VINCI XI  SURGICAL SYSTEM, ENDOWRIST STAPLER, ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER, AND INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION.  IN RECENT QUARTERS, WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH FROM OTHER U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CHOLECYSTECTOMY AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. OUR THIRD QUARTER 2018 INTRODUCTION OF THE SUREFORM 60MM STAPLER PRODUCT PROVIDES SURGEONS A BETTER OPTIMIZED ROBOTIC TOOL SET FOR BARIATRIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. GYNECOLOGY  . GROWTH IN GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED MODESTLY COMPARED TO 2018, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BENIGN HYSTERECTOMY PROCEDURES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GROWTH IN HYSTERECTOMY FOR CANCER. COMBINING ROBOTIC, LAPAROSCOPIC, AND VAGINAL APPROACHES, MIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 80% OF THE U.S. HYSTERECTOMY MARKET FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROWTH IN GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN DRIVEN BY CONSOLIDATION OF GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES INTO HIGHER VOLUME SURGEONS THAT FOCUS ON CANCER AND COMPLEX SURGERIES.  GLOBAL UROLOGY.  GLOBAL UROLOGY PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE GROWTH. IN THE U.S., DVP IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER, AND WE BELIEVE GROWTH IS LARGELY ALIGNED WITH SURGICAL VOLUMES OF PROSTATE CANCER. FOR OUS, DVP IS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD BUT IS THE LARGEST OVERALL DA VINCI PROCEDURE. YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 GROWTH IN OUS DVP WAS CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN 2018.  KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR RECENT GLOBAL UROLOGY GROWTH. CLINICAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USE OF A DA VINCI SYSTEM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PATIENT WILL RECEIVE NEPHRON SPARING SURGERY THROUGH A PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, WHICH IS TYPICALLY SURGICAL SOCIETY GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED THERAPY.  OUS PROCEDURES.  YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH RATE REFLECTS CONTINUED DA VINCI ADOPTION IN EUROPEAN AND ASIAN MARKETS. IN 2018 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA MODERATED, AS THE PREVIOUS SYSTEMS QUOTA EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2015 AND SYSTEMS INSTALLED IN CHINA ARE HIGHLY UTILIZED. IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A NEW QUOTA TO ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA THROUGH 2020, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA ACCELERATED, AS INITIAL SYSTEMS PLACED DURING THESE QUARTERS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE FIELD. THIS QUOTA APPLIES TO THE DA VINCI SI AND RECENTLY APPROVED XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (REFER TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN THE \u201cCLEARANCES AND APPROVALS\u201d SECTION), AS WELL AS COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS WHEN AND IF CLEARED BY NMPA. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON PROVINCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESSES AND HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS. IN JAPAN, WE EXPERIENCED STRONG PROCEDURE GROWTH AFTER RECEIVING THE NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, IN 2012 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, AS ADOPTION FOR THESE PROCEDURES HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS HIGHER LEVELS OF PENETRATION, GROWTH IN THESE TWO UROLOGIC PROCEDURES HAS MODERATED. A TOTAL OF 12 ADDITIONAL DA VINCI  PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT STATUS EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN JAPAN HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE NEW PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS. HOWEVER, THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND ARE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURE. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  SYSTEM DEMAND  FUTURE DEMAND FOR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE IMPACTED BY FACTORS INCLUDING HOSPITAL RESPONSE TO THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION, PROCEDURE GROWTH RATES, HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION TRENDS, EVOLVING SYSTEM UTILIZATION AND POINT OF CARE DYNAMICS, CAPITAL REPLACEMENT TRENDS, ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS IN VARIOUS GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING JAPAN, THE TIMING AROUND GOVERNMENTAL TENDERS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, INCLUDING CHINA, THE TIMING OF WHEN WE RECEIVE REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN OUR OTHER OUS MARKETS FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM, DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS, MARKET RESPONSE AS WELL AS OTHER ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS. MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE NATURE AND TIMING OF ADDITIONAL DA VINCI SP REGULATORY INDICATIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT FUTURE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS. DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY ROBOTIC SURGERY COMPETITION, INCLUDING FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE INTRODUCED PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF ROBOTIC SURGERY OR HAVE MADE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTER THE FIELD INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AVATERA MEDICAL GMBH; CMR SURGICAL LIMITED; JOHNSON & JOHNSON (INCLUDING THEIR RECENT ACQUISITION OF AURIS HEALTH, INC.); MEDICAROID INC.; MEDROBOTICS CORP.; MEDTRONIC PLC.; MEERECOMPANY INC.; OLYMPUS CORP.; SAMSUNG CORPORATION; SMART ROBOT TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO. LTD.; TITAN MEDICAL, INC.; TRANSENTERIX, INC.; VERB SURGICAL INC. (A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND GOOGLE INC.); AND WEGO HOLDING CO., LTD.  MANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WILL ALSO IMPACT FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR RECENTLY CLEARED ION SYSTEM, AS WE EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING INTO DIAGNOSTICS, ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPETITION, CLINICAL DATA TO DEMONSTRATE VALUE, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE.  NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS  SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP AND GRAY RELOAD.  IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD.

SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD IS A NEW, SINGLE-USE CARTRIDGE THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE STAGGERED ROWS OF IMPLANTABLE STAPLES AND A STAINLESS STEEL KNIFE. THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND GRAY RELOAD HAVE PARTICULAR UTILITY IN THORACIC PROCEDURES AND ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDES THE SUREFORM 45 STAPLER AND WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, AND BLACK RELOADS. NOT ALL RELOADS OR STAPLERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE ON ALL SYSTEMS OR IN ALL COUNTRIES.  DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS.  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE IN EUROPE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS, AN ENHANCED 3D ENDOSCOPE FOR USE WITH OUR DA VINCI X AND XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS. THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS LEVERAGES NEW SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED SHARPNESS AND COLOR ACCURACY. THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE AND IS EXPECTED TO LAUNCH IN THE U.S. LATER IN 2019.  DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA.  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA, A LIGHTWEIGHT, 2D CAMERA HEAD, WHICH CAN BE CONNECTED TO THIRD-PARTY LAPAROSCOPES. THIS ALLOWS THE LAPAROSCOPIC IMAGE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DA VINCI X/XI VISION CART TO ADDRESS ASPECTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES THAT MAY REQUIRE USE OF A LAPAROSCOPE, THUS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR REDUNDANT EQUIPMENT IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND INCREASING PROCEDURE EFFICIENCY. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA IN A MEASURED FASHION IN 2019 WITH A BROAD LAUNCH EXPECTED IN EARLY 2020.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES. THE ION SYSTEM USES AN ULTRA-THIN ARTICULATING ROBOTIC CATHETER THAT CAN MOVE 180 DEGREES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE OUTER DIAMETER OF THE CATHETER IS 3.5MM, WHICH PHYSICIANS CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH SMALL AND TORTUOUS AIRWAYS TO REACH NODULES IN ANY AIRWAY SEGMENT WITHIN THE LUNG. THE ION SYSTEM\u2019S FLEXIBLE BIOPSY NEEDLE CAN ALSO PASS THROUGH VERY TIGHT BENDS VIA ION\u2019S CATHETER TO COLLECT TISSUE IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG. THE CATHETER\u2019S 2MM WORKING CHANNEL CAN ALSO ACCOMMODATE OTHER BIOPSY TOOLS, SUCH AS BIOPSY FORCEPS OR CYTOLOGY BRUSHES, IF NECESSARY. WE ARE INTRODUCING ION IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IRIS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT. IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH THE PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE NOW IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM.  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR  A SINGLE PORT APPROACH  . IN MARCH 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDES THREE, MULTI-JOINTED, WRISTED INSTRUMENTS AND THE FIRST DA VINCI FULLY WRISTED, 3DHD CAMERA. THE INSTRUMENTS AND THE CAMERA ALL EMERGE THROUGH A SINGLE CANNULA AND ARE TRIANGULATED AROUND THE TARGET ANATOMY TO AVOID EXTERNAL INSTRUMENT COLLISIONS THAT CAN OCCUR IN NARROW SURGICAL WORKSPACES. THE SYSTEM ENABLES FLEXIBLE PORT PLACEMENT AND BROAD INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RANGE OF MOTION (E.G., 360 DEGREES OF ANATOMICAL ACCESS) THROUGH THE SINGLE SP ARM. SURGEONS CONTROL THE FULLY ARTICULATING INSTRUMENTS AND THE CAMERA ON THE DA VINCI SP SYSTEM, WHICH USES THE SAME FOURTH GENERATION SURGEON CONSOLE AS THE DA VINCI X AND XI SYSTEMS. THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM PROVIDES SURGEONS WITH ROBOTIC-ASSISTED TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED FOR DEEP AND NARROW ACCESS TO TISSUE IN THE BODY. WE ANTICIPATE PURSUING FURTHER REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING COLORECTAL APPLICATIONS, BROADENING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE SP PLATFORM OVER TIME. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM.  IN MAY 2017, WE LAUNCHED A NEW DA VINCI MODEL, THE DA VINCI X, IN THE U.S. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM PROVIDES SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS WITH ACCESS TO SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI SURGERY TECHNOLOGY AT A LOWER COST. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM USES THE SAME VISION CART AND SURGEON CONSOLE THAT ARE FOUND ON OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT, THE DA VINCI XI SYSTEM. FOR NEW CUSTOMERS, THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM PROVIDES A COST EFFECTIVE CAPITAL ENTRY POINT WHILE PROVIDING A PATHWAY FOR UPGRADING TO OTHER FOURTH GENERATION SYSTEMS. EXISTING CUSTOMERS MAY NEGOTIATE TO TRADE IN THEIR OLDER DA VINCI SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO STANDARDIZE THEIR ROBOTICS PROGRAMS ONTO THE FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM, CHOOSING WHICH SYSTEM MODEL BY CONSIDERING CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.  THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM ENABLES OPTIMIZED, FOCUSED-QUADRANT SURGERY, INCLUDING PROCEDURES LIKE PROSTATECTOMY, HERNIA REPAIR, AND BENIGN HYSTERECTOMY, AMONG OTHERS. THE SYSTEM FEATURES FLEXIBLE PORT PLACEMENT AND 3D DIGITAL OPTICS, WHILE INCORPORATING THE SAME ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES AS THE DA VINCI XI. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM DRIVES OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THROUGH SET-UP TECHNOLOGY THAT USES VOICE AND LASER GUIDANCE, DRAPE DESIGN THAT SIMPLIFIES SURGERY PREPARATIONS, AND A LIGHTWEIGHT, FULLY INTEGRATED ENDOSCOPE.

ON AUGUST 31, 2019, UPON THE SATISFACTION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS, WE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF THESE ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, WHICH COLLECTIVELY MET THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS. TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF $100.6 MILLION, AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE, CONSISTED OF AN INITIAL CASH PAYMENT OF $34.4 MILLION AND DEFERRED CASH PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $66.2 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE FUTURE PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN INTEGRATION STEPS, WHICH OCCUR DURING 2019 AND 2020 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED AROUND THE END OF 2020.  THE PROCESS TO MANUFACTURE ENDOSCOPES IS COMPLEX, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE ENDOSCOPE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE EMPLOYEES OF SCHO\u0308LLY OR ITS CURRENT SUPPLIERS. THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WILL BE COMPLEX AND INVOLVES THE INTEGRATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES GLOBALLY. THE INTEGRATION MAY REQUIRE EXPENSES AND TIME IN EXCESS OF EXPECTATIONS. INTEGRATING THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION WILL ALSO INVOLVE GETTING CERTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RE-CERTIFICATION OF MANUFACTURING SITES. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OR MANUFACTURE ENDOSCOPES SUBSEQUENT TO THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION, IT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

REVENUE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL REVENUE WAS APPROXIMATELY 20% AND 19% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND 19% AND 20% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE GENERALLY SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN LOCAL CURRENCIES WHERE WE HAVE DIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. FOREIGN CURRENCY RATE FLUCTUATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  REVENUE GENERATED IN THE U.S. ACCOUNTED FOR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE FOR BOTH THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND 73% AND 71% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE BELIEVE THAT U.S. REVENUE HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THE LARGE MAJORITY OF TOTAL REVENUE DUE TO U.S. PATIENTS\u2019 ABILITY TO CHOOSE THEIR PROVIDER AND METHOD OF TREATMENT, REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURES SUPPORTIVE OF INNOVATION AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY, AND OUR INITIAL INVESTMENTS FOCUSED ON U.S. INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE BEEN INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS IN THE OUS MARKETS, AND OUR OUS PROCEDURES HAVE GROWN FASTER IN PROPORTION TO U.S. PROCEDURES. WE EXPECT THAT OUR OUS PROCEDURES AND REVENUE WILL MAKE UP A GREATER PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE LONG TERM.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR REVENUE AND SYSTEM UNIT SHIPMENTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND UNIT SHIPMENTS).

INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE INCREASED BY 25% TO $606.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $486.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY PROCEDURE GROWTH OF NEARLY 20%, INCREMENTAL SALES OF OUR ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, AND CUSTOMER BUYING PATTERNS. THIRD QUARTER 2019 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 18% WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES AS WELL AS MODERATE GROWTH IN THE MORE MATURE GYNECOLOGIC AND UROLOGIC PROCEDURES CATEGORIES. OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 23% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGY, AND KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES. GEOGRAPHICALLY, THIRD QUARTER 2019 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE EXPANSION IN JAPAN, GERMANY, KOREA, AND CHINA.  SYSTEMS REVENUE INCREASED BY 23% TO $338.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $274.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. HIGHER THIRD QUARTER 2019 SYSTEMS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SYSTEM SHIPMENTS, HIGHER THIRD QUARTER 2019 ASPS, HIGHER OPERATING LEASE REVENUE, AND HIGHER LEASE BUYOUTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER PROPORTION OF SYSTEM SHIPMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, A TOTAL O  F 275 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED COMPARED WITH 231 SYSTEMS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. BY GEOGRAPHY, 185 SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 36 INTO EUROPE, 43 INTO ASIA, AND 11 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED WITH 156 SYSTEMS SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 30 INTO EUROPE, 37 INTO ASIA, AND 8 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. THE INCREASE IN SYSTEMS SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH, THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH CAPACITY, AND MORE CUSTOMERS TRADING IN OLDER DA VINCI MODELS FOR FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X SYSTEMS.  WE SHIPPED 102 AND 75 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 92 AND 58 SYSTEMS WERE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES, IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE WAS $27.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $14.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. SYSTEMS PLACED AS OPERATING LEASES REPRESENTED 33% OF TOTAL SHIPMENTS DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED WITH 25% DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. A TOTAL 560 OF DA VINCI  SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED AT CUSTOMERS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS WAS $19.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $8.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. WE EXPECT REVENUE FROM LEASE BUYOUTS TO FLUCTUATE PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THE BUYOUT OPTIONS EMBEDDED IN THEIR LEASES.  THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM ASP, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMS SHIPPED UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ION SYSTEMS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.57 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.45 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER THIRD QUARTER 2019 ASP WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX. ASP FLUCTUATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCT PRICING, SYSTEMS SHIPPED INVOLVING TRADE-INS, AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  PRODUCT REVENUE INCREASED BY 21% TO $2.7 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $2.2 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE INCREASED BY 22% TO $1,737.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $1,422.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 18% AND INCREMENTAL SALES OF OUR ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS. YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH OF APPROXIMATELY 17% WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES AS WELL AS MODERATE GROWTH IN MORE MATURE GYNECOLOGIC AND UROLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORIES. OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGY, AND KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES.  SYSTEMS REVENUE INCREASED BY 18% TO $929.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $786.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. HIGHER YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 SYSTEMS REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SYSTEM SHIPMENTS AND HIGHER LEASE-RELATED REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER NUMBER OF SYSTEM PLACEMENTS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, A TOTAL OF 783 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED, COMPARED WITH 636 SYSTEMS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. BY GEOGRAPHY, 532 SYSTEMS WERE SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 115 INTO EUROPE, 104 INTO ASIA, AND 32 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH 406 SYSTEMS SHIPPED INTO THE U.S., 114 INTO EUROPE, 76 INTO ASIA, AND 40 INTO OTHER MARKETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

OPERATING LEASE REVENUE WAS $72.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $35.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN SYSTEMS SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH, THE NEED FOR HOSPITALS TO EXPAND OR ESTABLISH CAPACITY, AND MORE CUSTOMERS TRADING IN OLDER DA VINCI MODELS FOR FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X SYSTEMS.  THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM ASP, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SYSTEMS SHIPPED UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ION SYSTEMS, WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.48 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.45 MILLION FOR NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 ASP WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE PRODUCT AND GEOGRAPHIC MIX. ASP FLUCTUATES PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCT PRICING, SYSTEMS SHIPPED INVOLVING TRADE-INS, AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  SERVICE REVENUE  SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY 15% TO $183.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $160.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY 14% TO $533.9 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH $468.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS PRODUCING SERVICE REVENUE.  GROSS PROFIT  PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED 25% TO $667.5 MILLION, REPRESENTING 70.6% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $535.8 MILLION, REPRESENTING 70.4% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED 20% TO $1.9 BILLION, REPRESENTING 69.7% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $1.6 BILLION, REPRESENTING 70.4% OF PRODUCT REVENUE, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCT REVENUE.  HIGHER GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS DRIVEN BY IMPROVED MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE.  LOWER GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES. PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $12.4 MILLION AND $34.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $10.1 MILLION AND $27.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. PRODUCT GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCLUDED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $7.9 MILLION AND $22.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $1.8 MILLION AND $4.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  IN PRIOR PERIODS, WE WERE SUBJECT TO THE MEDICAL DEVICE EXCISE TAX (\u201cMDET\u201d) IN THE UNITED STATES. MDET INITIALLY BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2013, AND WE TREATED MDET AS A REDUCTION IN GROSS PROFIT. IN DECEMBER 2015, THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016 (THE \u201cAPPROPRIATIONS ACT\u201d) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE APPROPRIATIONS ACT INCLUDED A TWO-YEAR MORATORIUM ON MDET SUCH THAT MEDICAL DEVICE SALES IN 2016 AND 2017 WERE EXEMPT FROM THE EXCISE TAX. THIS MORATORIUM WAS EXTENDED THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019, BY THE EXTENSION OF CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2018, SIGNED INTO LAW ON JANUARY 22, 2018. MDET IS SCHEDULED TO BE REINSTATED ON JANUARY 1, 2020.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $118.1 MILLION, OR 64.4% OF SERVICE REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $106.5 MILLION, OR 66.6% OF SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $354.4 MILLION, OR 66.4% OF SERVICE REVENUE, COMPARED WITH $313.9 MILLION, OR 67.0% OF SERVICE REVENUE, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE HIGHER SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SERVICE REVENUE, REFLECTING A LARGER INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS.  SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $5.6 MILLION AND $14.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $4.5 MILLION AND $12.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. SERVICE GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDED  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $0.9 MILLION AND $2.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $0.2 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS FOR SALES, MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, TRADESHOW EXPENSES, LEGAL EXPENSES, REGULATORY FEES, AND GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 28% TO $284.0 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $221.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 19% TO $836.6 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $702.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH OUR EXPANDED ASIAN AND EUROPEAN TEAMS, INCLUDING ESTABLISHING OUR DIRECT ORGANIZATIONS IN CHINA, INDIA, AND TAIWAN, AND INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR GROWTH.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDED NET PRE-TAX LITIGATION CHARGES (RECOVERIES) OF $0.2 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $(1.8) MILLION AND $45.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REFLECTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $44.7 MILLION AND $124.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH $35.9 MILLION AND $98.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 26% TO $135.9 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $107.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 34% TO $400.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $298.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES, INTANGIBLE ASSET CHARGES, AND OTHER PROJECT COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT A BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES (INCLUDING ION AND SP PLATFORM INVESTMENTS, INFORMATICS, ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROBOTICS).  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCLUDED WITHIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $26.6 MILLION AND $74.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $20.2 MILLION AND $54.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INTANGIBLE ASSET CHARGES WERE $0.5 MILLION AND $21.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH $1.5 MILLION AND $12.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FLUCTUATE WITH PROJECT TIMING. BASED UPON OUR BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND THE STAGE OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATE THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $33.3 MILLION AND $93.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $21.9 MILLION AND $53.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST EARNED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $0.3 MILLION, OR 0.1% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $43.4 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $51.4 MILLION, OR 4.8% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $87.0 MILLION, OR 9.4% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX BENEFIT FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR SWISS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (DISCUSSED BELOW).  IN AUGUST 2019, SWISS TAX REFORM WAS ENACTED, WHICH RESULTS IN A HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATE FOR OUR SWISS ENTITY FOR YEARS AFTER 2019. UNDER U.S. GAAP, CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAW ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT, AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT THE ENACTED TAX RATE. THE IMPACT OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR SWISS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS A BENEFIT OF $51.3 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 12.9 AND 4.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ALSO INCLUDED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS OF $28.8 MILLION AND $112.8 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 7.2 AND 10.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AS THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OR DEFICIENCIES FLUCTUATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE VOLUME OF SHARE-BASED INSTRUMENTS SETTLED OR VESTED, AND THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS UNDER U.S. GAAP.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN OUR TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  IN JULY 2015, A U.S. TAX COURT OPINION (THE \u201c2015 OPINION\u201d) WAS ISSUED INVOLVING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY CHARGES FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE U.S. TAX COURT, WE WERE REQUIRED TO, AND DID, REFUND TO OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ELEMENT OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY CHARGES MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. STARTING FROM 2015, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM INTERCOMPANY CHARGES. IN JUNE 2019, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE 2015 OPINION (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT OPINION\u201d). SINCE THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION POTENTIALLY IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER JUDICIAL REVIEW, WE CONTINUE TO TREAT OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2015 OPINION AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION OF THE POSITION IN LIGHT OF THE PRESENT FACTS. IN THE EVENT OF A FINAL OPINION WHICH REVERSES THE 2015 OPINION, THERE MAY BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  THE COMPANY\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE (THE \u201cJOINT VENTURE\u201d) WITH SHANGHAI FOSUN PHARMACEUTICAL (GROUP) CO., LTD. (\u201cFOSUN PHARMA\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, WAS ESTABLISHED TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THE JOINT VENTURE IS OWNED 60% BY US AND 40% BY FOSUN PHARMA. THE CATHETER-BASED TECHNOLOGY WILL INITIALLY TARGET EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED FORMS OF CANCER IN THE WORLD. DISTRIBUTION OF CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES IN CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT VENTURE, WHILE DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE OF CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY US. THE JOINT VENTURE IS LOCATED IN CHINA. IN JANUARY 2019, THE JOINT VENTURE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND CERTAIN PERSONNEL, FROM CHINDEX AND ITS AFFILIATES, A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN PHARMA, AND BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED $55 MILLION OF UP TO $100 MILLION REQUIRED BY THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THE JOINT VENTURE TO GENERATE REVENUE IN 2019 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES OR THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE WILL SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE SUCH PRODUCTS. THERE CAN ALSO BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND ITS BUSINESS, THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BECOME PROFITABLE, OR THAT THE ACQUIRED CHINDEX ASSETS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS WILL BE REALIZED.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $1.9 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $(0.7) MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHICH REDUCED COSTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $2.5 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASED NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND HIGHER COSTS TO RAMP UP OPERATIONS IN CHINA DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND BY THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PLUS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED FROM $4.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, TO $5.4 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY FROM CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS. CASH GENERATION IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTHS AND PROVIDES US WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING OUR OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING NEEDS.  SEE \u201cITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d ON OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FOR DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW DATA (UNAUDITED)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND 2018 (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $1,045.5  $831.5  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (748.2)  (563.3)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (219.2)  92.6  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (2.9)  (0.7)  NET INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $75.2  $360.1  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $1,045.5 MILLION EXCEEDED OUR NET INCOME OF $1,019.1 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  1.  OUR NET INCOME INCLUDED NON-CASH CHARGES: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF $246.6 MILLION; DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OF $108.0 MILLION; AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $31.2 MILLION; AND AMORTIZATION OF CONTRACT ACQUISITION ASSETS OF $9.2 MILLION.  2.  THE NON-CASH CHARGES OUTLINED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT RESULTED IN $353.7 MILLION OF CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, DEFERRED REVENUE, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES. INVENTORY, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT FROM INVENTORY TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, INCREASED BY $293.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AND BUILD-UP TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS TO MITIGATE RISKS OF DISRUPTION THAT COULD ARISE FROM TRADE, SUPPLY, OR OTHER MATTERS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED BY $95.1 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $39.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL MATTER. ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DECREASED BY $6.8 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENTS OF 2018 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $50.6 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF BILLINGS AND COLLECTIONS AND A $24.7 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY BUILD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS (NET OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS) OF $432.8 MILLION, THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $283.6 MILLION, AND THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF $32.9 MILLION. WE INVEST PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGH QUALITY, FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY, AT ANY TIME, CONTAIN INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL NOTES, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CASH DEPOSITS, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CASH USED IN THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $269.5 MILLION AND $152.9 MILLION IN TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF VESTED EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $205.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INTENSIVE. HOWEVER, WITH THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY AND FACILITIES AND IN MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS HAVE INCREASED. WE EXPECT THESE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO EXCEED $300 MILLION IN BOTH 2019 AND 2020. WE INTEND TO FUND THESE NEEDS WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE RESOURCES WE DEVOTE TO DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING OUR PRODUCTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND PROCEDURE ADOPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, FACILITIES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BASED UPON OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH THROUGH CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH INCOME TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW OR MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE, OR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE, TO THE COMPANY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC", "CIK": 1035267, "Date": "2019-10-18T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ISRG", "Name": "Intuitive Surgical Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3842.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 770416458.0, "key": "20191018ISRG", "labelr1": -0.6269315673289102, "labelr2": -4.7894082104140825, "labelr3": 0.7652823145123699, "labelr4": 1.5004167824395709, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5548148, "prof1": 0.44518518, "return1&2": 1.0544636608970233, "return1&2&3": 1.046394036987219, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0306937652458157, "return2": 1.047894082104141, "return1": 1.0062693156732891, "return3": 0.9923471768548764, "return4": 0.9849958321756044, "1_day_return": -0.6269315673289144, "cumulative_return1": 0.02096786952325579, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 2479, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0007823615098979, "cumreturn1b": 0.6917936817183512, "cumreturn1c": 1.0079440934904904, "cumreturndow": 1.0226069113170646, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0095811984995915}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2483, "level_0": 2550, "index": 63446, "text": "ITEM 2.

WE ARE A GLOBALLY INTEGRATED PAYMENTS COMPANY THAT PROVIDES OUR CUSTOMERS WITH ACCESS TO PRODUCTS, INSIGHTS AND EXPERIENCES THAT ENRICH LIVES AND BUILD BUSINESS SUCCESS. OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH TRAVEL AND LIFESTYLE SERVICES, OFFERED TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD. OUR RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDES.  \u2022  CREDIT CARD, CHARGE CARD AND OTHER PAYMENT AND FINANCING PRODUCTS  \u2022  MERCHANT ACQUISITION AND PROCESSING, SERVICING AND SETTLEMENT, AND POINT-OF-SALE MARKETING AND INFORMATION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MERCHANTS  \u2022  NETWORK SERVICES  \u2022  OTHER FEE SERVICES, INCLUDING FRAUD PREVENTION SERVICES AND THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF CUSTOMER LOYALTY PROGRAMS  \u2022  EXPENSE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES  \u2022  TRAVEL AND LIFESTYLE SERVICES  OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD GLOBALLY TO DIVERSE CUSTOMER GROUPS, INCLUDING CONSUMERS, LARGE CORPORATIONS, MID-SIZED COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES. THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE SOLD THROUGH VARIOUS CHANNELS, INCLUDING MOBILE AND ONLINE APPLICATIONS, DIRECT MAIL, IN-HOUSE SALES TEAMS, THIRD-PARTY VENDORS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS, AND DIRECT RESPONSE ADVERTISING. BUSINESS TRAVEL-RELATED SERVICES ARE OFFERED THROUGH OUR NON-CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE, AMERICAN EXPRESS GLOBAL BUSINESS TRAVEL (THE GBT JV).  WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, PAPER-BASED TRANSACTIONS (E.G., CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (ACH)), AS WELL AS EVOLVING AND GROWING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND FINANCING PROVIDERS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BUSINESS MODELS AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR FINANCING SOLUTIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF REVENUE ARE GENERATED FROM OUR VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  \u2022  DISCOUNT REVENUE, OUR LARGEST REVENUE SOURCE, PRIMARILY REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT WE EARN ON TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING AT MERCHANTS THAT HAVE ENTERED INTO A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT WITH US, OR A GLOBAL NETWORK SERVICES (GNS) PARTNER OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT ACQUIRER, FOR FACILITATING TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE MERCHANTS AND CARD MEMBERS;  \u2022  INTEREST ON LOANS, PRINCIPALLY REPRESENTS INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUTSTANDING BALANCES;  \u2022  NET CARD FEES, REPRESENT REVENUE EARNED FROM ANNUAL CARD MEMBERSHIP FEES, WHICH VARY BASED ON THE TYPE OF CARD AND THE NUMBER OF CARDS FOR EACH ACCOUNT;  \u2022  OTHER FEES AND COMMISSIONS, PRIMARILY REPRESENT CARD MEMBER DELINQUENCY FEES, FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION FEES CHARGED TO CARD MEMBERS, LOYALTY COALITION-RELATED FEES, TRAVEL COMMISSIONS AND FEES, SERVICE FEES EARNED FROM MERCHANTS, AND MEMBERSHIP REWARDS PROGRAM FEES; AND  \u2022  OTHER REVENUE, PRIMARILY REPRESENTS REVENUES ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH PARTNERS OF OUR GNS BUSINESS (INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND SIGNING FEES LESS ISSUER RATE PAYMENTS), CROSS-BORDER CARD MEMBER SPENDING, ANCILLARY MERCHANT-RELATED FEES, INSURANCE PREMIUMS EARNED FROM CARD MEMBERS, EARNINGS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING THE GBT JV), AND PREPAID CARD AND TRAVELERS CHEQUE-RELATED REVENUE.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND NON-GAAP MEASURES  CERTAIN OF THE STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-Q ARE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. REFER TO THE \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d SECTION. WE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). HOWEVER, CERTAIN INFORMATION INCLUDED WITHIN THIS FORM 10-Q CONSTITUTES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR CALCULATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM THE CALCULATIONS OF SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES BY OTHER COMPANIES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BANK HOLDING COMPANY  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) IS OUR PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  OUR RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECT SOLID PERFORMANCE, DEMONSTRATING BROAD BASED GROWTH ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN NEW SERVICES AND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, NEW CARD ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANDING OUR MERCHANT NETWORK, WHILE RETURNING $1.8 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 5 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLINGS, WHICH COMPRISES 86% OF OUR TOTAL BILLINGS, GREW 6 PERCENT, LED BY CONSUMERS. THE US DOLLAR REMAINED STRONG, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BILLINGS AND REVENUE GROWTH. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE (FX) RATES, WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 7 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, WITH INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY BILLINGS GROWING 13 PERCENT.  1  THIS SPENDING IS OCCURRING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING AT A MORE MODEST PACE RELATIVE TO 2018. GNS BILLED BUSINESS DECLINED 6 PERCENT (2 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS) AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THE NETWORK BUSINESS IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA DUE TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CHANGES; EXCLUDING THE BILLINGS FROM THOSE GEOGRAPHIES, GNS BILLED BUSINESS GREW 3 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS.  1  REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 8 PERCENT (9 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS), DRIVEN BY A WELL-BALANCED MIX OF GROWTH ACROSS CARD MEMBER SPENDING, NET INTEREST INCOME AND CARD FEES.  1  THIS WAS THE NINTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WITH FX-ADJUSTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 8 PERCENT OR BETTER, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  1  THE INCREASE IN CARD FEES REFLECTS OUR  APPROACH OF ENHANCING THE VALUE OF OUR PREMIUM PRODUCTS BY ADDING NEW BENEFITS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGHER ENGAGEMENT WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS. OUR NET INTEREST YIELD INCREASED 30 BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED POSITIVE IMPACTS FROM MIX AND PRICING INITIATIVES.  CARD MEMBER LOANS GREW 8 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AS WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR LENDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ACQUIRED NEW CARD MEMBERS. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES INCREASED 8 PERCENT, REFLECTING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN NET WRITE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES.  SPENDING ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (THE AGGREGATE OF REWARDS, CARD MEMBER SERVICES, AND MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES) INCREASED 11 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR WITH GROWTH ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. INCREASES IN REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES REFLECTED THE GROWTH IN PROPRIETARY BILLINGS AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND USAGE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PREMIUM TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT CARD MEMBER SERVICES TO BE OUR FASTEST GROWING EXPENSE CATEGORY, AS IT INCLUDES THE COSTS OF MANY COMPONENTS OF OUR DIFFERENTIATED VALUE PROPOSITIONS THAT SUPPORT STRONG CARD MEMBER ACQUISITION AND ENGAGEMENT. MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN OUR COBRAND PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE RENEWAL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES EARLIER IN 2019, AND HIGHER CORPORATE CLIENT INCENTIVES.  WE CONTINUE TO SEE ATTRACTIVE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND PLAN TO INVEST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN ORDER TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE MODERATE TO LONG TERM. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME HEADWINDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, REGULATION IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND INTENSE COMPETITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, CARD MEMBERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS AND DELIVERING APPROPRIATE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  SEE \u201cCERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR INFORMATION ON CERTAIN MATTERS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  1  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED INFORMATION ASSUMES A CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED FOR PURPOSES OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION INTO U.S. DOLLARS (I.E., ASSUMES THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES USED TO DETERMINE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD APPLY TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AGAINST WHICH SUCH RESULTS ARE BEING COMPARED). FX-ADJUSTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES CONSTITUTE NON-GAAP MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF INFORMATION ON A FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED BASIS IS HELPFUL TO INVESTORS BY MAKING IT EASIER TO COMPARE OUR PERFORMANCE IN ONE PERIOD TO THAT OF ANOTHER PERIOD WITHOUT THE VARIABILITY CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REFER TO THE \u201cGLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY\u201d FOR THE DEFINITIONS OF CERTAIN KEY TERMS AND RELATED INFORMATION APPEARING WITHIN THIS SECTION.

OTHER FEES AND COMMISSIONS INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN DELINQUENCY FEES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONVERSION REVENUE.  OTHER REVENUES INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BREAKAGE ON PREPAID PRODUCTS AND HIGHER REVENUES RELATED TO THE GBT JV, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE EARNED ON CROSS-BORDER CARD MEMBER SPENDING.  INTEREST INCOME INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS AND  HIGHER YIELDS.

ASSUMING NO CHANGE IN THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PORTFOLIO QUALITY, AND GROWTH IN CARD MEMBER LOANS, WE ESTIMATE OUR PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES WILL BE HIGHER UNDER CECL RELATIVE TO THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TABLE 4: EXPENSES SUMMARY  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  CHANGE  2019 VS. 2018  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  CHANGE  2019 VS. 2018  (MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  2019  2018  2019  2018  MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT  $1,818  $1,642  $176  11%  $5,164  $4,650  $514  11%  CARD MEMBER REWARDS  2,614  2,400  214  9  7,717  7,180  537  7  CARD MEMBER SERVICES  558  457  101  22  1,671  1,282  389  30  TOTAL MARKETING, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES  4,990  4,499  491  11  14,552  13,112  1,440  11  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS  1,499  1,350  149  11  4,288  3,956  332  8  OTHER, NET  1,355  1,360  (5)  \u2014  4,359  4,107  252  6  TOTAL EXPENSES  $7,844  $7,209  $635  9%  $23,199  $21,175  $2,024  10%  EXPENSES  MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS (INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT RENEWAL OF OUR COBRAND RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES), INCREASED NETWORK PARTNER PAYMENTS AND INCREASED CORPORATE CLIENT INCENTIVES DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING COSTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW GLOBAL BRAND CAMPAIGN.  CARD MEMBER REWARDS EXPENSE INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN MEMBERSHIP REWARDS AND CASH BACK REWARDS EXPENSES OF $146 MILLION AND $393 MILLION AND COBRAND REWARDS EXPENSE OF $68 MILLION AND $144 MILLION, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY, ALL OF WHICH WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPENDING VOLUMES.  THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ULTIMATE REDEMPTION RATE FOR CURRENT PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AT BOTH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS 96 PERCENT (ROUNDED UP).  CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSE INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER USAGE OF TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PAYROLL COSTS.  THE INCREASE IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  OTHER EXPENSES WERE FLAT FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD AND INCREASED FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD.  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS, OFFSET BY HIGHER UNREALIZED GAINS ON CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGE, HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND LOWER UNREALIZED GAINS ON CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PRIOR-YEAR LOSS ON A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PREPAID RELOADABLE AND GIFT CARD BUSINESS.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS AT AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB COULD AFFECT OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND CAUSE THE REGULATORY AGENCIES WITH OVERSIGHT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EQUITY CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE GENERATION OF NET INCOME. CAPITAL GENERATED THROUGH NET INCOME AND OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, IS USED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH AND ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, WITH EXCESS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PORTION OF GENERATED CAPITAL WE ALLOCATE TO SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH WILL BE GREATER GOING FORWARD THAN IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DUE TO PROJECTED ASSET GROWTH.  WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT CAPITAL ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AS APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INFUSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INTO SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL AT TARGETED LEVELS IN CONSIDERATION OF DEBT RATINGS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE INFUSED AMOUNTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPITAL PROFILE AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS PARENT COMPANY LEVEL.  THE FOLLOWING ARE DEFINITIONS FOR OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIO, WHICH ARE CALCULATED AS PER STANDARD REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  \u2014 ASSETS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK ACCORDING TO A FORMULA USED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONFORM TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES. ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK, WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS CONVERTED TO BALANCE SHEET EQUIVALENTS, USING RISK CONVERSION FACTORS, BEFORE BEING ALLOCATED A RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHT. OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES COMPRISE A MINIMAL PART OF THE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.  COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1), DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. CET1 IS THE SUM OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, ADJUSTED FOR INELIGIBLE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS AS FOLLOWS: NET UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON SECURITIES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND NET UNREALIZED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT/LOSSES, ALL NET OF TAX.  TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 1 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF CET1, OUR PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND THIRD-PARTY NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS 1.5 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM FOR THE CET1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO. WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO HELP ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE TIER 1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENTS.  TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL, DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND RECEIVABLE LOSSES (LIMITED TO 1.25 PERCENT OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS), MINORITY INTEREST THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL AND $600 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED NOTES, ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.  TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY OUR AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE UNDER BASEL III. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE REFLECTS AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS, AVERAGE OFF-BALANCE SHEET DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES, AVERAGE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, AND AVERAGE CREDIT EQUIVALENTS OF CONDITIONALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CANCELLABLE UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL THREE-YEAR PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE DAY-ONE ADVERSE REGULATORY CAPITAL EFFECTS UPON ADOPTING THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (CECL) MODEL PURSUANT TO NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO RELEASED A STATEMENT INDICATING THAT IT PLANS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATING CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCES ON LOANS IN SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS THROUGH THE 2021 STRESS TEST CYCLE. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CECL.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE RETURN CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE SHARE REPURCHASES REDUCE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND MORE THAN OFFSET THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SHARES AS PART OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RETURNED $1.8 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $0.3 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $1.5 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE REPURCHASED 12 MILLION COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $124.21 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. THESE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 101 PERCENT AND 84 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL GENERATED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PAID $21 MILLION AND $61 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS ON NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  FUNDING STRATEGY  OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND WELL-DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES TO ALLOW US TO MEET OUR MATURING OBLIGATIONS, COST-EFFECTIVELY FINANCE CURRENT AND FUTURE ASSET GROWTH IN OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG LIQUIDITY PROFILE.  WE MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, BORROWINGS THROUGH SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES AND A LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITY. WHILE WE DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES BY MAINTAINING SCALE AND RELEVANCE IN UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND DEPOSITS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PERSONAL SAVINGS HIGH YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM WILL BECOME A LARGER PROPORTION OF OUR FUNDING OVER TIME.  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  (BILLIONS)  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  $2.8  $3.1  LONG-TERM DEBT  58.5  58.4  TOTAL DEBT  61.3  61.5  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  73.3  70.0  TOTAL DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  $134.6  $131.5  WE MAY REDEEM FROM TIME TO TIME CERTAIN DEBT SECURITIES WITHIN 31 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPTIONAL REDEMPTION PROVISIONS OF THOSE DEBT SECURITIES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ISSUED (I) $2.0 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST) CONSISTING OF $1.2 BILLION OF THREE-YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.0 PERCENT AND $800 MILLION OF TWO-YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FLOATING RATE OF 1-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 24 BASIS POINTS, AND (II) $1.5 BILLION OF FIVE-YEAR SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.5 PERCENT.  OUR EQUITY CAPITAL AND FUNDING STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE AND STABLE UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (MOODY\u2019S), STANDARD & POOR\u2019S (S&P) AND FITCH RATINGS (FITCH). SUCH RATINGS HELP SUPPORT OUR ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE UNSECURED FUNDING AS PART OF OUR OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGY. OUR ASSET SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE RATED SEPARATELY.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TABLE 19: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS  CREDIT AGENCY  AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY  SHORT-TERM RATINGS  LONG-TERM RATINGS  OUTLOOK  FITCH  ALL RATED ENTITIES  F1  A  STABLE  MOODY\u2019S  TRS  (A)  PRIME-1  A2  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION  PRIME-1  A2  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK  PRIME-1  A3  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  PRIME-2  A3  STABLE  S&P  TRS  (A)  N/A  A-  STABLE  S&P  AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION AND AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK  A-2  A-  STABLE  S&P  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  A-2  BBB+  STABLE  (A)  AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC.  DOWNGRADES IN THE RATINGS OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT OR ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAM SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES RELATED TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. DECLINES IN CREDIT RATINGS COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE UNSECURED DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION CAPITAL MARKETS. WE BELIEVE OUR FUNDING MIX, INCLUDING THE PROPORTION OF U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) TO TOTAL FUNDING, SHOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT THAT CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES WOULD HAVE ON OUR FUNDING CAPACITY AND COSTS.  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  OUR LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO A DIVERSE SET OF ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY SOURCES IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR LIQUIDITY FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER OUR REGULAR FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  MAINTAINING DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES (REFER TO THE \u201cFUNDING STRATEGY\u201d SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS);  \u2022  MAINTAINING UNENCUMBERED LIQUID ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES;  \u2022  PROJECTING CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS UNDER A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET SCENARIOS;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  INCORPORATING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE INTO OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK.  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN CAN VARY OVER TIME, BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND OTHER VARIOUS REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER OUR LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY. SEE \u201cFINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\u201d UNDER \"CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE LCR.  THE INVESTMENT INCOME WE RECEIVE ON LIQUIDITY RESOURCES IS LESS THAN THE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THESE BALANCES. THE NET INTEREST COSTS TO MAINTAIN THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE NET INTEREST COSTS DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST OF FUNDING THESE AMOUNTS AND THEIR INVESTMENT YIELDS.  SECURITIZED BORROWING CAPACITY  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 15, 2022, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $3.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA NOTES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST II (THE CHARGE TRUST). WE ALSO MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY THAT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $2.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA CERTIFICATES FROM THE LENDING TRUST. ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE LENDING TRUST'S $2.0 BILLION FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2022. BOTH FACILITIES ARE USED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO FUND SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CONTINGENT FUNDING RESOURCES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON EITHER FACILITY.  FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, AENB MAY BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO, SUBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL THAT IT MAY PLEDGE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT BOTH CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARE A FORM OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL FOR SECURED BORROWINGS MADE THROUGH THE DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHETHER SPECIFIC ASSETS WILL BE CONSIDERED QUALIFYING COLLATERAL AND THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE BORROWED AGAINST THE COLLATERAL, REMAIN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.  WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $75.1 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IN U.S. CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES THAT COULD BE SOLD OVER TIME THROUGH OUR SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OR PLEDGED IN RETURN FOR SECURED BORROWINGS TO PROVIDE FURTHER LIQUIDITY, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO APPLICABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.  COMMITTED BANK CREDIT FACILITY  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OF $3.5 BILLION. ON OCTOBER 15, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE $3.5 BILLION COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 15, 2022. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON THIS FACILITY.  UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $301 BILLION OF UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS PART OF ESTABLISHED LENDING PRODUCT AGREEMENTS. TOTAL UNUSED CREDIT DOES NOT REPRESENT POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS UNUSED CREDIT WILL LIKELY NOT BE DRAWN. OUR CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE NO PRE-SET LIMIT, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN UNUSED CREDIT AVAILABLE TO CARD MEMBERS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOW ACTIVITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30.  TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS  (BILLIONS)  2019  2018  TOTAL CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10.4  $10.2  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (11.3)  (14.2)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1.9)  1.9  EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  0.3  0.1  NET DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  $(2.5)  $(2.0)  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR (I) NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME, SUCH AS PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND (II) CHANGES IN THE BALANCES OF OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER GROWTH IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS WELL AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER MATTERS  CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE ARE SUBSTANTIAL. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, HIGH REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS, AN INCREASING RANGE OF NEW REGULATIONS, AND A STRINGENT AND UNPREDICTABLE ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOCUSED, AND WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS, CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION ON REVIEWING COMPLIANCE BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. REVIEWS TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, RESTITUTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM, OR SERVED SUBPOENAS ON, US, SEEKING INFORMATION RELATING TO A SMALL, SPECIALIZED PART OF OUR BUSINESS, KNOWN AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS (FXIP), WHICH OFFERS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS SERVICES PRIMARILY TO SMALL AND MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN FIVE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN PARTICULAR, WE RECEIVED INVESTIGATIVE SUBPOENAS FROM BOTH THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DIVISIONS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS INQUIRIES FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC), THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB), THE FDIC AND OTHERS.  FXIP ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS UNRELATED TO OUR CARD BUSINESSES. RELATEDLY, OUR REVIEW OF FXIP\u2019S PRICING PRACTICES CONDUCTED WITH AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM HAS CONCLUDED AND AS A RESULT, WE VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION OF REMEDIATION TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS COVERING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD AND TOOK DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.  PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FEDERAL RESERVE RELEASED TWO PROPOSALS, ONE JOINTLY WITH THE OCC AND THE FDIC AND ONE ON ITS OWN, THAT WOULD TAILOR THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR LARGE U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS AND AENB. THE PROPOSALS WERE FINALIZED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON OCTOBER 10, 2019, WITH THE NEW RULES SET TO TAKE EFFECT 60 DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.  THE FINAL RULES ASSIGN EACH U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH $100 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, AS WELL AS ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, TO ONE OF FOUR CATEGORIES BASED ON ITS STATUS AS A U.S. GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING ORGANIZATION AND FIVE RISK-BASED INDICATORS: (I) SIZE, (II) CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY, (III) NON-BANK ASSETS, (IV) OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURE, AND (V) WEIGHTED SHORT-TERM WHOLESALE FUNDING. THE FEDERAL RESERVE INDICATED WHICH FIRMS WOULD FALL INTO EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES BASED ON DATA FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WITH OUR COMPANY IN \u201cCATEGORY IV.\u201d AS A RESULT, WE REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF FIRMS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND COMPLEXITY TO US AND WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER AND MORE COMPLEX BANKS, INCLUDING (I) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE ADVANCED APPROACHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, (II) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO, (III) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, (IV) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS, (V) BECOMING SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING ON AN EVERY-OTHER-YEAR BASIS RATHER THAN AN ANNUAL BASIS, (VI) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE LCR OR THE PROPOSED NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS; AND (VII) NO LONGER BEING REQUIRED TO MONITOR AND REPORT CERTAIN RISK-BASED INDICATORS.  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PAYMENTS REGULATION  LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THROUGH ANTITRUST ACTIONS, LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS TO CHANGE CERTAIN PRACTICES OR PRICING OF CARD ISSUERS, MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PAYMENT NETWORKS, AND, IN SOME CASES, TO ESTABLISH BROAD AND ONGOING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REGIMES FOR PAYMENT SYSTEMS.  THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE FEES (THAT IS, THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUER IN PAYMENT NETWORKS LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD), AS WELL AS THE RULES, CONTRACT TERMS AND PRACTICES GOVERNING MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE. REGULATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS RELATING TO PRICING OR PRACTICES COULD AFFECT ALL NETWORKS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AS WELL AS ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATION OF BANKCARD FEES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE WE EARN, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN SOME CASES, REGULATIONS ALSO EXTEND TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS NETWORK AND COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS OR THE TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR MERCHANTS.  BROAD REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER PAYMENT SYSTEMS CAN ALSO INCLUDE, IN SOME CASES, REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA STORAGE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR CLOSED LOOP.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA ISSUED A MANDATE REQUIRING PAYMENT SYSTEMS OPERATORS IN INDIA TO STORE CERTAIN PAYMENTS DATA LOCALLY. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT SYSTEM REGULATORY REGIMES GENERALLY CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND MAINTAIN AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PAYMENTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  SURCHARGING  IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN LITIGATION BROUGHT BY MERCHANT GROUPS AND SOME SUCH LAWS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED. SURCHARGING IS AN ADVERSE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD, PARTICULARLY WHERE IT ONLY OR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OTHER STEERING PRACTICES THAT ARE PERMITTED BY REGULATION IN SOME COUNTRIES COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF THEY BECOME WIDESPREAD.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR MARKETING, SALE AND SERVICING OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS ARE SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE CFPB, WHICH HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT \u201cUNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\u201d ACTS OR PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF U.S. STATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN U.S. FEDERAL LAWS). U.S. FEDERAL LAW ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, WHICH ALONG WITH BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US OR SUBJECT US TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE CFPB ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD SET FORTH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES, WHICH WE USE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FINAL RULES, IF ANY, BECOMING EFFECTIVE BEFORE 2021.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  59  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANTITRUST LITIGATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CERTAIN STATES\u2019 ATTORNEYS GENERAL BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US IN 2010 ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. ON JUNE 25, 2018, THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN FAVOR OF AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THAT CASE. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND SIMILAR ANTITRUST CLAIMS INITIATED BY MERCHANTS. SEE NOTE 7 TO THE \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ACTIONS IMPAIRING THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, OR THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE MERCHANT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF AN ADVERSE DECISION IN THE MERCHANT LITIGATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY  REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPORT AND ENABLE BUSINESS INNOVATION AND GROWTH. GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY RISK IN RECENT YEARS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE CODE, RANSOMWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS (INCLUDING PHISHING, IMPERSONATION AND IDENTITY TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS), HACKING, WEBSITE DEFACEMENT, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS AND OTHER ATTACKS AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM THE MISCONFIGURATION OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OR ACCESS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY REGULATION AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF A MAJOR INFORMATION OR CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO THE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF NOTE 1 TO THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY  ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT REPRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS (WHICH INCLUDES, ON A GAAP BASIS, INTEREST THAT IS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE), EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO AND IT IS A COMPONENT OF NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS.  ASSET SECURITIZATIONS  \u2014 ASSET SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE TRANSFER AND SALE OF LOANS OR RECEIVABLES TO A SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY CREATED FOR THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, TYPICALLY A TRUST. THE TRUST, IN TURN, ISSUES SECURITIES, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE SECURED BY THE TRANSFERRED LOANS AND RECEIVABLES. THE TRUST USES THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SUCH SECURITIES TO PAY THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE UNDERLYING LOANS OR RECEIVABLES. THE LOANS AND RECEIVABLES OF OUR LENDING TRUST AND CHARGE TRUST (COLLECTIVELY, THE TRUSTS) SECURITIZED ARE REPORTED AS ASSETS AND THE SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE TRUSTS ARE REPORTED AS LIABILITIES ON OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.\u201d  AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE \u2014  THIS CALCULATION IS GENERALLY DESIGNED TO REFLECT THE AVERAGE PRICING AT ALL MERCHANTS ACCEPTING AMERICAN EXPRESS CARDS AND REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PROPRIETARY AND GNS BILLED BUSINESS RETAINED BY US FROM MERCHANTS WE ACQUIRE, OR FROM MERCHANTS ACQUIRED BY THIRD PARTIES ON OUR BEHALF, NET OF AMOUNTS RETAINED BY SUCH THIRD PARTIES.  BILLED BUSINESS  \u2014 REPRESENTS TRANSACTION VOLUMES (INCLUDING CASH ADVANCES) ON CARDS AND OTHER PAYMENT PRODUCTS ISSUED BY AMERICAN EXPRESS (PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS) AND CARDS ISSUED UNDER NETWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES (GNS BILLED BUSINESS).  IN-STORE SPENDING ACTIVITY WITHIN GNS RETAIL COBRAND PORTFOLIOS, FROM WHICH WE EARN NO REVENUE, IS NOT INCLUDED IN BILLED BUSINESS.  BILLED BUSINESS IS REPORTED AS IN THE UNITED STATES OR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE ISSUER.  60  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CAPITAL RATIOS  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AS A MEASURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REGULATED ENTITY HAS SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO ABSORB ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LOSSES BEYOND CURRENT LOSS ACCRUAL ESTIMATES. REFER TO THE \u201cCAPITAL STRATEGY\u201d SECTION UNDER \u201cCONSOLIDATED CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\u201d FOR FURTHER RELATED DEFINITIONS UNDER BASEL III.  CARDS-IN-FORCE  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF CARDS THAT ARE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING BY AMERICAN EXPRESS (PROPRIETARY CARDS-IN-FORCE) AND CARDS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING UNDER NETWORK PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS WITH BANKS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONS, INCLUDING JOINT VENTURES (GNS CARDS-IN-FORCE), EXCEPT FOR GNS RETAIL COBRAND CARDS THAT HAD NO OUT-OF-STORE SPENDING ACTIVITY DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS.  BASIC CARDS-IN-FORCE  EXCLUDES SUPPLEMENTAL CARDS ISSUED ON CONSUMER ACCOUNTS.  CARD MEMBER  \u2014 THE INDIVIDUAL HOLDER OF AN ISSUED AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CHARGE, CREDIT AND CERTAIN PREPAID CARDS.  CARD MEMBER LOANS  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT DUE FROM CARD MEMBERS FOR CHARGES MADE ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CARDS, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST CHARGES AND CARD-RELATED FEES. CARD MEMBER LOANS ALSO INCLUDE REVOLVING BALANCES ON CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS.  CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING AMOUNT DUE FROM CARD MEMBERS FOR CHARGES MADE ON THEIR AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS, AS WELL AS ANY CARD-RELATED FEES, OTHER THAN REVOLVING BALANCES ON CERTAIN AMERICAN EXPRESS CHARGE CARDS WITH PAY OVER TIME FEATURES. SUCH REVOLVING BALANCES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN CARD MEMBER LOANS.  CHARGE CARDS  \u2014 REPRESENTS CARDS THAT GENERALLY CARRY NO PRE-SET SPENDING LIMITS AND ARE PRIMARILY DESIGNED AS A METHOD OF PAYMENT AND NOT AS A MEANS OF FINANCING PURCHASES. CHARGE CARD MEMBERS GENERALLY MUST PAY THE FULL AMOUNT BILLED EACH MONTH. NO FINANCE CHARGES ARE ASSESSED ON CHARGE CARDS. EACH CHARGE CARD TRANSACTION IS AUTHORIZED BASED ON ITS LIKELY ECONOMICS REFLECTING A CARD MEMBER\u2019S MOST RECENT CREDIT INFORMATION AND SPEND PATTERNS. SOME CHARGE CARD ACCOUNTS HAVE ADDITIONAL PAY OVER TIME FEATURE(S) THAT ALLOW REVOLVING OF CERTAIN CHARGES.  COBRAND CARDS  \u2014 CARDS ISSUED UNDER COBRAND AGREEMENTS WITH SELECTED COMMERCIAL FIRMS. PURSUANT TO THE COBRAND AGREEMENTS, WE MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR COBRAND PARTNERS, WHICH CAN BE SIGNIFICANT, BASED PRIMARILY ON THE AMOUNT OF CARD MEMBER SPENDING AND CORRESPONDING REWARDS EARNED ON SUCH SPENDING AND, UNDER CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS, ON THE NUMBER OF ACCOUNTS ACQUIRED AND RETAINED. THE PARTNER IS THEN LIABLE FOR PROVIDING REWARDS TO THE CARD MEMBER UNDER THE COBRAND PARTNER\u2019S OWN LOYALTY PROGRAM.  CREDIT CARDS  \u2014 REPRESENTS CARDS THAT HAVE A RANGE OF REVOLVING PAYMENT TERMS, GRACE PERIODS, AND RATE AND FEE STRUCTURES.  DISCOUNT REVENUE  \u2014 PRIMARILY REPRESENTS REVENUE EARNED FROM FEES CHARGED TO MERCHANTS WHO HAVE ENTERED INTO A CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENT. THE DISCOUNT FEE IS GENERALLY DEDUCTED FROM OUR PAYMENT FOR CARD MEMBER PURCHASES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  \u2014 INCLUDES INTEREST INCURRED PRIMARILY TO FUND CARD MEMBER LOANS AND RECEIVABLES, GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES AND LIQUIDITY NEEDS, AND IS RECOGNIZED AS INCURRED. INTEREST EXPENSE IS DIVIDED PRINCIPALLY INTO TWO CATEGORIES: (I) DEPOSITS, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEPOSITS TAKEN FROM CUSTOMERS AND INSTITUTIONS, AND (II) DEBT, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATES TO INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, (E.G., COMMERCIAL PAPER, FEDERAL FUNDS PURCHASED, BANK OVERDRAFTS AND OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS), AS WELL AS THE REALIZED IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES HEDGING INTEREST RATE RISK ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 INCLUDES (I) INTEREST ON LOANS, (II) INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES AND (III) INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER.  INTEREST ON LOANS  \u2014 ASSESSED USING THE AVERAGE DAILY BALANCE METHOD FOR CARD MEMBER LOANS. UNLESS THE LOAN IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-ACCRUAL, INTEREST IS RECOGNIZED BASED UPON THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNT AGREEMENT UNTIL THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE IS PAID OR WRITTEN OFF.  INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON INVESTMENT SECURITIES  \u2014 PRIMARILY RELATES TO OUR PERFORMING FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST INCOME IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD, WHICH ADJUSTS THE YIELD FOR SECURITY PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS, FEES AND OTHER PAYMENTS, SO A CONSTANT RATE OF RETURN IS RECOGNIZED ON THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE RELATED INVESTMENT SECURITY THROUGHOUT ITS TERM. AMOUNTS ARE RECOGNIZED UNTIL SECURITIES ARE IN DEFAULT OR WHEN IT IS LIKELY THAT FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AS SCHEDULED.  61  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST INCOME ON DEPOSITS WITH BANKS AND OTHER  \u2014 RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE PLACEMENT OF CASH IN EXCESS OF NEAR-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN INTEREST-BEARING TIME DEPOSITS, OVERNIGHT SWEEP ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND AND CALL ACCOUNTS.  LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO  \u2014  REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY THE REGULATORY AGENCIES AS A MEASURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE REGULATED ENTITY HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET LIQUIDITY NEEDS IN PERIODS OF FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC STRESS.  MERCHANT ACQUISITION  \u2014 REPRESENTS OUR PROCESS OF ENTERING INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS TO ACCEPT AMERICAN EXPRESS-BRANDED CARDS.  NET CARD FEES  \u2014 REPRESENTS THE CARD MEMBERSHIP FEES EARNED DURING THE PERIOD. THESE FEES ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE OVER THE COVERED CARD MEMBERSHIP PERIOD (TYPICALLY ONE YEAR), NET OF THE PROVISION FOR PROJECTED REFUNDS FOR CARD MEMBERSHIP CANCELLATION AND DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS.  NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS \u2014  A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME BY AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS, COMPUTED ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. RESERVES AND NET WRITE-OFFS RELATED TO UNCOLLECTIBLE INTEREST ARE RECORDED THROUGH PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, AND ARE THUS NOT INCLUDED IN THE NET INTEREST YIELD CALCULATION.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULTS OF ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ANY FUTURE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  OUR STRATEGIC PLAN FOCUSES ON.  \u2022  OWNING HIGH-QUALITY, DIFFERENTIATED OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE BBDS OF OUR CORE MARKETS;  \u2022  IMPROVING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR PROPERTIES THROUGH CONCENTRATED LEASING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, COST CONTROL AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EFFORTS;  \u2022  DEVELOPING AND ACQUIRING OFFICE BUILDINGS IN BBDS THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO AND GENERATE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS;  \u2022  DISPOSING OF PROPERTIES NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE CORE ASSETS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOCATION, AGE, QUALITY AND/OR OVERALL STRATEGIC FIT; AND  \u2022  MAINTAINING A BALANCE SHEET WITH AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS AND GROWTH PROSPECTS.  REVENUES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND HEAVILY ON SUCCESSFULLY LEASING AND OPERATING THE OFFICE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OFFICE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN OUR CORE MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, IN PREDICTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  THE KEY COMPONENTS AFFECTING OUR RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES, COST RECOVERY INCOME, NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY INCREASES DURING TIMES OF IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE OUTPACES VACANCIES THAT OCCUR UPON THE EXPIRATIONS OF EXISTING LEASES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY DECLINES DURING TIMES OF SLOWER OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEN NEW VACANCIES TEND TO OUTPACE OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE. ASSET ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RENTAL REVENUES AND COULD IMPACT OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, DEPENDING UPON THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ACQUIRED, SOLD OR PLACED IN SERVICE. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE REVENUES IS THE EXPECTED LEASE EXPIRATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY BY LEASING CURRENT VACANT SPACE, WE ALSO CONCENTRATE OUR LEASING EFFORTS ON RENEWING EXISTING LEASES PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LEASE EXPIRATIONS, SEE \"PROPERTIES - LEASE EXPIRATIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OCCUPANCY IN OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM  91.6%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  91.2%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WHETHER OR NOT OUR RENTAL REVENUE TRACKS AVERAGE OCCUPANCY PROPORTIONALLY DEPENDS UPON WHETHER GAAP RENTS UNDER SIGNED NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE GAAP RENTS UNDER EXPIRING LEASES. ANNUALIZED RENTAL REVENUES FROM SECOND GENERATION LEASES EXPIRING DURING ANY PARTICULAR YEAR ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RENTAL REVENUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES SIGNED DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  (WE DEFINE SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES AS LEASES WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWALS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OFFICE SPACE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED UNDER OUR OWNERSHIP AND LEASES WITH RESPECT TO VACANT SPACE IN ACQUIRED BUILDINGS).  NEW  RENEWAL  ALL OFFICE  LEASED SPACE (IN RENTABLE SQUARE FEET)  366,923  571,779  938,702  AVERAGE TERM (IN YEARS - RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT WEIGHTED)  6.7  6.3  6.5  BASE RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $30.02  $29.11  $29.46  RENT CONCESSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  (0.69  )  (0.56  )  (0.61  )  GAAP RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $29.33  $28.55  $28.85  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $5.19  $2.59  $3.61  LEASING COMMISSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $1.11  $0.70  $0.86  __________  (1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  ANNUAL COMBINED GAAP RENTS FOR NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES SIGNED IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER WERE  $28.85  PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT,  19.4%  HIGHER  COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LEASES IN THE SAME OFFICE SPACES.  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE, STABLE AND CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMER BASE. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL GUIDELINE WHEREBY CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 3% OF OUR REVENUES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  3%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  5%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE METLIFE III DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN RALEIGH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT METLIFE WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY  3.3%  OF OUR REVENUES BASED ON ANNUALIZED CASH REVENUES FOR  SEPTEMBER 2019.  EXPENSES  OUR EXPENSES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INTEREST EXPENSE. FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS. RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES AND INCLUDE EXPENSES THAT VARY SOMEWHAT PROPORTIONATELY TO OCCUPANCY LEVELS, SUCH AS JANITORIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES, AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT VARY BASED ON OCCUPANCY, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY AND GENERALLY REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT EACH YEAR, UNLESS WE BUY, PLACE IN SERVICE OR SELL ASSETS, SINCE OUR PROPERTIES AND RELATED BUILDING AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIXED LIVES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND SHORT AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET OPERATING INCOME  WHETHER OR NOT WE RECORD INCREASING NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) IN OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO GARNER HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, WHETHER FROM HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, HIGHER GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT OR HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, THAT EXCEED ANY CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES. SAME PROPERTY NOI WAS  $1.8 MILLION  , OR  1.6%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY REVENUES OF  $4.4 MILLION  OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF  $2.5 MILLION  IN SAME PROPERTY EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION TO THE EFFECT OF SAME PROPERTY NOI, WHETHER OR NOT NOI INCREASES DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE NOI FROM OUR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE EXCEEDS THE NOI FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. NOI WAS  $5.1 MILLION  , OR  4.3%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR SAME PROPERTY NOI AND THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY NOI LOST FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS  IN CALCULATING NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH ARE NON-CASH EXPENSES, ARE ADDED BACK TO NET INCOME. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A POSITIVE AMOUNT OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CHANGES IN OUR NET INCOME, AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES AND NET ADDITIONS OR DECREASES IN OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH RELATED TO INVESTING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO CAPITALIZED COSTS INCURRED FOR LEASING AND MAJOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, DISPOSITION AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT NET ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, OUR CASH USED IN SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL GENERALLY EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF CASH RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR JOINT VENTURES.  NET CASH RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO DISTRIBUTIONS, INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, AND ISSUANCES, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR CASH TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE INCREASES IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF DEBT DURING A PERIOD DEPENDS GENERALLY UPON THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR DAILY WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH MEANS THAT DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, WE MAY RECORD SIGNIFICANT REPAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\"  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET WITH ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO CAPITALIZE ON FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD  $599.9 MILLION  OF AVAILABILITY AT  OCTOBER 15, 2019  . OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON OUR DEBT, DISTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS, TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS AND LEASE COMMISSIONS. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITAL COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT TYPICALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE COSTS REQUIRED TO CUSTOMIZE SPACE FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PLANNED FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND FOR THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER DEBT. CONTINUED ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY CAPITALIZE ON STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY USES GENERALLY CONSIST OF THE RETIREMENT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT UPON MATURITY, FUNDING OF BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, NEW BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS AND LAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FUNDING ACQUISITIONS OF BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STARTED AND/OR COMMITTED NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RETIRE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF.  \u2022  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  BANK TERM LOANS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP; AND  \u2022  THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS MEASURED BY THE RATIO OF OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AND OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK TO THE UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, WAS  37.4%  AND THERE WERE  106.5 MILLION  DILUTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  AS NOTED ABOVE, A KEY TENET OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO AND DELIVER CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WHETHER OR NOT AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR NEW DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN HIGHER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE NOI FOR ANY SUCH PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL COST OF CAPITAL USED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE LENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION CYCLES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE NOT PLACED IN SERVICE UNTIL, IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL YEARS AFTER COMMENCEMENT. SALES OF NON-CORE ASSETS COULD RESULT IN LOWER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FFO IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD IN THE EVENT THE RESULTING USE OF PROCEEDS DOES NOT EXCEED THE CAPITALIZATION RATE ON THE SOLD PROPERTIES.  MARKET ROTATION PLAN  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF PLANNED INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. FIRST, WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE\u2019S UPTOWN CBD SUBMARKET FOR A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF $436 MILLION. BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IS A TROPHY, LEED GOLD-REGISTERED OFFICE BUILDING ENCOMPASSING 841,000 SQUARE FEET WITH STRUCTURED PARKING THAT DELIVERS THIS YEAR. THE ACQUISITION IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN NOVEMBER 2019. WE HAVE POSTED EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS TOTALING $50 MILLION THAT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SECOND, WE HAVE A TWO-PHASED PLAN TO EXIT THE GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS MARKETS. THE FIRST PHASE CONSISTS OF SELLING A SELECT PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS BY MID-2020 WITH A TOTAL SALES PRICE THAT APPROXIMATES THE $436 MILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION AND CLOSING THE DIVISION OFFICES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL DISPOSE OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, BECAUSE THE DISPOSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AND BINDING PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS AND WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE BUYERS\u2019 COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE SECOND PHASE IS THE PLANNED SALE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN BOTH MARKETS. THERE IS NO PRE-DETERMINED TIMETABLE FOR THE SECOND PHASE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $8.1 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $6.7 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, HIGHER PARKING INCOME AND HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE OF $2.7 MILLION FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $3.0 MILLION  , OR  4.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $2.5 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, CONTRACT SERVICES AND PROPERTY INSURANCE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $0.9 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $3.2 MILLION  , OR  5.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY LEASE RELATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, PARTLY OFFSET BY FULLY AMORTIZED ACQUISITION-RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.3 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENTS IN  2018.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $2.2 MILLION  , OR  22.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019, EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF OUR GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS DIVISION OFFICES. WE EXPECT TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 MILLION OF SEVERANCE COSTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.1 MILLION  , OR  17.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $0.6 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT IN 2019.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $3.5 MILLION  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  64.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.05  LOWER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  LASER SPINE INSTITUTE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, WHICH OCCUPIED A 176,000 SQUARE-FOOT, SIX-STORY BUILDING WITH STRUCTURED PARKING IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET, A BBD. THE BUILDING, DEVELOPED BY US, HAD BEEN USED BY LASER SPINE INSTITUTE FOR BOTH ITS COMPANY HEADQUARTERS AND AN AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER. AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED ON MARCH 1, 2019, LASER SPINE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. THIS UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED ALL OF ITS LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN CLOSURE, WE INCURRED $5.6 MILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF $2.3 MILLION OF LEASE INCENTIVES, $4.1 MILLION OF NOTES RECEIVABLE AND $11.6 MILLION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $5.3 MILLION  , OR  1.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $17.1 MILLION AND $0.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, HIGHER PARKING INCOME AND HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF LEASE INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $8.2 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $5.0 MILLION  , OR  2.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $4.0 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AND PROPERTY INSURANCE, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER UTILITIES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY A $2.7 MILLION DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS  $17.6 MILLION  , OR  10.2%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.8 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENTS IN  2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $2.8 MILLION  , OR  9.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019 AND HIGHER COMPANY-WIDE BASE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF OUR GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS DIVISION OFFICES, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND EXPENSED PRE-DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE EXPECT TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 MILLION OF SEVERANCE COSTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $5.9 MILLION  , OR  11.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $5.0 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO THE WRITE-OFF OF NOTES RECEIVABLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE AND LOSSES ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT IN 2019.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $6.8 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.7 MILLION  , OR  44.4%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.40  LOWER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS  WE REPORT AND ANALYZE OUR CASH FLOWS BASED ON OPERATING ACTIVITIES, INVESTING ACTIVITIES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS IN 2018, PARTLY OFFSET BY NON-REFUNDABLE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE.  THE CHANGE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY/(USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019.

SEE ALSO \"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\"  OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  CONSISTED OF  $95.8 MILLION  OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  4.0%  AND  $2,240.0 MILLION  OF UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  3.67%  . THE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE ASSETS WITH AN UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF  $146.3 MILLION  . AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ,  $250.0 MILLION  OF OUR DEBT DOES NOT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES OR IS NOT PROTECTED BY INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION OR DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS. CONSUMMATION OF ANY TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE. SEE \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS EXCEEDING OUR ESTIMATES\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ACQUIRED DEVELOPMENT LAND IN RALEIGH FOR A PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED ACQUISITION COSTS, OF  $6.6 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE SOLD A BUILDING AND LAND PARCELS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $14.3 MILLION  AND RECORDED AGGREGATE GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $3.5 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.3 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF PLANNED INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. FIRST, WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE\u2019S UPTOWN CBD SUBMARKET FOR A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF $436 MILLION. BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IS A TROPHY, LEED GOLD-REGISTERED OFFICE BUILDING ENCOMPASSING 841,000 SQUARE FEET WITH STRUCTURED PARKING THAT DELIVERS THIS YEAR. THE ACQUISITION IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN NOVEMBER 2019. WE HAVE POSTED EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS TOTALING $50 MILLION THAT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SECOND, WE HAVE A TWO-PHASED PLAN TO EXIT THE GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS MARKETS. THE FIRST PHASE CONSISTS OF SELLING A SELECT PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS BY MID-2020 WITH A TOTAL SALES PRICE THAT APPROXIMATES THE $436 MILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION AND CLOSING THE DIVISION OFFICES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL DISPOSE OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, BECAUSE THE DISPOSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AND BINDING PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS AND WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE BUYERS\u2019 COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE SECOND PHASE IS THE PLANNED SALE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN BOTH MARKETS. THERE IS NO PRE-DETERMINED TIMETABLE FOR THE SECOND PHASE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE WERE DEVELOPING  0.9 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE PROPERTIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THESE ANNOUNCED AND IN-PROCESS OFFICE DEVELOPMENTS.

(2)  OUR CORPORATE AND RALEIGH MARKET PERSONNEL PLAN TO OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 45,500 SQUARE FEET.  (3)  WE OWN AN  80.0%  INTEREST IN THIS CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE.  FINANCING ACTIVITY  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS, A DIVISION OF BB&T SECURITIES, LLC, MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BTIG, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., FIFTH THIRD SECURITIES, INC., JEFFERIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL UP TO $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\"NYSE\") OR OTHERWISE  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS.  OUR $600.0 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  AND INCLUDES AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS. ASSUMING NO DEFAULTS HAVE OCCURRED, WE HAVE AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY FOR  TWO  ADDITIONAL  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS. THE INTEREST RATE AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS  AND THE ANNUAL FACILITY FEE IS 20 BASIS POINTS. THE INTEREST RATE AND FACILITY FEE ARE BASED ON THE HIGHER OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED RATINGS FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES. THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  . AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  , WE HAD  $0.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  WAS $599.9 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED  $400.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  3.050%  NOTES DUE  FEBRUARY 2030  , LESS ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNT OF  $1.0 MILLION  . THESE NOTES WERE PRICED TO YIELD  3.079%  . DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 3.050% NOTES, WE OBTAINED  $150.0 MILLION  NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF FORWARD-STARTING SWAPS. UPON THE SUBSEQUENT ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE TERMINATED THE FORWARD-STARTING SWAPS AND PAID CASH UPON SETTLEMENT. THE UNREALIZED LOSS OF  $6.6 MILLION  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE AS INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE MADE ON THE DEBT. UNDERWRITING FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE INCURRED THAT AGGREGATED  $3.4 MILLION  ; THESE COSTS WERE DEFERRED AND WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES. THE NET EFFECT OF THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE ITEMS RESULTED IN AN EFFECTIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  3.37%.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY  $100.0 MILLION  OF OUR  $200.0 MILLION  UNSECURED BANK TERM LOAN THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  . THE INTEREST RATE ON THE TERM LOAN AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 110 BASIS POINTS  . WE RECORDED  $0.3 MILLION  OF LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT RELATED TO THIS PREPAYMENT.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND RATIOS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PROPERTY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BANK TERM LOANS REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE LENDERS HAVING AT LEAST 51.0% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN ACCELERATE ALL BORROWINGS THEN OUTSTANDING, AND WE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BORROWING ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS GIVING THE UNSECURED LENDERS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE A DEFAULT IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER MORE THAN $30.0 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LOANS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OUTSTANDING NOTES REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25.0% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY SERIES OF NOTES CAN ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SERIES UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DEFAULT THAT REMAINS UNCURED AFTER 60 DAYS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY, REFINANCE OR EXTEND ANY OR ALL OF OUR DEBT AT MATURITY OR UPON ANY ACCELERATION. IF ANY REFINANCING IS DONE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES, THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS. ANY SUCH REFINANCING COULD ALSO IMPOSE TIGHTER FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST, SUCH AS FUNDING NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, MAKING OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASING OUR SECURITIES OR PAYING DISTRIBUTIONS.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, THE COMPANY MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE AT LEAST 90.0% OF ITS ANNUAL REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH CASH FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY'S REIT TAXABLE INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, DOES NOT EQUAL ITS NET INCOME UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS, CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX UNLESS SUCH GAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CASH DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING DEBT MATURITIES, REDUCING DEBT OR FUTURE GROWTH INITIATIVES. THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT SUCH CASH FLOWS AND,  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACCORDINGLY, INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  ON OCTOBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 3, 2019 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF NOVEMBER 11, 2019.  CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH NEEDS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT, BANK TERM LOANS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAD  $116.7 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  WAS  $599.9 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE A CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, THE COMPANY MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OFFERINGS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTERS INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF FIRMS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NYSE OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE BLOCK TRADES).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE BY MANAGEMENT TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OTHER THAN THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH CHANGED OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS POLICY, SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ALL OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE BENEFICIAL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AND ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EQUITY REIT. BECAUSE THESE FFO CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE SUCH FACTORS AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, THEY FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE USE OF FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE, TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS COMPETITORS AND A MORE INFORMED AND APPROPRIATE BASIS ON WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS INVOLVING OPERATING, FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURES IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE FFO MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM SUBJECTIVE, SUCH AS ADDING BACK EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS. FURTHERMORE, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE DOES NOT DEPICT THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS' BENEFIT. ACCORDINGLY, FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME, NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, OR NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY'S PRESENTATION OF FFO IS CONSISTENT WITH FFO AS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET INCOME/(LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP;  \u2022  LESS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES;  \u2022  PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES;  \u2022  LESS GAINS, OR PLUS LOSSES, FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS UNDER GAAP;  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS OUR SHARE OF ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, FOR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS (TO REFLECT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ON THE SAME BASIS); AND  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS/(LOSSES) ON SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY INCLUDES NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS CONSISTENT WITH STANDARD INDUSTRY PRACTICE FOR REITS THAT OPERATE THROUGH AN UPREIT STRUCTURE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO PRESENT FFO ON AN AS-CONVERTED BASIS SINCE ALL OF THE COMMON UNITS NOT OWNED BY THE COMPANY ARE REDEEMABLE ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS FOR SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE COMPANY'S FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES NOI AND SAME PROPERTY NOI ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPERTY OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE SUCH METRICS PROVIDE A PERFORMANCE MEASURE OF THE REVENUES AND EXPENSES DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN OWNING REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND A PERSPECTIVE NOT IMMEDIATELY APPARENT FROM NET INCOME OR FFO. THE COMPANY DEFINES NOI AS RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES LESS RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DEFINES CASH NOI AS NOI LESS LEASE TERMINATION FEES, STRAIGHT-LINE RENT, AMORTIZATION OF LEASE INCENTIVES AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED ABOVE AND BELOW MARKET LEASES. OTHER REITS MAY USE DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES TO CALCULATE NOI, SAME PROPERTY NOI AND CASH NOI.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF  210  IN-SERVICE PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  28.7 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE WHOLLY OWNED DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED (FROM JANUARY 1,  2018  TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ). AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF  210  IN-SERVICE PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  28.1 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE WHOLLY OWNED DURING THE ENTIRETY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED (FROM JANUARY 1,  2017  TO  DECEMBER 31,  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2018  ). THE CHANGE IN OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WAS DUE TO THE ADDITION OF  THREE  NEWLY DEVELOPED PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  0.8 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET PLACED IN SERVICE DURING  2017  . THESE ADDITIONS WERE OFFSET BY THE REMOVAL OF  THREE  PROPERTIES ENCOMPASSING  0.2 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET THAT WERE SOLD DURING  2019.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES RELATED TO PROPERTIES NOT IN OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO WERE  $12.3 MILLION  AND  $8.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND  $32.7 MILLION  AND  $27.9 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

GRAINGER, INC. (GRAINGER OR THE COMPANY) IS A BROAD LINE, BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DISTRIBUTOR OF MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATING (MRO) PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND JAPAN. MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE RELY ON GRAINGER FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS SAFETY, GLOVES, LADDERS, MOTORS AND JANITORIAL SUPPLIES, ALONG WITH SERVICES LIKE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THESE CUSTOMERS REPRESENT A BROAD COLLECTION OF INDUSTRIES (SEE NOTE 3 IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)). THEY PLACE ORDERS ONLINE, ON MOBILE DEVICES, THROUGH SALES REPRESENTATIVES, OVER THE PHONE AND AT LOCAL BRANCHES. APPROXIMATELY 5,000 SUPPLIERS PROVIDE GRAINGER WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION PRODUCTS STOCKED IN GRAINGER'S DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (DCS) AND BRANCHES WORLDWIDE.  GRAINGER'S  TWO  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE THE U.S. AND CANADA (ACKLANDS - GRAINGER INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES). THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S HIGH-TOUCH SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES IN THOSE GEOGRAPHIES. OTHER BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, (ZORO IN THE U.S. AND MONOTARO IN JAPAN), AND SMALLER HIGH-TOUCH SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES IN EUROPE, ASIA AND MEXICO.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  GIVEN GRAINGER'S LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THE DIVERSE INDUSTRIES IT SERVES, SEVERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS TEND TO SHAPE GRAINGER\u2019S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE GENERAL INSIGHT INTO PROJECTING GRAINGER'S GROWTH. GRAINGER\u2019S SALES IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) AND CANADA TEND TO POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH BUSINESS INVESTMENT, BUSINESS INVENTORY, EXPORTS, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP). SALES IN CANADA ALSO TEND TO POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH OIL PRICES. THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES THESE ESTIMATED INDICATORS FOR 2019.  U.S.  CANADA  ESTIMATED 2018  FORECASTED 2019  ESTIMATED 2018  FORECASTED 2019  BUSINESS INVESTMENT  6.8%  1.6%  1.2%  (2.0)%  BUSINESS INVENTORY  1.8%  2.8%  \u2014  \u2014  EXPORTS  3.0%  (0.2)%  3.2%  2.6%  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  3.9%  0.9%  3.1%  0.8%  GDP  2.9%  2.3%  1.9%  1.4%  OIL PRICES  \u2014  \u2014  $65/BARREL  $59/BARREL  SOURCE: GLOBAL INSIGHT U.S. (OCTOBER 2019), GLOBAL INSIGHT CANADA (SEPTEMBER 2019)  IN THE U.S., BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND EXPORTS ARE TWO MAJOR INDICATORS OF MRO SPENDING. PER THE GLOBAL INSIGHT OCTOBER  2019  FORECAST, BUSINESS INVENTORY IS FORECAST TO IMPROVE WHILE BUSINESS INVESTMENT, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, EXPORTS AND GDP ARE FORECAST TO SOFTEN, AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE TENSIONS AND ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY AROUND TARIFF POLICY, SLOWING GLOBAL GROWTH AND A STRONG U.S. DOLLAR, DIMINISHING SUPPORT FROM FISCAL STIMULUS AND A DECLINE IN THE PACE OF INVENTORY ACCUMULATION.  PER THE GLOBAL INSIGHT SEPTEMBER  2019  FORECAST, CANADA'S BUSINESS INVESTMENT, EXPORTS, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND GDP ARE EXPECTED TO SLOW DUE TO ELEVATED GLOBAL TRADE UNCERTAINTIES, A REDUCTION IN SPENDING, DELAYED INVESTMENTS AND SLOWING GLOBAL OIL DEMAND.  OUTLOOK  EACH BUSINESS IN GRAINGER\u2019S PORTFOLIO HAS A SPECIFIC SET OF STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES FOCUSED ON CREATING UNIQUE VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS.  IN THE U.S. BUSINESS, GRAINGER IS FOCUSED ON GROWING MARKET SHARE THROUGH THE THREE PILLARS OF ITS STRATEGY: (I) BUILDING ADVANTAGED MRO SOLUTIONS, WHICH MEANS BEING ABLE TO GET CUSTOMERS THE EXACT PRODUCT THEY NEED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM QUICKLY; (II) OFFERING DIFFERENTIATED SALES AND SERVICES; GRAINGER HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN SERVING COMPLEX BUSINESSES AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS THROUGH ITS DIRECT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ONSITE SERVICES AND (III) DELIVERING UNPARALLELED CUSTOMER SERVICE; GRAINGER IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE ABSOLUTE BEST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY THROUGH ITS EFFORT TO DELIVER FLAWLESSLY ON EVERY CUSTOMER TRANSACTION.  18  W.W.

ON A DAILY BASIS, NET SALES INCREASED 2.5%. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VOLUME INCREASES IN THE U.S. BUSINESS AND THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE CANADA BUSINESS AND CROMWELL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.), WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER BUSINESSES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRICE INFLATION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE WERE FLAT. SEE THE  SEGMENT ANALYSIS  BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO SEGMENT REVENUE.

THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF  37.3%  DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  DECREASED  0.8  PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PRICING ADJUSTMENTS DURING THE YEAR WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE PRICE COST SPREAD IN THE U.S. BUSINESS AND INCREASED NET SALES IN THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE A LOWER GROSS PROFIT. SEE THE  SEGMENT ANALYSIS  BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT.

GRAINGER'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 24.2% AND 32.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGHER TAX RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CROMWELL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WHICH LOWERED REPORTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND WERE NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN BOTH PERIODS AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 24.2% AND 20.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS  20  W.W. GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET IN BOTH PERIODS AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, SG&A DECREASED $14 MILLION, OR 1% PRIMARILY DUE TO 2018 COST TAKE-OUT ACTIONS IN CANADA.  OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE  $1,081 MILLION  , AN INCREASE OF  $213 MILLION  , OR  24%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET IN BOTH PERIODS AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED $47 MILLION OR 5%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY COST TAKE-OUT ACTIONS IN THE CANADIAN BUSINESS AND SG&A LEVERAGE IN THE U.S. BUSINESS.  OTHER EXPENSE, NET WAS  $42 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, A DECREASE OF $24 MILLION, OR  38%  COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LOSSES FROM THE COMPANY'S CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE CONCLUDED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2018.  INCOME TAXES OF  $261 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  INCREASED  $63 MILLION  , OR  32%  COMPARED WITH  $198 MILLION  FOR THE COMPARABLE 2018 PERIOD. GRAINGER'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 25.1% AND 24.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER TAX BENEFIT FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPANY'S CLEAN ENERGY TAX BENEFITS IN 2019 AS THE COMPANY CONCLUDED ITS INVESTMENTS IN 2018.  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO W.W. GRAINGER, INC.

EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET FROM BOTH PERIODS IN THE TABLE ABOVE, NET EARNINGS INCREASED $19 MILLION, OR 3%. THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM LOWER SG&A AND LOWER OTHER EXPENSE, NET.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF  $13.40  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS UP  33%  VERSUS THE  $10.04  FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS AND LOWER AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET FROM BOTH PERIODS IN THE TABLE ABOVE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN $13.40 COMPARED TO $12.74 IN 2018, AN INCREASE OF 5%.

THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER SALES, HIGHER GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS AND IMPROVED SG&A LEVERAGE.  CANADA  NET SALES WERE  $400 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, A DECREASE OF  $108 MILLION  , OR  21%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.

OPERATING LOSSES WERE  $4 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO LOSSES OF  $38 MILLION  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET IN BOTH PERIODS AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, OPERATING LOSSES WOULD HAVE BEEN $5 MILLION COMPARED TO $15 MILLION IN THE PRIOR PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER GROSS PROFIT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SG&A.  25  W.W. GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OTHER BUSINESSES  NET SALES FOR OTHER BUSINESSES WERE  $1,969 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AN INCREASE OF  $149 MILLION  , OR  8%  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 AND CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  PERCENT INCREASE/(DECREASE)  PRICE/VOLUME  10.0%  FOREIGN EXCHANGE  (2.0)  TOTAL  8.0%  THE NET SALES INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CUSTOMER ACQUISITION GROWTH FROM THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEADWINDS FROM THE EURO AND POUND STERLING.  OPERATING EARNINGS OF  $87 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 INCREASED  $109 MILLION  FROM OPERATING  LOSSES OF  $22 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  CASH FLOW  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $770 MILLION  AND $743 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER NET EARNINGS AND FAVORABLE CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND HIGHER NET PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PAID UNDER ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLANS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $145 MILLION  AND $105 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF ASSETS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $875 MILLION  AND $437 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASES IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018.  WORKING CAPITAL  INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL AND FUNDS USED FOR GROWTH INITIATIVES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. GRAINGER'S WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT SEASONALITY TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  WORKING CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CURRENT ASSETS (LESS NON-OPERATING CASH) AND CURRENT LIABILITIES (LESS SHORT-TERM DEBT, CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LEASE LIABILITIES). WORKING CAPITAL AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WAS $2,059 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF $161 MILLION  WHEN COMPARED TO $1,898 MILLION  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEES PROFIT-SHARING PLANS DUE TO THE ANNUAL CASH CONTRIBUTION.  AT THESE DATES, THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS  2.6  AND  2.4  , RESPECTIVELY.  DEBT  GRAINGER MAINTAINS A DEBT RATIO AND LIQUIDITY POSITION THAT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, GRAINGER HAS VARIOUS SOURCES OF FINANCING AVAILABLE, INCLUDING BANK BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT. TOTAL DEBT, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TOTAL INTEREST-BEARING DEBT (SHORT-TERM, CURRENT MATURITIES AND LONG-TERM) AND LEASE LIABILITIES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION WAS  53.7%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AND  51.5%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  26  W.W. GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BACKGROUND AND GENERAL  WE ARE A PRODUCER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM SPECIALTY ALLOYS, INCLUDING TITANIUM ALLOYS, POWDER METALS, STAINLESS STEELS, ALLOY STEELS, AND TOOL STEELS AS WELL AS DRILLING TOOLS. WE ARE A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPECIALTY ALLOY-BASED MATERIALS AND PROCESS SOLUTIONS FOR CRITICAL APPLICATIONS IN THE AEROSPACE, DEFENSE, MEDICAL, TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY, INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER MARKETS. WE HAVE EVOLVED TO BECOME A PIONEER IN PREMIUM SPECIALTY ALLOYS, INCLUDING TITANIUM, NICKEL, AND COBALT, AS WELL AS ALLOYS SPECIFICALLY ENGINEERED FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (\"AM\") PROCESSES AND SOFT MAGNETICS APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR AM CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE \u201cEND-TO-END\u201d SOLUTION TO ACCELERATE MATERIALS INNOVATION AND STREAMLINE PARTS PRODUCTION. WE PRIMARILY PROCESS BASIC RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS NICKEL, COBALT, TITANIUM, MANGANESE, CHROMIUM, MOLYBDENUM, IRON SCRAP AND OTHER METAL ALLOYING ELEMENTS THROUGH VARIOUS MELTING, HOT FORMING AND COLD WORKING FACILITIES TO PRODUCE FINISHED PRODUCTS IN THE FORM OF BILLET, BAR, ROD, WIRE AND NARROW STRIP IN MANY SIZES AND FINISHES. WE ALSO PRODUCE CERTAIN METAL POWDERS AND PARTS. OUR SALES ARE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY FROM OUR PRODUCTION PLANTS AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AS WELL AS THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. UNLIKE MANY OTHER SPECIALTY STEEL PRODUCERS, WE OPERATE OUR OWN WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. THESE SERVICE CENTERS, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, EUROPE AND ASIA ALLOW US TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER VARIOUS JUST-IN-TIME STOCKING PROGRAMS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT AND EXECUTE OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT COLLABORATIONS AIMED AT BROADENING OUR OFFERINGS TO THE MARKETPLACE. WE HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL TERMS AND STRUCTURES OF SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THESE OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR DISCUSSIONS BELOW IN THIS ITEM 2 ARE BASED UPON THE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF OUR  2019  FORM 10-K. OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE FOCUS ON OUR RESULTS DURING OR AS OF THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  , AND TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, ON MATERIAL CHANGES FROM INFORMATION DISCUSSED IN THE  2019  FORM 10-K AND OTHER IMPORTANT INTERVENING DEVELOPMENTS OR INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE REPORTED ON FORM 8-K. THESE DISCUSSIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE  2019  FORM 10-K FOR DETAILED BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND WITH ANY SUCH INTERVENING FORM 8-K.  IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL PRICES AND PRODUCT MIX  WE VALUE MOST OF OUR INVENTORY UTILIZING THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\"LIFO\") INVENTORY COSTING METHOD. UNDER THE LIFO INVENTORY COSTING METHOD, CHANGES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD EVEN THOUGH THESE MATERIALS MAY POTENTIALLY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED AT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT VALUES DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE RAW MATERIALS TO THE SALE OF THE PROCESSED FINISHED GOODS TO THE CUSTOMERS. IN A PERIOD OF RISING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, THE LIFO INVENTORY VALUATION NORMALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER COST OF SALES. CONVERSELY, IN A PERIOD OF DECREASING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, THE LIFO INVENTORY VALUATION NORMALLY RESULTS IN LOWER COST OF SALES.  THE VOLATILITY OF THE COSTS OF RAW MATERIALS HAS IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE, AND OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY, GENERALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS COST INCREASES ON MAJOR RAW MATERIALS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS USING SURCHARGES THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO RECOVER INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. GENERALLY, THE FORMULA USED TO CALCULATE A SURCHARGE IS BASED ON PUBLISHED PRICES OF THE RESPECTIVE RAW MATERIALS FOR THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHICH CORRELATES TO THE PRICES WE PAY FOR OUR RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF OUR SURCHARGES TO CUSTOMERS MAY BE CALCULATED USING A DIFFERENT SURCHARGE FORMULA OR MAY BE BASED ON THE RAW MATERIAL PRICES AT THE TIME OF ORDER, WHICH CREATES A LAG BETWEEN SURCHARGE REVENUE AND CORRESPONDING RAW MATERIAL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES. THE SURCHARGE MECHANISM PROTECTS OUR NET INCOME ON SUCH SALES EXCEPT FOR THE LAG EFFECT DISCUSSED ABOVE. HOWEVER, SURCHARGES HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES AS DESCRIBED LATER IN THIS REPORT.  APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF OUR NET SALES ARE SALES TO CUSTOMERS UNDER FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS. FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE A RISK OF PROFIT MARGIN FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY WHEN RAW MATERIAL PRICES ARE VOLATILE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATING PROFIT MARGINS ON THESE SALES, WE ENTER INTO COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE CERTAIN CRITICAL RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE RELATED PRODUCTS SOLD. FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY INCLUDE CERTAIN ANNUAL PURCHASING COMMITMENTS AND CONSUMPTION SCHEDULES AGREED TO BY THE CUSTOMERS AT SELLING PRICES BASED ON RAW MATERIAL PRICES AT THE TIME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED. IF A CUSTOMER FAILS TO MEET THE VOLUME COMMITMENTS (OR THE CONSUMPTION SCHEDULE DEVIATES FROM THE AGREED-UPON TERMS OF THE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS), THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO ABSORB THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS/LOSS WHEN EARNINGS ARE IMPACTED BY THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. BECAUSE WE VALUE MOST OF OUR INVENTORY UNDER THE LIFO COSTING METHODOLOGY, CHANGES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ATTEMPTING TO MATCH THE MOST RECENTLY INCURRED COSTS WITH REVENUES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) TOGETHER WITH THE ACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES WHEN THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE PURCHASED AND RECORDED IN INVENTORY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE COMMODITIES, INCLUSIVE OF THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS, ARE HIGHER OR LOWER RELATIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF YEAR COSTS, OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD REFLECTS SUCH AMOUNTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND/OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS MAY NOT IMPACT THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, AND COMPARISONS OF GROSS PROFIT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED. THESE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS WE LOOK TO STRENGTHEN OUR LONG-TERM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS BY EXPANDING, RENEWING AND IN CERTAIN CASES EXTENDING TO A LONGER-TERM, OUR CUSTOMER LONG-TERM ARRANGEMENTS.  WE PRODUCE HUNDREDS OF GRADES OF MATERIALS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PRICING AND PROFIT LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE GRADE. IN ADDITION, OUR PRODUCT MIX WITHIN A PERIOD IS SUBJECT TO THE FLUCTUATING ORDER PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS DECISIONS WE MAY MAKE ON PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON AVAILABLE CAPACITY, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF CAPACITY COMMITMENTS WE MAY HAVE UNDER EXISTING CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS. WHILE WE EXPECT TO SEE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION FROM A MORE FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX IN OUR MARGIN PERFORMANCE OVER TIME, THE IMPACT BY PERIOD MAY FLUCTUATE AND PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS MAY VARY.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET PENSION EXPENSE  NET PENSION EXPENSE, AS WE DEFINE IT BELOW, INCLUDES THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS RELATED TO BOTH OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS ARE DETERMINED ANNUALLY BASED ON BEGINNING OF YEAR BALANCES AND ARE RECORDED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR, UNLESS A SIGNIFICANT RE-MEASUREMENT EVENT OCCURS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE TOTAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR FISCAL YEAR  2020  WILL BE $15.0 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $11.4 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  .

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW  OUR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS REFLECT THE ONGOING MOMENTUM WE ARE DRIVING ACROSS OUR CORE BUSINESS AS WE GENERATED STRONG OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND DELIVERED OUR ELEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES AND EARNINGS GROWTH. BACKLOG LEVELS INCREASED 26 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR WITH THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE AND MEDICAL END-USE MARKETS INCREASING BY 40 PERCENT AND 15 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.  IN THE MEDICAL END-USE MARKET, WE DELIVERED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH DUE TO EXPANDED DIRECT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN FACILITY EXPANSIONS FOR OUR PREMIUM TITANIUM BAR PRODUCTS.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS WITH OBTAINING THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS FOR OUR ATHENS FACILITY AND RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT LEVELS RELATED TO ATHENS QUALIFICATIONS REMAIN HIGH AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL APPROVALS AND PROVIDE CRITICAL INCREMENTAL CAPACITY FOR THE INDUSTRY.  WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR CORE BUSINESS FORWARD WITH STRONG COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND CONTINUING MANUFACTURING IMPROVEMENTS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A BALANCE BETWEEN NEAR-TERM EARNINGS GROWTH AND INVESTING FOR THE LONG-TERM. WE CONTINUE TO TAKE INNOVATIVE ACTION IN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AREAS INCLUDING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND SOFT MAGNETICS TO ACCELERATE PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN OUR POSITION AS A LEADING SOLUTIONS PROVIDER AND CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE YEARS AND DECADES TO COME.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPORTED NET INCOME OF  $41.2 MILLION  , OR  $0.85  PER DILUTED SHARE. THIS COMPARES WITH NET INCOME FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR EARLIER OF  $31.5 MILLION  , OR  $0.65  PER DILUTED SHARE. THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS REFLECT STRENGTHENING PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS COMBINED WITH OUR SOLUTIONS-FOCUSED APPROACH DRIVING INCREASED SALES IN OUR AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE AND MEDICAL END-USE MARKETS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WERE  $585.4 MILLION  , WHICH WAS A  2  PERCENT  INCREASE  OVER THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  7  PERCENT ON A  5  PERCENT  DECREASE  IN SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE REFLECT A FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 6 PERCENT FROM THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO TO $200.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONGER DEMAND IN THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE END-USE MARKET IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC AND THE ENERGY END-USE MARKET IN EUROPE. A PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RESULTED IN A $1.3 MILLION DECREASE IN SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . NET SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTED 34 PERCENT AND 33 PERCENT OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  SALES BY END-USE MARKETS  WE SELL TO CUSTOMERS ACROSS DIVERSIFIED END-USE MARKETS.

EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  19  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO ON A  10  PERCENT  INCREASE  IN SHIPMENT VOLUME. THE RESULTS REFLECT STRONGER DEMAND IN ALMOST ALL AEROSPACE SUB-MARKETS DEMONSTRATING THE CONTINUED BENEFITS FROM OUR BROAD SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO ACROSS MULTIPLE ATTRACTIVE SUB-MARKETS.  IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR DEFENSE RELATED APPLICATIONS DRIVEN BY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.  MEDICAL END-USE MARKET SALES  INCREASED  4  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $48.9 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  11  PERCENT ON  9  PERCENT  HIGHER  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR HIGH-VALUE MATERIALS USED IN ORTHOPEDIC, CARDIOLOGY AND DENTAL APPLICATIONS.  TRANSPORTATION END-USE MARKET SALES  DECREASED  1  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $40.0 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  5  PERCENT ON  FLAT  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT INCREASED SALES IN LIGHT VEHICLES AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS DRIVEN BY RICHER PRODUCT MIX FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS SPECIFICALLY ENGINEERED FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE AND HIGH-WEAR APPLICATIONS OFFSET BY IMPACTS OF ONGOING TRADE ACTIONS AND TARIFFS WHICH HAVE IMPACTED CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS.  SALES TO THE ENERGY END-USE MARKET OF $39.3 MILLION  REFLECT AN  11  PERCENT  DECREASE  FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  DECREASED  12  PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECT DECREASES IN THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET DUE TO DECLINING MARKET ACTIVITY AND GROWING PRICING PRESSURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE INTERNATIONAL POWER GENERATION SUB-MARKET.  INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER END-USE MARKET SALES  DECREASED  24  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $73.3 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  DECREASED  19 PERCENT ON  28  PERCENT LOWER SHIPMENT VOLUME. THE RESULTS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF REDUCED DEMAND FOR MATERIALS USED IN SELECT INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS OUR ONGOING PORTFOLIO RATIONALIZATION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT  OUR GROSS PROFIT IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER  INCREASED  23  PERCENT TO  $112.6 MILLION  , OR  19.2  PERCENT OF NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH  $91.7 MILLION  , OR  16.0  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SURCHARGE REVENUE, OUR ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS  23.1 PERCENT  AS COMPARED TO  20.1 PERCENT  IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASING MARGINS IN THE SAO SEGMENT AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX IN ALL END-USE MARKETS.  WHILE THE SURCHARGE GENERALLY PROTECTS THE ABSOLUTE GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, IT DOES HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENT OF SALES. THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE SURCHARGE ON GROSS MARGIN FOR THE COMPARATIVE THREE MONTH PERIODS. SEE THE SECTION \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES.

THE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES REFLECT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INCLUDING EXPENSES OF LPW WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER A YEAR AGO.  OPERATING INCOME  OUR OPERATING INCOME IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER WAS $59.8 MILLION  OR  10.2  PERCENT OF NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH $45.0 MILLION  OR  7.9  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN WAS  12.3  PERCENT FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER AS COMPARED WITH  9.9  PERCENT A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  PRIMARILY REFLECT STRONGER PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS AND IMPROVED MARGINS IN THE SAO SEGMENT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO.  THE FOLLOWING PRESENTS OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, IN EACH CASE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SURCHARGE REVENUE ON NET SALES. WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THIS ITEM PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT AND MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR COMPARING ONGOING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  INCLUDES NET LOSSES FROM INTEREST RATE SWAPS OF  $0.0 MILLION  COMPARED WITH  $0.3 MILLION  OF NET LOSSES FROM INTEREST RATE SWAPS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . CAPITALIZED INTEREST REDUCED INTEREST EXPENSE BY  $2.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  $0.9 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  OTHER (EXPENSE) INCOME, NET  OTHER EXPENSE, NET FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS  $0.3 MILLION  AS COMPARED WITH  $1.6 MILLION  OF OTHER INCOME, NET FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE FROM PENSION EARNINGS, INTEREST AND DEFERRALS WHILE THE PRIOR YEAR RESULTS REFLECTED FAVORABLE MARKET RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS USED TO FUND COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS HELD IN RABBI TRUSTS.  INCOME TAXES  INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER WAS  $12.9 MILLION  , OR  23.8 PERCENT  OF PRE-TAX INCOME COMPARED WITH  $8.8 MILLION  , OR  21.8  PERCENT OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IS HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO LOSSES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECORDED AS WELL AS A LOWER TAX BENEFIT FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  WE HAVE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: SAO AND PEP.

EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, NET SALES  INCREASED  9  PERCENT ON  4  PERCENT  LOWER  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECT THE IMPACT OF INCREASED SALES AND STRONGER PRODUCT MIX IN ALL END-USE MARKETS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SAME QUARTER.  OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SAO SEGMENT WAS  $81.0 MILLION  OR  16.5  PERCENT OF NET SALES (  20.6  PERCENT OF NET SALES EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE) IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER, AS COMPARED WITH $52.8 MILLION  OR  11.1  PERCENT OF NET SALES (  14.6  PERCENT OF NET SALES EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE) IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT IMPROVED MARGINS FROM CAPACITY AND PRODUCTIVITY GAINS AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SAME QUARTER.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PERFORMANCE ENGINEERED PRODUCTS SEGMENT  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  FOR THE PEP SEGMENT  DECREASED  2  PERCENT TO $109.4 MILLION  , AS COMPARED WITH $111.7 MILLION  IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, NET SALES OF $107.9 MILLION  WERE  FLAT  FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT LOWER SALES IN OUR ENERGY END-USE MARKET, PRIMARILY IN THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET.  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE PEP SEGMENT WAS $2.0 MILLION  OR NEGATIVE  1.8  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER, COMPARED WITH OPERATING INCOME OF $7.3 MILLION  OR  6.5  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS WERE IMPACTED BY OUR CONTINUING STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND DECREASED ACTIVITY IN THE NORTH AMERICAN OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE GENERATED CASH FROM OPERATIONS OF $0.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO $9.4 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. OUR FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH WE DEFINE UNDER \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW, WAS NEGATIVE  $56.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NEGATIVE  $41.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WORKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME LEVELS. THE FREE CASH FLOW RESULTS REFLECT WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENTS AND HIGHER CAPITAL SPENDING LEVELS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN STRATEGIC GROWTH AREAS INCLUDING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND SOFT MAGNETICS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SAME PERIOD.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE WERE $47.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO $41.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  WERE $9.7 MILLION  AND  $9.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE PAID AT THE SAME QUARTERLY RATE OF $0.20  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK IN BOTH PERIODS.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO MEET OUR NEEDS THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF FINANCING TO SUPPLEMENT INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. WE GENERALLY TARGET MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $150 MILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ADDED TO AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT OF  $400 MILLION  , WHICH EXPIRES IN MARCH 2022. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $5.9 MILLION  OF ISSUED LETTERS OF CREDIT AND  $77.6 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE BALANCE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT,  $316.5 MILLION  , REMAINS AVAILABLE TO US. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD TOTAL LIQUIDITY OF $341.1 MILLION, INCLUDING  $24.6 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE BORROWED UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DAILY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY $36.2 MILLION WITH DAILY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGING FROM $0.0 MILLION TO $73.2 MILLION DURING THE PERIOD.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $24.6 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY OF  $316.5 MILLION  UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS OVER THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE MADE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS OF  $2.4 MILLION  TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO MAKE  $3.8 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION HELD AT VARIOUS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. OUR GLOBAL CASH DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 CASH BALANCES, THE LOCATIONS OF OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS, AND THE COST TO ACCESS INTERNATIONAL CASH BALANCES, AS NECESSARY. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY MAKE SHORT-TERM INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS AGAINST OUR CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE ANY REQUIRED BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO (3.50 TO 1.00 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ). THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS, FOR ANY PERIOD, THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND NON-CASH NET PENSION EXPENSE (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) TO CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE FOR SUCH PERIOD. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO OF LESS THAN 55%. THE DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS, AS DEFINED THEREIN, TO CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION, AS DEFINED THEREIN. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR ACTUAL RATIO PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .  COVENANT  COVENANT REQUIREMENT  ACTUAL RATIO  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE  3.50 TO 1.00 (MINIMUM)  16.24 TO 1.00  CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO CAPITAL  55% (MAXIMUM)  28.5%  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THIS COULD REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FLEXIBILITY DUE TO POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWINGS AVAILABLE TO US UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN WAIVERS OR MODIFICATIONS OF THE COVENANTS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE USE IN THIS REPORT. OUR DEFINITIONS AND CALCULATIONS OF THESE ITEMS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE THE SAME AS THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  NET SALES AND GROSS MARGIN EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE  THIS REPORT INCLUDES DISCUSSIONS OF NET SALES AS ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL SURCHARGE AND THE RESULTING IMPACT ON GROSS MARGINS, WHICH REPRESENT FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THE IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL SURCHARGE FROM NET SALES AND COST OF SALES PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS FOR COMPARING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN THIS REPORT. MANAGEMENT USES ITS RESULTS EXCLUDING THESE AMOUNTS TO EVALUATE ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND TO DISCUSS ITS BUSINESS WITH INVESTMENT INSTITUTIONS, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OTHERS.

IT IS MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT INTENTION TO USE EXCESS CASH TO FUND INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSISTENT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OF, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, CASH FLOWS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  CONTINGENCIES  ENVIRONMENTAL  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POLLUTION, PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH. ALTHOUGH COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT THE COSTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, COMPLIANCE COSTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES AT SOME OF OUR OWNED OPERATING FACILITIES AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A PRP WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTY SUPERFUND WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES AND OTHER THIRD PARTY-OWNED SITES. WE ACCRUE AMOUNTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS THAT REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE FUTURE COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY DECREASED THE LIABILITY FOR A COMPANY-OWNED FORMER OPERATING SITE BY $0.2 MILLION  . THE LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AT SUPERFUND SITES, OTHER THIRD PARTY-OWNED SITES AND CARPENTER-OWNED CURRENT OR FORMER OPERATING FACILITIES REMAINING AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE  $15.9 MILLION  AND  $16.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT WE MAY BE A PRP WITH RESPECT TO OTHER SUPERFUND SITES AS TO WHICH NO PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST US. NEITHER THE EXACT AMOUNT OF REMEDIATION COSTS NOR THE FINAL METHOD OF THEIR ALLOCATION AMONG ALL DESIGNATED PRPS AT THESE SUPERFUND SITES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. ACCORDINGLY, AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE EXPECTED COSTS FOR SUCH MATTERS. THE LIABILITY FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED IS EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS ARE INHERENTLY IMPRECISE BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING EVOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY, THE IDENTIFICATION OF CURRENTLY UNKNOWN REMEDIATION SITES AND THE ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG THE PRPS. BASED UPON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, SUCH FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  HOWEVER, SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN A PARTICULAR FUTURE QUARTER OR YEAR.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER  WE ARE DEFENDING VARIOUS ROUTINE CLAIMS AND LEGAL ACTIONS THAT ARE INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND THAT ARE COMMON TO OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO PRODUCT CLAIMS, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, COMPLIANCE WITH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND TAX ISSUES. LIKE MANY OTHER MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS WE, FROM TIME TO TIME, HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES IN THE WORKPLACE SUCH AS ASBESTOS. WE PROVIDE FOR COSTS RELATING TO THESE MATTERS WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE EFFECT OF THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY CANNOT BE PREDICTED BECAUSE ANY SUCH EFFECT DEPENDS ON FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE AMOUNT AND TIMING (BOTH AS TO RECORDING FUTURE CHARGES TO OPERATIONS AND CASH EXPENDITURES) OF THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE TOTAL LIABILITY FROM THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AN INCREASE IN THE SCOPE OF PENDING MATTERS OR THAT ANY FUTURE LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN A PARTICULAR FUTURE QUARTER OR YEAR.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  A SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS DISCUSSED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d, AND IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 THERETO.  GOODWILL  GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD IS AT LEAST ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL MAY BE IMPAIRED. POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IS IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE USE OF MARKET MULTIPLES VALUATION TECHNIQUES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT TESTED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO CASH FLOW FORECASTS, DISCOUNT RATES, TERMINAL VALUES AND INCOME TAX RATES. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO REVENUE GROWTH RATES. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EACH REPORTING UNIT\u2019S MARKETS, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PRICING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS COST PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON A MARKET PARTICIPANT\u2019S PERSPECTIVE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. THE TERMINAL VALUE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTING UNIT BEYOND THE FORECAST PERIOD, IS ESTIMATED USING A PERPETUITY GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION. THE INCOME TAX RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF THE LONG-TERM STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD FIVE REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL RECORDED. GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SAO REPORTING UNIT IS TESTED AT THE SAO SEGMENT LEVEL AND REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL GOODWILL. ALL OTHER GOODWILL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PEP SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL RECORDED.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SAO REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 32 PERCENT.  THE GOODWILL RECORDED RELATED TO THE SAO REPORTING UNIT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $195.5 MILLION. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS FOR THE SAO REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE VOLUME, IMPROVE MIX, EXPAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR SAO\u2019S FAIR VALUE, WE USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST CAPITAL OF 10 PERCENT AND A TERMINAL GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION OF 3 PERCENT.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF CARPENTER POWDER PRODUCTS (\u201cPOWDERS\u201d) EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY 8 PERCENT. THE GOODWILL RECORDED RELATED TO POWDERS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $22.0 MILLION. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS FOR THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE VOLUME, IMPROVE MIX, EXPAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE, WE USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST CAPITAL OF 14.5 PERCENT AND A TERMINAL GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION OF 3 PERCENT.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JULY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED CERTAIN BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN OUR PEP SEGMENT. THE LPW, CALRAM AND POWDER BUSINESSES IN ALABAMA AND WEST VIRGINIA WERE COMBINED TO CREATE THE CARPENTER ADDITIVE REPORTING UNIT. THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT REMAINS BUT NOW EXCLUDES THE ALABAMA AND WEST VIRGINIA SITES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF JULY 1, 2019 FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IMPACTED BY THE REORGANIZATION NOTING THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE IN ALL INSTANCES.  THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. WE BASED OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF FUTURE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR BUSINESS UNITS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR PURPOSES OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTING AS OF THE TIME OF TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING BUSINESS PROJECTIONS, COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS OR ANTICIPATED GROWTH RATES ARE NOT CORRECT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD GOODWILL AND/OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHETHER IN CONNECTION WITH OUR NEXT ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OR EARLIER, IF AN INDICATOR OF AN IMPAIRMENT IS PRESENT BEFORE OUR NEXT ANNUAL EVALUATION.

EXECUTIVE  OVERVIEW  KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION, A MARYLAND CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS.   THE TERMS \u201cKIMCO,\u201d THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d EACH REFER TO KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S MISSION IS TO CREATE DESTINATIONS FOR EVERYDAY LIVING THAT INSPIRE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND DELIVER VALUE TO OUR MANY STAKEHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) AND HAS OWNED AND OPERATED OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS FOR OVER 60 YEARS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED, NOR DOES IT EXPECT TO RETAIN, ANY REIT ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS PROPERTIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD INTERESTS IN 420 SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES, AGGREGATING 73.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS LEASABLE AREA (\u201cGLA\u201d), LOCATED IN 27 STATES AND PUERTO RICO. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD 247 OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE COMPANY\u2019S PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, TOTALING 4.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GLA. THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE CONSIST OF ITS CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO AND PORTFOLIOS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS AN ECONOMIC INTEREST, SUCH AS PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, WHERE THE COMPANY PARTNERS WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND ALSO RETAINS MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING STRATEGIES ARE TO (I) OWN AND OPERATE ITS SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES AT THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL THROUGH MAXIMIZING AND MAINTAINING RENTAL INCOME AND OCCUPANCY LEVELS, (II) ATTRACT LOCAL AREA CUSTOMERS TO ITS SHOPPING CENTERS, WHICH OFFER OFF-PRICE MERCHANDISE AND DAY-TO-DAY NECESSITIES RATHER THAN HIGH-PRICED LUXURY ITEMS, AND (III) MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO INVEST CAPITAL INTO HIGH QUALITY ASSETS FOCUSING ON MAJOR METROPOLITAN-AREA U.S. MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY ON THE EAST AND WEST COASTS AND IN THE SUNBELT REGION, WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY STRONG DEMOGRAPHICS, SIGNIFICANT PROJECTED POPULATION GROWTH, AND WHERE THE COMPANY PERCEIVES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHILE DISPOSING OF LESSER QUALITY ASSETS IN LESS DESIRABLE LOCATIONS. THROUGH THIS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY HAS STEADILY PROGRESSED IN ITS TRANSFORMATION OF ITS PORTFOLIO AND WILL CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS AS DEEMED NECESSARY TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY AND GROWTH OF ITS PORTFOLIO. THE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS ALLOWING TENANTS TO GENERATE HIGHER FOOT TRAFFIC RESULTING IN HIGHER SALES VOLUME. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS WILL ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN HIGHER OCCUPANCY LEVELS, RENTAL RATES AND RENTAL GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY, ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, HAS EMBARKED ON SEVERAL GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT AND RE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES THE RETAIL RE-TENANTING, RENOVATION AND EXPANSION OF ITS EXISTING CENTERS AND ACQUIRED CENTERS, WHILE ALSO PURSUING REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OVERALL VALUE WITHIN ITS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ESTABLISHED INCOME-PRODUCING REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT RE-TENANTING AND REDEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PRESENTLY OPERATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE LAND PARCELS IN ITS KEY MARKETS FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER INVESTMENTS IN OTHER REAL ESTATE SECTORS AND IN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WHERE IT DOES NOT PRESENTLY OPERATE SHOULD SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO SIMPLIFY ITS BUSINESS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ITS JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS.  AS PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY EACH PROPERTY IS EVALUATED FOR ITS HIGHEST AND BEST USE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS RELATED TO RETAILER CONTROLLED REAL ESTATE SUCH AS, REPOSITIONING UNDERPERFORMING RETAIL LOCATIONS, RETAIL REAL ESTATE FINANCING AND BANKRUPTCY TRANSACTION SUPPORT. THE COMPANY HAS AN ACTIVE CAPITAL RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR ANY OF THESE ASSETS IS LESS THAN THEIR NET CARRYING VALUES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL.

ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A U.S. INCOME TAX IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  FUNDS  F  ROM OPERATIONS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d) IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. IN DECEMBER 2018, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) ISSUED \u201cNAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES, WHERE NECESSARY, EXISTING GUIDANCE AND CONSOLIDATES ALERTS AND POLICY BULLETINS INTO A SINGLE DOCUMENT FOR EASE OF USE.  NAREIT DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME/(LOSS) AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), EXCLUDING (I) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, (II) GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, (III) GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGE IN CONTROL, (IV) IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES WHEN THE IMPAIRMENT IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE HELD BY THE ENTITY AND (V) AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES CALCULATED TO REFLECT FFO ON THE SAME BASIS. INCLUDED IN THE 2018 RESTATEMENT IS AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AN ELECTION TO INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS INCIDENTAL TO ITS MAIN BUSINESS IN THE CALCULATION OF FFO. THE MAIN BUSINESS OF A REIT IS ACQUIRING, OWNING, OPERATING, DEVELOPING AND REDEVELOPING REAL ESTATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS RENTAL OF REAL ESTATE.  INCIDENTAL ASSETS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, LAND PERIPHERAL TO OPERATING PROPERTIES, PROPERTY DEVELOPED FOR SALE, AND SECURITIES. THE NAREIT FFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT (\u201cFFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT\u201d) IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND INTERIM PERIODS REPORTED WITHIN THOSE PERIODS.  AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE FFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO EXCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS INCIDENTAL TO ITS MAIN BUSINESS AND TO EXCLUDE MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN VALUE OF ITS EQUITY SECURITIES IN CALCULATING FFO. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER INCLUDE GAINS/IMPAIRMENTS ON LAND PARCELS, GAINS/LOSSES (REALIZED OR UNREALIZED) FROM MARKETABLE SECURITIES OR GAINS/IMPAIRMENTS ON PREFERRED EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS IN NAREIT DEFINED FFO.  THE COMPANY PRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS IT CONSIDERS IT AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BELIEVES IT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE EVALUATION OF REITS, MANY OF WHICH PRESENT FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WHEN REPORTING RESULTS. COMPARISON OF OUR PRESENTATION OF FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES FOR OTHER REITS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MEANINGFUL DUE TO POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE NAREIT DEFINITION USED BY SUCH REITS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED AS AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE AS IT BELIEVES IT IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF ITS CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO COMPARE THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED IS GENERALLY CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY AS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EXCLUDING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONAL INCOME AND EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING IMPAIRMENTS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE RESULTS WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO.  FFO IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES\u2019 OPERATING PERFORMANCES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.  OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM METHODS USED BY OTHER REITS AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SUCH OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED, IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA).

SAME PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME  (\u201c  S  AME PROPERTY NOI\u201d)  SAME PROPERTY NOI IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES\u2019 OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SAME PROPERTY NOI AS AN IMPORTANT OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS TO MEASURE ONLY THE NET OPERATING INCOME OF PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN OWNED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR REPORTING PERIODS. IT EXCLUDES PROPERTIES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND PENDING STABILIZATION; PROPERTIES ARE DEEMED STABILIZED AT THE EARLIER OF (I) REACHING 90% LEASED OR (II) ONE YEAR FOLLOWING A PROJECT\u2019S INCLUSION IN OPERATING REAL ESTATE. SAME PROPERTY NOI ASSISTS IN ELIMINATING DISPARITIES IN NET INCOME DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES DURING THE PARTICULAR PERIOD PRESENTED, AND THUS PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE MEASURE FOR THE COMPARISON OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES.  SAME PROPERTY NOI IS CALCULATED USING REVENUES FROM RENTAL PROPERTIES (EXCLUDING STRAIGHT-LINE RENT ADJUSTMENTS, LEASE TERMINATION FEES, TIFS AND AMORTIZATION OF ABOVE/BELOW MARKET RENTS) LESS CHARGES FOR BAD DEBT, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, REAL ESTATE TAXES AND RENT EXPENSE PLUS THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF SAME PROPERTY NOI FROM UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES, CALCULATED ON THE SAME BASIS.

IN ADDITION, THERE WAS ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 UNDER THE 2010 ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (\u201cA&EP\u201d) LOSS PORTFOLIO TRANSFER AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY AND OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS  CNA\u2019S COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS (\u201cPROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS\u201d) INCLUDE ITS SPECIALTY, COMMERCIAL AND INTERNATIONAL LINES OF BUSINESS. CNA\u2019S OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS INCLUDE ITS LONG TERM CARE BUSINESS THAT IS IN  RUN-OFF,  CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES, INCLUDING INTEREST ON CNA\u2019S CORPORATE DEBT, AND CERTAIN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESSES IN  RUN-OFF,  INCLUDING CNA RE AND A&EP. CNA\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PRIMARILY MARKETED THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS, BROKERS AND MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITERS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, ASSOCIATIONS, PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER GROUPS. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF CNA AS ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS APPROPRIATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ON SEGMENT REPORTING. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE PROVIDE GREATER DETAIL WITH RESPECT TO CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS AND OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO ENHANCE THE READER\u2019S UNDERSTANDING AND TO PROVIDE FURTHER TRANSPARENCY INTO KEY DRIVERS OF CNA\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ASSESSING CNA\u2019S INSURANCE OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE CORE INCOME (LOSS) FINANCIAL MEASURE. CORE INCOME (LOSS) IS CALCULATED BY EXCLUDING FROM NET INCOME (LOSS) (I) NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES, (II) INCOME OR LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, (III) ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND (IV) DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY REMEASUREMENT AS A RESULT OF AN ENACTED U.S. FEDERAL TAX RATE CHANGE. IN ADDITION, CORE INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. THE CALCULATION OF CORE INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDES NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES BECAUSE NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT WITH KEY DRIVERS OF UNDERWRITING PERFORMANCE, AND ARE THEREFORE NOT CONSIDERED AN INDICATION OF TRENDS IN INSURANCE OPERATIONS. CORE INCOME (LOSS) IS DEEMED TO BE A  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURE AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS MANAGEMENT USES THIS MEASURE TO ASSESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS  IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS, CNA UTILIZES THE LOSS RATIO, THE EXPENSE RATIO, THE DIVIDEND RATIO AND THE COMBINED RATIO. THESE RATIOS ARE CALCULATED USING GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE LOSS RATIO IS THE PERCENTAGE OF NET INCURRED CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE EXPENSE RATIO IS THE PERCENTAGE OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS, TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE DIVIDEND RATIO IS THE RATIO OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 DIVIDENDS INCURRED TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE COMBINED RATIO IS THE SUM OF THE LOSS, EXPENSE AND DIVIDEND RATIOS. IN ADDITION, CNA ALSO UTILIZES RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE, RATE, RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS IN EVALUATING OPERATING TRENDS. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED CHANGE IN AVERAGE PREMIUM ON POLICIES THAT RENEW, INCLUDING RATE AND EXPOSURE CHANGES. RATE REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE CHANGE IN PRICE ON POLICIES THAT RENEW EXCLUDING EXPOSURE CHANGES. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS WITHIN SMALL BUSINESS, WHERE QUANTIFIABLE, RATE INCLUDES THE INFLUENCE OF NEW BUSINESS AS WELL. EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE MEASURE OF RISK USED IN THE PRICING OF THE INSURANCE PRODUCT. RETENTION REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM DOLLARS RENEWED IN COMPARISON TO THE EXPIRING PREMIUM DOLLARS FROM POLICIES AVAILABLE TO RENEW. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE, RATE AND RETENTION PRESENTED FOR THE PRIOR PERIOD ARE UPDATED TO REFLECT SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY ON POLICIES WRITTEN IN THE PERIOD. NEW BUSINESS REPRESENTS PREMIUMS FROM POLICIES WRITTEN WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND ADDITIONAL POLICIES WRITTEN WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS. GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EXCLUDING THIRD PARTY CAPTIVES, EXCLUDES BUSINESS WHICH IS MOSTLY CEDED TO THIRD PARTY CAPTIVES, INCLUDING BUSINESS RELATED TO LARGE WARRANTY PROGRAMS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS OF CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.

PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVES FOR LONG TERM CARE WERE BASED ON THE ACTUARIAL BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS ESTABLISHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AS A RESULT OF A RESERVE UNLOCKING. THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 GPV INDICATED THE CARRIED RESERVES INCLUDED A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY $182 MILLION. THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 GPV INDICATED A PREMIUM DEFICIENCY OF $216 MILLION AND FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES WERE INCREASED ACCORDINGLY. AS A RESULT, THE LONG TERM CARE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVES CARRIED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REPRESENT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS AT THAT DATE WITH NO MARGIN FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION. A SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES IN THE GPV RESULTS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  (IN MILLIONS)  LONG TERM CARE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVE - CHANGE IN ESTIMATED RESERVE MARGIN  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 ESTIMATED MARGIN  $182  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS  (280  )  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING MORBIDITY ASSUMPTIONS  32  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING PERSISTENCY ASSUMPTIONS AND INFORCE POLICY INVENTORY  (234  )  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING PREMIUM RATE ACTION ASSUMPTIONS  58  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING EXPENSE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS  26  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PREMIUM DEFICIENCY  $(216  )  THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS DRIVEN BY LOWER EXPECTED REINVESTMENT RATES, CONTEMPLATING BOTH NEAR-TERM MARKET INDICATIONS AND LONG-TERM NORMATIVE ASSUMPTIONS. THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY WAS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RECOGNITION OF MARGIN IN EARNINGS IN RECENT QUARTERS AND CHANGES IN PERSISTENCY ASSUMPTIONS, PRIMARILY FROM LOWER PROJECTED ACTIVE LIFE MORTALITY RATES. THESE UNFAVORABLE DRIVERS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RATE INCREASES ON ACTIVE RATE INCREASE PROGRAMS, NEW PLANNED RATE INCREASE FILINGS AND FAVORABLE CHANGES TO THE UNDERLYING MORBIDITY AND EXPENSE ASSUMPTIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY, CNA\u2019S PROJECTIONS NO LONGER INDICATE A PATTERN OF EXPECTED PROFITS IN EARLIER FUTURE YEARS FOLLOWED BY EXPECTED LOSSES IN LATER FUTURE YEARS. AS SUCH, CNA WILL NO LONGER ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES FOR PROFITS FOLLOWED BY LOSSES IN PERIODS WHERE THE LONG TERM CARE BUSINESS GENERATES CORE INCOME. THE NEED FOR THESE ADDITIONAL FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES WILL BE  RE-EVALUATED  IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEXT GPV, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE ESTIMATED PRETAX IMPACT ON CNA\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS TO ITS ACTIVE LIFE RESERVE ASSUMPTIONS. THE ANNUAL GPV PROCESS INVOLVES UPDATING ALL ASSUMPTIONS TO THE THEN CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE, AND HISTORICALLY ALL SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN REVISED EACH YEAR. IN THE HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS TABLE BELOW, CNA HAS ASSUMED THAT REVISIONS TO SUCH ASSUMPTIONS WOULD OCCUR IN EACH POLICY TYPE, AGE AND DURATION WITHIN EACH POLICY GROUP AND WOULD OCCUR ABSENT ANY CHANGES, MITIGATING OR OTHERWISE, IN THE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS. ALTHOUGH SUCH HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED OR ANTICIPATED, CNA BELIEVES THEY COULD OCCUR BASED ON PAST VARIANCES IN EXPERIENCE AND ITS EXPECTATIONS OF THE RANGES OF FUTURE EXPERIENCE THAT COULD REASONABLY OCCUR. ANY ACTUAL ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC POLICIES AFFECTED AND, THEREFORE, MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INDUSTRY-WIDE FLOATER UTILIZATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 66% BASED ON INDUSTRY ANALYST REPORTS, WHICH WAS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER BUT AN INCREASE FROM APPROXIMATELY 58% FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER OF 2018. DURING 2019, THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN AVERAGE DAYRATES IN SOME GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS; HOWEVER, DAYRATES REMAIN LOW COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PERIODS, AS THE INCREASE IN OIL PRICES FROM EARLIER LOWS HAS NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DAYRATES AT A SUSTAINED OR CONSISTENT LEVEL. SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS INDICATE THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, UTILIZATION RATES WILL HAVE TO INCREASE TO THE 80%-RANGE BEFORE PRICING POWER SHIFTS TO THE DRILLING CONTRACTOR FROM THE CUSTOMER.  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, THE NUMBER OF CONTRACT TENDERS FOR 2020 AND 2021 FLOATER PROJECT COMMENCEMENTS INCREASED, PRIMARILY FOR WORK IN THE NORTH SEA AND AUSTRALIA MARKETS. PRESENTLY, MANY OF THESE TENDERS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO SINGLE-WELL CONTRACTS, WITH OPTIONS FOR FUTURE WELLS. ALTHOUGH SOME GEOGRAPHIC AREAS APPEAR TO BE IMPROVING, OTHER MARKETS SHOW LITTLE OR NO SIGN OF RECOVERY AT THIS TIME.  FROM A SUPPLY PERSPECTIVE, SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS HAVE REPORTED A THREE RIG DECREASE IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY OF FLOATER RIGS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. HOWEVER, THE OFFSHORE CONTRACT DRILLING MARKET REMAINS OVERSUPPLIED, PROVIDING FOR A CHALLENGING OFFSHORE DRILLING MARKET IN THE NEAR TERM. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, INDUSTRY ANALYSTS REPORT THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 80 STACKED OR UNCONTRACTED FLOATERS AND APPROXIMATELY 30 NEWBUILD FLOATERS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 THROUGH 2022. OF THESE RIGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS REPORT THAT ONLY ONE RIG IS CURRENTLY CONTRACTED FOR FUTURE WORK. IN ADDITION, DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, APPROXIMATELY 70 CONTRACTED FLOATERS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ROLLING OFF THEIR CURRENT CONTRACTS, WHICH WILL FURTHER ADD TO THE OVER-SUPPLY OF FLOATERS.  AS A RESULT OF THESE CHALLENGES, DIAMOND OFFSHORE AND OTHER OFFSHORE DRILLERS ARE CONTINUING TO ACTIVELY SEEK WAYS TO DRIVE EFFICIENCY, REDUCE  NON-PRODUCTIVE  TIME ON RIGS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL INNOVATION TO CUSTOMERS. DIAMOND OFFSHORE ANTICIPATES THAT THESE EFFICIENCIES AND INNOVATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE FASTER DRILLING AND COMPLETION OF WELLS, LEADING TO LOWER OVERALL WELL COSTS TO THE BENEFIT OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG WAS $1.8 BILLION AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 (BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME) AND $2.0 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 (THE DATE REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018). THE CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG BY YEAR AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 IS $0.2 BILLION IN 2019 (FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2019), $0.8 BILLION IN 2020 AND AN AGGREGATE OF $0.8 BILLION IN 2021 THROUGH 2024. CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 EXCLUDES FUTURE GROSS MARGIN COMMITMENTS OF $30 MILLION FOR 2019, APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION FOR 2020 AND AN AGGREGATE $75 MILLION IN 2021 THROUGH 2023, PAYABLE BY A CUSTOMER IN THE FORM OF A GUARANTEE OF GROSS MARGIN TO BE EARNED ON FUTURE CONTRACTS OR BY DIRECT PAYMENT AT THE END OF EACH OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE PERIODS, PURSUANT TO TERMS OF AN EXISTING CONTRACT.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG INCLUDES ONLY FIRM COMMITMENTS (TYPICALLY REPRESENTED BY SIGNED CONTRACTS) AND IS CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE CONTRACTED OPERATING DAYRATE BY THE FIRM CONTRACT PERIOD. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CALCULATION ALSO ASSUMES FULL UTILIZATION OF ITS DRILLING EQUIPMENT FOR THE CONTRACT PERIOD (EXCLUDING SCHEDULED SHIPYARD AND SURVEY DAYS); HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL REVENUE EARNED AND THE ACTUAL PERIODS DURING WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS AND PERIODS STATED ABOVE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING UTILIZATION SUCH AS WEATHER CONDITIONS AND UNSCHEDULED REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG EXCLUDES REVENUES FOR MOBILIZATION, DEMOBILIZATION, CONTRACT PREPARATION AND CUSTOMER REIMBURSABLES. CHANGES IN DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG BETWEEN PERIODS ARE GENERALLY A FUNCTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF WORK ON TERM CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS THE EXTENSION OR MODIFICATION OF EXISTING TERM CONTRACTS AND THE EXECUTION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CUSTOMERS MAY SEEK TO TERMINATE OR RENEGOTIATE ITS CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REPORTED BACKLOG.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR DIAMOND OFFSHORE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 AS PRESENTED IN NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE EARNING DAYS, DUE TO FEWER  NON-PRODUCTIVE  DAYS AND FEWER PLANNED SHIPYARD PROJECTS AND MOBILIZATION OF RIGS. CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE INCREASED $14 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RIG OPERATING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS FOR A RIG WHICH WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOEWS CORPORATION INCREASED $21 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, REFLECTING LOWER MARGINS FROM CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUES, HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES SINCE THE LATTER PART OF 2018 AND A LOSS OF $3 MILLION (AFTER TAX AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) ON THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL CLAIM IN THE 2018 PERIOD.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 2018  CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUE DECREASED $158 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DAILY REVENUE EARNED AND THE EFFECT OF FEWER REVENUE EARNING DAYS. CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE INCREASED $32 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL AMORTIZATION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED CONTRACT PREPARATION AND MOBILIZATION COSTS AND INCREASED RIG OPERATING COSTS FOR THE CURRENT FLEET. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED COSTS FOR THE RIG THAT WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND LOWER FUEL COSTS FOR THE CURRENT FLEET.  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOEWS CORPORATION INCREASED $83 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, REFLECTING LOWER MARGINS FROM CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUES, HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE COMPLETION OF SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS IN 2019 AND A LOWER TAX BENEFIT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL CLAIM IN THE 2018 PERIOD AND THE ABSENCE OF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN THE 2018 PERIOD.  BOARDWALK PIPELINES  FIRM AGREEMENTS  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE CAPACITY IS CONTRACTED FOR UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS. FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 88% OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 REVENUES, EXCLUDING RETAINED FUEL, WERE DERIVED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS. BOARDWALK PIPELINES EXPECTS TO EARN REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $10.3 BILLION FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE AND OTHER SERVICES, OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THOSE AGREEMENTS. THIS AMOUNT HAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION FROM THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, FROM CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO DURING 2019. FOR BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CHARGED MAXIMUM TARIFF RATES RELATED TO ITS FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION REGULATED OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, THE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS REFLECT THE CURRENT TARIFF RATE FOR SUCH SERVICES FOR THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENTS, HOWEVER, THE TARIFF RATES MAY BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENT. THE ESTIMATED REVENUES FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE ESTIMATED REVENUES THAT ARE ANTICIPATED UNDER EXECUTED PRECEDENT TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REVENUES BOARDWALK PIPELINES HAS RECOGNIZED AND MAY RECOGNIZE UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS BASED ON ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THE CONTRACTED PIPELINE OR STORAGE CAPACITY, ANY EXPECTED REVENUES FOR PERIODS AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATES OF THE EXISTING AGREEMENTS OR EXECUTION OF PRECEDENT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH PROJECTS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED OR WILL OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  CONTRACT RENEWALS  EACH YEAR A PORTION OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 FIRM TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE AGREEMENTS EXPIRE. DEMAND FOR FIRM SERVICE IS PRIMARILY BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH CAN VARY ACROSS BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 PIPELINE SYSTEMS. THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN FIRM RESERVATION FEES UNDER CONTRACT REFLECTS THE OVERALL MARKET TRENDS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT FROM BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 GROWTH PROJECTS. BOARDWALK PIPELINES FOCUSES ITS MARKETING EFFORTS ON ENHANCING THE VALUE OF THE CAPACITY THAT IS UP FOR RENEWAL AND WORKS WITH CUSTOMERS TO MATCH GAS SUPPLIES FROM VARIOUS BASINS TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING AGGREGATING SUPPLIES AT KEY LOCATIONS ALONG ITS PIPELINES TO PROVIDE  END-USE  CUSTOMERS WITH ATTRACTIVE AND DIVERSE SUPPLY OPTIONS. IF THE MARKET PERCEIVES THE VALUE OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 AVAILABLE CAPACITY TO BE LOWER THAN ITS LONG-TERM VIEW OF THE CAPACITY, BOARDWALK PIPELINES MAY SEEK TO SHORTEN CONTRACT TERMS UNTIL MARKET PERCEPTION IMPROVES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOARDWALK PIPELINES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 AS PRESENTED IN NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

OTHER REVENUES INCREASED $27 MILLION AND $36 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S OPERATIONS OF $35 MILLION AND $43 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN 2019. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PASS-THROUGH EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESIN PRICES. CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S CONTRACTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR RESIN PRICE CHANGES TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS ON A SHORT-TERM LAG, GENERALLY ABOUT ONE MONTH. WHEN A PASS-THROUGH OCCURS, REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY CHANGE BY THE SAME AMOUNT SO THAT CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S GROSS MARGIN RETURNS TO THE SAME LEVEL AS PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN PRICES.  OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES INCREASED $20 MILLION AND $26 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S EXPENSES OF $35 MILLION AND $44 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN 2019 AND OPERATING PERSONNEL EXPENSES AT CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CORPORATE OVERHEAD EXPENSES. INTEREST EXPENSES INCREASED $4 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDING CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S 2019 ACQUISITIONS.  NET RESULTS IMPROVED $26 MILLION AND $80 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  PARENT COMPANY  PARENT COMPANY CASH AND INVESTMENTS, NET OF RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, TOTALED $3.5 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $3.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECEIVED $817 MILLION IN DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING A SPECIAL DIVIDEND FROM CNA OF $485 MILLION. CASH INFLOWS ALSO INCLUDED $183 MILLION FROM LOEWS HOTELS & CO. CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDED THE PAYMENT OF $643 MILLION TO FUND TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES AND $57 MILLION OF CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. AS A HOLDING COMPANY WE DEPEND ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE AN  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) REGISTERING THE FUTURE SALE OF AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

FUTURE USES OF OUR CASH MAY INCLUDE INVESTING IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES, NEW ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDENDS AND/OR REPURCHASES OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS NEEDS.  SUBSIDIARIES  CNA\u2019S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $980 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH $868 MILLION FOR THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS COLLECTED AND LOWER INCOME TAXES PAID. CNA BELIEVES THAT ITS PRESENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS CURRENT AND EXPECTED WORKING CAPITAL AND DEBT OBLIGATION NEEDS.  CNA DECLARED AND PAID DIVIDENDS OF $3.05 PER SHARE ON ITS COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING A SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $2.00 PER SHARE, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. ON OCTOBER 25, 2019, CNA\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY DIVIDEND OF $0.35 PER SHARE ON ITS COMMON STOCK, PAYABLE DECEMBER 2, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON NOVEMBER 11, 2019. CNA\u2019S DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CNA\u2019S EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS NEEDS AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS.  CNA HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT, EQUITY OR HYBRID SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME.  DIVIDENDS FROM THE CONTINENTAL CASUALTY COMPANY (\u201cCCC\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF CNA, ARE SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, THE DOMICILIARY STATE OF CCC. UNDER THESE LAWS, ORDINARY DIVIDENDS, OR DIVIDENDS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (\u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d), ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE GREATER OF THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S STATUTORY NET INCOME OR 10% OF STATUTORY SURPLUS AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, ORDINARY DIVIDENDS MAY ONLY BE PAID FROM EARNED SURPLUS, WHICH IS CALCULATED BY REMOVING UNREALIZED GAINS FROM UNASSIGNED SURPLUS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CCC WAS IN A POSITIVE EARNED SURPLUS POSITION. THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DIVIDEND CCC COULD PAY DURING 2019 THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE DEPARTMENT\u2019S PRIOR APPROVAL IS APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION, LESS DIVIDENDS PAID DURING THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS MEASURED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. CCC PAID DIVIDENDS OF $116 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND $940 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CCC IS ABLE TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $327 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN ANY YEAR IS DETERMINED AFTER AN ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE DIVIDEND CAPACITY, HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY AND CASH NEEDS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT THE DIVIDENDS WILL HAVE ON THE STATUTORY SURPLUS OF THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE COMPANY.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DECREASED $203 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD, DUE TO LOWER CASH COLLECTED FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES AND HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, NET OF REFUNDS, PRIMARILY IN DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. INCREMENTAL CASH USED FOR OPERATIONS DURING THE 2019 PERIOD WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE IN CASH EXPENDITURES RELATED TO CONTRACT DRILLING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION TO $130 MILLION FOR A TOTAL SPEND OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION TO $380 MILLION IN 2019. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 INCLUDE SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS UNDER ITS CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UPGRADES FOR THE  OCEAN BLACKHAWK  ,  OCEAN BLACKHORNET  AND  OCEAN COURAGE  AND OTHER LARGE SHIPYARD PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, OTHER SPECIFIC PROJECTS FOR 2019 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION IN CAPITALIZED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REACTIVATION AND UPGRADE OF THE  OCEAN ONYX  AND APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE REACTIVATION OF THE  OCEAN ENDEAVOR.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAS NO SIGNIFICANT PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE RELATED TO ITS DIRECT RIG OPERATIONS, WHICH ARISE DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF OCTOBER 25, 2019, DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAD $1.2 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER ITS CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2019, S&P GLOBAL RATINGS (\u201cS&P\u201d) DOWNGRADED DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CORPORATE AND SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES CREDIT RATINGS TO CCC+ FROM B. THE RATING OUTLOOK FROM S&P CHANGED TO STABLE FROM NEGATIVE. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CURRENT CORPORATE CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (\u201cMOODY\u2019S\u201d) IS B2 AND ITS CURRENT SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY\u2019S IS B3. THE RATING OUTLOOK FROM MOODY\u2019S IS NEGATIVE. THESE CREDIT RATINGS ARE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND COULD RAISE DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S COST OF FINANCING. CONSEQUENTLY, DIAMOND OFFSHORE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL DEBT IN AMOUNTS AND/OR WITH TERMS THAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE REASONABLE. THESE RATINGS COULD LIMIT DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S ABILITY TO PURSUE OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE WILL MAKE PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS OF ITS CAPITAL SPENDING PROGRAMS BASED ON INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IF IT DETERMINES THEY ARE REQUIRED. DIAMOND OFFSHORE, MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, TO FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THE ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT, EQUITY OR HYBRID SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS BY ISSUING DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT RATINGS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND ITS CONTROL AT THE TIME DIAMOND OFFSHORE SEEKS SUCH ACCESS.  BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $81 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN NET INCOME AND THE TIMING OF RECEIVABLES.

BOARDWALK PIPELINES MAY SEEK TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS TO FUND SOME OR ALL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR GROWTH PROJECTS, ACQUISITIONS OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. BOARDWALK PIPELINES HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES, WARRANTS OR RIGHTS FROM TIME TO TIME.

THE PARENT COMPANY PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING SHORT SALES AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS GENERALLY PRESENT GREATER VOLATILITY, LESS LIQUIDITY AND GREATER RISK THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED WITHIN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CORPORATE.  WE ENTER INTO SHORT SALES AND INVEST IN CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED FOR ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, INCOME ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND TO BENEFIT FROM ANTICIPATED FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN THE UNDERLYING MARKETS. IF SUCH MOVEMENTS DO NOT OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THEN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES MAY OCCUR.

WE MITIGATE THE RISK OF  NON-PERFORMANCE  BY MONITORING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF COUNTERPARTIES AND DIVERSIFYING DERIVATIVES BY USING MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTIES. WE OCCASIONALLY REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM OUR DERIVATIVE INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE EXPOSURE AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY.

CNA\u2019S VIEWS ON THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, TAX REGULATIONS, ASSET CLASS VALUATIONS, SPECIFIC SECURITY ISSUER AND BROADER INDUSTRY SEGMENT CONDITIONS AS WELL AS DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT ENTER INTO AN INVESTMENT DECISION. CNA ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORS EXPOSURE TO ISSUERS OF SECURITIES HELD AND BROADER INDUSTRY SECTOR EXPOSURES AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST SUCH EXPOSURES BASED ON ITS VIEWS OF A SPECIFIC ISSUER OR INDUSTRY SECTOR.  A FURTHER CONSIDERATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CNA\u2019S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES AND THE ABILITY TO ALIGN THE DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO TO THOSE LIABILITIES AND TO MEET FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS, MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF INCOME SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE LIABILITIES. FOR PORTFOLIOS WHERE FUTURE LIABILITY CASH FLOWS ARE DETERMINABLE AND TYPICALLY LONG TERM IN NATURE, CNA SEGREGATES INVESTMENTS FOR ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE SEGREGATED INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE LONG TERM CARE AND STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT LIABILITIES IN OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ACCURATE, NON-INVASIVE, PATIENT-FRIENDLY SCREENING TEST CALLED COLOGUARD\u00ae FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR OTHER TYPES OF CANCER, WITH THE GOAL OF BECOMING A LEADER IN CANCER SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTICS.  \u200b  ON JULY 28, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH GENOMIC HEALTH, INC. (\u201cGENOMIC HEALTH\u201d), UNDER WHICH WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE GENOMIC HEALTH IN A CASH AND STOCK TRANSACTION VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION. GENOMIC HEALTH IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF GENOMIC-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT HELP OPTIMIZE CANCER CARE. FOLLOWING THE MERGER WITH GENOMIC HEALTH, WE WOULD BE THE PROVIDER OF TWO OF THE STRONGEST BRANDS IN CANCER DIAGNOSTICS, COLOGUARD AND ONCOTYPE DX\u00ae, PROVIDING A ROBUST PLATFORM FOR CONTINUED GROWTH. REFER TO NOTE 12 IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  \u200b  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2019, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF GENOMIC HEALTH\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE AGGREGATE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION. THE MERGER WILL BE FINANCED IN PART BY THE USE OF OUR CASH ON HAND AND IN PART BY THE USE OF GENOMIC HEALTH\u2019S CASH ON HAND.  \u200b  OUR COLOGUARD TEST  \u200b  COLORECTAL CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN THE U.S. AND THE LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN THE U.S. AMONG NON-SMOKERS. EACH YEAR IN THE U.S. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY.  \u200b  \u25cf  146,000 NEW CASES OF COLORECTAL CANCER  \u25cf  51,000 DEATHS FROM COLORECTAL CANCER  \u200b  IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT COLORECTAL CANCER IS AMONG THE MOST PREVENTABLE, YET LEAST PREVENTED CANCERS. COLORECTAL CANCER CAN TAKE UP TO 10-15 YEARS TO PROGRESS FROM A PRE-CANCEROUS LESION TO METASTATIC CANCER AND DEATH. PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED EARLY IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE\u2014WITH PRE-CANCEROUS LESIONS OR POLYPS OR EARLY-STAGE CANCER\u2014ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A COMPLETE RECOVERY AND TO BE TREATED LESS EXPENSIVELY. OF THE 106 MILLION AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 85 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE-RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER, AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT ARE NOT UP-TO-DATE WITH SCREENING ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cACS\u201d) COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING GUIDELINES. INTERNAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEARLY 50% OF SURVEYED COLOGUARD USERS WERE PREVIOUSLY UNSCREENED FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. POOR COMPLIANCE WITH SCREENING GUIDELINES HAS MEANT THAT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES ARE MADE IN THE DISEASE\u2019S LATE STAGES. THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES FOR STAGES 3 AND 4 ARE 71 PERCENT AND 14 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO A 90 PERCENT SURVIVAL RATE IF THE DISEASE IS DIAGNOSED EARLIER IN STAGE 1. WE BELIEVE THE LARGE UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF UNSCREENED AND INADEQUATELY SCREENED PATIENTS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR A PATIENT-FRIENDLY SCREENING TEST.  \u200b  OUR COLOGUARD TEST IS A NON-INVASIVE STOOL-BASED DNA (\u201cSDNA\u201d) SCREENING TEST THAT UTILIZES A MULTI-TARGET APPROACH TO DETECT DNA AND HEMOGLOBIN BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. ELEVEN BIOMARKERS ARE TARGETED THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. METHYLATION, MUTATION, AND HEMOGLOBIN RESULTS ARE COMBINED IN THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS THROUGH AN ALGORITHM TO PROVIDE A SINGLE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REPORTABLE RESULT.  \u200b  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MUTATIONS, ALTER GENE EXPRESSION AND OTHER MECHANISMS FOR CELL CYCLE REGULATION AND DIFFERENTIATION. AS A RESULT, THE AFFECTED CELLS CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE, OFTEN RESULTING IN MALIGNANCIES ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. HEMOGLOBIN IS THE PROTEIN COMPLEX RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING OXYGEN IN RED BLOOD CELLS. DURING THE PROGRESSION OF CANCER, THE PROBABILITY OF BLEEDING INTO THE COLON INCREASES. THE PRESENCE OF HEMOGLOBIN, RELEASED FROM RED BLOOD CELLS, CAN BE DETECTED IN THE STOOL. USING SDNA, COLOGUARD PURIFIES, AMPLIFIES AND DETECTS INCREASED LEVELS OF METHYLATION, AND PRESENCE OF MUTATIONS, IN SPECIFIC GENES. BY COMBINING THESE DNA INDICATORS WITH A TEST FOR HEMOGLOBIN, COLOGUARD PRODUCES A MULTI-MARKER RESULT EFFECTIVE FOR THE DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCEROUS ADENOMAS.  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2014, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) GRANTED PREMARKET APPROVAL (\u201cPMA\u201d) TO COLOGUARD FOR USE AS A COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING TEST IN ADULTS 50 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER WHO ARE AT A TYPICAL AVERAGE-RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. UPON APPROVAL, COLOGUARD BECAME THE FIRST AND ONLY FDA-APPROVED SDNA NON-INVASIVE COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING TEST. IN SEPTEMBER 2019, THE FDA EXPANDED COLOGUARD\u2019S INDICATION TO INCLUDE AVERAGE-RISK INDIVIDUALS AGES 45-49. COLOGUARD IS NOW INDICATED FOR AVERAGE RISK ADULTS 45 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER.  \u200b  OUR ORIGINAL PMA SUBMISSION TO THE FDA FOR COLOGUARD INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF OUR PIVOTAL DEEP-C CLINICAL TRIAL THAT HAD OVER 10,000 PATIENTS ENROLLED AT 90 SITES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE RESULTS OF OUR DEEP-C CLINICAL TRIAL FOR COLOGUARD WERE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IN APRIL 2014. THE PEER-REVIEWED STUDY, \u201cMULTI-TARGET STOOL DNA TESTING FOR COLORECTAL-CANCER SCREENING,\u201d HIGHLIGHTED THE PERFORMANCE OF COLOGUARD IN THE TRIAL POPULATION.  \u200b  \u25cf  CANCER SENSITIVITY: 92%  \u25cf  STAGE I AND II CANCER SENSITIVITY: 94%  \u25cf  HIGH-GRADE DYSPLASIA SENSITIVITY: 69%  \u25cf  SPECIFICITY: 87%  \u200b  WE BELIEVE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF SDNA SCREENING PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE 106 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 85 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. AT A THREE-YEAR SCREENING INTERVAL AND AN AVERAGE REVENUE PER TEST OF $500 THIS REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL $18 BILLION MARKET FOR COLOGUARD, OF WHICH OUR CURRENT SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY 5.2 PERCENT.  \u200b  OUR CLINICAL LABORATORY AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES  \u200b  AS PART OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGY, WE ESTABLISHED A STATE-OF-THE-ART, HIGHLY AUTOMATED LAB FACILITY THAT IS CERTIFIED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS REQUIREMENTS TO PROCESS COLOGUARD TESTS AND PROVIDE PATIENT RESULTS. OUR INITIAL CLINICAL LAB OPERATION IS HOUSED IN A 55,000 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. AT THIS LAB, WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION TESTS PER YEAR.  \u200b  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN OPERATIONS AT A SECOND CLINICAL LAB FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. OUR TOTAL LAB CAPACITY AT BOTH FACILITIES IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION TESTS PER YEAR, WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO OUR NEW FACILITY, IF NEEDED.  \u200b  WE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURE OUR COLOGUARD TEST KIT IN A FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. AS WE EXPAND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF COLOGUARD, WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXPAND OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING AN ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY FOR WHICH WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FDA APPROVAL FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN 2020. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MANUFACTURING AND PROVIDING MEDICAL DEVICES AND RELATED PRODUCTS THAT MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE ADHERE TO MANUFACTURING AND SAFETY STANDARDS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OPERATE OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES UNDER A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE PURCHASE CERTAIN COMPONENTS FOR OUR COLOGUARD TEST FROM THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS.  \u200b  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOW WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  \u200b  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERY OF A TEST RESULT TO AN ORDERING PHYSICIAN FOR TESTS PERFORMED. THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COLLECT AT THE TIME DELIVERY IS COMPLETE. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE WE RECOGNIZE IS BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED BILLING RATES LESS CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH YIELDS THE CONSTRAINED AMOUNT THAT WE EXPECT TO ULTIMATELY COLLECT. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO ULTIMATELY COLLECT ON A PER-PAYER OR PER-AGREEMENT BASIS, USING HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS, ESTABLISHED REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE AGREED ON A REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT WITH A PAYER, THE EXPECTED AMOUNT IS TYPICALLY LOWER, DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF ANY PATIENT CO-PAYMENTS, THE EXISTENCE OF SECONDARY PAYERS AND CLAIM DENIALS. UPON ULTIMATE COLLECTION, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT RECEIVED FROM PAYERS AND PATIENTS WHERE REIMBURSEMENT WAS ESTIMATED IS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS COLLECTION ESTIMATES AND, IF NECESSARY, THE CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED.  FINALLY, SHOULD WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM CLAIMS ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS AND LATER DETERMINE THE JUDGMENTS UNDERLYING ESTIMATED COLLECTIONS CHANGE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN FUTURE QUARTERS. HISTORICALLY, A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED UPON CASH RECEIPT, BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED FROM CERTAIN PAYERS. EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED FROM ALL PAYERS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PATIENT COST-SHARE COLLECTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR ALL BILLED CLAIMS AT THE TIME THE TEST RESULTS ARE DELIVERED TO THE ORDERING PROVIDER.  \u200b  OUR AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT PER COLOGUARD TEST, AS FURTHER DEFINED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $481 AND $470 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS CUMULATIVE AVERAGE COLOGUARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WILL CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS MEDICAL COVERAGE DECISIONS BY PAYERS, CHANGES IN THE PAYER MIX, THE EFFECTS OF CONTRACTS SIGNED WITH PAYERS, NON-RENEWAL OR TERMINATION OF PAYER CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN ALLOWED AMOUNTS BY PAYERS, OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY WIN APPEALS FOR PAYMENT, SETTLEMENTS REACHED WITH PAYERS REGARDING PREVIOUSLY DENIED CLAIMS AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT CASH PAYMENTS FROM PAYERS AND INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. HISTORICAL AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT.  \u200b  WE CALCULATE THE AVERAGE COLOGUARD REIMBURSEMENT PER TEST ON A TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH BASIS FOR ALL TESTS THAT ARE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OLD, SINCE IT CAN TAKE THAT LONG, OR IN SOME CASES LONGER, TO COLLECT FROM SOME PAYERS AND PATIENTS. THUS, THE AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT PER TEST AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS THE TOTAL CASH COLLECTED THROUGH SUCH DATES FOR TESTS PERFORMED DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF TESTS PERFORMED DURING THOSE SAME PERIODS.  \u200b  2019 PRIORITIES  \u200b  OUR TOP PRIORITIES FOR 2019 ARE TO (1) POWER OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH PFIZER, (2) ENHANCE COLOGUARD THROUGH LABEL EXPANSION AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS, AND (3) ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY.  \u200b  POWER THE PARTNERSHIP  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A PROMOTION AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROMOTION AGREEMENT, PFIZER AGREED TO PROMOTE COLOGUARD AND PROVIDE CERTAIN OTHER SALES AND MARKETING SERVICES. WE AND PFIZER COMMITTED IN THE PROMOTION AGREEMENT TO INVEST SPECIFIED AMOUNTS IN THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF COLOGUARD. PFIZER HAS A LARGE PRIMARY CARE SALES TEAM THAT HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS AND ENHANCES OUR PHYSICIAN AND CONSUMER MARKETING CAPABILITIES. A PRIORITY FOR 2019 IS EXECUTING ON THE PFIZER PARTNERSHIP IN ORDER TO GROW THE COLOGUARD BRAND AND GET MORE PATIENTS SCREENED.  \u200b  ENHANCE COLOGUARD  \u200b  IN MAY 2018, THE ACS UPDATED ITS GUIDELINES TO RECOMMEND COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING BEGIN AT AGE 45, RATHER THAN 50, FOR PEOPLE AT AVERAGE RISK OF THE DISEASE, DUE TO THE RISING INCIDENCE RATE WITHIN THE 45-49 YEAR-OLD POPULATION.  THERE ARE NEARLY 21 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45-49, AND WE ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY 19 MILLION OF THEM ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER AND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SCREENING UNDER THE ACS GUIDELINES. IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA APPROVAL TO EXPAND COLOGUARD\u2019S INDICATION TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 49 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  IN ADDITION, WE ARE SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE UPON COLOGUARD\u2019S PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE EVALUATING WHETHER NEW BIOMARKERS AND IMPROVED LABORATORY PROCESSES WOULD INCREASE SPECIFICITY WHILE MAINTAINING SENSITIVITY. IF WE COULD INCREASE THE SPECIFICITY OF COLOGUARD, WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD ENHANCE ITS ADOPTION AS A FRONT-LINE SCREENING TEST. WE ARE ALSO EVALUATING WAYS THAT WE MIGHT MAKE COLOGUARD EVEN EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO USE AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER THE COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR COLOGUARD.  \u200b  THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH ENHANCEMENTS TO COLOGUARD IS UNKNOWN AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FDA APPROVAL.  \u200b  ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY  \u200b  WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON BUILDING A PIPELINE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH A FOCUS ON BLOOD OR OTHER FLUID-BASED (\u201cLIQUID BIOPSY\u201d) TESTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY THROUGH BIOMARKER DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION IN TISSUE, BLOOD, OR OTHER FLUIDS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PROPRIETARY BIOMARKERS FOR SEVERAL CANCERS, INCLUDING LIVER CANCER AND PANCREATIC CANCER. THROUGH OUR COLLABORATION WITH MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED VALIDATION STUDIES ON TISSUE SAMPLES FOR THIRTEEN CANCERS AND ON BLOOD OR OTHER FLUID SAMPLES FOR NINE CANCERS.  \u200b  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u200b  WE HAVE GENERATED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION AND, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR THE NEAR FUTURE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE WE MAY NEVER ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.  \u200b  REVENUE.  OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY PERFORMING SCREENING SERVICES USING OUR COLOGUARD TEST. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE COMPLETED APPROXIMATELY 456,000 AND 241,000 COLOGUARD TESTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND GENERATED REVENUE OF $218.8 MILLION AND $118.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE COMPLETED APPROXIMATELY 1.2 MILLION AND 0.6 MILLION COLOGUARD TESTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND GENERATED REVENUE OF $580.7 MILLION AND $311.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPLETED COLOGUARD TESTS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SELLING AND MARKETING EFFORTS.  \u200b  OUR COST STRUCTURE.  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NON-RESEARCH PERSONNEL SALARIES, OFFICE EXPENSES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  \u200b  COST OF SALES INCLUDES COSTS RELATED TO INVENTORY PRODUCTION AND USAGE, SHIPMENT OF TEST COLLECTION KITS, ROYALTIES AND THE COST OF SERVICES TO PROCESS TESTS AND PROVIDE RESULTS TO PHYSICIANS. WE INCUR EXPENSES FOR TESTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTIVITIES OCCUR, THEREFORE, GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE MAY VARY DUE TO COSTS BEING INCURRED IN ONE PERIOD THAT RELATE TO REVENUES RECOGNIZED IN A LATER PERIOD.  \u200b  WE EXPECT THAT GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE AND BE AFFECTED BY COLOGUARD TEST VOLUME, OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, PATIENT COMPLIANCE RATES, PAYER MIX, THE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT, AND PAYMENT PATTERNS OF PAYERS AND PATIENTS.  \u200b  COST OF SALES.  COST OF SALES INCREASED TO $52.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $30.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. COST OF SALES INCREASED TO $147.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $79.8 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.

WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2019, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF GENOMIC HEALTH\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CASH OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE AGGREGATE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION.  \u200b  WE EXPECT THAT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMBINED WITH CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES RECEIVED AS PART OF THE GENOMIC HEALTH ACQUISITION, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO BE PAID IN CONNECTION WITH THE GENOMIC HEALTH ACQUISITION AS WELL AS OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, BASED ON CURRENT OPERATING PLANS. HOWEVER, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL TO FULLY FUND OUR CURRENT STRATEGIC PLAN, WHICH INCLUDES SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZING COLOGUARD AND DEVELOPING A PIPELINE OF FUTURE PRODUCTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS TO ACQUIRE OTHER BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR TECHNOLOGIES AS PART OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO ENABLE US TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF SUCH PLAN, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR PLAN AND OTHERWISE SCALE BACK OUR OPERATIONS. EVEN IF WE SUCCESSFULLY RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE CANNOT ASSURE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL EVER GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO BECOME PROFITABLE.  \u200b  A TABLE REFLECTING CERTAIN OF OUR SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS PROVIDED IN THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION OF OUR 2018 FORM 10-K AND UPDATED INFORMATION CONCERNING OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NOTES WAS INCLUDED IN THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION OF OUR SUBSEQUENTLY FILED QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2019.

THE 2025 NOTES WERE PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM CONVERTIBLE NOTES, NET ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BEFORE BEING RECLASSIFIED TO CONVERTIBLE NOTES, NET, CURRENT PORTION ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. SEE NOTE 11 OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR FURTHER DETAILS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THIS ITEM, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS IN THE SPECIFIED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  \u200b  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \u200b  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, TAX POSITIONS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS ARE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u200b  REVENUE RECOGNITION  \u200b  REVENUE.  OUR REVENUE IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY PERFORMING SCREENING SERVICES USING OUR COLOGUARD TEST, AND THE SERVICE IS COMPLETED UPON DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN. WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u201d), WHICH WE ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2018, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH WE ELECTED TO APPLY TO ALL CONTRACTS.  APPLICATION OF THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD DID NOT IMPACT AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY US, NOR DID IT REQUIRE A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT UPON ADOPTION, AS OUR METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER ASC 606 WAS ANALOGOUS TO THE METHOD UTILIZED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ADOPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EACH FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM WAS AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD AND AN EXPLANATION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.  THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM OUR COLOGUARD TEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT CORE PRINCIPLE, AND KEY ASPECTS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u200b  CONTRACTS  \u200b  OUR CUSTOMER IS THE PATIENT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ENTER INTO A FORMAL REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT, AS FORMAL REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING A NATIONAL COVERAGE DETERMINATION FOR COLOGUARD BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (\u201cCMS\u201d), ARE ESTABLISHED WITH PAYERS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE ESTABLISH A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER CUSTOMARY BUSINESS PRACTICES.  \u200b  \u25cf  APPROVAL OF A CONTRACT IS ESTABLISHED VIA THE ORDER SUBMITTED BY THE PATIENT\u2019S PHYSICIAN AND THE RETURN OF A SAMPLE BY THE PATIENT.  \u25cf  WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM OUR LABORATORY SERVICES UPON RECEIPT OF A SAMPLE FROM A PATIENT, AND THE PATIENT AND/OR APPLICABLE PAYER ARE OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US FOR SERVICES RENDERED BASED ON THE PATIENT\u2019S INSURANCE BENEFITS.  \u25cf  PAYMENT TERMS ARE A FUNCTION OF A PATIENT\u2019S EXISTING INSURANCE BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS WITH CMS AND APPLICABLE REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN US AND PAYERS, UNLESS THE PATIENT IS A SELF-PAY PATIENT, WHEREBY WE REQUIRE PAYMENT FROM THE PATIENT PRIOR TO US SHIPPING A COLLECTION KIT TO THE PATIENT.  \u25cf  ONCE WE DELIVER A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, WE ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO COLLECT PAYMENT AND BILL AN INSURER AND/OR PATIENT AND DEPENDING ON PAYER CONTRACT STATUS OR PATIENT INSURANCE BENEFIT STATUS.  \u25cf  OUR CONSIDERATION IS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE, AND WE CONSIDER COLLECTION OF SUCH CONSIDERATION TO BE PROBABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS UNCONSTRAINED.  \u200b  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  \u200b  A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE (OR A BUNDLE OF GOODS OR SERVICES) TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, WHICH IS SATISFIED UPON RENDERING OF SERVICES, WHICH CULMINATES IN THE DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S COLOGUARD TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN.  THE DURATION OF TIME BETWEEN SAMPLE RECEIPT AND DELIVERY OF A VALID TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ELECT THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND THEREFORE, WE DO NOT DISCLOSE THE VALUE OF UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  \u200b  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTION PRICE  \u200b  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO COLLECT IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER, EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES (FOR EXAMPLE, SOME SALES TAXES). THE CONSIDERATION EXPECTED FROM A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER MAY INCLUDE FIXED AMOUNTS, VARIABLE AMOUNTS, OR BOTH.  \u200b  THE CONSIDERATION DERIVED FROM OUR CONTRACTS IS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE, THOUGH THE VARIABILITY IS NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN ANY CONTRACT. RATHER, THE IMPLIED VARIABILITY IS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, ANY PATIENT CO-PAYMENTS, DEDUCTIBLES OR ADHERENCE INCENTIVES, THE EXISTENCE OF SECONDARY PAYERS AND CLAIM DENIALS.  \u200b  WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD, WHICH REPRESENTS THE SUM OF PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED AMOUNTS IN A RANGE OF POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION AMOUNTS. WHEN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS EXPERIENCE, PATIENT INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS.  \u200b  WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE UNCONSTRAINED PORTION OF SUCH CONSIDERATION.  IN OTHER WORDS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UP TO THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL UNTIL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED OR THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OR REFUNDS IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, INCLUDING FINAL SETTLEMENTS, REPRESENT CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH REVISIONS ARE MADE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICES WAS $1.2 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICES WAS $4.6 MILLION AND $14.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  WE MONITOR OUR ESTIMATES OF TRANSACTION PRICE TO DEPICT CONDITIONS THAT EXIST AT EACH REPORTING DATE. IF WE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINE THAT WE WILL COLLECT MORE CONSIDERATION THAN WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT, WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE AS AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (I.E., AN UPWARD REVENUE ADJUSTMENT) IN THE PERIOD IDENTIFIED. SIMILARLY, IF WE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINE THAT THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO COLLECT FROM A PATIENT IS LESS THAN WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE WILL GENERALLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE AS A DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (I.E., A DOWNWARD REVENUE ADJUSTMENT), PROVIDED THAT SUCH DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED.  \u200b  WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR THAT EXPERIENCE HAS LIMITED PREDICTIVE VALUE, THE CONSTRAINT OVER ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION MAY RESULT IN NO REVENUE BEING RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S COLOGUARD TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, WITH RECOGNITION GENERALLY OCCURRING AT THE DATE OF CASH RECEIPT.  \u200b  ALLOCATE TRANSACTION PRICE  \u200b  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONTAINED IN A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT.  \u200b  POINT IN TIME RECOGNITION  \u200b  OUR SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME, AND THAT POINT IN TIME IS DEFINED AS THE DATE A PATIENT\u2019S SUCCESSFUL TEST RESULT IS DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT\u2019S ORDERING PHYSICIAN. WE CONSIDER THIS DATE TO BE THE TIME AT WHICH THE PATIENT OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PROMISED COLOGUARD TEST SERVICE.  \u200b  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE  \u200b  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES DISAGGREGATED BY REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  MEDICARE PARTS B & C  \u200b  $108,617  \u200b  $65,870  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  \u200b  99,352  \u200b  \u200b  48,624  OTHER  \u200b  \u200b  10,836  \u200b  \u200b  3,797  TOTAL  \u200b  $218,805  \u200b  $118,291  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  MEDICARE PARTS B & C  \u200b  $295,103  \u200b  $178,052  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  \u200b  261,521  \u200b  \u200b  123,045  OTHER  \u200b  \u200b  24,094  \u200b  \u200b  10,384  TOTAL  \u200b  $580,718  \u200b  $311,481  \u200b  CONTRACT BALANCES  \u200b  THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BILLINGS AND CASH COLLECTIONS RESULTS IN BILLED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, BILLING OCCURS SUBSEQUENT TO DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, RESULTING IN AN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE. HOWEVER, WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE ADVANCE PAYMENT FROM A PATIENT, PARTICULARLY A SELF-PAY PATIENT, BEFORE A COLOGUARD TEST RESULT IS COMPLETED, RESULTING IN DEFERRED REVENUE. THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE IS RELIEVED UPON DELIVERY OF THE APPLICABLE PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE WERE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY ANY OTHER FACTORS.  \u200b  DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND WERE $0.7 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PERIOD WAS $0.2 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PERIOD, WAS $0.5 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS  \u200b  WE DO NOT ADJUST THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT, AS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WE EXPECT THE COLLECTION CYCLE TO BE ONE YEAR OR LESS.  \u200b  WE EXPENSE SALES COMMISSIONS WHEN INCURRED BECAUSE THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE YEAR OR LESS.  THESE COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  WE INCUR CERTAIN OTHER COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CONTRACT IS OBTAINED. SUCH COSTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEGAL SERVICES AND PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS (E.G. COMPLIANCE REMINDER LETTERS).  THESE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND RECORDED WITHIN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY IS STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET VALUE (NET REALIZABLE VALUE). WE DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORY USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST OUT METHOD (\u201cFIFO\u201d). WE ESTIMATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORY BY REFERENCE TO INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMANDS AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, INCLUDING EXPIRATION. WE PERIODICALLY ANALYZE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO IDENTIFY INVENTORY THAT MAY EXPIRE PRIOR TO EXPECTED SALE OR HAS A COST BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES FOR SUCH INVENTORY, AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING WHICH WE PERFORM THROUGHOUT THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IF CERTAIN BATCHES OR UNITS OF PRODUCT NO LONGER MEET QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS OR BECOME OBSOLETE DUE TO EXPIRATION, WE RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES TO WRITE DOWN SUCH UNMARKETABLE INVENTORY TO ITS ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE.  \u200b  DIRECT AND INDIRECT MANUFACTURING COSTS INCURRED DURING PROCESS VALIDATION AND FOR OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BE SOLD, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ALL STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARDS AND SHARES PURCHASED UNDER AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (\u201cESPP\u201d) (IF CERTAIN PARAMETERS ARE NOT MET), ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF MARKET MEASURE-BASED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS ARE CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND ESPP SHARES.  \u200b  \u25cf  VALUATION AND RECOGNITION  \u2014 THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF SERVICE-BASED AWARDS FOR EACH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THAT DAY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED TO EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR AWARDS ISSUED TO NON-EMPLOYEES, THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE WHEN THE PERFORMANCE IS COMPLETE OR WHEN THE AWARD VESTS, WHICHEVER IS THE EARLIEST. ACCORDINGLY, NON-EMPLOYEE AWARDS ARE RE-MEASURED AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD UNTIL THE FINAL MEASUREMENT DATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD IS RECOGNIZED AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD. THE BLACK-SCHOLES AND MONTE CARLO PRICING MODELS UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.  \u200b  \u25cf  EXPECTED TERM  - EXPECTED TERM IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL LIFE DATA AND IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE OF THE VESTING PERIOD AND THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. EXPECTED LIFE OF A MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARD IS BASED ON THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.  \u200b  \u25cf  EXPECTED VOLATILITY  - EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL STOCK VOLATILITY DATA OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARDS.  \u200b  \u25cf  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE  - WE BASE THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES AND MONTE CARLO VALUATION MODELS ON THE IMPLIED YIELD CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON U.S. TREASURY ZERO-COUPON ISSUES WITH AN EQUIVALENT EXPECTED TERM.  \u200b  \u25cf  FORFEITURES  - WE RECORD THE EFFECTS OF ACTUAL FORFEITURES AT THE TIME THEY OCCUR.  \u200b  THE FAIR VALUE OF SERVICE-BASED AWARDS FOR EACH RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THAT DAY. THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKET MEASURE-BASED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS ARE CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED ABOVE AND AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5 IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  WE ACCOUNT FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH OR EQUITY UPON CONVERSION BY SEPARATING THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENTS IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. IN JANUARY 2018 AND JUNE 2018, WE ISSUED THE 2025 NOTES OF $690.0 MILLION AND $218.5 MILLION, IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.0% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JANUARY 15, 2025. IN MARCH 2019 WE ISSUED THE 2027 NOTES OF $747.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.375% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2027. IN MARCH 2019, WE SETTLED APPROXIMATELY $493.4 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING 2025  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NOTES. WE DETERMINED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES BY USING ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING A DEBT INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING MARKET INTEREST RATES, CREDIT STANDING, YIELD CURVES AND VOLATILITIES. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT COMPONENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEBT COMPONENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE.  \u200b  FOR THE JANUARY 2018 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $194.9 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE SEVEN-YEAR TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. FOR THE JUNE 2018 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $73.0 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT, LESS THE $14.2 MILLION PREMIUM, IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2025 NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING SIX-AND-A-HALF-YEAR TERM OF THE NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. FOR THE MARCH 2019 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $275.0 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE EIGHT-YEAR TERM OF THE 2027 NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. IN ADDITION, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE NOTES WERE $18.8 MILLION, $7.4 MILLION, AND $18.0 MILLION FOR THE JANUARY 2018, JUNE 2018, AND MARCH 2019 OFFERINGS, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALLOCATED THE COSTS TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ALLOCATED TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES AS ADDITIONAL NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE. THE TRANSACTION COSTS ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  \u200b  GOODWILL.  IN 2018, WE RECOGNIZED GOODWILL OF $15.3 MILLION FROM THE ACQUISITION OF BIOMATRICA. WE EVALUATE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY SHOULD AN EVENT OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE OCCUR THAT INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT IS IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OR 2018. REFER TO NOTE 2 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE GOODWILL RECORDED.  \u200b  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  \u200b  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  \u200b  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  AND SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS TO THE INITIAL GUIDANCE: ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 AND ASU 2019-01  ,  (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cUPDATE 2016-02\u201d).

THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. WE ADOPTED UPDATE 2016-02 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, WE RECORDED AN OPENING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET BALANCE OF $20.6 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ALSO RECORDED AN OPENING LEASE LIABILITY OF $20.1 MILLION, OF WHICH $3.0 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES AND $17.1 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED IN LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR MORE DETAIL.  \u200b  IN JUNE 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07 (TOPIC 718),  IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING,  (\u201cUPDATE 2018-07\u201d).

AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS TO TOPIC 718 TO NONEMPLOYEE AWARDS EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE AMENDMENT. WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2019, AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  IN JULY 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2018-09,  CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS  , (\"UPDATE 2018-09\").

THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THOSE SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 1A. (RISK FACTORS) OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND PART I, ITEM 1A. (RISK FACTORS) OF OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT, AND  OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OUR COMPANY  WE ARE A SCIENCE-LED GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CLINICALLY-DIFFERENTIATED MEDICINES THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS TO PATIENTS WITH RARE DISORDERS. OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS IS THE FOUNDATION THAT DRIVES OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN A ROBUST PIPELINE OF TRANSFORMATIVE MEDICINES AND OUR MISSION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO BEST-IN-CLASS TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED. OUR STRATEGY IS TO BRING BEST-IN-CLASS THERAPIES WITH DIFFERENTIATED CLINICAL BENEFIT TO PATIENTS AFFECTED BY RARE DISORDERS AND TO LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAXIMIZE VALUE FOR OUR PATIENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.  CORPORATE UPDATES  DMD FRANCHISE  WE HAVE TWO PRODUCTS, TRANSLARNATM (ATALUREN) AND EMFLAZATM (DEFLAZACORT), FOR THE TREATMENT OF DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, OR DMD, A RARE, LIFE THREATENING DISORDER.  TRANSLARNA RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN AUGUST 2014 FOR THE TREATMENT OF NONSENSE MUTATION DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, OR NMDMD, IN AMBULATORY PATIENTS AGED FIVE YEARS AND OLDER IN THE 31 MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, OR EEA. IN JULY 2018, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPROVED A LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST TO OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA TO INCLUDE PATIENTS FROM TWO TO UP TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $48.3 MILLION  IN NET SALES FROM TRANSLARNA.  TRANSLARNA IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN OVER  40  COUNTRIES ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS OR THROUGH A REIMBURSED EARLY ACCESS PROGRAM, OR EAP PROGRAM. WE HOLD WORLDWIDE COMMERCIALIZATION RIGHTS TO TRANSLARNA FOR ALL INDICATIONS IN ALL TERRITORIES. EMFLAZA IS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN PATIENTS TWO YEARS AND OLDER. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , EMFLAZA ACHIEVED NET SALES OF  $22.9 MILLION.  OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL REVIEW AND RENEWAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOLLOWING REASSESSMENT BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY, OR EMA, OF THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE OF THE AUTHORIZATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE ANNUAL EMA REASSESSMENT. IN JULY 2019, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RENEWED OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION, MAKING  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IT EFFECTIVE, UNLESS EXTENDED, THROUGH AUGUST 5, 2020. THIS MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IS FURTHER SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT AND SUBMIT THE RESULTS OF AN 18-MONTH, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL, FOLLOWED BY AN 18-MONTH OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION, WHICH WE REFER TO TOGETHER AS STUDY 041. THE FINAL REPORT ON THE TRIAL AND OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION IS TO BE SUBMITTED BY US TO THE EMA BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022.  IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SUBMITTED TO THE EMA A LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST TO OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA TO INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO ARE NON-AMBULATORY. IN JUNE 2019, THE COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE, OR CHMP, OF THE EMA INFORMED US THAT IT HAD ADOPTED A NEGATIVE OPINION OF OUR LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST. WE REQUESTED A RE-EXAMINATION OF THE PROCEDURE AND IN OCTOBER 2019 THE NEGATIVE OPINION WAS AFFIRMED.  IN APRIL 2019 WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN BRAZIL FROM ANVISA, THE BRAZILIAN HEALTH REGULATORY AUTHORITY, FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN AMBULATORY PATIENTS AGED FIVE YEARS AND OLDER.  EACH COUNTRY, INCLUDING EACH MEMBER STATE OF THE EEA, HAS ITS OWN PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT REGULATIONS. IN ORDER TO COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SALE OF PRODUCT PURSUANT TO OUR TRANSLARNA MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY IN THE EEA, WE MUST FINALIZE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT BODY IN SUCH COUNTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS. WE ALSO HAVE MADE, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, PRODUCT AVAILABLE UNDER EAP PROGRAMS, BOTH IN COUNTRIES IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES. OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRODUCT UNDER COMMERCIAL AND EAP PROGRAMS CAN BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE IN ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRY.  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW OUR EEA MARKETING AUTHORIZATION DURING ANY ANNUAL RENEWAL CYCLE, OR IF OUR PRODUCT LABEL IS MATERIALLY RESTRICTED, OR IF STUDY 041 DOES NOT PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION, WE WOULD LOSE ALL, OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES.  TRANSLARNA IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE FILED A NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR NDA, FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OVER PROTEST WITH THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OR FDA. IN OCTOBER 2017, THE OFFICE OF DRUG EVALUATION I OF THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER FOR THE NDA, STATING THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO APPROVE THE APPLICATION IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IN RESPONSE, WE FILED A FORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION REQUEST WITH THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS OF THE FDA. IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS OF THE FDA DENIED OUR APPEAL OF THE COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER. IN ITS RESPONSE, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS RECOMMENDED A POSSIBLE PATH FORWARD FOR THE ATALUREN NDA SUBMISSION BASED ON THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL PATHWAY. THIS WOULD INVOLVE A RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA CONTAINING THE CURRENT DATA ON EFFECTIVENESS OF ATALUREN WITH NEW DATA TO BE GENERATED ON DYSTROPHIN PRODUCTION IN NMDMD PATIENTS\u2019 MUSCLES. WE INTEND TO FOLLOW THE FDA\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND WILL COLLECT, USING NEWER TECHNOLOGIES VIA PROCEDURES AND METHODS THAT WE DESIGNED, SUCH DYSTROPHIN DATA IN A NEW STUDY, STUDY 045, WHICH WE INITIATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. WE EXPECT THAT A POTENTIAL RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA COULD OCCUR IN 2020. ADDITIONALLY, SHOULD A RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA RECEIVE ACCELERATED APPROVAL, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS STATED THAT STUDY 041, WHICH IS CURRENTLY ENROLLING, COULD SERVE AS THE CONFIRMATORY POST-APPROVAL TRIAL REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL FRAMEWORK.  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT STUDY 045, OR ANY OTHER STUDIES WE MAY USE TO COLLECT THE DYSTROPHIN DATA, WILL NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DATA TO SUPPORT A MARKETING APPROVAL FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE U.S.  EMFLAZA WAS INITIALLY APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN PATIENTS FIVE YEARS AND OLDER. IN JUNE 2019, THE FDA APPROVED OUR LABEL EXPANSION REQUEST FOR EMFLAZA FOR PATIENTS TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE.  GENE THERAPY PLATFORM  WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF GENE THERAPY PRODUCT CANDIDATES FOR RARE MONOGENIC DISEASES THAT AFFECT THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, OR CNS, INCLUDING PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AROMATIC L-AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE, OR AADC, DEFICIENCY, OR AADC DEFICIENCY, A RARE CNS DISORDER ARISING FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE ENZYME AADC THAT RESULT FROM MUTATIONS IN THE DOPA DECARBOXYLASE GENE. WE ARE PREPARING A BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION, OR BLA, FOR PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AADC DEFICIENCY IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE SUBMITTING TO THE FDA IN LATE 2019, WITH AN ANTICIPATED COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN 2020. WE ARE ALSO PREPARING A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION, OR MAA, FOR PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AADC DEFICIENCY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU, FOR SUBMISSION TO THE EMA, WHICH WILL FOLLOW OUR BLA SUBMISSION TO THE FDA.  OUR GENE THERAPY PLATFORM ALSO INCLUDES A GENE THERAPY ASSET TARGETING FRIEDREICH ATAXIA, A RARE AND LIFE-SHORTENING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE CAUSED BY A SINGLE DEFECT IN THE FXN GENE WHICH CAUSES REDUCED PRODUCTION OF THE FRATAXIN PROTEIN. WE EXPECT TO SUBMIT AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR IND, TO THE FDA FOR THIS PROGRAM MID-YEAR 2020.  AKCEA PARTNERSHIP  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE HOLD THE RIGHTS FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF TEGSEDITM (INOTERSEN) AND WAYLIVRATM (VOLANESORSEN) FOR THE TREATMENT OF RARE DISEASES IN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, OR THE PTC TERRITORY, PURSUANT TO OUR COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AKCEA THERAPEUTICS, INC, OR THE AKCEA AGREEMENT.  TEGSEDI HAS RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE U.S., EU AND CANADA FOR THE TREATMENT OF STAGE 1 OR STAGE 2 POLYNEUROPATHY IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH HATTR AMYLOIDOSIS. TEGSEDI ALSO RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FROM ANVISA IN OCTOBER 2019 FOR THE TREATMENT OF STAGE 1 OR STAGE 2 POLYNEUROPATHY IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH HATTR AMYLOIDOSIS IN BRAZIL.  WAYLIVRA HAS RECEIVED CONDITIONAL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EU FOR THE TREATMENT OF FAMILIAL CHYLOMICRONEMIA SYNDROME, OR FCS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING APPROVAL FOR WAYLIVRA IN THE EU, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS REQUIRING AKCEA TO PROVIDE RESULTS OF A STUDY BASED ON A REGISTRY OF PATIENTS TO INVESTIGATE HOW BLOOD CHECKS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO FREQUENCY OF INJECTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT IN PRACTICE AND HOW WELL THEY WORK TO PREVENT THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND BLEEDING IN FCS PATIENTS TAKING WAYLIVRA. WAYLIVRA IS NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE PTC TERRITORY.  SPLICING PLATFORM  WE ALSO HAVE A SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, OR SMA, COLLABORATION WITH F. HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE LTD. AND HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE INC., WHICH WE REFER TO COLLECTIVELY AS ROCHE, AND THE SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY FOUNDATION, OR SMA FOUNDATION. CURRENTLY, OUR COLLABORATION HAS TWO PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS ONGOING TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISDIPLAM (RG7916, RO7034067), THE LEAD COMPOUND IN THE SMA PROGRAM. ROCHE IS PREPARING AN NDA AND AN MAA FOR RISDIPLAM FOR THE TREATMENT OF SMA IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ROCHE ANTICIPATES SUBMITTING TO THE FDA IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AND THE EMA IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2020.  IN COLLABORATION WITH MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE SPLICING COMPOUND PTC258, WHICH IS A SPLICING MODIFIER THAT RESTORES IKAP LEVELS, TARGETING FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA. BASED ON INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM THE FDA ON THE DIFFICULTY FOR A CLINICAL PATHWAY FOR THE SMALL POPULATION OF PATIENTS, THE FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA ORAL SPLICING PROGRAM HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.  PRE-CLINICAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND DISCOVERY PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN EARLY CLINICAL, PRE-CLINICAL AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR MULTIPLE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, INCLUDING RARE DISEASES AND ONCOLOGY.  FUNDING  THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES WE MAY DEVELOP, DEPENDS LARGELY ON OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REIMBURSEMENT FROM GOVERNMENTS AND THIRD-PARTY INSURERS. OUR REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES WHERE WE ARE PERMITTED TO DISTRIBUTE TRANSLARNA UNDER OUR EAP PROGRAMS AND IN COUNTRIES IN THE EEA WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE COMMERCIAL PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS, AND FROM SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  TO DATE, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OFFERING OF 3.0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE AUGUST 15, 2022, OR THE 2022 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, OUR OFFERING OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2026, OR THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2022 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, OUR PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK IN FEBRUARY 2014, OCTOBER 2014, APRIL 2018, JANUARY 2019, AND SEPTEMBER 2019, \"AT THE MARKET OFFERINGS\" OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK IN JUNE 2013, PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK, COLLABORATIONS, BANK DEBT, A CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, OR THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WITH MIDCAP FINANCIAL TRUST, OR MIDCAP FINANCIAL, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND MIDCAP FINANCIAL AND OTHER CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AS LENDERS THERETO, AND GRANTS AND CLINICAL TRIAL SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE DISEASE AREAS ADDRESSED BY OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. SINCE 2014, WE HAVE ALSO RELIED ON REVENUE GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND IN MAY 2017, WE BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY OF $60 MILLION, OF WHICH $40 MILLION WAS DRAWN BY US ON MAY 5, 2017. OUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON THE REMAINING $20 MILLION UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS MAY 1, 2021, UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE MADE LOAN REPAYMENTS OF $6.7 MILLION  ON THE CREDIT FACILITY.  IN JANUARY 2019, WE CLOSED AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. WE ISSUED AND SOLD AN AGGREGATE OF 7,563,725 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF $30.20 PER SHARE, INCLUDING 843,725 SHARES ISSUED UPON EXERCISE BY THE UNDERWRITER OF ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES IN FEBRUARY 2019. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY  $224.2 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN AUGUST 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN AT THE MARKET OFFERING SALES AGREEMENT, OR THE SALES AGREEMENT, WITH CANTOR FITZGERALD AND RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, LLC, OR TOGETHER, THE SALES AGENTS, PURSUANT TO WHICH, WE MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, HAVING AN AGGREGATE OFFERING PRICE OF UP TO $125.0 MILLION FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH THE SALES AGENTS BY ANY METHOD THAT IS DEEMED TO BE AN \u201cAT THE MARKET OFFERING\u201d AS DEFINED IN RULE 415(A)(4) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES ACT. DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ISSUED AND SOLD AN AGGREGATE OF  63,926  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO THE SALES AGREEMENT AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF  $46.60  PER SHARE. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $2.6 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE CLOSED AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. WE ISSUED AND SOLD AN AGGREGATE OF  2,475,248  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF  $40.40  PER SHARE. THE OFFERING INCLUDED AN OPTION TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  371,287  SHARES FOR A PERIOD OF 30 DAYS FOLLOWING THE OFFERING. THIS OPTION WAS NOT EXERCISED BY THE UNDERWRITER. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $97.0 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE ISSUED  $287.5 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH INCLUDED AN OPTION  TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL  $37.5 MILLION  IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES BEAR CASH INTEREST AT A RATE OF 1.5% PER YEAR, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING ON MARCH 15, 2020. THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2026, UNLESS EARLIER REPURCHASED OR CONVERTED. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $279.3 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING THE INITIAL PURCHASERS\u2019 DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND THE OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  $1,112.8 MILLION  . WE HAD A NET LOSS OF  $173.9 MILLION  AND  $79.8 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EEA, LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER TERRITORIES, INCLUDING THE EXPANSION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CORRESPONDING SALES AND MARKETING, LEGAL AND REGULATORY, DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND EMPLOYEE-BASED EXPENSES. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH STUDY 041 AND STUDY 045 AND OUR OPEN LABEL EXTENSION TRIALS OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AS WELL AS OUR STUDIES FOR NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA AND NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5 AND OUR FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES AND STUDIES FOR LIMB-GIRDLE 2I. WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCUR ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE OUR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS. WE HAVE BEGUN SEEKING AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE EEA AND WE MAY ALSO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR OTHER INDICATIONS. IN LATE  2019, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE FDA, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE EMA. THESE EFFORTS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EXPENSES.  WE MAY SEEK TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN-LICENSING OR ACQUIRING THE RIGHTS TO PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR TECHNOLOGIES AND WE MAY INCUR EXPENSES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTION COSTS, SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR ANY UPFRONT, MILESTONE OR OTHER PAYMENTS OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUTSTANDING 2022 AND 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS IN ARREARS, WHICH REQUIRE TOTAL FUNDING OF $8.8 MILLION ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CASH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY IN ARREARS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2013, WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, INVESTOR RELATIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES.  WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PROFITABLE AND WE WILL NEED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY, AND WE MAY NEVER DO SO. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED OR ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, WE COULD BE FORCED TO DELAY, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW  TO DATE, OUR NET PRODUCT SALES HAVE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR PROCESS FOR RECOGNIZING REVENUE IS DESCRIBED BELOW UNDER \u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES\u2014REVENUE RECOGNITION\u201d.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION COLLABORATION.  IN NOVEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENT, OR LICENSING AGREEMENT, WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE COMPOUNDS IDENTIFIED UNDER OUR SMA PROGRAM WITH THE SMA FOUNDATION. THE RESEARCH COMPONENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TERMINATED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE LICENSING AGREEMENT INCLUDED A $30 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT MADE IN 2011 WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED ON A DEFERRED BASIS OVER THE RESEARCH TERM, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UP TO $460 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES ON NET SALES.  IN AUGUST 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE SELECTION OF A DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATE. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $10.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE, WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.  IN JANUARY 2014, WE INITIATED A PHASE 1 CLINICAL PROGRAM, WHICH TRIGGERED A $7.5 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  IN NOVEMBER 2014, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN SMA WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION HAD STARTED A PHASE 2 STUDY IN ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $10.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  IN OCTOBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN SMA WITH ROCHE AND SMA FOUNDATION HAD TRANSITIONED INTO THE PIVOTAL SECOND PART OF ITS STUDY EVALUATING THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF RG7916 IN PEDIATRIC AND ADULT TYPE 2/3 SMA PATIENTS. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $20.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE AT TIME OF ACHIEVEMENT.  GRANT REVENUE.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE GRANT FUNDING FROM VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. THE GRANTS ARE TYPICALLY FOR EARLY DISCOVERY RESEARCH, AND GENERALLY SUCH GRANT PROGRAMS LAST FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DRUG DISCOVERY EFFORTS, CONDUCTING PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS, MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO REGULATORY FILINGS. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST OF.  \u00b7    EXTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS AND INVESTIGATIVE SITES, THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSULTANTS;  \u00b7    EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, FOR THE PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN OUR DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; AND  \u00b7    FACILITIES, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER ALLOCATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE DIRECT AND ALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR RENT AND MAINTENANCE OF FACILITIES, IT, HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, DEPRECIATION OF LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND LABORATORY AND OTHER SUPPLIES.  WE USE OUR EMPLOYEE AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES ACROSS MULTIPLE RESEARCH PROJECTS, INCLUDING OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WE TRACK EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR CLINICAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS ON A PER PROJECT BASIS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ONGOING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH STUDY 041 AND OTHER STUDIES FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, OUR STUDIES OF TRANSLARNA IN NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA AND NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5, OUR STUDIES OF EMFLAZA IN LIMB-GIRDLE 2I, ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE EXPENSES WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF OUR ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PLANNED CLINICAL TRIALS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE EXPENSES WILL ALSO DEPEND ON THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND THE RELATED EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ADVANCEMENT OF OUR PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS, AND PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATE MANUFACTURING COSTS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FOR OUR MOST ADVANCED PRINCIPAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  TRANSLARNA (NMDMD, ANIRIDIA AND DRAVET)  $25,239  $33,878  GENE THERAPY  17,016  1,928  ONCOLOGY  3,944  3,495  EMFLAZA  4,760  4,670  OTHER RESEARCH AND PRECLINICAL  12,117  10,397  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $63,076  $54,368  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  TRANSLARNA (NMDMD, ANIRIDIA AND DRAVET)  $53,354  $68,552  GENE THERAPY  44,418  1,928  ONCOLOGY  17,769  8,467  EMFLAZA  19,253  10,676  OTHER RESEARCH AND PRECLINICAL  40,827  28,714  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $175,621  $118,337  THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THIS IS DUE TO THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING DRUGS, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY OF.  \u00b7  THE SCOPE, RATE OF PROGRESS AND EXPENSE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS AND OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES;  \u00b7  THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES OVER OTHER THERAPIES;  \u00b7  OUR ABILITY TO MARKET, COMMERCIALIZE AND ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING OR MAY DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US AND TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS WE CURRENTLY HAVE OR MAY RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u00b7  CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS;  \u00b7  THE TERMS AND TIMING OF REGULATORY APPROVALS; AND  \u00b7  THE EXPENSE OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  A CHANGE IN THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD MEAN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE COSTS AND TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PRODUCT OR PRODUCT CANDIDATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE EMA OR FDA OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY WERE TO REQUIRE US TO CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS BEYOND THOSE WHICH WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETION OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLARNA OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATE OR IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN ENROLLMENT IN ANY OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TIME ON THE COMPLETION OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS FOR PERSONNEL, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, IN OUR EXECUTIVE, LEGAL, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, COMMERCIAL, FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTIONS. OTHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE FACILITY-RELATED COSTS NOT OTHERWISE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE; ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRY AND TRADE SHOWS; AND PROFESSIONAL FEES FOR LEGAL SERVICES, INCLUDING PATENT-RELATED EXPENSES, ACCOUNTING SERVICES AND MISCELLANEOUS SELLING COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OUR EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE WAYLIVRA AND TEGSEDI IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN AND TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED PAYROLL, EXPANDED INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, INCREASED CONSULTING, LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTOR RELATIONS EXPENSES.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET CONSISTS OF INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING AND INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE REPORTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS REPORTED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OTHER THAN THOSE DISCLOSED BELOW.  RESTRICTED CASH  RESTRICTED CASH INCLUDED IN DEPOSITS AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RELATES TO AN UNCONDITIONAL, IRREVOCABLE AND TRANSFERABLE LETTER OF CREDIT THAT WAS ENTERED INTO DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER A FACILITY LEASE FOR OUR LEASED BIOLOGICS FACILITY IN HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY. THE AMOUNT OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT IS  $7.5 MILLION  , IS TO BE MAINTAINED FOR A TERM OF NOT LESS THAN  FIVE YEARS  AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE REDUCED TO  $3.8 MILLION  IF AFTER  FIVE YEARS  THE COMPANY IS NOT IN DEFAULT OF ITS LEASE. THE AMOUNT IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN DEPOSITS AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  NET PRODUCT REVENUE  OUR NET PRODUCT REVENUE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SALES OF TRANSLARNA IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AND SALES OF EMFLAZA IN THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.  OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE TO PROVIDE TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA BASED ON CUSTOMER ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS, HOSPITALS, SPECIALTY PHARMACIES OR RETAIL PHARMACIES.  THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN OUR CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF EITHER TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA, WHICH IS TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY. WE INVOICE CUSTOMERS AFTER THE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AND INVOICE PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY DUE WITHIN 30 TO 90 DAYS OF INVOICE DATE.  WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE BASED ON FIXED CONSIDERATION IN ITS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. CONTRACT LIABILITIES ARISE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN CONSIDERATION IS DUE FOR GOODS NOT YET PROVIDED. AS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ONLY ONE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED ENTIRELY TO EITHER PRODUCT SALES OF TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA.  IN DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE, A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT DOES NOT EXIST SINCE THE TIMING FROM WHEN WE DELIVER PRODUCT TO WHEN THE CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THE PRODUCT IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN ONE YEAR. CUSTOMERS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PAY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT DELIVERY. IN THOSE INSTANCES, PAYMENT AND DELIVERY TYPICALLY OCCUR IN THE SAME MONTH.  WE RECORD PRODUCT SALES NET OF ANY VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, WHICH INCLUDES DISCOUNTS, ALLOWANCES, REBATES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES. WE USE THE EXPECTED VALUE OR MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD WHEN ESTIMATING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, UNLESS DISCOUNT OR REBATE TERMS ARE SPECIFIED WITHIN CONTRACTS. THE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AT THE TIME REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES ARE RECOGNIZED. THESE ESTIMATES FOR VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT KNOWN CHANGES IN FACTORS AND MAY IMPACT SUCH ESTIMATES IN THE QUARTER THOSE CHANGES ARE KNOWN. REVENUE RECOGNIZED DOES NOT INCLUDE AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT ARE CONSTRAINED.  IN RELATION TO CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, WE INCUR COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT BUT DO NOT INCUR COSTS TO OBTAIN A CONTRACT.  THESE COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  UPON ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 606 ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE HAVE ELECTED THE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS.  \u2022  PORTFOLIO APPROACH - WE APPLIED THE PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO CONTRACT REVIEWS WITHIN IDENTIFIED REVENUE STREAMS THAT HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS AND WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH WOULD NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY THAN IF APPLYING ASC TOPIC 606 TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.  \u2022  SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT - WE EXPECT THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN WE TRANSFER A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR THE GOOD OR SERVICE TO BE ONE YEAR OR LESS.  \u2022  IMMATERIAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS - WE DISREGARD PROMISES DEEMED TO BE IMMATERIAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTRACT.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES - WE CONSIDER ANY SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS OBTAINED CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT AS A COST TO FULFILL A PROMISE.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FINISHED GOODS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS ARE RECORDED AS A SELLING EXPENSE.  COLLABORATION REVENUE  THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE PAYMENTS TO US OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES; MILESTONE PAYMENTS; RESEARCH FUNDING AND ROYALTIES ON FUTURE PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE SERVICE REVENUE THROUGH AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR FEES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AND MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED EVENTS.  AT THE INCEPTION OF A COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT, WE NEED TO FIRST EVALUATE IF THE ARRANGEMENT MEETS THE CRITERIA IN ASC TOPIC 808 \u201cCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS\u201d TO THEN DETERMINE IF ASC TOPIC 606 IS APPLICABLE BY CONSIDERING WHETHER THE COLLABORATOR MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A CUSTOMER.  IF THE CRITERIA ARE MET, WE ASSESS THE PROMISES IN THE ARRANGEMENT TO IDENTIFY DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  FOR LICENSES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE ASSESS, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE ARRANGEMENT.  IF THE LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DETERMINED TO BE DISTINCT, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED FOR NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES WHEN THE LICENSE IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE CUSTOMER CAN USE AND BENEFIT FROM THE LICENSE.  IF THE LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DETERMINED NOT TO BE DISTINCT, THEN THE LICENSE WILL BE BUNDLED WITH OTHER PROMISES IN THE ARRANGEMENT INTO ONE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE DETERMINE IF THE BUNDLED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME.  IF WE CONCLUDE THAT THE NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, WE ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE METHOD OF MEASURING PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE.  FOR MILESTONE PAYMENTS, WE ASSESS, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WHETHER THE DEVELOPMENT OR SALES-BASED MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED PROBABLE OF BEING ACHIEVED.  IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE REVERSAL WILL OCCUR, WE WILL NOT RECORD REVENUE UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  MILESTONE PAYMENTS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE NOT CONSIDERED PROBABLE OF BEING ACHIEVED UNTIL THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY APPROVALS OR OTHER EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ARE OBTAINED AS SUCH CONDITIONS ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL.  IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE REVERSAL WILL NOT OCCUR, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS USING THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD.  WE WILL RE-ASSESS THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES EACH REPORTING PERIOD TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVEMENT.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS UNDER COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. WE RECORD THESE REIMBURSEMENTS AS REVENUE AND NOT AS A REDUCTION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS WE HAVE THE RISKS AND REWARDS AS THE PRINCIPAL IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-2, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d ALONG WITH OTHER AMENDMENTS ISSUED IN 2017 AND 2018. TOPIC 842 SUPERSEDES THE LEASE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS IN  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 840, LEASES  (TOPIC 840). TOPIC 842 REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS TO RECOGNIZE LEASED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES TO HELP INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES.  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. THIS DETERMINATION GENERALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT CONVEYS TO US THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY IDENTIFIED FIXED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. CONTROL OF AN UNDERLYING ASSET IS CONVEYED TO US IF WE OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO DIRECT THE USE OF AND TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM USING THE UNDERLYING ASSET. WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL LEASES.  UNDER THE STANDARD, OPERATING LEASES ARE CLASSIFIED AS RIGHT OF USE (\"ROU\") ASSETS, SHORT TERM LEASE LIABILITIES, AND LONG TERM LEASE LIABILITIES. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. ROU ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED AND LEASE LIABILITIES ACCRETE TO YIELD STRAIGHT-LINE EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY ARE COMPRISED OF FIXED PAYMENTS.  VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE EVENT, ACTIVITY, OR CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT ON WHICH THOSE PAYMENTS ARE ASSESSED OCCURS. VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM AS EXPENSE ARISING FROM FIXED LEASE PAYMENTS FOR OPERATING LEASES.  LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND WE RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE APPLY THIS POLICY TO ALL UNDERLYING ASSET CATEGORIES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOPIC 842 REQUIRES A LESSEE TO DISCOUNT ITS UNPAID LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE INTEREST RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE OR, IF THAT RATE CANNOT BE READILY DETERMINED, ITS INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE. AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. WE GIVE CONSIDERATION TO OUR RECENT DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS WHEN CALCULATING OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES.  THE LEASE TERM FOR ALL OF OUR LEASES INCLUDES THE NON-CANCELLABLE PERIOD OF THE LEASE PLUS ANY ADDITIONAL PERIODS COVERED BY EITHER OUR OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE THAT WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE, OR AN OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE CONTROLLED BY THE LESSOR.

TO DATE, ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT REVENUE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA AND SECURE MARKET ACCESS THROUGH COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS AT SUSTAINABLE LEVELS IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EEA OR THROUGH EAP PROGRAMS IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES.

AS A RESULT, WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE OPERATING LOSSES IN 2019, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OPERATING LOSSES GENERATED IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD DECLINE VERSUS PRIOR PERIODS.  THE NET LOSSES WE INCUR MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.

WE HAVE BEGUN SEEKING AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE EEA AND WE MAY ALSO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR OTHER INDICATIONS. IN LATE 2019, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE FDA, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE EMA. THESE EFFORTS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION, OUR EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IF AND AS WE.  \u2022  SEEK TO SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS WE ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGILIS ACQUISITION;  \u2022  SEEK TO SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AKCEA AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZATION OF TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA IN THE PTC TERRITORY;  \u2022  EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY FOR EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING COMMERCIALIZATION AND INTEGRATION EFFORTS;  \u2022  SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ASSUMED THROUGH THE EMFLAZA ACQUISITION;  \u2022  ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE ANY ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, NON-CLINICAL STUDIES OR CMC ASSESSMENTS OR ANALYSES IN ORDER TO ADVANCE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE;  \u2022  ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE OTHER STEPS, IN ADDITION TO STUDY 041, TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OR TO OBTAIN FURTHER MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OR OTHER INDICATIONS;  \u2022  INITIATE OR CONTINUE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLARNA AND EMFLAZA FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AND OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  SEEK TO DISCOVER AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u2022  SEEK TO EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  MAINTAIN, EXPAND AND PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO; AND  \u2022  ADD OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PERSONNEL, INCLUDING PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOWS FROM THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES,  WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE HAVE BASED THIS ESTIMATE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG, AND WE COULD USE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT.  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE AND MARKET EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE PRICING, COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS, ON A TIMELY BASIS, WITH THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ORPHAN EXCLUSIVITY FOR, AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE ALL FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, EMFLAZA;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, INCLUDING WHETHER THE EMA DETERMINES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE OF TRANSLARNA SUPPORTS RENEWAL OF OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA, ON THE CURRENT APPROVED LABEL;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF STUDY 041;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING, WHETHER WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, NON-CLINICAL STUDIES OR CMC ASSESSMENTS OR ANALYSES AT SIGNIFICANT COST WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, MAY ENABLE FDA REVIEW OF AN NDA SUBMISSION BY US AND, ULTIMATELY, MAY SUPPORT APPROVAL OF TRANSLARNA FOR NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE AND MARKET TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA IN THE PTC TERRITORY;  \u2022  THE PROGRESS AND RESULTS OF OUR OPEN LABEL EXTENSION CLINICAL TRIALS OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AS WELL AS OUR STUDIES FOR NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA, NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5 AND LIMB-GIRDLE 2I AND ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS;  \u2022  THE SCOPE, COSTS AND TIMING OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRODUCT SALES, MARKETING, LEGAL, REGULATORY, DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING, FOR BOTH EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD AND TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, FOR TEGSEDI, FOR WAYLIVRA AND FOR ANY OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT MAY RECEIVE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION OR ANY ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS OR TERRITORIES IN WHICH WE RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION TO MARKET TRANSLARNA;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF REGULATORY REVIEW OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR GENE THERAPY AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS, AND TRANSLARNA IN OTHER TERRITORIES OR FOR INDICATIONS OTHER THAN NMDMD;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT FOR OUR LEASED BIOLOGICS FACILITY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH MIDCAP FINANCIAL;  \u2022  THE TIMING AND SCOPE OF GROWTH IN OUR EMPLOYEE BASE;  \u2022  THE SCOPE, PROGRESS, RESULTS AND COSTS OF PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, LABORATORY TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS FOR TRANSLARNA AND EMFLAZA FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AND FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR GENE THERAPY AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS;  \u2022  REVENUE RECEIVED FROM COMMERCIAL SALES OF TRANSLARNA, EMFLAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, OR ANY OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL AND MAINTAIN EXISTING REIMBURSED NAMED PATIENT AND COHORT EAP PROGRAMS FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD ON ADEQUATE TERMS, OR AT ALL;  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO ACCESS TRANSLARNA THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEANS IF PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT NEGOTIATIONS IN THE APPLICABLE TERRITORY DO NOT HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME;  \u2022  THE COSTS OF PREPARING, FILING AND PROSECUTING PATENT APPLICATIONS, MAINTAINING, AND PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEFENDING AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED CLAIMS;  \u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN OTHER BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF ANY ACQUISITION, IN-LICENSING OR OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTION WE MAY PURSUE, AND THE COSTS OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO OUR ACQUISITION OF EMFLAZA, OUR ACQUISITION OF AGILIS, AND OUR LICENSING OF TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA; AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN COLLABORATIONS, INCLUDING OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION, AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN RESEARCH FUNDING AND ACHIEVE MILESTONES UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES, CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS IN ARREARS, WHICH REQUIRE TOTAL FUNDING OF $8.8 MILLION ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CASH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY IN ARREARS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2013, WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. THESE COSTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, INVESTOR RELATIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE DID NOT INCUR AS A PRIVATE COMPANY.  WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PROFITABLE AND WE WILL NEED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY, AND WE MAY NEVER DO SO. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. UNTIL SUCH TIME, IF EVER, AS WE CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCT REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE OUR CASH NEEDS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY OFFERINGS, DEBT FINANCINGS, COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, GRANTS AND CLINICAL TRIAL SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE DISEASE AREAS ADDRESSED BY OUR PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS. ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OUR SHAREHOLDERS OWNERSHIP INTEREST WILL BE DILUTED, AND THE TERMS OF THESE SECURITIES MAY INCLUDE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER PREFERENCES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. DEBT FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE, MAY INVOLVE AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE COVENANTS LIMITING OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR DECLARING DIVIDENDS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY HAVE TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES, FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS, RESEARCH PROGRAMS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR TO GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FAVORABLE TO US.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS WHEN NEEDED OR ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY, LIMIT, REDUCE OR TERMINATE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS OR GRANT RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE PREFER TO DEVELOP AND MARKET OURSELVES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DID NOT HAVE DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE, ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED UNDER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES.

OVERVIEW  IROBOT IS A LEADING CONSUMER ROBOT COMPANY THAT DESIGNS AND BUILDS ROBOTS THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE TO DO MORE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. OUR CONSUMER ROBOTS HELP PEOPLE FIND SMARTER WAYS TO CLEAN AND ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. OUR PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS FEATURES PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE CONNECTED HOME AND ADVANCED CONCEPTS IN CLEANING, MAPPING AND NAVIGATION, HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION AND PHYSICAL SOLUTIONS.  LEVERAGING THIS PORTFOLIO, OUR ENGINEERS ARE BUILDING AN ECOSYSTEM OF ROBOTS TO EMPOWER THE SMART HOME. FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN A PIONEER IN THE ROBOTICS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRIES.  WE SELL OUR ROBOTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING CHAIN STORES AND OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS, THROUGH OUR ON-LINE STORE, AND THROUGH VALUE-ADDED DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS WORLDWIDE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD 1,132 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN THE DISCIPLINES NECESSARY TO BUILD DURABLE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ROBOTS THROUGH THE CLOSE INTEGRATION OF SOFTWARE, ELECTRONICS AND HARDWARE. OUR CORE TECHNOLOGIES SERVE AS REUSABLE BUILDING BLOCKS THAT WE ADAPT AND EXPAND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, DEVELOP NEXT-GENERATION VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DESIGN AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, REDUCING THE TIME, COST AND RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. OUR SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE IN CONSUMER NEEDS, ROBOT DESIGN, ENGINEERING AND SMART HOME TECHNOLOGIES AND TRENDS POSITIONS US TO CAPITALIZE ON THE GROWTH WE EXPECT IN THE MARKET FOR ROBOT-BASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THE CONSUMER ROBOTS MARKET. WE BELIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE INCLUDE INCREASING COMPETITION AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS INTO BOTH NEW AND EXISTING MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO COST-OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND BROADER SUPPLY CHAIN WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MAINTAINING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT PRICING, REDUCING SUPPLY-CHAIN RISK AND LIMITING CHINA-RELATED TARIFF EXPOSURE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA I7 AND I7+ IN THE U.S., WHICH ARE ROBOT VACUUMS THAT REMEMBER A HOME'S FLOOR PLAN AND CLEAN SPECIFIC ROOMS BY NAME. USING IMPRINTTM SMART MAPPING, THE ROOMBA I7+ LEARNS THE HOME'S FLOOR PLAN, GIVING CUSTOMERS TOTAL CONTROL OVER WHICH ROOMS TO CLEAN AND WHEN. WHEN THE ROOMBA I7+ ROBOT VACUUM IS FINISHED CLEANING, IT EMPTIES ITS OWN DUST BIN INTO THE CLEAN BASETM, WHICH HOLDS 30 BINS OF DIRT. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY ALSO INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA E5, A HIGHLY-FEATURED PRODUCT AT A MORE ACCESSIBLE PRICE, TO OUR LINEUP IN THE U.S. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA E5 IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE LAUNCHED ROOMBA I7 AND I7+ IN EMEA, JAPAN AND CHINA. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED TWO NEW CLEANING ROBOTS IN THE U.S., THE ROOMBA S9 AND S9+, WHICH, ALONG WITH THE FEATURES OF THE ROOMBA I7 AND I7+, ARE ROBOT VACUUMS THAT CAN CLEAN DEEP INTO CORNERS AND ALONG EDGES, AND THE BRAAVA JET M6 ROBOT MOP, WHICH CAN TACKLE MULTIPLE ROOMS AND LARGE SPACES WITH ADVANCED NAVIGATION AND MAPPING CAPABILITIES. TOGETHER, THESE TWO ROBOTS CAN USE IMPRINT LINK TECHNOLOGY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, AUTOMATICALLY VACUUMING AND THEN MOPPING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL ACTION BY THE USER. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE S9 AND S9+ WERE LAUNCHED IN EMEA, WHILE THE M6 WAS LAUNCHED IN BOTH EMEA AND JAPAN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE S9, S9+ AND M6 WILL LAUNCH IN ALL OTHER TARGET MARKETS IN EARLY 2020.  19  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, REVENUE RECOGNITION INCLUDING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT RETURNS AND INCENTIVES; WARRANTY COSTS, VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS; EVALUATING LOSS CONTINGENCIES; ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDING PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENTS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES. WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MARKET PARTICIPANT FAIR VALUE CONSIDERATIONS, PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE \"MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" SECTION INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 30, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE NEW LEASING STANDARD UNDER ASC 842 USING THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHILE THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  . WE HAVE UPDATED OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY AS IT RELATES TO LEASE ACCOUNTING. REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WERE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALING  $70.5 MILLION  AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF  $20.5 MILLION  . OUR WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH REPRESENTS OUR TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS LESS TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES, WAS  $364.2 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO $271.1 MILLION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 29, 2018.  WE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH GIVES US THE ADVANTAGES OF RELATIVELY LOW CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULING PRODUCTION AND MANAGING INVENTORY LEVELS. BY LEASING OUR OFFICE FACILITIES, WE ALSO MINIMIZE THE CASH NEEDED FOR EXPANSION. ACCORDINGLY, OUR CAPITAL SPENDING IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, COMPUTERS, OFFICE FURNITURE, PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION TOOLING, INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE AND TEST EQUIPMENT.  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 29, 2018  , WE SPENT  $27.1 MILLION  AND  $25.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OUR STRATEGY FOR DELIVERING CONSUMER PRODUCTS TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS GIVES US THE FLEXIBILITY TO PROVIDE CONTAINER SHIPMENTS DIRECTLY FROM OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS IN SOUTHERN CHINA TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND, ALTERNATIVELY, ALLOWS OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND CERTAIN RETAIL CUSTOMERS TO TAKE POSSESSION OF PRODUCT ON A DOMESTIC BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT INVENTORY CONSISTS OF GOODS SHIPPED TO OUR THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS PROVIDERS FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF DISTRIBUTOR, RETAIL AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES. OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING AND STOCKING COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND THEY TYPICALLY INVOICE US WHEN THE FINISHED GOODS ARE SHIPPED.  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  $31.6 MILLION  , OF WHICH THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS WERE OUR NET INCOME OF  $65.3 MILLION  , NON-CASH CHARGES OF  $45.3 MILLION  AND CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL MAINLY INCLUDES INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OF  $10.9 MILLION  ,  $83.9 MILLION  AND  $8.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES OF  $39.2 MILLION.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  $25.9 MILLION  . DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE INVESTED  $27.1 MILLION  IN THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING MACHINERY AND TOOLING FOR NEW PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, WE MADE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS OF  $5.3 MILLION  AND PAID $2.8 MILLION FOR A BUSINESS ACQUISITION, WHILE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES AND MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AMOUNTED TO  $9.4 MILLION.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  $2.3 MILLION  . DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE RECEIVED  $5.0 MILLION  FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS AND PAID  $7.3 MILLION  UPON VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK WHERE 59,260 SHARES WERE RETAINED BY US TO COVER EMPLOYEE TAX WITHHOLDINGS.  WORKING CAPITAL FACILITIES  CREDIT FACILITY  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FROM $75.0 MILLION TO $150.0 MILLION AND EXTENDING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY TO JUNE 2023. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IS AVAILABLE TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE INTEREST ON LOANS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUES, AT OUR ELECTION, AT EITHER (1) LIBOR PLUS A MARGIN, CURRENTLY EQUAL TO 1.0%, BASED ON OUR RATIO OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (THE \"EURODOLLAR RATE\"), OR (2) THE LENDER\u2019S BASE RATE. THE LENDER\u2019S BASE RATE IS EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (1) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE  24  PLUS 0.5%, (2) THE LENDER\u2019S PRIME RATE AND (3) THE EURODOLLAR RATE PLUS 1.0%. IN THE EVENT THAT LIBOR IS DISCONTINUED AS EXPECTED IN 2021, WE EXPECT THE INTEREST RATES FOR OUR DEBT FOLLOWING SUCH EVENT WILL BE BASED ON EITHER ALTERNATE BASE RATES OR AGREED UPON REPLACEMENT RATES. WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT A LIBOR DISCONTINUATION WOULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW OR MAINTAIN ALREADY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, IT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CREDIT FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR OR GUARANTEE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, CREATE LIENS, ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, MAKE LOANS OR INVESTMENTS, SELL ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS ON, OR REPURCHASE, OUR STOCK, AND CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE WITH OTHER ENTITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS CUSTOMARY WITH THIS TYPE OF AGREEMENT, INCLUDING MAINTAINING A MAXIMUM RATIO OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA AND A MINIMUM SPECIFIED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING FOR PAYMENT DEFAULTS, BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS, BREACHES OF AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CROSS DEFAULTS TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, BANKRUPTCY AND FAILURE TO DISCHARGE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS. IF A DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS NOT CURED WITHIN ANY APPLICABLE CURE PERIOD OR IS NOT WAIVED, OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE ACCELERATED.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO MATERIAL CASH COMMITMENTS, EXCEPT FOR NORMAL RECURRING TRADE PAYABLES, EXPENSE ACCRUALS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING LEASES, ALL OF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING THROUGH WORKING CAPITAL, FUNDS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXISTING REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. WE BELIEVE OUR OUTSOURCED APPROACH TO MANUFACTURING PROVIDES US WITH FLEXIBILITY IN BOTH MANAGING INVENTORY LEVELS AND FINANCING OUR INVENTORY. WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IN THE EVENT OUR REVENUE PLAN DOES NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY ELIMINATE OR CURTAIL EXPENDITURES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE EXPANSION OF OUR MARKETING AND SALES ACTIVITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF SPENDING TO SUPPORT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, THE TIMING OF INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE ACQUISITION OF NEW CAPABILITIES OR TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MOREOVER, TO THE EXTENT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND CASH FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWING ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FUTURE ACTIVITIES, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES, TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE DISCLOSURE OF OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS IS SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING \"MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018.

THE EARN-OUT CONSIDERATION IS CAPPED AT $500,000 AND IS PAYABLE OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS IF CERTAIN MINIMUM OPERATING INCOME LEVELS ARE ACHIEVED.  THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THE ACQUISITION IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  THE COMPANY RECORDED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION.  DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $175,000 OF COSTS (INCLUDING LEGAL AND ACCOUNTING FEES) RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION.

LOUIS, MISSOURI LOCATION CONTAINS THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE AND THE DIRECT MAIL OPERATIONS OF IMPRESSIONS DIRECT, AND THEIR PARSONS, KANSAS LOCATION HAS THEIR MAIN MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND WAREHOUSE.  THE ACQUISITION OF FLESH, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $31.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, EXPANDS THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS FOR BUSINESS FORMS, CHECKS, DIRECT MAIL SERVICES, INTEGRATED PRODUCTS AND LABELS.  ON MARCH 16, 2019, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ACQUIRED THE ASSETS OF INTEGRATED PRINT & GRAPHICS (\u201c  INTEGRATED  \u201d) FOR $8.9 MILLION IN CASH PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF TRADE PAYABLES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.  GOODWILL OF $893,000 RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THE ACQUISITION IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION.  INTEGRATED IS LOCATED IN SOUTH ELGIN, ILLINOIS AND GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $20.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE ACQUISITION CREATED ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGH COLOR COMMERCIAL PRINT PRODUCT LINE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF 829,126 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, PAR VALUE $2.50 PER SHARE, TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT BUSINESS FORMS, INC., D/B/A WRIGHT BUSINESS GRAPHICS (\u201c  WRIGHT  \u201d), AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION BY THE COMPANY OF ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF WRIGHT PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED JULY 16, 2018 (THE \u201c  MERGER AGREEMENT  \u201d).  THE COMPANY SHARES ISSUED TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT REPRESENTED AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $16.2 MILLION AT THE TIME OF ISSUANCE.  AN ADDITIONAL $19.7 MILLION WAS PAID IN CASH TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT, SUBJECT TO A FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT, AND $2.6 MILLION WAS PAID TO PAY-OFF OUTSTANDING DEBT.  THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THIS MERGER IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  WRIGHT IS A PRINTING COMPANY THAT PRODUCES FORMS, PRESSURE SEAL, PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, CHECKS, STATEMENT PROCESSING AND COMMERCIAL PRINTING AND SELLS MAINLY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS.

WRIGHT, WHICH GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $58.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER ITS BRAND NAMES.  ON APRIL 30, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE ASSETS OF ALLEN-BAILEY TAG & LABEL (\u201c  ABTL  \u201d), A TAG AND LABEL OPERATION LOCATED IN NEW YORK, FOR $4.7 MILLION IN CASH PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF TRADE PAYABLES, SUBJECT TO A WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.  IN ADDITION, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OF UP TO $500,000 IS PAYABLE TO THE SELLERS IF CERTAIN SALES LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.  ABTL GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS ACQUISITION TO BE IMMATERIAL.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MANUFACTURING, DESIGNING, AND SELLING BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER PRINTED BUSINESS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPERATE 63 MANUFACTURING PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN 21 STRATEGICALLY LOCATED STATES.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE BUSINESS PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE ARE CUSTOM AND SEMI-CUSTOM PRODUCTS, CONSTRUCTED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZES, COLORS, NUMBER OF PARTS, AND QUANTITIES ON AN INDIVIDUAL JOB BASIS, DEPENDING UPON THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPECIFICATIONS.  21  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  THE PRODUCTS SOLD INCLUDE SNAP SETS, CONTINUOUS FORMS, LASER CUT SHEETS, TAGS, LABELS, ENVELOPES, INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, JU  MBO ROLLS AND PRESSURE SENSITIVE PRODUCTS IN SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG RUNS UNDER THE FOLLOWING LABELS: ENNIS\u00ae, ROYAL BUSINESS FORMS\u00ae, BLOCK GRAPHICS\u00ae, SPECIALIZED PRINTED FORMS\u00ae, 360O CUSTOM LABELS  SM  , COLORWORX\u00ae, ENFUSION\u00ae, UNCOMPROMISED CHECK SOLUTIONS\u00ae, VE  RSASEAL\u00ae, AD CONCEPTS  SM  , FORMSOURCE LIMITED  SM  , STAR AWARD RIBBON COMPANY\u00ae, WITT PRINTING\u00ae, B&D LITHO\u00ae, GENFORMS\u00ae, PRINTGRAPHICS\u00ae, CALIBRATED FORMS\u00ae, PRINTXCEL\u00ae, PRINTEGRA\u00ae, FALCON BUSINESS FORMS  SM  , FORMS MANUFACTURERS  SM  , MUTUAL GRAPHICS\u00ae, TRI-C BUSINESS FO  RMS  SM  , MAJOR BUSINESS SYSTEMS  SM  , INDEPENDENT PRINTING  SM  , HOOSIER DATA FORMS\u00ae, HAYES GRAPHICS\u00ae, WRIGHT BUSINESS GRAPHICS  SM  , WRIGHT 360  SM  , INTEGRATED PRINT & GRAPHICS  SM  , AND THE FLESH COMPANY  SM  . WE ALSO SELL THE ADAMS MCCLURE\u00ae BRAND (WHICH PROVIDES POINT OF  PURCHASE ADVERTISING FOR LARGE FRANCHISE AND FAST FOOD CHAINS, AS WELL AS KITTING AND FULFILLMENT); THE ADMORE\u00ae, FOLDER EXPRESS\u00ae, AND INDEPENDENT FOLDERS\u00ae BRANDS (WHICH PROVIDE PRESENTATION FOLDERS AND DOCUMENT FOLDERS); ENNIS TAG & LABEL  SM  (WHICH PROVIDES  CUSTOM PRINTED, HIGH PERFORMANCE LABELS AND CUSTOM AND STOCK TAGS); ALLEN-BAILEY TAG & LABEL  SM  , ATLAS TAG & LABEL\u00ae, KAY TOLEDO TAG\u00ae, AND SPECIAL SERVICE PARTNERS\u00ae (SSP) (WHICH PROVIDES CUSTOM AND STOCK TAGS AND LABELS); TRADE ENVELOPES\u00ae, BLOCK GRAPHICS\u00ae,  WISCO\u00ae, AND NATIONAL IMPRINT CORPORATION\u00ae (WHICH PROVIDE CUSTOM AND IMPRINTED ENVELOPES) AND NORTHSTAR\u00ae AND GENERAL FINANCIAL SUPPLY\u00ae (WHICH PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND SECURITY DOCUMENTS).  WE SELL PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH PRIVATE PRINTERS AND INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS TO MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. NORTHSTAR COMPUTER FORMS, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (WHERE A DISTRIBUTOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR AVAILABLE TO THE END-USER).  ADAMS MCCLURE, LP, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, WHERE SALES ARE GENERALLY THROUGH ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  THE PRINTING INDUSTRY GENERALLY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS EITHER DIRECTLY TO END USERS, A MARKET DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS R.R. DONNELLEY AND SONS, STAPLES, INC., STANDARD REGISTER CO. (A SUBSIDIARY OF TAYLOR CORPORATION), AND CENVEO, INC., OR, LIKE THE COMPANY, THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND DISTRIBUTOR GROUPS. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC STATISTICAL INFORMATION, TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARE OF THE TOTAL BUSINESS PRODUCTS MARKET, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTING PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT, RANGING IN SIZE FROM SINGLE EMPLOYEE-OWNED OPERATIONS TO MULTI-PLANT ORGANIZATIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIC LOCATIONS AND BUYING POWER PERMIT US TO COMPETE ON A FAVORABLE BASIS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTOR MARKET ON COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS SERVICE, QUALITY, AND PRICE.  DISTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY DONE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, INCLUDING BUSINESS FORMS DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, DIRECT MAIL, COMMERCIAL PRINTERS, PAYROLL AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOFTWARE COMPANIES, AND ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  RAW MATERIALS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF A WIDE VARIETY OF WEIGHTS, WIDTHS, COLORS, SIZES, AND QUALITIES OF PAPER FOR BUSINESS PRODUCTS PURCHASED PRIMARILY FROM ONE MAJOR SUPPLIER AT FAVORABLE PRICES BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS.  BUSINESS PRODUCTS USAGE IN THE PRINTING INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY NOT SEASONAL. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTION OF THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS FORMS INDUSTRY ARE THE PREDOMINANT FACTORS IN QUARTERLY VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.  BUSINESS CHALLENGES  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  THE CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  22  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A P  ORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A PROACTIVE BASIS WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AN  D EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MAR  KET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PRESSURE SEAL PRODUCTS, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MO  LD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \u2013 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 RESULTED IN THE DISSIPATION OF THE PRICING ADVANTAGE THAT FOREIGN IMPORTS HAD OVER DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS, WHICH IN TURN LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY LEFT THE MARKET, WHETHER PLANNED (I.E., SWITCHING OF PRODUCTS TO ALTERNATIVE PAPER PRODUCTS) OR UNPLANNED (I.E., BANKRUPTCY).  CONSEQUENTLY, EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE RESULTED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019, WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL GRADES.  GIVEN THESE LEVELS, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRACTICE, SUPPLIERS RAISED PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019 ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIES.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS ARE FLOWING BACK INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING OF DOMESTIC DEMAND, HAS RESULTED IN RENEWED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  HISTORICALLY, THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE NORMALIZATION OF PRICING AND COSTS, WHICH IS BEGINNING TO APPEAR TO SOME DEGREE IN THE MARKETPLACE.  HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DISTRIBUTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  SOME CUSTOMERS MAY DEMAND BETTER PRICING AND SERVICES, AND OTHER CUSTOMERS MAY BE FORCED TO RELOCATE THEIR BUSINESS TO THEIR NEW PARENT COMPANY\u2019S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE HISTORICAL BUSINESS OF THESE CUSTOMERS, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, ULTIMATELY WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES WERE $108.8 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $98.6 MILLION FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF $10.2 MILLION, OR 10.3%.  RECENT INCREASES IN FOREIGN IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICINGS LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT (COMPLETED IN JULY 2018), INTEGRATED (COMPLETED IN MARCH 2019) AND FLESH (COMPLETED IN JULY 2019) ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET ON GOING TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTION AND OTHER CHANGES.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $16.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $8.1 MILLION FROM $68.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 TO $76.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OR 11.9%. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\u201c  MARGIN  \u201d) WAS $32.5 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER, OR 29.8% OF NET SALES, COMPARED TO $30.3 MILLION, OR 30.8% OF NET SALES, FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OUR MARGINS CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR.    WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE ACQUISITIONS, THE MARGIN OF OUR ORGANIC PLANTS CONTINUES TO BE ABOVE 31.5%, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INTEGRATE THESE ACQUISITIONS INTO OUR BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  IN ADDITION, ON A COMPARATIVE QUARTER BASIS, OUR MEDICAL EXPENSES IMPACTED OUR MARGIN BY APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201c  SG&A  \u201d) EXPENSES WERE $19.6 MILLION COMPARED TO $17.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, AN INCREASE OF $2.0 MILLION, OR 11.4%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 18.1% AND 17.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE TO SG&A EXPENSES RELATES TO THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS, WHICH IMPACTED SUCH EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON A SETTLEMENT AWARDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FORMER APPAREL OPERATIONS, WHICH IMPACTED SUCH EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $325,000.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $2,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $12.8 MILLION, OR 11.7% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $12.8 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONAL INCOME BY $1.1 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME WAS $68,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,000 EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  NET EARNINGS.  NET EARNINGS, DUE TO THE FACTORS ABOVE, WERE $9.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $9.6 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, A SLIGHT DECREASE OF 1.0%.  NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $0.37, COMPARED TO $0.37 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL AND INTEREST EXPENSES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED NET EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT QUARTER BY $1.35 MILLION, OR $0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE.  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES WERE $216.8 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $192.0 MILLION FOR SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF 12.9%.  RECENT INCREASES IN FOREIGN IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICINGS LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $35.4 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  25  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $151.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $131.5 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $20.2 MILLION, OR 15.4%. O  UR MARGIN WAS $65.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OR 30.0%.  THIS COMPARES TO 31.5% FOR THE SAME SIX MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  OUR MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED FOR THE MOST PART BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE AC  QUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO THE NUMEROUS RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES TAKEN LAST YEAR.  DURING THE LAST YEAR, TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE M  ANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICAL PRICE INCREASES WERE LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PASS THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED M  ANUFACTURERS\u2019 ABILITIES TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  THESE PRICE INCREASES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THEY ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR COSTS DECLINE.  RECENTLY, DUE TO CURR  ENT PRICING LEVELS AND THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, THE ENVIRONMENT HAS ONCE AGAIN BEEN ATTRACTIVE FOR IMPORTS AND THEY HAVE MORE THAN FILLED ANY VACUUM IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN.  THIS HISTORICALLY HAS LED TO SOME NORMALIZATION/STABILITY IN THE MARKETP  LACE.  HOWEVER, WITH THE RECENT OWNERSHIP CHANGE IN SEVERAL LARGER DOMESTIC MILLS, THIS HISTORICAL PENDULUM SWING IN PRICING MAY NOT OCCUR.  AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST YEAR HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS. WI  THOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE ACQUISITIONS, THE MARGINS FROM OUR ORGANIC PLANTS CONTINUED TO BE ABOVE 31.5% DURING THE PERIOD, COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS S  YSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS AT THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED PLANTS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  OUR MARGINS WERE ALSO IMPACTED FOR THE SIX MONTHS BY OUR COMPARATIVELY HIGH MEDICAL EXPENSES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  OUR SG&A EXPENSES WERE $39.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $35.3 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF 11.3%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, THE SG&A EXPENSES WERE 18.1% AND 18.4% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF WRIGHT, INTEGRATED AND FLESH IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSES BY $4.7 MILLION DURING THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $6,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $25.8 MILLION, OR 11.9% OF SALES, AS COMPARED TO $25.2 MILLION, OR 13.1% OF SALES, FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS, DURING THE PERIOD IMPACTED OUR OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $0.1 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $0.1 MILLION EXPENSE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  NET EARNINGS.  NET EARNINGS WERE $19.2 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $18.8 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $0.4 MILLION.  NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $0.74, COMPARED TO $0.74 FOR THE SAME SIX MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE ADDITIONAL MEDICAL AND INTEREST EXPENSES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED NET EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD BY $1.35 MILLION, OR $0.05 PER DILUTED SHARE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON OUR CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY EXTENDED PURSUANT TO OUR SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \u201d), TO MEET CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE PAYMENTS TO VENDORS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT REPAYMENTS AND RELATED INTEREST PAYMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN, WHICH COVERS APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR AGGREGATE EMPLOYEES (THE \u201c  PENSION PLAN  \u201d), AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  AUGUST 31,  FEBRUARY 28,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $98,686  $134,542  CASH  $52,500  $88,442  26  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $35.9 MILLION OR 26.7%, FROM $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO $98.7 MILLION AT AUGUST 31, 2019.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.3 TO 1.0 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO 3.6 TO 1.0 AT AUGUST 31, 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CURRENT RATIO WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $30.0 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $4.2 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ASC 842 WHICH INCREASED OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES BY $5.3 MILLION.  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $27,718  $24,250  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(20,264  )  $(29,575  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(43,396  )  $(11,422  )  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $3.5 MILLION FROM $24.3 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 TO $27.7 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: I) A $2.8 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND II) A $2.1 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR INVENTORIES.  THESE INCREASES IN OUR CASH WERE OFFSET BY A $3.2 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $9.3 MILLION FROM 29.6 MILLION TO $20.3 MILLION USED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 AND AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.0 MILLION LESS USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS $8.3 MILLION LESS USED IN OUR ACQUISITIONS OF INTEGRATED AND FLESH IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IN COMPARISON TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF ABTL AND WRIGHT IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST FISCAL YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  WE USED $32.0 MILLION MORE IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  WE USED $30.0 MILLION TO PAY LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, BUT PAID NO LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.  WE USED $1.6 MILLION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, WHEREAS WE USED $0.7 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  IN ADDITION, $0.9 MILLION MORE WAS USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY, WITH A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSE OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (A) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (B) THE COMPANY\u2019S NET LEVERAGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS THAN 2.50:1.00.  ALL CALCULATIONS ARE MADE BASED ON GAAP EXISTING AT THE TIME THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ENTERED INTO.  AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA.  AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND THE COMPANY HAD  $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $99.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL AS ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COMPANY\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED.  27  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  PENSION PLAN \u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN.  THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\u201c  ERISA  \u201d).  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE H  IGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT (HATFA) IN AUGUST 2014, WHICH EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE DISCOUNT RATES MANDATED FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A PLAN\u2019S BENEFIT LIABILITY AND ANNUAL COST OF ACCRUALS, OUR MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION PLAN IS  ZERO FOR THE PENSION PLAN YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020. ASSUMING A STABLE FUNDING STATUS, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $1.3 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  WE M  ADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019. AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDE  D AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD A NET PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION.  INVENTORIES  \u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE WITHIN OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \u2013  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019.  28  ENNIS, INC.

IN ADDITION, WE ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT WILL REDUCE MANAGERIAL LAYERS AND CONSOLIDATE ROLES ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION, RESULTING IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 400 FULL-TIME POSITIONS LOCATED AT OUR HEADQUARTERS AND ACROSS THE FIELD ORGANIZATION.

GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $208.2 MILLION AS COMPARED TO GROSS PROFIT OF $208.8 MILLION FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. THE INCREASE IN THE THIRTEEN WEEK GROSS PROFIT FOR THE SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED PHARMACY NETWORK MANAGEMENT. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIOD WAS FLAT TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u200b  GROSS MARGIN WAS 7.1% OF SALES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 7.0% OF SALES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEK PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 1, 2018.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PHARMACY SERVICES SEGMENT REVENUE WAS 5.7% AND 5.4% FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF PHARMACY SERVICES SEGMENT REVENUE WAS 5.8% AND 5.6% FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE THIRTEEN AND TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT CURRENT YEAR AND FUTURE GROWTH.  \u200b  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  \u200b  GENERAL  \u200b  WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY: (I) CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND (II) BORROWINGS UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES. OUR PRINCIPAL USES OF CASH ARE TO PROVIDE WORKING CAPITAL FOR OPERATIONS, TO SERVICE OUR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON DEBT AND TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. TOTAL LIQUIDITY AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $1,400.9 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF REVOLVER BORROWING CAPACITY OF $1,366.8 MILLION AND INVESTED CASH OF $34.1 MILLION.  \u200b  CREDIT FACILITIES  \u200b  ON DECEMBER 20, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW SENIOR SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT, CONSISTING OF A NEW $2.7 BILLION SENIOR SECURED ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\u201cSENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) AND A NEW $450.0 MILLION \u201cFIRST-IN, LAST OUT\u201d SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (\u201cSENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN\u201d) (COLLECTIVELY THE \u201cNEW FACILITIES\u201d). PROCEEDS FROM THE NEW FACILITIES WERE USED TO REFINANCE OUR PRIOR $2.7 BILLION AMENDED AND RESTATED SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY DUE JANUARY 2020 (THE \u201cOLD FACILITY\u201d, THE NEW FACILITIES AND THE OLD FACILITY ARE COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFACILITIES\u201d). THE NEW FACILITIES EXTEND OUR DEBT MATURITY PROFILE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL  66  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY. THE NEW FACILITIES MATURE IN DECEMBER 2023, SUBJECT TO AN EARLIER MATURITY ON DECEMBER 31, 2022 IF WE HAVE NOT REPAID OR REFINANCED OUR EXISTING 6.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 PRIOR TO SUCH DATE. IT IS OUR INTENTION TO REPAY OR REFINANCE OUR EXISTING 6.125% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2023 PRIOR TO THE EARLY MATURITY BECOMING EFFECTIVE. OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 125 TO 175 BASIS POINTS (OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE PLUS 25 TO 75 BASIS POINTS), DEPENDING ON AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVING FACILITY. OUR NEW SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE OF LIBOR PLUS 300 BASIS POINTS (OR AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE PLUS 200 BASIS POINTS).  \u200b  OUR ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES IS BASED UPON A SPECIFIED BORROWING BASE CONSISTING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND PRESCRIPTION FILES. AT AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD $1,700.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND HAD LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING AGAINST THE NEW FACILITIES OF $83.2 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL BORROWING CAPACITY OF $1,366.8 MILLION. IF AT ANY TIME THE TOTAL CREDIT EXPOSURE OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES AND THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR OTHER SENIOR OBLIGATIONS EXCEED THE BORROWING BASE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CERTAIN OTHER MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS TO ELIMINATE SUCH SHORTFALL.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES RESTRICT US AND ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES THAT GUARANTEE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND UNSECURED GUARANTEED NOTES (THE \u201cSUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS\u201d) FROM ACCUMULATING CASH ON HAND IN EXCESS OF $200.0 MILLION AT ANY TIME WHEN REVOLVING LOANS ARE OUTSTANDING (NOT INCLUDING CASH LOCATED IN OUR STORE AND LOCKBOX DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS AND CASH NECESSARY TO COVER OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES). THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO STATE THAT IF AT ANY TIME (OTHER THAN FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF REMEDIES OR ACCELERATION OF ANY SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OR SECOND PRIORITY DEBT AND RECEIPT OF A TRIGGERING NOTICE BY THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SENIOR OBLIGATIONS OR THE SECOND PRIORITY DEBT) EITHER (I) AN EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES OR (II) THE SUM OF REVOLVER AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND CERTAIN AMOUNTS HELD ON DEPOSIT WITH THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT IN A CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT IS LESS THAN $275.0 MILLION FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS OR LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO $200.0 MILLION ON ANY DAY (A \u201cCASH SWEEP PERIOD\u201d), THE FUNDS IN OUR DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS WILL BE SWEPT TO A CONCENTRATION ACCOUNT WITH THE SENIOR COLLATERAL AGENT AND WILL BE APPLIED FIRST TO REPAY OUTSTANDING REVOLVING LOANS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES, AND THEN HELD AS COLLATERAL FOR THE SENIOR OBLIGATIONS UNTIL SUCH CASH SWEEP PERIOD IS RESCINDED PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF OUR NEW FACILITIES.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES ALLOW US TO HAVE OUTSTANDING, AT ANY TIME, UP TO $1.5 BILLION IN SECURED SECOND PRIORITY DEBT, SPLIT-PRIORITY TERM LOAN DEBT, UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK IN ADDITION TO BORROWINGS UNDER THE NEW FACILITIES AND EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS, PROVIDED THAT NOT IN EXCESS OF $750.0 MILLION OF SUCH SECURED SECOND PRIORITY DEBT, SPLIT-PRIORITY TERM LOAN DEBT, UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK SHALL MATURE OR REQUIRE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL PRIOR TO 90 DAYS AFTER THE LATEST OF (I) THE FIFTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEW FACILITIES AND (II) THE LATEST MATURITY DATE OF ANY TERM LOAN OR OTHER REVOLVING COMMITMENT (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE NEW FACILITIES). SUBJECT TO THE LIMITATIONS DESCRIBED IN CLAUSES (I) AND (II) OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SENTENCE, THE NEW FACILITIES ADDITIONALLY ALLOW US TO ISSUE OR INCUR AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF UNSECURED DEBT AND DISQUALIFIED PREFERRED STOCK SO LONG AS A FINANCIAL COVENANT EFFECTIVENESS PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE NEW FACILITIES) IS NOT IN EFFECT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT CERTAIN OF OUR OTHER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF UNSECURED DEBT THAT CAN BE INCURRED IF CERTAIN INTEREST COVERAGE LEVELS ARE NOT MET AT THE TIME OF INCURRENCE OR OTHER EXEMPTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO CONTAIN CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF SECURED FIRST PRIORITY DEBT WE ARE ABLE TO INCUR. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO ALLOW FOR THE VOLUNTARY REPURCHASE OF ANY DEBT OR OTHER CONVERTIBLE DEBT, SO LONG AS THE NEW FACILITIES ARE NOT IN DEFAULT AND WE MAINTAIN AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVER OF MORE THAN $365.0 MILLION.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES HAVE A FINANCIAL COVENANT THAT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.00 TO 1.00 (I) ON ANY DATE ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS LESS THAN $200.0 MILLION OR (II) ON THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS LESS THAN $250.0 MILLION AND, IN EACH CASE, ENDING ON AND EXCLUDING THE FIRST DAY THEREAFTER, IF ANY, WHICH IS THE 30TH CONSECUTIVE CALENDAR DAY ON WHICH AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN $250.0 MILLION. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR NEW FACILITIES OF $1,366.8 MILLION, OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS GREATER THAN 1.00 TO 1.00, AND WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE NEW FACILITIES\u2019 FINANCIAL COVENANT. THE NEW FACILITIES ALSO CONTAIN COVENANTS WHICH PLACE RESTRICTIONS ON THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT, THE PAYMENTS OF DIVIDENDS, SALE OF ASSETS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AND THE GRANTING OF LIENS.  \u200b  THE NEW FACILITIES PROVIDE FOR CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT INCLUDING NONPAYMENT, MISREPRESENTATION, BREACH OF COVENANTS AND BANKRUPTCY. IT IS ALSO AN EVENT OF DEFAULT IF WE FAIL TO MAKE ANY REQUIRED PAYMENT ON DEBT HAVING A PRINCIPAL AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF $50.0 MILLION OR ANY EVENT OCCURS THAT ENABLES, OR WHICH WITH THE GIVING OF NOTICE OR THE  67  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LAPSE OF TIME WOULD ENABLE, THE HOLDER OF SUCH DEBT TO ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OR REQUIRE THE REPAYMENT REPURCHASE, REDEMPTION OR DEFEASANCE OF SUCH DEBT.  \u200b  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS OUR GUARANTEED UNSECURED NOTES CONTAINS RESTRICTIONS ON THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SECURED AND UNSECURED DEBT THAT CAN BE INCURRED BY US. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL SECURED DEBT THAT COULD BE INCURRED UNDER THE MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANT OF THE INDENTURE WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION (WHICH AMOUNT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO ENTER INTO CERTAIN SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS). ASSUMING A FULLY DRAWN REVOLVER AND THE OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WE COULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL $350.0 MILLION IN SECURED DEBT. THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL UNSECURED DEBT UNDER THE INDENTURE IS GENERALLY GOVERNED BY AN INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO TEST. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD THE ABILITY TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL UNSECURED DEBT UNDER OUR OTHER INDENTURES.  \u200b  NET CASH PROVIDED BY/USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  \u200b  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $330.0 MILLION AND $300.9 MILLION FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE INCREASE IN AMOUNTS DUE FROM CMS, SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILD, PAYMENTS TO FUND THE FISCAL 2019 401(K) CONTRIBUTION AND BONUS PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS THE TIMING OF WORKING CAPITAL ITEMS.  \u200b  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $95.3 MILLION AND $94.8 MILLION FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. CASH USED FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. DURING THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, WE REMODELED 51 STORES AND SPENT $15.7 MILLION ON FILE BUYS.  \u200b  CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $425.0 MILLION COMPARED TO CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $883.2 MILLION FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE TWENTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 REFLECTS NET REVOLVER BORROWINGS AND THE CHANGE IN OUR ZERO BALANCE ACCOUNTS DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  \u200b  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u200b  DURING THE THIRTEEN AND TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIODS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 1, 2018 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE AS FOLLOWS.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  THIRTEEN WEEK PERIOD ENDED  TWENTY-SIX WEEK PERIOD ENDED  \u200b  \u200b  AUGUST 31,  SEPTEMBER 1,  AUGUST 31,  SEPTEMBER 1,  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  2019  \u200b  2018  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NEW STORE CONSTRUCTION, STORE RELOCATION AND STORE REMODEL PROJECTS  \u200b  $16,727  \u200b  $20,986  \u200b  $37,334  \u200b  $45,875  \u200b  TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS, IMPROVEMENTS TO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND OTHER CORPORATE REQUIREMENTS  \u200b  26,352  \u200b  23,608  \u200b  46,726  \u200b  46,690  \u200b  PURCHASE OF PRESCRIPTION FILES FROM OTHER RETAIL PHARMACIES  \u200b  7,498  \u200b  6,864  \u200b  15,708  \u200b  20,519  \u200b  TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \u200b  $50,577  \u200b  $51,458  \u200b  $99,768  \u200b  $113,084  \u200b  \u200b  FUTURE LIQUIDITY  \u200b  WE ARE HIGHLY LEVERAGED. OUR HIGH LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS COULD: (I) LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING; (II) LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN PLANNING FOR, OR REACTING TO, CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND THE INDUSTRY; (III) PLACE US AT A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO OUR COMPETITORS WITH LESS DEBT; (IV) RENDER US MORE VULNERABLE TO GENERAL ADVERSE ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY CONDITIONS; AND (V) REQUIRE US TO DEDICATE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW TO SERVICE OUR DEBT. BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVELS OF OPERATIONS, WE BELIEVE THAT CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER AND OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, DEBT SERVICE AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. BASED ON OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN STRONG THROUGHOUT THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO BE SUBJECT TO THE FIXED CHARGE COVENANT IN OUR NEW FACILITIES IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION AND POTENTIAL SOURCES OF  68  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SUPPLEMENTAL LIQUIDITY IN LIGHT OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER RELEVANT CIRCUMSTANCES. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY SEEK ADDITIONAL DELEVERAGING OR REFINANCING TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ENTERING INTO TRANSACTIONS TO EXCHANGE DEBT FOR SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, ISSUANCE OF EQUITY (INCLUDING PREFERRED STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES), REPURCHASE OR REDEMPTION OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, OR SEEK TO REFINANCE OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT (INCLUDING OUR FACILITIES) OR MAY OTHERWISE SEEK TRANSACTIONS TO REDUCE INTEREST EXPENSE AND EXTEND DEBT MATURITIES, PARTICULARLY FOLLOWING THE SALE AND IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGIES FOLLOWING THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER. ANY OF THESE TRANSACTIONS COULD IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. WE MAY ALSO USE ADDITIONAL SALE PROCEEDS FOR ONE OR MORE OF THESE PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR OUTSTANDING AGREEMENTS.  \u200b  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \u200b  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THE USE OF SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES BY MANAGEMENT, REFER TO \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS\u2014CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR FISCAL 2019 10-K, WHICH WE FILED WITH THE SEC ON APRIL 25, 2019, AND THE FIRST QUARTER 2020 10-Q, WHICH WE FILED ON JULY 11, 2019.  \u200b  EFFECTIVE MARCH 3, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE LEASE STANDARD.

WE BELIEVE THE NON-GAAP MEASURES SERVE AS AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS.

OPERATING SEGMENTS  OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE EVIDENCE OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL ORGANIZATION. THE NIKE BRAND SEGMENTS ARE DEFINED BY GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS FOR OPERATIONS PARTICIPATING IN NIKE BRAND SALES ACTIVITY.  EACH NIKE BRAND GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT OPERATES PREDOMINANTLY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR, APPAREL AND EQUIPMENT. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS FOR THE NIKE BRAND ARE: NORTH AMERICA; EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA (EMEA); GREATER CHINA; AND ASIA PACIFIC & LATIN AMERICA (APLA), AND INCLUDE RESULTS FOR THE NIKE, JORDAN AND HURLEY BRANDS. THE COMPANY'S NIKE DIRECT OPERATIONS ARE MANAGED WITHIN EACH GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT. CONVERSE IS ALSO A REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENT FOR THE COMPANY, AND OPERATES PREDOMINATELY IN ONE INDUSTRY: THE DESIGN, MARKETING, LICENSING AND SELLING OF ATHLETIC LIFESTYLE SNEAKERS, APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES.  AS PART OF OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ARE ASSIGNED TWICE PER YEAR TO EACH NIKE BRAND ENTITY IN OUR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE. THESE RATES ARE SET APPROXIMATELY NINE AND TWELVE MONTHS IN ADVANCE OF THE FUTURE SELLING SEASONS TO WHICH THEY RELATE (SPECIFICALLY, FOR EACH CURRENCY, ONE STANDARD RATE APPLIES TO THE FALL AND HOLIDAY SELLING SEASONS AND ONE STANDARD RATE APPLIES TO THE SPRING AND SUMMER SELLING SEASONS) BASED ON AVERAGE MARKET SPOT RATES IN THE CALENDAR MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE THEY ARE ESTABLISHED. INVENTORIES AND COST OF SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS AND CONVERSE REFLECT THE USE OF THESE STANDARD RATES TO RECORD NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PURCHASES INTO THE ENTITY'S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ASSIGNED STANDARD FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND ACTUAL MARKET RATES ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE, TOGETHER WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED FROM OUR CENTRALLY MANAGED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND OTHER CONVERSION GAINS AND LOSSES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES  OVERVIEW  AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO LESSEN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS MATERIAL TO NIKE, INC. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON THE UNDERLYING NET EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WHERE EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, OUR PROGRAM HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY IS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AS OF AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM OR STRATEGY FROM WHAT WAS DISCLOSED WITHIN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  REFER TO  NOTE 4 \u2014 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  AND  NOTE 9 \u2014 RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT EACH REPORTED PERIOD END. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE TRANSACTIONS WHICH SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.  \u2022  PRODUCT COSTS \u2014 PRODUCT PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE TRANSACTING ENTITY AND FACTORY INPUT COSTS FROM THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN FACTORIES.  \u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES \u2014 A PORTION OF OUR NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPEAN OPERATIONS ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G., THE BRITISH POUND) BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE SALES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.  \u2022  OTHER COSTS \u2014 NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, ALSO GENERATE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK, THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT.  \u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \u2014 OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND MAY ALSO ELECT TO USE CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE REMAINING EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES, NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES AND OTHER COSTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.  TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  MANY OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS, OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  WITHIN  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  . THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED  REVENUES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $313 MILLION AND A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $29 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $86 MILLION AND A BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  MANAGEMENT GENERALLY IDENTIFIES HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKETS AS THOSE MARKETS WHOSE CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD EXCEEDS 100%. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY WITHIN OUR APLA OPERATING SEGMENT IS OPERATING IN A HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKET. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019  , THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY CHANGED FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN FUTURE PERIODS BASED ON CURRENT RATES.  MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING, CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS AT NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER U.S. GAAP. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND/OR OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THE VARIABILITY OF THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THE COMBINATION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD. HEDGES OF THE PURCHASE OF U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.  WE ESTIMATE THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION ON OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOW ACTIVITY  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS  WAS  $394 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1,301 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME  , ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, GENERATED  $1,629 MILLION  OF OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $1,498 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS  OF  $1,235 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO  $197 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL RELATED TO INCREASES IN  INVENTORY  AND  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  , WHICH DECREASED  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS  BY  $245 MILLION  AND  $162 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY HIGHER PAYMENTS RELATED TO COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WAS AN OUTFLOW OF  $348 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $333 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WAS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED AS THE  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING SALES, MATURITIES AND PURCHASES) WAS RELATIVELY FLAT, AND LOWER ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, WERE OFFSET BY OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  WAS  $1,010 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO  $1,832 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST THREE MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  , WITH THE DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN  NOTES PAYABLE  , PRIMARILY FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, AS WELL AS LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES.  DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE REPURCHASED  11.9 MILLION  SHARES OF NIKE'S CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR  $995 MILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $83.87  PER SHARE) UNDER THE FOUR-YEAR,  $15 BILLION  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2018. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD REPURCHASED  23.5 MILLION  SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.0 BILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $84.29  PER SHARE) UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT FUNDING OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL COME FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXCESS CASH AND/OR PROCEEDS FROM DEBT.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JULY 23, 2019, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (THE \u201cSHELF\u201d) WITH THE SEC WHICH PERMITS US TO ISSUE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. THE SHELF EXPIRES ON JULY 23, 2022.  ON AUGUST 16, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS WHICH PROVIDES FOR UP TO $2 BILLION OF BORROWINGS, WITH THE OPTION TO INCREASE BORROWINGS UP TO $3 BILLION IN TOTAL UPON LENDER APPROVAL. THE FACILITY MATURES ON AUGUST 16, 2024, WITH A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION PRIOR TO ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, PROVIDED THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL IT EXTEND BEYOND AUGUST 16, 2026. THIS FACILITY REPLACES THE PRIOR $2 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON AUGUST 28, 2015, WHICH WOULD HAVE MATURED AUGUST 28, 2020. AS OF AND FOR THE PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND MAY 31, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF AA- AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN-OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS IN THE SYNDICATE, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $2 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT ANY POINT WAS $1.0 BILLION. AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD $225 MILLION IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE OF 2.10%. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31, 2019. WE MAY CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT SECURITIES DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1+ AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.  TO DATE, IN  FISCAL 2020  , WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CREDIT MARKETS OR INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS; HOWEVER, FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS.  AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING  $3.6 BILLION  , PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTMENT GRADE TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT RISK. WHILE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES HAVE VARYING DURATIONS, AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2019  , THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DAYS TO MATURITY OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO WAS  27  DAYS.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO  NOTE 1 \u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "NIKE, Inc.", "CIK": 320187, "Date": "2019-10-04T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NKE", "Name": "Nike Inc", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3021.0, "Business": "OR", "Incorporated": "OR", "IRS": 930584541.0, "key": "20191004NKE", "labelr1": 0.10744600838079783, "labelr2": -1.5240957389717738, "labelr3": 0.8392370572207042, "labelr4": 0.5188067444876826, "pred": 1.0, "prof-1": 0.49243826, "prof1": 0.50756174, "return1&2": 0.985817126893736, "return1&2&3": 0.9940904695390568, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9992478779413344, "return2": 0.9847590426102822, "return1": 1.001074460083808, "return3": 1.0083923705722069, "return4": 1.0051880674448768, "1_day_return": 0.107446008380796, "cumulative_return1": 0.011445916371851474, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 2443, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.001074460083808, "cumreturn1b": 1.0236743586042147, "cumreturn1c": 0.9758034817975486, "cumreturndow": 1.0177239759190244, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0153152430288028}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2454, "level_0": 2519, "index": 76403, "text": "ITEM 2.

THE FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MARYLAND CORPORATION THAT HAS ELECTED TO BE TREATED AS A BDC UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, AS AMENDED (THE \u201c1940  ACT\u201d). OUR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO CREATE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED RETURNS BY GENERATING CURRENT INCOME AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION FROM OUR INVESTMENTS. WE INVEST PRIMARILY IN SENIOR AND UNITRANCHE LEVERAGED LOANS AND MEZZANINE DEBT  ISSUED BY PRIVATE U.S. MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES, WHICH WE DEFINE AS COMPANIES HAVING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAX, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) OF BETWEEN $2 MILLION AND $50 MILLION, BOTH THROUGH DIRECT LENDING AND  THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LOAN SYNDICATES. WE MAY ALSO INVEST UP TO 30.0% OF THE PORTFOLIO IN OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO SEEK TO ENHANCE RETURNS TO STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN DISTRESSED DEBT, WHICH MAY  INCLUDE SECURITIES OF COMPANIES IN BANKRUPTCY, FOREIGN DEBT, PRIVATE EQUITY, SECURITIES OF PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT ARE NOT THINLY TRADED AND STRUCTURED FINANCE VEHICLES SUCH AS COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO CURRENT  INTENTION TO DO SO, TO THE EXTENT WE INVEST IN PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, WE WILL LIMIT OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE DEFINITION OF \u201cINVESTMENT COMPANY\u201d UNDER SECTION 3(C)(1) OR SECTION 3(C)(7) OF THE 1940  ACT, WHICH INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS, TO NO MORE THAN 15.0% OF ITS NET ASSETS. WE HAVE ELECTED AND QUALIFIED TO BE TREATED AS A RIC UNDER SUBCHAPTER M OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCODE\u201d).  CORPORATE HISTORY AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE COMMENCED OPERATIONS, AT THE TIME KNOWN AS GSC INVESTMENT CORP., ON MARCH 23, 2007 AND COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF SHARES OF  COMMON STOCK ON MARCH 28, 2007. PRIOR TO JULY 30, 2010, WE WERE EXTERNALLY MANAGED AND ADVISED BY GSCP (NJ), L.P., AN ENTITY AFFILIATED WITH GSC GROUP, INC. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF A RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION ON JULY 30, 2010,  AS DESCRIBED BELOW WE ENGAGED SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS (\u201cSIA\u201d) TO REPLACE GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND CHANGED OUR NAME TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP.  AS A RESULT OF THE EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER A REVOLVING SECURITIZED CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEUTSCHE BANK WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN PLACE, IN DECEMBER  2008 WE ENGAGED THE INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM OF STIFEL, NICOLAUS & COMPANY TO EVALUATE STRATEGIC TRANSACTION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES FOR US. ON APRIL 14, 2010, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH  SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES AND AN ASSIGNMENT, ASSUMPTION AND NOVATION AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSC INVESTMENT CORP. ASSUMED CERTAIN RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT  ADVISORS UNDER A DEBT COMMITMENT LETTER SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS RECEIVED FROM MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING LLC, WHICH INDICATED MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING\u2019S WILLINGNESS TO PROVIDE GSC INVESTMENT CORP. WITH A $40.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, SUBJECT TO THE SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, GSC INVESTMENT CORP. AND GSCP (NJ), L.P. ENTERED INTO A TERMINATION AND RELEASE AGREEMENT, TO BE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION  CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P., AMONG OTHER THINGS, AGREED TO WAIVE ANY AND ALL ACCRUED AND UNPAID DEFERRED INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEES UP TO AND AS OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE  STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT BUT CONTINUED TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THE BASE MANAGEMENT FEES EARNED THROUGH THE DATE OF THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED BY THE STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFFECTING AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INVESTMENT VALUATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION AND THE RECOGNITION OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEE EXPENSE AS OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED  TO THE MATTERS DESCRIBED BELOW. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOLLOWS.  INVESTMENT VALUATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INVESTMENTS AT FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD  (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT AND DISCLOSURES  (\u201cASC 820\u201d). ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FAIR  VALUE HIERARCHY BASED ON THE QUALITY OF INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND ENHANCES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. ASC 820 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO ASSUME THAT ITS INVESTMENTS ARE TO BE SOLD OR ITS LIABILITIES ARE TO BE  TRANSFERRED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE IN THE PRINCIPAL MARKET TO INDEPENDENT MARKET PARTICIPANTS, OR IN THE ABSENCE OF A PRINCIPAL MARKET, IN THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET, WHICH MAY BE A HYPOTHETICAL MARKET. MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE DEFINED AS BUYERS  AND SELLERS IN THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET THAT ARE INDEPENDENT, KNOWLEDGEABLE, AND WILLING AND ABLE TO TRANSACT.  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE READILY AVAILABLE ARE FAIR VALUED AT SUCH MARKET QUOTATIONS OBTAINED FROM INDEPENDENT  THIRD-PARTY  PRICING SERVICES AND MARKET MAKERS SUBJECT TO ANY DECISION BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO APPROVE A FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION TO REFLECT SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFFECTING THE VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. WE VALUE  INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE AT FAIR VALUE AS APPROVED, IN GOOD FAITH, BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS BASED ON INPUT FROM SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND A THIRD PARTY  INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM. DETERMINATIONS OF FAIR VALUE MAY INVOLVE SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE TYPES OF FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS INCLUDE THE NATURE AND REALIZABLE VALUE OF ANY  COLLATERAL, THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE PAYMENTS, MARKET YIELD TREND ANALYSIS, THE MARKETS IN WHICH THE PORTFOLIO COMPANY DOES BUSINESS, COMPARISON TO PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS.  WE UNDERTAKE A MULTI-STEP VALUATION PROCESS EACH QUARTER WHEN VALUING INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTATIONS ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, AS  DESCRIBED BELOW.  \u2022  EACH INVESTMENT IS INITIALLY VALUED BY THE RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND PRELIMINARY VALUATION CONCLUSIONS ARE DOCUMENTED AND DISCUSSED WITH OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT; AND  \u2022  AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM ENGAGED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWS A SELECTION OF THESE  PRELIMINARY VALUATIONS EACH QUARTER SO THAT THE VALUATION OF EACH INVESTMENT FOR WHICH MARKET QUOTES ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE IS REVIEWED BY THE INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM AT LEAST ONCE EACH FISCAL YEAR. WE USE A THIRD-PARTY INDEPENDENT VALUATION  FIRM TO VALUE OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SUBORDINATED NOTES OF SARATOGA CLO AND THE  CLASS F-R-2  NOTES AND  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES OF THE SARATOGA CLOS EVERY QUARTER.  IN ADDITION, ALL OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING VALUATION PROCESS.  \u2022  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS REVIEWS AND APPROVES EACH PRELIMINARY VALUATION AND SARATOGA  INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (IF APPLICABLE) WILL SUPPLEMENT THE PRELIMINARY VALUATION TO REFLECT ANY COMMENTS PROVIDED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE; AND  \u2022  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DISCUSSES THE VALUATIONS AND APPROVES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH INVESTMENT, IN GOOD FAITH,  BASED ON THE INPUT OF SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM (TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE) AND THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH IS BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH  FLOW MODEL THAT UTILIZES PREPAYMENT,  RE-INVESTMENT  AND LOSS ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND PROJECTED PERFORMANCE, ECONOMIC FACTORS, THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING CASH FLOW, AND  COMPARABLE YIELDS FOR EQUITY INTERESTS IN COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATION FUNDS SIMILAR TO SARATOGA CLO, WHEN AVAILABLE, AS DETERMINED BY SIA AND RECOMMENDED TO OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. SPECIFICALLY, WE USE INTEX CASH FLOW MODELS, OR AN APPROPRIATE  SUBSTITUTE, TO FORM THE BASIS FOR THE VALUATION OF OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO. THE MODELS USE A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING PROJECTED DEFAULT RATES, RECOVERY RATES, REINVESTMENT RATE AND PREPAYMENT RATES IN ORDER TO ARRIVE AT ESTIMATED  VALUATIONS. THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE BASED ON AVAILABLE MARKET DATA AND PROJECTIONS PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES. WE USE THE OUTPUT FROM THE INTEX MODELS (I.E., THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS) TO PERFORM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW  ANALYSIS ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS TO DETERMINE A VALUATION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  INCOME RECOGNITION  INTEREST INCOME,  ADJUSTED FOR AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUM AND ACCRETION OF DISCOUNT, IS RECORDED ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THE COMPANY STOPS ACCRUING INTEREST ON ITS INVESTMENTS WHEN IT IS DETERMINED THAT INTEREST  IS NO LONGER COLLECTIBLE. DISCOUNTS AND PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS PURCHASED ARE ACCRETED/AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RESPECTIVE INVESTMENT USING THE EFFECTIVE YIELD METHOD. THE AMORTIZED COST OF INVESTMENTS REPRESENTS THE ORIGINAL COST ADJUSTED FOR  THE ACCRETION OF DISCOUNTS AND AMORTIZATION OF PREMIUMS ON INVESTMENTS.  LOANS ARE GENERALLY PLACED ON NON-ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN THERE IS  REASONABLE DOUBT THAT PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST WILL BE COLLECTED. ACCRUED INTEREST IS GENERALLY RESERVED WHEN A LOAN IS PLACED ON  NON-ACCRUAL  STATUS. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON NON-ACCRUAL LOANS MAY BE  RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION IN PRINCIPAL DEPENDING UPON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT REGARDING COLLECTABILITY.  NON-ACCRUAL  LOANS ARE RESTORED TO ACCRUAL STATUS WHEN PAST DUE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS PAID AND, IN  MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT, ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN CURRENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE EXCEPTIONS TO THIS GENERAL RULE IF THE LOAN HAS SUFFICIENT COLLATERAL VALUE AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF COLLECTION.  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  INTEREST  THE COMPANY HOLDS DEBT AND PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ITS PORTFOLIO THAT CONTAIN A  PAYMENT-IN-KIND  (\u201cPIK\u201d) INTEREST PROVISION. THE PIK INTEREST, WHICH REPRESENTS CONTRACTUALLY DEFERRED INTEREST ADDED TO THE INVESTMENT BALANCE THAT IS GENERALLY DUE AT MATURITY, IS GENERALLY RECORDED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS TO THE EXTENT SUCH AMOUNTS ARE  EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. WE STOP ACCRUING PIK INTEREST IF WE DO NOT EXPECT THE ISSUER TO BE ABLE TO PAY ALL PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WHEN DUE.  REVENUES  WE GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF INTEREST INCOME AND CAPITAL GAINS ON THE DEBT INVESTMENTS THAT WE HOLD AND CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY,  ON EQUITY INTERESTS THAT WE MAY ACQUIRE. WE EXPECT OUR DEBT INVESTMENTS, WHETHER IN THE FORM OF LEVERAGED LOANS OR MEZZANINE DEBT, TO HAVE TERMS OF UP TO TEN YEARS, AND TO BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A FIXED OR FLOATING RATE. INTEREST ON DEBT WILL BE  PAYABLE GENERALLY EITHER QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUALLY. IN SOME CASES, OUR DEBT OR PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY PROVIDE FOR A PORTION OR ALL OF THE INTEREST TO BE PIK. TO THE EXTENT INTEREST IS PIK, IT WILL BE PAYABLE THROUGH THE INCREASE OF THE  PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE OBLIGATION BY THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST DUE ON THE THEN-OUTSTANDING AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH OBLIGATION. THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE DEBT AND ANY ACCRUED BUT UNPAID INTEREST WILL GENERALLY BECOME DUE AT THE MATURITY  DATE. IN ADDITION, WE MAY GENERATE REVENUE IN THE FORM OF COMMITMENT, ORIGINATION, STRUCTURING OR DILIGENCE FEES, FEES FOR PROVIDING MANAGERIAL ASSISTANCE OR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND POSSIBLY CONSULTING FEES. ANY SUCH FEES WILL BE  GENERATED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZED AS EARNED. WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN PREFERRED EQUITY OR COMMON EQUITY SECURITIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS ON A CURRENT BASIS.  ON JANUARY 22, 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLATERAL MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WITH SARATOGA CLO, PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ACT AS ITS COLLATERAL  MANAGER. THE SARATOGA CLO WAS INITIALLY REFINANCED IN OCTOBER 2013 WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER 2016. ON NOVEMBER 15, 2016, WE COMPLETED A SECOND REFINANCING OF THE SARATOGA CLO WITH ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD EXTENDED TO OCTOBER  2018.  ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE COMPLETED A THIRD REFINANCING AND UPSIZE OF THE SARATOGA CLO. THE THIRD SARATOGA CLO REFINANCING,  AMONG OTHER THINGS, EXTENDED ITS REINVESTMENT PERIOD TO JANUARY 2021, AND EXTENDED ITS LEGAL MATURITY DATE TO JANUARY 2030. A  NON-CALL  PERIOD OF JANUARY 2020 WAS ALSO ADDED. FOLLOWING THIS REFINANCING, THE  SARATOGA CLO PORTFOLIO INCREASED FROM APPROXIMATELY $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT TO APPROXIMATELY $500.0 MILLION OF PREDOMINANTLY SENIOR SECURED FIRST LIEN TERM LOANS. IN ADDITION TO REFINANCING ITS LIABILITIES, WE INVESTED  AN ADDITIONAL $13.8 MILLION IN ALL OF THE NEWLY ISSUED SUBORDINATED NOTES OF THE SARATOGA CLO AND ALSO PURCHASED $2.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS F-R-2  AND $7.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE  CLASS G-R-2  NOTES TRANCHES AT PAR, WITH A COUPON OF LIBOR PLUS 8.75% AND LIBOR PLUS 10.00%, RESPECTIVELY. AS PART OF THIS REFINANCING, WE ALSO REDEEMED OUR EXISTING  $4.5 MILLION AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE CLASS F NOTES TRANCHE AT PAR.  THE SARATOGA CLO REMAINS EFFECTIVELY 100% OWNED AND MANAGED  BY SARATOGA INVESTMENT CORP. WE RECEIVE A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.10% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.40% PER ANNUM OF THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE  PROCEEDS. PRIOR TO THE SECOND REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  AMENDED CLO NOTES, WE RECEIVED A BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM AND A SUBORDINATED MANAGEMENT FEE OF 0.25% PER ANNUM OF THE  OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SARATOGA CLO\u2019S ASSETS, PAID QUARTERLY TO THE EXTENT OF AVAILABLE PROCEEDS.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOLLOWING THE THIRD REFINANCING AND THE ISSUANCE OF THE  2013-1  RESET CLO NOTES ON DECEMBER 14, 2018, WE ARE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO AN INCENTIVE MANAGEMENT FEE EQUAL TO 20.0% OF EXCESS CASH FLOW TO THE EXTENT THE SARATOGA CLO SUBORDINATED NOTES RECEIVE AN  INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN PAID IN CASH EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 12.0%.  INTEREST INCOME ON OUR INVESTMENT IN SARATOGA CLO IS RECORDED USING  THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC TOPIC  325-40,  INVESTMENTS-OTHER, BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS  (\u201cASC  325-40\u201d),  BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED YIELD AND THE ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE PROJECTED LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT. YIELDS ARE REVISED WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES IN ACTUAL OR ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES  IN PREPAYMENTS AND/OR RE-INVESTMENTS, CREDIT LOSSES OR ASSET PRICING. CHANGES IN ESTIMATED YIELD ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE ESTIMATED YIELD OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INVESTMENT FROM THE DATE THE ESTIMATED YIELD WAS CHANGED.  ASC 606  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU  2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u201d), WHICH SUPERSEDES THE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS IN REVENUE RECOGNITION (ASC 605). UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY SHOULD  RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, ASU  2016-12  AMENDED ASU 2014-09 AND DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE PERIOD FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2017. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE MAJORITY OF ITS REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  ARE SCOPED OUT OF ASC 606, AND HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT RELATES TO THE TIMING OF THE RECOGNITION OF THE CLO INCENTIVE FEE INCOME. WE ADOPTED ASC 606 UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH USING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT  PROVIDED FOR, THEREFORE THE PRESENTATION OF PRIOR PERIODS HAS NOT BEEN ADJUSTED.  EXPENSES  OUR PRIMARY OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE THE PAYMENT OF INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS  INSURANCE, FEES PAID TO INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS AND ADMINISTRATOR EXPENSES, INCLUDING OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF OUR ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD. OUR INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMPENSATE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER FOR ITS WORK IN  IDENTIFYING, EVALUATING, NEGOTIATING, CLOSING AND MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BEAR ALL OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES OF OUR OPERATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO.  \u2022  ORGANIZATION;  \u2022  CALCULATING OUR NET ASSET VALUE (INCLUDING THE COST AND EXPENSES OF ANY INDEPENDENT VALUATION FIRM);  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER  ADVISERS, IN MONITORING OUR FINANCIAL AND LEGAL AFFAIRS AND IN MONITORING OUR INVESTMENTS AND PERFORMING DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO COMPANIES;  \u2022  EXPENSES INCURRED BY OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER PAYABLE FOR TRAVEL AND DUE DILIGENCE ON OUR PROSPECTIVE PORTFOLIO  COMPANIES;  \u2022  INTEREST PAYABLE ON DEBT, IF ANY, INCURRED TO FINANCE OUR INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES;  \u2022  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT FEES;  \u2022  FEES PAYABLE TO THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING AGENTS, CONSULTANTS OR OTHER ADVISERS, RELATING TO, OR ASSOCIATED WITH,  EVALUATING AND MAKING INVESTMENTS;  \u2022  TRANSFER AGENT AND CUSTODIAL FEES;  \u2022  FEDERAL AND STATE REGISTRATION FEES;  \u2022  ALL COSTS OF REGISTRATION AND LISTING OUR COMMON STOCK ON ANY SECURITIES EXCHANGE;  \u2022  FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES;  \u2022  INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS\u2019 FEES AND EXPENSES;  \u2022  COSTS OF PREPARING AND FILING REPORTS OR OTHER DOCUMENTS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENTAL BODIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) AND THE SBA);  \u2022  COSTS OF ANY REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS OR OTHER NOTICES TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS INCLUDING PRINTING COSTS;  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  OUR FIDELITY BOND, DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS ERRORS AND OMISSIONS LIABILITY INSURANCE, AND ANY OTHER INSURANCE  PREMIUMS;  \u2022  DIRECT COSTS AND EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION, INCLUDING PRINTING, MAILING, LONG DISTANCE TELEPHONE, COPYING,  SECRETARIAL AND OTHER STAFF, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS AND OUTSIDE LEGAL COSTS; AND  \u2022  ADMINISTRATION FEES AND ALL OTHER EXPENSES INCURRED BY US OR, IF APPLICABLE, THE ADMINISTRATOR IN CONNECTION WITH  ADMINISTERING OUR BUSINESS (INCLUDING PAYMENTS UNDER THE ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT BASED UPON OUR ALLOCABLE PORTION OF THE ADMINISTRATOR\u2019S OVERHEAD IN PERFORMING ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER AN ADMINISTRATION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING RENT AND THE ALLOCABLE  PORTION OF THE COST OF OUR OFFICERS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE STAFFS (INCLUDING TRAVEL EXPENSES)).  PURSUANT TO THE  INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WE HAD WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE HAD AGREED TO PAY GSCP (NJ), L.P. AS INVESTMENT ADVISER A QUARTERLY BASE MANAGEMENT FEE OF 1.75% OF THE AVERAGE VALUE  OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS (OTHER THAN CASH OR CASH EQUIVALENTS BUT INCLUDING ASSETS PURCHASED WITH BORROWED FUNDS) AT THE END OF THE TWO MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTERS AND AN INCENTIVE FEE.  THE INCENTIVE FEE HAD TWO PARTS.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR PRE-INCENTIVE FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME, EXPRESSED AS  A RATE OF RETURN ON THE VALUE OF THE NET ASSETS AT THE END OF THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING QUARTER, THAT EXCEEDED A 1.875% QUARTERLY HURDLE RATE MEASURED AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER. UNDER THIS PROVISION, IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER, OUR INVESTMENT  ADVISER RECEIVED NO INCENTIVE FEE UNLESS OUR  PRE-INCENTIVE  FEE NET INVESTMENT INCOME EXCEEDED THE HURDLE RATE OF 1.875%. AMOUNTS RECEIVED AS A RETURN OF CAPITAL WERE NOT INCLUDED IN CALCULATING THIS PORTION OF  THE INCENTIVE FEE. SINCE THE HURDLE RATE WAS BASED ON NET ASSETS, A RETURN OF LESS THAN THE HURDLE RATE ON TOTAL ASSETS COULD STILL HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCENTIVE FEE.  \u2022  A FEE, PAYABLE AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, EQUAL TO 20.0% OF OUR NET REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, COMPUTED  NET OF ALL REALIZED CAPITAL LOSSES AND UNREALIZED CAPITAL DEPRECIATION, IN EACH CASE ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS ON EACH INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S PORTFOLIO, LESS THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL GAINS INCENTIVE FEES PAID TO THE INVESTMENT ADVISER  THROUGH SUCH DATE.  WE DEFERRED CASH PAYMENT OF ANY INCENTIVE FEE OTHERWISE EARNED BY OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER IF,  DURING THE THEN MOST RECENT FOUR FULL FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH PAYMENT WAS TO BE MADE, THE SUM OF (A) OUR AGGREGATE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND (B) OUR CHANGE IN NET ASSETS (DEFINED AS TOTAL ASSETS LESS  LIABILITIES) (BEFORE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ANY INCENTIVE FEES PAYABLE DURING THAT PERIOD) WAS LESS THAN 7.5% OF OUR NET ASSETS AT THE BEGINNING OF SUCH PERIOD. THESE CALCULATIONS WERE APPROPRIATELY  PRO-RATED  FOR  THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF OPERATION AND ADJUSTED FOR ANY SHARE ISSUANCES OR REPURCHASES DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. SUCH INCENTIVE FEE WOULD BECOME PAYABLE ON THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH SUCH TEST HAD BEEN SATISFIED FOR THE MOST RECENT FOUR  FULL FISCAL QUARTERS OR UPON CERTAIN TERMINATIONS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT. WE COMMENCED DEFERRING CASH PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE FEES DURING THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2007 AND CONTINUED TO DEFER SUCH PAYMENTS  THROUGH THE QUARTERLY PERIOD ENDED MAY 31, 2010. AS OF JULY 30, 2010, THE DATE ON WHICH GSCP (NJ), L.P. CEASED TO BE OUR INVESTMENT ADVISER AND ADMINISTRATOR, WE OWED GSCP (NJ), L.P. $2.9 MILLION IN FEES FOR SERVICES PREVIOUSLY  PROVIDED TO US; OF WHICH $0.3 MILLION HAS BEEN PAID BY US. GSCP (NJ), L.P. AGREED TO WAIVE PAYMENT BY US OF THE REMAINING $2.6 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSUMMATION OF THE STOCK PURCHASE TRANSACTION WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS  AND CERTAIN OF ITS AFFILIATES DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT  WITH SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT ADVISER, ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SIMILAR TO THE TERMS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT WE HAD ENTERED INTO WITH GSCP (NJ), L.P., OUR FORMER INVESTMENT ADVISER, EXCEPT FOR THE  FOLLOWING MATERIAL DISTINCTIONS IN THE FEE TERMS.  \u2022  THE CAPITAL GAINS PORTION OF THE INCENTIVE FEE WAS RESET WITH RESPECT TO GAINS AND LOSSES FROM MAY 31, 2010, AND  THEREFORE LOSSES AND GAINS INCURRED PRIOR TO SUCH TIME WILL NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN CALCULATING THE CAPITAL GAINS FEE PAYABLE TO SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS AND, AS A RESULT, SARATOGA INVESTMENT ADVISORS WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20.0% OF NET  GAINS THAT ARISE AFTER MAY 31, 2010.

THE CHANGES AFFECT ALL COMPANIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT DISCLOSURES. IN GENERAL, THE AMENDMENTS IN ASU  2018-13  ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019.

IN THIS REGARD, BECAUSE OUR  COMMON STOCK HAS HISTORICALLY TRADED AT A PRICE BELOW OUR CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE AND WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO SELL OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE BELOW NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE, WE HAVE BEEN AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE LIMITED IN OUR  ABILITY TO RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL.  IN ADDITION, WE INTEND TO DISTRIBUTE TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR TAXABLE INCOME IN  ORDER TO SATISFY THE DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT APPLICABLE TO RICS UNDER THE CODE. IN SATISFYING THIS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT, WE HAVE IN THE PAST RELIED ON INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\u201cIRS\u201d) ISSUED PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS CONCLUDING THAT A  RIC MAY TREAT A DISTRIBUTION OF ITS OWN STOCK AS FULFILLING ITS RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS IF EACH STOCKHOLDER MAY ELECT TO RECEIVE HIS OR HER ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION IN EITHER CASH OR STOCK OF THE RIC SUBJECT TO A LIMITATION ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT  OF CASH TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH LIMITATION MUST BE AT LEAST 20.0% OF THE AGGREGATE DECLARED DISTRIBUTION. WE MAY RELY ON THESE IRS PRIVATE LETTER RULINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS TO SATISFY OUR RIC DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALSO, AS A BDC, WE GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL ASSETS, LESS  LIABILITIES AND INDEBTEDNESS NOT REPRESENTED BY SENIOR SECURITIES, TO TOTAL SENIOR SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE ALL OF OUR BORROWINGS AND ANY OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK, OF AT LEAST 200.0%, REDUCED TO 150.0% EFFECTIVE APRIL 16, 2019 FOLLOWING THE  APPROVAL RECEIVED FROM THE  NON-INTERESTED  BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON APRIL 16, 2018.

TO FUND GROWTH IN OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IN THE FUTURE, WE ANTICIPATE NEEDING TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL FROM VARIOUS SOURCES, INCLUDING THE EQUITY MARKETS AND OTHER DEBT-RELATED  MARKETS, WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.  CONSEQUENTLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUNDS OR THE ABILITY TO FUND  NEW INVESTMENTS, TO MAKE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, TO FUND OUR UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS TO PORTFOLIO COMPANIES OR TO REPAY BORROWINGS. ALSO, THE ILLIQUIDITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS MAY MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO SELL THESE  INVESTMENTS WHEN DESIRED AND, IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO SELL THESE INVESTMENTS, WE MAY REALIZE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THEIR RECORDED VALUE.  MADISON  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  BELOW IS A SUMMARY OF THE TERMS OF THE SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WE ENTERED INTO WITH  MADISON CAPITAL FUNDING  LLC (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d) ON JUNE 30, 2010, WHICH WAS MOST RECENTLY AMENDED ON MAY 18, 2017.  AVAILABILITY.  THE COMPANY CAN DRAW UP TO THE LESSER OF (I) $40.0 MILLION (THE \u201cFACILITY AMOUNT\u201d) AND (II) THE  PRODUCT OF THE APPLICABLE ADVANCE RATE (WHICH VARIES FROM 50.0% TO 75.0% DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSET) AND THE VALUE, DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE\u201d), OF CERTAIN  \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d LOAN ASSETS PLEDGED AS SECURITY FOR THE LOAN (THE \u201cBORROWING BASE\u201d), IN EACH CASE LESS (A) THE AMOUNT OF ANY UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS THE COMPANY HAS UNDER ANY LOAN ASSET AND WHICH ARE NOT COVERED BY AMOUNTS IN  THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT REFERRED TO BELOW (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE AMOUNT\u201d) AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. EACH LOAN ASSET HELD BY THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS CLOSED WAS VALUED AS OF THAT DATE AND EACH  LOAN ASSET THAT THE COMPANY ACQUIRES AFTER SUCH DATE WILL BE VALUED AT THE LOWEST OF ITS FAIR VALUE, ITS FACE VALUE (EXCLUDING ACCRUED INTEREST) AND THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR SUCH LOAN ASSET. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUE OF A LOAN ASSET WILL BE MADE  TO REFLECT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN ITS FAIR VALUE, A DEFAULT BY THE OBLIGOR ON THE LOAN ASSET, INSOLVENCY OF THE OBLIGOR, ACCELERATION OF THE LOAN ASSET, AND CERTAIN MODIFICATIONS TO THE TERMS OF THE LOAN ASSET.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS LIMITATIONS ON THE TYPE OF LOAN ASSETS THAT ARE \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BORROWING BASE AND AS  TO THE CONCENTRATION LEVEL OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF LOAN ASSETS IN THE BORROWING BASE SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS ON GEOGRAPHIC AND INDUSTRY CONCENTRATIONS, ASSET SIZE AND QUALITY, PAYMENT FREQUENCY, STATUS AND TERMS, AVERAGE LIFE, AND COLLATERAL  INTERESTS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PAYS THE LENDERS A COMMITMENT FEE OF 0.75% PER YEAR ON THE UNUSED AMOUNT OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE DURATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD (DEFINED BELOW). ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY. THE  COMPANY WAS ALSO OBLIGATED TO PAY CERTAIN OTHER FEES TO THE LENDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.

IN ADDITION TO SATISFYING THE BORROWING BASE  TEST, THE FOLLOWING TESTS MUST ALSO BE SATISFIED (TOGETHER WITH BORROWING BASE TEST, THE \u201cCOLLATERAL TESTS\u201d).  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF INTEREST COLLECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO  PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS, LESS CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES RELATING TO THE CREDIT FACILITY, TO ACCRUED INTEREST AND COMMITMENT FEES AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE LAST 6 PAYMENT PERIODS MUST EQUAL AT LEAST  175.0%.  \u2022  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO.  THE RATIO (EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE) OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING  VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS PLUS THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INELIGIBLE PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS AND THE CLO NOTES (IN EACH CASE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS) TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY PLUS THE UNFUNDED  EXPOSURE AMOUNT MUST EQUAL AT LEAST 200.0%.  \u2022  WEIGHTED AVERAGE FMV TEST.

SUCH PAYMENTS OR REPLACEMENTS MUST EQUAL  THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE BORROWING BASE IS OVERSTATED AS A RESULT OF SUCH BREACH OR ANY DEFICIENCY UNDER THE COLLATERAL TESTS AT THE TIME OF REPAYMENT OR REPLACEMENT. COMPLIANCE WITH THE COLLATERAL TESTS IS ALSO A CONDITION TO THE  DISCRETIONARY SALE OF PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS BY THE COMPANY.  PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS.  DURING THE REVOLVING PERIOD, THE PRIORITY OF  PAYMENTS PROVISIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRE, AFTER PAYMENT OF SPECIFIED FEES AND EXPENSES AND ANY NECESSARY FUNDING OF THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT, THAT COLLECTIONS OF PRINCIPAL FROM THE LOAN ASSETS AND, TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE ARE  INSUFFICIENT, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST FROM THE LOAN ASSETS, BE APPLIED ON EACH PAYMENT DATE TO PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IF THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AND THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO WOULD NOT OTHERWISE BE MET.  SIMILARLY, FOLLOWING TERMINATION OF THE REVOLVING PERIOD, COLLECTIONS OF INTEREST ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED, AFTER PAYMENT OF CERTAIN FEES AND EXPENSES, TO CURE ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BORROWING BASE TEST, THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO AND THE  OVERCOLLATERALIZATION RATIO AS OF THE RELEVANT PAYMENT DATE.  RESERVE ACCOUNT.  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO SET  ASIDE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE SUM OF ACCRUED INTEREST, COMMITMENT FEES AND ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING THREE PAYMENT DATES (OR CORRESPONDING TO THREE PAYMENT PERIODS). IF FOR ANY MONTHLY PERIOD DURING WHICH FEES  AND OTHER PAYMENTS ACCRUE, THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED LOAN ASSETS WHICH DO NOT PAY CASH INTEREST AT LEAST QUARTERLY EXCEEDS 15.0% OF THE AGGREGATE ADJUSTED BORROWING VALUE OF \u201cELIGIBLE\u201d PLEDGED  LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE SUCH INTEREST AND FEES DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING SIX PAYMENT DATES. AMOUNTS IN THE RESERVE ACCOUNT CAN BE APPLIED SOLELY TO THE PAYMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT FEES, COMMITMENT FEES,  ACCRUED AND UNPAID INTEREST AND ANY BREAKAGE COSTS PAYABLE TO THE LENDERS.  UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT.  WITH RESPECT TO REVOLVER OR  DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SET ASIDE IN A DESIGNATED ACCOUNT (THE \u201cUNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT\u201d) 100.0% OF ITS OUTSTANDING AND UNDRAWN FUNDING COMMITMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SUCH LOAN ASSETS. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE  ACCOUNT IS FUNDED AT THE TIME THE COMPANY ACQUIRES A REVOLVER OR DELAYED DRAW LOAN ASSET AND REQUESTS A RELATED BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. THE UNFUNDED EXPOSURE ACCOUNT IS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PROCEEDS OF THE REQUESTED BORROWING  AND OTHER COMPANY FUNDS, AND IF FOR ANY REASON SUCH AMOUNTS ARE INSUFFICIENT, THROUGH APPLICATION OF THE PRIORITY OF PAYMENT PROVISIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  SEPTEMBER 2019  QUARTER FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  OUR PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE  SEPTEMBER 2019  QUARTER WAS  $1.9 BILLION  , REPRESENTING A  $259 MILLION  INCREASE  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM A  5.1%  INCREASE IN REVENUE. PRE-TAX INCOME, ADJUSTED (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) WAS  $2.0 BILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF  $361 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  REVENUE.  COMPARED TO THE  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER, OUR OPERATING REVENUE  INCREASED  $607 MILLION  , OR  5.1%  , PRIMARILY FROM GROWTH IN ALL COMPONENTS OF PASSENGER REVENUE, WITH PREMIUM PRODUCT TICKET REVENUE DRIVING MORE THAN HALF OF THE IMPROVEMENT, AND STRONG GROWTH IN BOTH LOYALTY AND MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL (\"MRO\") REVENUE. THE IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING REVENUE ON  3.9%  HIGHER  CAPACITY GENERATED A  1.1%  INCREASE IN TOTAL REVENUE PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (\"TRASM\") AND A  2.5%  INCREASE IN TRASM, ADJUSTED (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) COMPARED TO THE  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSE.  TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSE  INCREASED  $181 MILLION  , OR  1.8%  , PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM HIGHER EMPLOYEE COSTS. OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING COST PER AVAILABLE SEAT MILE (\"CASM\")  DECREASED  2.1%  TO  13.85 CENTS  COMPARED TO THE  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER FUEL COSTS AND HIGHER CAPACITY. NON-FUEL UNIT COSTS (\"CASM-EX\" A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  INCREASED  2.4%  TO  9.84 CENTS  COMPARED TO THE  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER, DUE TO EMPLOYEE WAGE INCREASES, RECORD PASSENGER VOLUMES AND THE EFFECTS OF WEATHER-RELATED OPERATIONAL DISRUPTIONS.  NON-OPERATING RESULTS.  TOTAL NON-OPERATING EXPENSE WAS  $124 MILLION  IN THE  SEPTEMBER 2019  QUARTER COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $43 MILLION  IN THE SEPTEMBER 2018 QUARTER, PRIMARILY DUE TO UNREALIZED LOSSES ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  FREE CASH FLOW  . STRONG EARNINGS DURING THE QUARTER RESULTED IN  $2.2 BILLION  OF OPERATING CASH FLOW, ENABLING $945 MILLION OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS INCLUDING  $549 MILLION  OF AIRCRAFT PURCHASES AND CABIN ENHANCEMENTS. THESE RESULTS GENERATED  $1.4 BILLION  OF FREE CASH FLOW (A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE) COMPARED TO  $655 MILLION  IN THE SEPTEMBER 2018 QUARTER.

LOAD FACTOR  INCREASED  1.4 POINTS  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR TO  88.3%.  DOMESTIC UNIT REVENUE INCREASED  3.2%  , RESULTING FROM OUR COMMERCIAL INITIATIVES, INCLUDING OUR PREMIUM PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS HIGH LOAD FACTORS DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF STRONG DEMAND AND LIMITED INDUSTRY CAPACITY GROWTH.  PASSENGER REVENUE RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL REGIONS  INCREASED  1.1%  YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON CAPACITY INCREASES IN THE ATLANTIC AND PACIFIC REGIONS AND YIELD GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA. THIS GROWTH IN PASSENGER REVENUE WAS ACHIEVED DESPITE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  24  ATLANTIC UNIT REVENUE DECREASED DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND THE EURO AND BRITISH POUND, THE UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN EUROPE AND INCREASED INDUSTRY CAPACITY. THESE CONDITIONS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN PREMIUM PRODUCT DEMAND AND STRONG U.S. POINT OF SALE.  UNIT REVENUE INCREASED IN LATIN AMERICA FOR THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER AS A RESULT OF YIELD GROWTH, MAINLY IN BRAZIL ON REDUCED INDUSTRY CAPACITY FROM THE U.S. AND IN MEXICO BEACH MARKETS. UNIT REVENUE AND YIELD INCREASES WERE ACHIEVED DESPITE THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF HURRICANE DORIAN IN THE BAHAMAS.  IN THE SEPTEMBER 2019 QUARTER WE ANNOUNCED OUR PLAN TO ENTER INTO A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH LATAM, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO PROVIDE GREATER CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE, A MORE SEAMLESS TRAVEL EXPERIENCE AND TO BETTER CONNECT CUSTOMERS FROM AND THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS.  UNIT REVENUE DECREASED IN THE PACIFIC REGION PRIMARILY DUE TO DOUBLE-DIGIT CAPACITY GROWTH TO JAPAN AND KOREA FROM NEW ROUTES INTRODUCED OVER THE LAST YEAR, TRADE RELATED UNCERTAINTY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  WE CONTINUED TO RESHAPE OUR PACIFIC NETWORK WITH THE AUGUST ANNOUNCEMENT THAT BEGINNING IN MARCH 2020 WE WILL TRANSFER OUR U.S.-TOKYO SERVICES FROM NARITA TO HANEDA AIRPORT, TOKYO'S PREFERRED AIRPORT FOR CORPORATE CUSTOMERS.

THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE BRAND COMPONENT HAS INCREASED, RESULTING IN AN ADDITIONAL $130 MILLION PRIMARILY WITHIN OTHER REVENUE DURING THE  SEPTEMBER 2019  QUARTER. WE EXPECT THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION DURING 2019.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY INCLUDES AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES, OUR VACATION WHOLESALE OPERATIONS, OUR PRIVATE JET OPERATIONS AND REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH ARE AT OR NEAR COST, DECREASED  $102 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER.  SEPTEMBER 2018  QUARTER RESULTS ALSO INCLUDED  $63 MILLION  OF REVENUE FROM DGS, WHICH WAS SOLD IN DECEMBER 2018 AND IS NO LONGER REFLECTED IN ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.

THE INCREASE IN SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PAY RATE INCREASES FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THIS INCREASE IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALARIES FOR DGS EMPLOYEES, WHICH ARE NO LONGER INCLUDED IN SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS FOLLOWING THE SALE OF THAT BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018. DGS-RELATED EXPENSES ARE NOW RECORDED IN CONTRACTED SERVICES.  AIRCRAFT FUEL AND RELATED TAXES.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED  $185 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN APPROXIMATELY  6%  DECREASE IN THE MARKET PRICE PER GALLON OF JET FUEL, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  2%  INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION AND REDUCED PROFITABILITY AT OUR REFINERY.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND THE REASON FOR ADJUSTING FUEL EXPENSE, SEE \"SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\" BELOW.  CONTRACTED SERVICES  . THE INCREASE IN CONTRACTED SERVICES EXPENSE PREDOMINANTLY RELATES TO SERVICES PERFORMED BY DGS THAT WERE RECORDED IN SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THAT BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION.  THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION PRIMARILY RESULTS FROM  $93 MILLION  OF ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO THE DECISION TO EARLY RETIRE OUR MD-90 FLEET BY THE END OF 2022, NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES, FLEET MODIFICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS. SEE  NOTE 8  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE PLANNED EARLY RETIREMENT OF OUR MD-90 FLEET.  30  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MATERIALS AND OUTSIDE REPAIRS.  AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MATERIALS AND OUTSIDE REPAIRS CONSIST OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAINTENANCE OF AIRCRAFT USED IN OUR OPERATIONS. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RELATES TO A HIGHER VOLUME OF SCHEDULED ENGINE OVERHAULS ON CERTAIN AIRCRAFT DURING THE SEPTEMBER 2019 QUARTER.  PROFIT SHARING  . OUR PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM PAYS 10% TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES FOR THE FIRST $2.5 BILLION OF ANNUAL PROFIT AND 20% OF ANNUAL PROFIT ABOVE $2.5 BILLION.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY.  ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY INCLUDES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO THIRD PARTIES, OUR VACATION WHOLESALE OPERATIONS, OUR PRIVATE JET OPERATIONS AND REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES. REFINERY SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, WHICH ARE AT OR NEAR COST, DECREASED  $442 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . IN ADDITION, COSTS RELATED TO SERVICES PERFORMED BY DGS ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES WERE RECORDED IN ANCILLARY BUSINESSES AND REFINERY PRIOR TO THE SALE OF THAT BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2018. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN OUR MRO BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  31  NON-OPERATING RESULTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE)  2019  2018  FAVORABLE (UNFAVORABLE)  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  $(70  )  $(73  )  $3  $(228  )  $(244  )  $16  UNREALIZED GAIN/(LOSS) ON INVESTMENTS, NET  (35  )  50  (85  )  (17  )  (171  )  154  MISCELLANEOUS, NET  (19  )  66  (85  )  (174  )  48  (222  )  TOTAL NON-OPERATING (EXPENSE)/INCOME, NET  $(124  )  $43  $(167  )  $(419  )  $(367  )  $(52  )  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES ON OUR DEBT.

SEE  NOTE 4  OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  MISCELLANEOUS, NET IS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF EARNINGS/LOSSES FROM OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN VIRGIN ATLANTIC AND GRUPO AEROME\u0301XICO, PENSION-RELATED BENEFITS/COSTS, CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES. OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT EARNINGS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS/LOSSES VARY AND IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF MISCELLANEOUS, NET FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  INCOME TAXES  WE PROJECT THAT OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR  2019  WILL BE BETWEEN 23% AND 24%. IN CERTAIN INTERIM PERIODS, WE MAY HAVE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR NET DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN PRIOR YEAR ESTIMATES AND TAX LAWS ENACTED DURING THE PERIOD, WHICH WILL IMPACT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THAT INTERIM PERIOD.  REFINERY SEGMENT  THE REFINERY (\"MONROE\") PRIMARILY PRODUCES GASOLINE, DIESEL AND JET FUEL. MONROE EXCHANGES THE NON-JET FUEL PRODUCTS THE REFINERY PRODUCES WITH THIRD PARTIES FOR JET FUEL CONSUMED IN OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS. THE JET FUEL PRODUCED AND PROCURED THROUGH EXCHANGING GASOLINE AND DIESEL FUEL PRODUCED BY THE REFINERY PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY  200,000  BARRELS PER DAY, OR APPROXIMATELY 75% OF OUR CONSUMPTION, FOR USE IN OUR AIRLINE OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE JET FUEL SUPPLY RESULTING FROM THE REFINERY'S OPERATION CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING THE MARKET PRICE OF JET FUEL AND THUS LOWERS OUR COST OF JET FUEL COMPARED TO WHAT IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE.  THE REFINERY RECORDED OPERATING REVENUE OF  $1.5 BILLION  AND  $4.3 BILLION  IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $1.6 BILLION  AND  $4.8 BILLION  IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . OPERATING REVENUE IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF  $1.1 BILLION  AND  $3.0 BILLION  OF NON-JET FUEL PRODUCTS EXCHANGED WITH THIRD PARTIES TO PROCURE JET FUEL,  $304 MILLION  AND  $882 MILLION  OF SALES OF JET FUEL TO THE AIRLINE SEGMENT AND  $52 MILLION  AND  $360 MILLION  OF NON-JET FUEL PRODUCT SALES. REFINERY REVENUES DECREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO LOWER COSTS OF CRUDE OIL LEADING TO LOWER PRICING FOR ASSOCIATED REFINED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REFINERY RUN RATES DURING THE QUARTER.  THE REFINERY RECORDED OPERATING INCOME OF  $49 MILLION  AND  $52 MILLION  IN THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF  $12 MILLION  AND  $101 MILLION  IN  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  A REFINERY IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY REQUIREMENTS TO BLEND RENEWABLE FUELS INTO THE GASOLINE AND ON-ROAD DIESEL FUEL IT PRODUCES. ALTERNATIVELY, A REFINERY MAY PURCHASE RENEWABLE ENERGY CREDITS, CALLED RENEWABLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (\"RINS\"), FROM THIRD PARTIES IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. THE REFINERY PURCHASES THE MAJORITY OF ITS RINS REQUIREMENT IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.

(3)  IN THE SEPTEMBER 2019 QUARTER WE AND GOJET AIRLINES, LLC, AGREED NOT TO RENEW OUR CRJ-700 CONTRACT AND TO END THOSE OPERATIONS BY THE END OF 2020. THE SEVEN CRJ-900 ARE UNDER CONTRACT THROUGH 2022 AND SUBJECT TO FURTHER NEGOTIATION.  35  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR CASH NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WITH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $5.0 BILLION  IN UNRESTRICTED LIQUIDITY, CONSISTING OF  $1.9 BILLION  IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND  $3.1 BILLION  IN AVAILABLE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE USED EXISTING CASH, CASH RECEIVED FROM FINANCINGS AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $3.9 BILLION  AND RETURN  $2.5 BILLION  TO SHAREHOLDERS.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF  $7.5 BILLION  AND  $5.8 BILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE GENERATING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW IS IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  SEASONALITY OF ADVANCE TICKET SALES.  WE SELL TICKETS FOR AIR TRAVEL IN ADVANCE OF THE CUSTOMER'S TRAVEL DATE. WHEN WE RECEIVE A CASH PAYMENT AT THE TIME OF SALE, WE RECORD THE CASH RECEIVED ON ADVANCE SALES AS DEFERRED REVENUE IN AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY. THE AIR TRAFFIC LIABILITY INCREASES DURING THE WINTER AND SPRING AS ADVANCED TICKET SALES GROW PRIOR TO THE SUMMER PEAK TRAVEL SEASON AND DECREASES DURING THE SUMMER AND FALL MONTHS.  FUEL.  FUEL EXPENSE REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY  21%  OF OUR TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THE MARKET PRICE FOR JET FUEL IS VOLATILE, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE COMPARABILITY OF OUR PERIODIC CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS.  PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.  WE HAVE NO MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN  2019  . HOWEVER, WE VOLUNTARILY CONTRIBUTED $500 MILLION  TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS DURING THE JUNE 2019 QUARTER. DURING THE MARCH 2018 QUARTER WE ALSO VOLUNTARILY CONTRIBUTED $500 MILLION TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS.  PROFIT SHARING.  OUR BROAD-BASED EMPLOYEE PROFIT SHARING PROGRAM PROVIDES THAT FOR EACH YEAR IN WHICH WE HAVE AN ANNUAL PRE-TAX PROFIT, AS DEFINED BY THE TERMS OF THE PROGRAM, WE WILL PAY A SPECIFIED PORTION OF THAT PROFIT TO EMPLOYEES. IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT SHARING, THE PROGRAM DEFINES PROFIT AS PRE-TAX PROFIT ADJUSTED FOR PROFIT SHARING AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE ACCRUED  $1.3 BILLION  IN PROFIT SHARING EXPENSE BASED ON THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE AND CURRENT EXPECTATIONS FOR  2019  PROFIT.  WE PAID $1.3 BILLION IN PROFIT SHARING IN FEBRUARY  2019  RELATED TO OUR  2018  PRE-TAX PROFIT IN RECOGNITION OF OUR EMPLOYEES' CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD MEETING OUR FINANCIAL GOALS. THE 2019 PROFIT SHARING PAYMENT WILL BE MADE IN FEBRUARY 2020.  36  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  $3.9 BILLION  AND  $3.8 BILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASES OF AIRCRAFT, FLEET MODIFICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY ENHANCEMENTS.  WE HAVE COMMITTED TO FUTURE AIRCRAFT PURCHASES AND HAVE OBTAINED, BUT ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO USE, LONG-TERM FINANCING COMMITMENTS FOR A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF CERTAIN AIRCRAFT. OUR EXPECTED  2019  INVESTMENTS OF  $4.5 BILLION WILL BE PRIMARILY FOR AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING DELIVERIES AND ADVANCE DEPOSIT PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH RELATE TO CABIN ENHANCEMENTS THROUGHOUT OUR FLEET.  IN OCTOBER 2019, THE OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE ANNOUNCED A 10% TARIFF ON NEW AIRCRAFT IMPORTED FROM EUROPE. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT ON OUR FUTURE AIRBUS DELIVERIES.  EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  WE HAVE ACQUIRED  10%  OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF HANJIN-KAL, THE LARGEST SHAREHOLDER OF KOREAN AIR, DURING 2019  , FOR $170 MILLION.  IN THE SEPTEMBER 2019 QUARTER WE ANNOUNCED OUR PLAN TO ENTER INTO A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH LATAM AIRLINES GROUP S.A.  SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, SPECIFICALLY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE HART-SCOTT-RODINO ANTITRUST IMPROVEMENT ACT, WE PLAN TO COMMENCE A TENDER OFFER FOR THE ACQUISITION OF UP TO  20%  OF THE COMMON SHARES OF LATAM AT A PRICE PER SHARE OF  $16  , TO BE FUNDED WITH NEWLY ISSUED DEBT AND AVAILABLE CASH. IN ADDITION, TO SUPPORT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE STRATEGIC ALLIANCE, WE WILL INVEST  $350 MILLION  ,  $150 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS DISBURSED IN THE SEPTEMBER 2019 QUARTER.  AS PART OF OUR PLANNED STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH LATAM, WE HAVE ALSO AGREED TO ACQUIRE FOUR A350 AIRCRAFT FROM LATAM AND PLAN TO ASSUME TEN OF LATAM'S A350 PURCHASE COMMITMENTS FROM AIRBUS, WITH DELIVERIES THROUGH 2025.  THIS ALLIANCE IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE NEW GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, BUILDING UPON DELTA'S AND LATAM'S GLOBAL FOOTPRINT AND JOINT VENTURES, INCLUDING DELTA'S EXISTING PARTNERSHIP WITH AEROME\u0301XICO.  WE PLAN TO SELL OUR GOL OWNERSHIP STAKE AND WIND DOWN OUR COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS WITH GOL TO FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF OUR STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH LATAM.  LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (\"LAX\") CONSTRUCTION.  WE EXECUTED A MODIFIED LEASE AGREEMENT DURING 2016 WITH THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES (\"THE CITY\"), WHICH OWNS AND OPERATES LAX, AND ANNOUNCED PLANS TO MODERNIZE, UPGRADE AND CONNECT TERMINALS 2 AND 3 AT LAX. UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT, WE HAVE RELOCATED CERTAIN AIRLINES AND OTHER TENANTS LOCATED IN TERMINALS 2 AND 3 TO TERMINALS 5 AND 6 AND UNDERTAKEN VARIOUS INITIAL PROJECTS TO ENABLE OPERATIONS FROM TERMINALS 2 AND 3 DURING THE PROJECT. WE ARE NOW DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING THE REDEVELOPMENT OF TERMINAL 3 AND ENHANCEMENT OF TERMINAL 2, WHICH ALSO INCLUDES REBUILDING THE TICKETING AND ARRIVAL HALLS AND SECURITY CHECKPOINT, CONSTRUCTION OF CORE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE CITY'S PLANNED AIRPORT PEOPLE MOVER, RAMP IMPROVEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTION OF A SECURE CONNECTOR TO THE NORTH SIDE OF THE TOM BRADLEY INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL. CONSTRUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY 2024.  UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT PROJECT COMPONENT APPROVALS BY THE CITY'S BOARD OF AIRPORT COMMISSIONERS, THE CITY HAS APPROPRIATED TO DATE APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION TO PURCHASE COMPLETED PROJECT ASSETS. THE LEASE ALLOWS FOR A MAXIMUM REIMBURSEMENT BY THE CITY OF $1.8 BILLION. COSTS WE INCUR IN EXCESS OF SUCH A MAXIMUM WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED BY THE CITY.  A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE PROJECT COSTS WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH THE REGIONAL AIRPORTS IMPROVEMENT CORPORATION (\"RAIC\"), A CALIFORNIA PUBLIC BENEFIT CORPORATION, USING AN $800 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDED BY A GROUP OF LENDERS. THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS EXECUTED DURING 2017, AND WE HAVE GUARANTEED THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE RAIC UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. LOANS MADE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE REPAID WITH THE PROCEEDS FROM THE CITY\u2019S PURCHASE OF COMPLETED PROJECT ASSETS. USING FUNDING PROVIDED BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND/OR THE CREDIT FACILITY, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION ON THIS PROJECT DURING  2019  , OF WHICH $134 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  NEW YORK-LAGUARDIA REDEVELOPMENT.  AS PART OF THE TERMINAL REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY OF NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY (THE \u201cPORT AUTHORITY\u201d) TO REPLACE TERMINALS C AND D WITH A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART TERMINAL FACILITY CONSISTING OF 37 GATES ACROSS FOUR CONCOURSES CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL HEADHOUSE. THE TERMINAL WILL FEATURE A NEW, LARGER DELTA SKY CLUB, WIDER CONCOURSES, MORE GATE SEATING AND 30 PERCENT MORE CONCESSIONS SPACE THAN THE EXISTING TERMINALS. THE FACILITY WILL ALSO OFFER DIRECT ACCESS BETWEEN THE PARKING GARAGE AND TERMINAL AND IMPROVED ROADWAYS AND DROP-OFF/PICK-UP AREAS. THE DESIGN OF THE NEW TERMINAL WILL INTEGRATE SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGIES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY. CONSTRUCTION WILL BE PHASED TO LIMIT PASSENGER INCONVENIENCE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED BY 2026.  37  IN CONNECTION WITH THE REDEVELOPMENT, DURING 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED TERMINAL LEASE WITH THE PORT AUTHORITY WITH A TERM THROUGH 2050.

WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR NET PROJECT COST TO BE APPROXIMATELY $3.3 BILLION AND WE BEAR THE RISKS OF PROJECT CONSTRUCTION, INCLUDING ANY POTENTIAL COST OVER-RUNS. USING FUNDING PROVIDED BY CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND/OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, WE EXPECT TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $560 MILLION ON THIS PROJECT DURING  2019  , OF WHICH $430 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN TO ACCELERATE PLANNED 2019 REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  IN THE MARCH 2019 QUARTER, WE COMPLETED A $500 MILLION OFFERING OF PASS THROUGH CERTIFICATES, SERIES 2019-1 (\"2019-1 EETC\") THROUGH A PASS THROUGH TRUST. THE NET PROCEEDS OF THE OFFERING ARE BEING USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING TO REFINANCE DEBT MATURING DURING 2019.  THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF DEBT AND FINANCE LEASES WAS  $10.0 BILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  CAPITAL RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS.

THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR INTERIM AND ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. WE ADOPTED THIS STANDARD EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019 WITH THE ELECTION NOT TO RECLASSIFY  $1.2 BILLION  OF STRANDED TAX EFFECTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PENSION PLANS, FROM AOCI TO RETAINED EARNINGS.  39  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  WE SOMETIMES USE INFORMATION (\"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\") THAT IS DERIVED FROM THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUT THAT IS NOT PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES, NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BUT SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR OR SUPERIOR TO GAAP RESULTS.

WE BASE OUR ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES TO BE RELEVANT AT THE TIME OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED.  ON A REGULAR BASIS, MANAGEMENT REVIEWS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ASSUMPTIONS, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  23  TO ENSURE OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED FAIRLY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE DETERMINED WITH CERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES, AND SUCH DIFFERENCES COULD BE MATERIAL.  WE DESCRIBE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. S  IGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF OUR FORM 10-K, RELATE  TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842, LEASES, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 1 AND 4 TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, INVESTIGATIONS AND CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE NORMAL CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATING TO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL, EMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS. WE ESTIMATE AND ACCRUE OUR LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM SUCH MATTERS BASED UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STAGE OF THE PROCEEDING; POTENTIAL SETTLEMENT VALUE; ASSESSMENTS BY INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COUNSEL; AND ASSESSMENTS BY ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS AND CONSULTANTS OF POTENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND REMEDIATION COSTS.  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE ADEQUATELY ACCRUED FOR THESE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES; HOWEVER, FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES MAY CHANGE, SUCH AS NEW DEVELOPMENTS, OR A CHANGE IN APPROACH, INCLUDING A CHANGE IN SETTLEMENT STRATEGY OR IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION PLAN, THAT COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL LIABILITY TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATES, OR MAY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RECORDED LIABILITY BALANCES IN THE FUTURE.  OUR ESTIMATE OF LIABILITY AS A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY AND OUR REMAINING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REMEDIATE THE LOWER PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY AND OTHER SITES ARE ACCRUED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR AGGREGATE ENVIRONMENTAL RELATED ACCRUALS WERE $2.5 MILLION, OF WHICH $0.6 MILLION WAS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES, WITH THE REMAINDER INCLUDED IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AS RELATED TO CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, THE ACCRUAL WAS ESTIMATED AT THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES SINCE NO AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE IS A BETTER ESTIMATE THAN ANY OTHER AMOUNT.  IF WE HAD ACCRUED AT THE HIGH END OF THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, FOR THOSE SITES WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE OUR LIABILITY, OUR ACCRUAL WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION HIGHER.  THESE ACCRUALS CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DUE TO SUCH FACTORS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE NATURE OR EXTENT OF CONTAMINATION, THE METHODS OF REMEDIATION REQUIRED CHANGES IN THE APPORTIONMENT OF COSTS AMONG RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE AND OTHER ACTIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES OR PRIVATE PARTIES, OR THE IMPACT, IF ANY, OF BEING NAMED IN A NEW MATTER.

WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULTS OF ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS TO REFLECT ANY FUTURE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  OUR STRATEGIC PLAN FOCUSES ON.  \u2022  OWNING HIGH-QUALITY, DIFFERENTIATED OFFICE BUILDINGS IN THE BBDS OF OUR CORE MARKETS;  \u2022  IMPROVING THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR PROPERTIES THROUGH CONCENTRATED LEASING, ASSET MANAGEMENT, COST CONTROL AND CUSTOMER SERVICE EFFORTS;  \u2022  DEVELOPING AND ACQUIRING OFFICE BUILDINGS IN BBDS THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF OUR PORTFOLIO AND GENERATE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS;  \u2022  DISPOSING OF PROPERTIES NO LONGER CONSIDERED TO BE CORE ASSETS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOCATION, AGE, QUALITY AND/OR OVERALL STRATEGIC FIT; AND  \u2022  MAINTAINING A BALANCE SHEET WITH AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS AND GROWTH PROSPECTS.  REVENUES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND HEAVILY ON SUCCESSFULLY LEASING AND OPERATING THE OFFICE SPACE IN OUR PORTFOLIO. ECONOMIC GROWTH AND OFFICE EMPLOYMENT LEVELS IN OUR CORE MARKETS ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS, AMONG OTHERS, IN PREDICTING OUR FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  THE KEY COMPONENTS AFFECTING OUR RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, RENTAL RATES, COST RECOVERY INCOME, NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY INCREASES DURING TIMES OF IMPROVING ECONOMIC GROWTH, AS OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE OUTPACES VACANCIES THAT OCCUR UPON THE EXPIRATIONS OF EXISTING LEASES. AVERAGE OCCUPANCY GENERALLY DECLINES DURING TIMES OF SLOWER OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH, WHEN NEW VACANCIES TEND TO OUTPACE OUR ABILITY TO LEASE SPACE. ASSET ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND NEW DEVELOPMENTS PLACED IN SERVICE DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RENTAL REVENUES AND COULD IMPACT OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, DEPENDING UPON THE OCCUPANCY RATE OF THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ACQUIRED, SOLD OR PLACED IN SERVICE. A FURTHER INDICATOR OF THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE REVENUES IS THE EXPECTED LEASE EXPIRATIONS OF OUR PORTFOLIO. AS A RESULT, IN ADDITION TO SEEKING TO INCREASE OUR AVERAGE OCCUPANCY BY LEASING CURRENT VACANT SPACE, WE ALSO CONCENTRATE OUR LEASING EFFORTS ON RENEWING EXISTING LEASES PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING OUR LEASE EXPIRATIONS, SEE \"PROPERTIES - LEASE EXPIRATIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. OCCUPANCY IN OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO DECREASED FROM  91.6%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  91.2%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WHETHER OR NOT OUR RENTAL REVENUE TRACKS AVERAGE OCCUPANCY PROPORTIONALLY DEPENDS UPON WHETHER GAAP RENTS UNDER SIGNED NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES ARE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE GAAP RENTS UNDER EXPIRING LEASES. ANNUALIZED RENTAL REVENUES FROM SECOND GENERATION LEASES EXPIRING DURING ANY PARTICULAR YEAR ARE TYPICALLY LESS THAN 15% OF OUR TOTAL ANNUAL RENTAL REVENUES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH INFORMATION REGARDING SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES SIGNED DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  (WE DEFINE SECOND GENERATION OFFICE LEASES AS LEASES WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND RENEWALS OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS IN OFFICE SPACE THAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY OCCUPIED UNDER OUR OWNERSHIP AND LEASES WITH RESPECT TO VACANT SPACE IN ACQUIRED BUILDINGS).  NEW  RENEWAL  ALL OFFICE  LEASED SPACE (IN RENTABLE SQUARE FEET)  366,923  571,779  938,702  AVERAGE TERM (IN YEARS - RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT WEIGHTED)  6.7  6.3  6.5  BASE RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $30.02  $29.11  $29.46  RENT CONCESSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  (0.69  )  (0.56  )  (0.61  )  GAAP RENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $29.33  $28.55  $28.85  TENANT IMPROVEMENTS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $5.19  $2.59  $3.61  LEASING COMMISSIONS (PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT)  (1)  $1.11  $0.70  $0.86  __________  (1)  WEIGHTED AVERAGE PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  ANNUAL COMBINED GAAP RENTS FOR NEW AND RENEWAL LEASES SIGNED IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER WERE  $28.85  PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT,  19.4%  HIGHER  COMPARED TO PREVIOUS LEASES IN THE SAME OFFICE SPACES.  WE STRIVE TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSE, STABLE AND CREDITWORTHY CUSTOMER BASE. WE HAVE AN INTERNAL GUIDELINE WHEREBY CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN 3% OF OUR REVENUES ARE PERIODICALLY REVIEWED WITH THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , NO CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN  3%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES OTHER THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR LESS THAN  5%  OF OUR CASH REVENUES ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. UPON COMPLETION OF THE METLIFE III DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IN RALEIGH, IT IS EXPECTED THAT METLIFE WILL ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY  3.3%  OF OUR REVENUES BASED ON ANNUALIZED CASH REVENUES FOR  SEPTEMBER 2019.  EXPENSES  OUR EXPENSES PRIMARILY CONSIST OF RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND INTEREST EXPENSE. FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS. RENTAL PROPERTY EXPENSES ARE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR OWNERSHIP AND OPERATION OF RENTAL PROPERTIES AND INCLUDE EXPENSES THAT VARY SOMEWHAT PROPORTIONATELY TO OCCUPANCY LEVELS, SUCH AS JANITORIAL SERVICES AND UTILITIES, AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT VARY BASED ON OCCUPANCY, SUCH AS PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION IS A NON-CASH EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OWNERSHIP OF REAL PROPERTY AND GENERALLY REMAINS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT EACH YEAR, UNLESS WE BUY, PLACE IN SERVICE OR SELL ASSETS, SINCE OUR PROPERTIES AND RELATED BUILDING AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ASSETS ARE DEPRECIATED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER FIXED LIVES. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MANAGEMENT AND EMPLOYEE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, CORPORATE OVERHEAD AND SHORT AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  NET OPERATING INCOME  WHETHER OR NOT WE RECORD INCREASING NET OPERATING INCOME (\u201cNOI\u201d) IN OUR SAME PROPERTY PORTFOLIO DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO GARNER HIGHER RENTAL REVENUES, WHETHER FROM HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY, HIGHER GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT OR HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, THAT EXCEED ANY CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN OPERATING EXPENSES. SAME PROPERTY NOI WAS  $1.8 MILLION  , OR  1.6%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SAME PROPERTY REVENUES OF  $4.4 MILLION  OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF  $2.5 MILLION  IN SAME PROPERTY EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION TO THE EFFECT OF SAME PROPERTY NOI, WHETHER OR NOT NOI INCREASES DEPENDS UPON WHETHER THE NOI FROM OUR ACQUIRED PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE EXCEEDS THE NOI FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS. NOI WAS  $5.1 MILLION  , OR  4.3%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR SAME PROPERTY NOI AND THE IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, PARTLY OFFSET BY NOI LOST FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CASH FLOWS  IN CALCULATING NET CASH RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, WHICH ARE NON-CASH EXPENSES, ARE ADDED BACK TO NET INCOME. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED A POSITIVE AMOUNT OF CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DEPENDS PRIMARILY UPON CHANGES IN OUR NET INCOME, AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d CHANGES IN RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES AND NET ADDITIONS OR DECREASES IN OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO.  NET CASH RELATED TO INVESTING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO CAPITALIZED COSTS INCURRED FOR LEASING AND MAJOR BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, DISPOSITION AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. DURING PERIODS OF SIGNIFICANT NET ACQUISITION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, OUR CASH USED IN SUCH INVESTING ACTIVITIES WILL GENERALLY EXCEED CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES, WHICH TYPICALLY CONSISTS OF CASH RECEIVED UPON THE SALE OF PROPERTIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR JOINT VENTURES.  NET CASH RELATED TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES GENERALLY RELATES TO DISTRIBUTIONS, INCURRENCE AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT, AND ISSUANCES, REPURCHASES OR REDEMPTIONS OF COMMON STOCK, COMMON UNITS AND PREFERRED STOCK. WE USE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR CASH TO FUND DISTRIBUTIONS. WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE INCREASES IN THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF DEBT DURING A PERIOD DEPENDS GENERALLY UPON THE NET EFFECT OF OUR ACQUISITION, DISPOSITION, DEVELOPMENT AND JOINT VENTURE ACTIVITY. WE GENERALLY USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR DAILY WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES, WHICH MEANS THAT DURING ANY GIVEN PERIOD, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE INTEREST EXPENSE, WE MAY RECORD SIGNIFICANT REPAYMENTS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS.\"  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE AND FLEXIBLE BALANCE SHEET WITH ACCESS TO MULTIPLE SOURCES OF DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL AND SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO CAPITALIZE ON FAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AS THEY ARISE.  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES ARE OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF FUNDS TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS FOR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS INCLUDE AVAILABLE WORKING CAPITAL AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD  $599.9 MILLION  OF AVAILABILITY AT  OCTOBER 15, 2019  . OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF OPERATING EXPENSES, INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION ON OUR DEBT, DISTRIBUTIONS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING BUILDING IMPROVEMENT COSTS, TENANT IMPROVEMENT COSTS AND LEASE COMMISSIONS. BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS ARE CAPITAL COSTS TO MAINTAIN OR ENHANCE EXISTING BUILDINGS NOT TYPICALLY RELATED TO A SPECIFIC CUSTOMER. TENANT IMPROVEMENTS ARE THE COSTS REQUIRED TO CUSTOMIZE SPACE FOR THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND PLANNED FINANCING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. WE USE OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND FOR THE SHORT-TERM FUNDING OF OUR DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND, IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE REPAYMENT OF OTHER DEBT. CONTINUED ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY CAPITALIZE ON STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES AT SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES.  OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY USES GENERALLY CONSIST OF THE RETIREMENT OR REFINANCING OF DEBT UPON MATURITY, FUNDING OF BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS, NEW BUILDING DEVELOPMENTS AND LAND INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND FUNDING ACQUISITIONS OF BUILDINGS AND DEVELOPMENT LAND. OUR EXPECTED FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STARTED AND/OR COMMITTED NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WERE APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . ADDITIONALLY, WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, RETIRE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AND/OR DEBT SECURITIES THROUGH REDEMPTIONS, OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES, PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED ACQUISITIONS OR OTHERWISE.  WE EXPECT TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF.  \u2022  CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES;  \u2022  BANK TERM LOANS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF UNSECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT;  \u2022  THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP; AND  \u2022  THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO, AS MEASURED BY THE RATIO OF OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AND OUTSTANDING PREFERRED STOCK TO THE UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF OUR ASSETS, WAS  37.4%  AND THERE WERE  106.5 MILLION  DILUTED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  AS NOTED ABOVE, A KEY TENET OF OUR STRATEGIC PLAN IS TO CONTINUOUSLY UPGRADE THE QUALITY OF OUR OFFICE PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP OFFICE BUILDINGS THAT IMPROVE THE AVERAGE QUALITY OF OUR OVERALL PORTFOLIO AND DELIVER CONSISTENT AND SUSTAINABLE VALUE FOR OUR STOCKHOLDERS OVER THE LONG-TERM. WHETHER OR NOT AN ASSET ACQUISITION OR NEW DEVELOPMENT RESULTS IN HIGHER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\"FFO\") IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD DEPENDS UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING WHETHER THE NOI FOR ANY SUCH PERIOD EXCEEDS THE ACTUAL COST OF CAPITAL USED TO FINANCE THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE LENGTH OF CONSTRUCTION CYCLES, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE NOT PLACED IN SERVICE UNTIL, IN SOME CASES, SEVERAL YEARS AFTER COMMENCEMENT. SALES OF NON-CORE ASSETS COULD RESULT IN LOWER PER SHARE NET INCOME OR FFO IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD IN THE EVENT THE RESULTING USE OF PROCEEDS DOES NOT EXCEED THE CAPITALIZATION RATE ON THE SOLD PROPERTIES.  MARKET ROTATION PLAN  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF PLANNED INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. FIRST, WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE\u2019S UPTOWN CBD SUBMARKET FOR A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF $436 MILLION. BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IS A TROPHY, LEED GOLD-REGISTERED OFFICE BUILDING ENCOMPASSING 841,000 SQUARE FEET WITH STRUCTURED PARKING THAT DELIVERS THIS YEAR. THE ACQUISITION IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN NOVEMBER 2019. WE HAVE POSTED EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS TOTALING $50 MILLION THAT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SECOND, WE HAVE A TWO-PHASED PLAN TO EXIT THE GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS MARKETS. THE FIRST PHASE CONSISTS OF SELLING A SELECT PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS BY MID-2020 WITH A TOTAL SALES PRICE THAT APPROXIMATES THE $436 MILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION AND CLOSING THE DIVISION OFFICES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL DISPOSE OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, BECAUSE THE DISPOSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AND BINDING PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS AND WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE BUYERS\u2019 COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE SECOND PHASE IS THE PLANNED SALE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN BOTH MARKETS. THERE IS NO PRE-DETERMINED TIMETABLE FOR THE SECOND PHASE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES  RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE  $8.1 MILLION  , OR  4.5%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE AND HIGHER SAME PROPERTY REVENUES, WHICH INCREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $6.7 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, HIGHER PARKING INCOME AND HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY LOST REVENUE OF $2.7 MILLION FROM PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $3.0 MILLION  , OR  4.9%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $2.5 MILLION AND $1.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, CONTRACT SERVICES AND PROPERTY INSURANCE.

WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.3 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE. WE RECORDED NO SUCH IMPAIRMENTS IN  2018.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $2.2 MILLION  , OR  22.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED LEASE RELATED COSTS THAT ARE NOW EXPENSED UPON ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN 2019, EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND SEVERANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANTICIPATED CLOSURE OF OUR GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS DIVISION OFFICES. WE EXPECT TO RECORD AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 MILLION OF SEVERANCE COSTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.1 MILLION  , OR  17.7%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER CAPITALIZED INTEREST.  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS)  OTHER INCOME/(LOSS) WAS  $0.6 MILLION  LOWER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT IN 2019.  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY  GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY WERE  $3.5 MILLION  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO THE NET EFFECT OF THE DISPOSITION ACTIVITY IN SUCH PERIODS.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES WAS  $0.4 MILLION  , OR  64.0%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE OCCUPANCY.  EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE - DILUTED  DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $0.05  LOWER  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE REASONS DISCUSSED ABOVE.  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  LASER SPINE INSTITUTE  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PROVIDED INFORMATION ON LASER SPINE INSTITUTE, WHICH OCCUPIED A 176,000 SQUARE-FOOT, SIX-STORY BUILDING WITH STRUCTURED PARKING IN TAMPA\u2019S WESTSHORE SUBMARKET, A BBD. THE BUILDING, DEVELOPED BY US, HAD BEEN USED BY LASER SPINE INSTITUTE FOR BOTH ITS COMPANY HEADQUARTERS AND AN AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER. AFTER THE MARKET CLOSED ON MARCH 1, 2019, LASER SPINE INSTITUTE ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. THIS UNEXPECTED ANNOUNCEMENT AFFECTED ALL OF ITS LOCATIONS NATIONWIDE. AS A RESULT OF THIS SUDDEN CLOSURE, WE INCURRED $5.6 MILLION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF $2.3 MILLION OF LEASE INCENTIVES, $4.1 MILLION OF NOTES RECEIVABLE AND $11.6 MILLION OF TENANT IMPROVEMENTS AND DEFERRED LEASING COSTS.

SAME PROPERTY RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES WERE HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GAAP RENTS PER RENTABLE SQUARE FOOT, HIGHER PARKING INCOME AND HIGHER COST RECOVERY INCOME, PARTLY OFFSET BY CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES AND WRITE-OFFS OF LEASE INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUDDEN CLOSURE OF LASER SPINE INSTITUTE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY PROPERTY DISPOSITIONS AND LOWER RESTORATION FEES, WHICH DECREASED RENTAL AND OTHER REVENUES BY $8.2 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RENTAL PROPERTY AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE  $5.0 MILLION  , OR  2.8%  ,  HIGHER  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SAME PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES PLACED IN SERVICE, WHICH INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES BY $4.0 MILLION AND $3.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.8 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE.

THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ACQUISITION ACTIVITY AND HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN DEVELOPMENT IN-PROCESS IN 2018, PARTLY OFFSET BY NON-REFUNDABLE EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE.  THE CHANGE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY/(USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  AS COMPARED TO  2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET DEBT BORROWINGS IN 2019.

SEE ALSO \"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.\"  OUR MORTGAGES AND NOTES PAYABLE AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  CONSISTED OF  $95.8 MILLION  OF SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  4.0%  AND  $2,240.0 MILLION  OF UNSECURED INDEBTEDNESS WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  3.67%  . THE SECURED INDEBTEDNESS WAS COLLATERALIZED BY REAL ESTATE ASSETS WITH AN UNDEPRECIATED BOOK VALUE OF  $146.3 MILLION  . AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ,  $250.0 MILLION  OF OUR DEBT DOES NOT BEAR INTEREST AT FIXED RATES OR IS NOT PROTECTED BY INTEREST RATE HEDGE CONTRACTS.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVESTMENT ACTIVITY  IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE REGULARLY EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. AS A RESULT, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY HAVE ONE OR MORE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS UNDER CONSIDERATION THAT ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF EVALUATION, NEGOTIATION OR DUE DILIGENCE, INCLUDING POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO NON-BINDING LETTERS OF INTENT OR ENFORCEABLE CONTRACTS. CONSUMMATION OF ANY TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING THE SATISFACTION OF CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE PROVIDED THAT WE WILL ACQUIRE ANY PROPERTIES IN THE FUTURE. SEE \"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS - RECENT AND FUTURE ACQUISITIONS AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES MAY FAIL TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS AND MAY REQUIRE RENOVATION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS EXCEEDING OUR ESTIMATES\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ACQUIRED DEVELOPMENT LAND IN RALEIGH FOR A PURCHASE PRICE, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED ACQUISITION COSTS, OF  $6.6 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE SOLD A BUILDING AND LAND PARCELS FOR AN AGGREGATE SALE PRICE OF  $14.3 MILLION  AND RECORDED AGGREGATE GAINS ON DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY OF  $3.5 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE RECORDED AGGREGATE IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS OF  $5.3 MILLION  AS A RESULT OF SHORTENED HOLD PERIODS FROM CLASSIFYING ALL OF OUR ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS AS NON-CORE.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF PLANNED INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES. FIRST, WE HAVE AGREED TO ACQUIRE BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IN CHARLOTTE\u2019S UPTOWN CBD SUBMARKET FOR A TOTAL INVESTMENT OF $436 MILLION. BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION IS A TROPHY, LEED GOLD-REGISTERED OFFICE BUILDING ENCOMPASSING 841,000 SQUARE FEET WITH STRUCTURED PARKING THAT DELIVERS THIS YEAR. THE ACQUISITION IS SCHEDULED TO CLOSE IN NOVEMBER 2019. WE HAVE POSTED EARNEST MONEY DEPOSITS TOTALING $50 MILLION THAT ARE NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES. SECOND, WE HAVE A TWO-PHASED PLAN TO EXIT THE GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS MARKETS. THE FIRST PHASE CONSISTS OF SELLING A SELECT PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS IN GREENSBORO AND MEMPHIS BY MID-2020 WITH A TOTAL SALES PRICE THAT APPROXIMATES THE $436 MILLION TOTAL INVESTMENT FOR BANK OF AMERICA TOWER AT LEGACY UNION AND CLOSING THE DIVISION OFFICES. WE CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCES, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL DISPOSE OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS ON FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, BECAUSE THE DISPOSITIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE NEGOTIATION AND EXECUTION OF DEFINITIVE AND BINDING PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENTS AND WOULD THEN BE SUBJECT TO THE BUYERS\u2019 COMPLETION OF SATISFACTORY DUE DILIGENCE AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE SECOND PHASE IS THE PLANNED SALE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IN BOTH MARKETS. THERE IS NO PRE-DETERMINED TIMETABLE FOR THE SECOND PHASE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE WERE DEVELOPING  0.9 MILLION  RENTABLE SQUARE FEET OF OFFICE PROPERTIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THESE ANNOUNCED AND IN-PROCESS OFFICE DEVELOPMENTS.

(2)  OUR CORPORATE AND RALEIGH MARKET PERSONNEL PLAN TO OCCUPY APPROXIMATELY 45,500 SQUARE FEET.  (3)  WE OWN AN  80.0%  INTEREST IN THIS CONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE.  FINANCING ACTIVITY  WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SEPARATE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH EACH OF WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, LLC, ROBERT W. BAIRD & CO. INCORPORATED, BB&T CAPITAL MARKETS, A DIVISION OF BB&T SECURITIES, LLC, MERRILL LYNCH, PIERCE, FENNER & SMITH INCORPORATED, BTIG, LLC, CAPITAL ONE SECURITIES, INC., FIFTH THIRD SECURITIES, INC., JEFFERIES LLC AND J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL UP TO $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE GROSS SALES PRICE OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE (\"NYSE\") OR OTHERWISE  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS.  OUR $600.0 MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  AND INCLUDES AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS. ASSUMING NO DEFAULTS HAVE OCCURRED, WE HAVE AN OPTION TO EXTEND THE MATURITY FOR  TWO  ADDITIONAL  SIX  -MONTH PERIODS. THE INTEREST RATE AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 100 BASIS POINTS  AND THE ANNUAL FACILITY FEE IS 20 BASIS POINTS. THE INTEREST RATE AND FACILITY FEE ARE BASED ON THE HIGHER OF THE PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED RATINGS FROM MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS SERVICES. THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  . AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  , WE HAD  $0.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH REDUCES THE AVAILABILITY ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS A RESULT, THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  WAS $599.9 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP ISSUED  $400.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  3.050%  NOTES DUE  FEBRUARY 2030  , LESS ORIGINAL ISSUANCE DISCOUNT OF  $1.0 MILLION  . THESE NOTES WERE PRICED TO YIELD  3.079%  . DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE 3.050% NOTES, WE OBTAINED  $150.0 MILLION  NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF FORWARD-STARTING SWAPS. UPON THE SUBSEQUENT ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE TERMINATED THE FORWARD-STARTING SWAPS AND PAID CASH UPON SETTLEMENT. THE UNREALIZED LOSS OF  $6.6 MILLION  IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE AS INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE MADE ON THE DEBT. UNDERWRITING FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES WERE INCURRED THAT AGGREGATED  $3.4 MILLION  ; THESE COSTS WERE DEFERRED AND WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE NOTES. THE NET EFFECT OF THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE ITEMS RESULTED IN AN EFFECTIVE FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  3.37%.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE PREPAID WITHOUT PENALTY  $100.0 MILLION  OF OUR  $200.0 MILLION  UNSECURED BANK TERM LOAN THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE IN  JANUARY 2022  . THE INTEREST RATE ON THE TERM LOAN AT OUR CURRENT CREDIT RATINGS IS  LIBOR PLUS 110 BASIS POINTS  . WE RECORDED  $0.3 MILLION  OF LOSS ON DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT RELATED TO THIS PREPAYMENT.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED DEBT. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND RATIOS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT YEAR, DEPENDING UPON OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, PROPERTY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND BANK TERM LOANS REQUIRE US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE LENDERS HAVING AT LEAST 51.0% OF THE TOTAL COMMITMENTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CAN ACCELERATE ALL BORROWINGS THEN OUTSTANDING, AND WE COULD BE PROHIBITED FROM BORROWING ANY FURTHER AMOUNTS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS GIVING THE UNSECURED LENDERS THE RIGHT TO DECLARE A DEFAULT IF WE ARE IN DEFAULT UNDER MORE THAN $30.0 MILLION WITH RESPECT TO OTHER LOANS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE INDENTURE THAT GOVERNS THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP'S OUTSTANDING NOTES REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY OPERATING COVENANTS AND VARIOUS FINANCIAL RATIOS. THE TRUSTEE OR THE HOLDERS OF AT LEAST 25.0% IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF ANY SERIES OF NOTES CAN ACCELERATE THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF SUCH SERIES UPON WRITTEN NOTICE OF A DEFAULT THAT REMAINS UNCURED AFTER 60 DAYS.  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY, REFINANCE OR EXTEND ANY OR ALL OF OUR DEBT AT MATURITY OR UPON ANY ACCELERATION. IF ANY REFINANCING IS DONE AT HIGHER INTEREST RATES, THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DISTRIBUTIONS. ANY SUCH REFINANCING COULD ALSO IMPOSE TIGHTER FINANCIAL RATIOS AND OTHER COVENANTS THAT RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE IN OUR BEST INTEREST, SUCH AS FUNDING NEW DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, MAKING OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS, REPURCHASING OUR SECURITIES OR PAYING DISTRIBUTIONS.  DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS  TO MAINTAIN ITS QUALIFICATION AS A REIT, THE COMPANY MUST PAY DIVIDENDS TO STOCKHOLDERS THAT ARE AT LEAST 90.0% OF ITS ANNUAL REIT TAXABLE INCOME, EXCLUDING NET CAPITAL GAINS. THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT REQUIRES THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP TO DISTRIBUTE AT LEAST ENOUGH CASH FOR THE COMPANY TO BE ABLE TO PAY SUCH DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY'S REIT TAXABLE INCOME, AS DETERMINED BY THE FEDERAL TAX LAWS, DOES NOT EQUAL ITS NET INCOME UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). IN ADDITION, ALTHOUGH CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO MAINTAIN REIT STATUS, CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY, ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX UNLESS SUCH GAINS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CASH DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CASH THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE AVAILABLE FOR OTHER BUSINESS PURPOSES, INCLUDING FUNDING DEBT MATURITIES, REDUCING DEBT OR FUTURE GROWTH INITIATIVES. THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE DISTRIBUTIONS THAT WILL BE MADE IS AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS THAT WILL AFFECT SUCH CASH FLOWS AND,  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ACCORDINGLY, INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS REGARDING DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS, SEE \"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS\" IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , THE COMPANY DECLARED AND PAID A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK.  ON OCTOBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND OF  $0.475  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS PAYABLE ON DECEMBER 3, 2019 TO STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF NOVEMBER 11, 2019.  CURRENT AND FUTURE CASH NEEDS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OTHER AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES BY THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP, THE ISSUANCE OF SECURED DEBT, BANK TERM LOANS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE ISSUANCE OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE COMPANY OR THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND THE DISPOSITION OF NON-CORE ASSETS, WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS.  WE HAD  $116.7 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THE UNUSED CAPACITY OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT BOTH  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 15, 2019  WAS  $599.9 MILLION  , EXCLUDING AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT ALLOWS FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $400.0 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL LENDER COMMITMENTS.  WE HAVE A CURRENTLY EFFECTIVE AUTOMATIC SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC PURSUANT TO WHICH, AT ANY TIME AND FROM TIME TO TIME, IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS, THE COMPANY MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND DEPOSITARY SHARES AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP MAY SELL AN INDEFINITE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OFFERINGS ON SATISFACTORY TERMS BASED ON PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS.  THE COMPANY FROM TIME TO TIME ENTERS INTO EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS WITH A VARIETY OF FIRMS PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY MAY OFFER AND SELL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH SUCH FIRMS, ACTING AS AGENTS OF THE COMPANY OR AS PRINCIPALS. SALES OF THE SHARES, IF ANY, MAY BE MADE BY MEANS OF ORDINARY BROKERS\u2019 TRANSACTIONS ON THE NYSE OR OTHERWISE AT MARKET PRICES PREVAILING AT THE TIME OF SALE, AT PRICES RELATED TO PREVAILING MARKET PRICES OR AT NEGOTIATED PRICES OR AS OTHERWISE AGREED WITH ANY OF SUCH FIRMS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE BLOCK TRADES).  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO CHANGES MADE BY MANAGEMENT TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OTHER THAN THE NEW LEASE STANDARD ADOPTION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019, WHICH CHANGED OUR POLICY WITH RESPECT TO ESTIMATING CREDIT LOSSES ON OPERATING LEASE RECEIVABLES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS POLICY, SEE NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF ALL OTHER CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\u201d IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  NON-GAAP INFORMATION  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE BENEFICIAL TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS AND ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EQUITY REIT. BECAUSE THESE FFO CALCULATIONS EXCLUDE SUCH FACTORS AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS, WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES, THEY FACILITATE COMPARISONS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN PERIODS AND BETWEEN OTHER REITS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP IMPLICITLY ASSUMES THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. SINCE REAL ESTATE VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE USE OF FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE, TOGETHER WITH THE REQUIRED GAAP PRESENTATIONS, PROVIDES A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO ITS COMPETITORS AND A MORE INFORMED AND APPROPRIATE BASIS ON WHICH TO MAKE DECISIONS INVOLVING OPERATING, FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT NET INCOME OR NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP. NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE AS DEFINED BY GAAP ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURES IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE FFO MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS THAT INVESTORS MAY DEEM SUBJECTIVE, SUCH AS ADDING BACK EXPENSES SUCH AS DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENTS. FURTHERMORE, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE DOES NOT DEPICT THE AMOUNT THAT ACCRUES DIRECTLY TO THE STOCKHOLDERS' BENEFIT. ACCORDINGLY, FFO, FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE SHOULD NEVER BE CONSIDERED AS ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME, NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS, OR NET INCOME AVAILABLE FOR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS PER SHARE AS INDICATORS OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY'S PRESENTATION OF FFO IS CONSISTENT WITH FFO AS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS, WHICH IS CALCULATED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET INCOME/(LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP;  \u2022  LESS NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES;  \u2022  PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES;  \u2022  LESS GAINS, OR PLUS LOSSES, FROM SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS UNDER GAAP;  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS OUR SHARE OF ADJUSTMENTS, INCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, FOR UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS (TO REFLECT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ON THE SAME BASIS); AND  \u2022  PLUS OR MINUS ADJUSTMENTS FOR DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND GAINS/(LOSSES) ON SALES OF DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, PLUS IMPAIRMENTS ON DEPRECIABLE OPERATING PROPERTIES, AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES RELATED TO DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

REFER TO THE GLOSSARY OF TERMS FOR DEFINITIONS OF CAPITALIZED TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS USED IN THIS REPORT.  U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS ARE PRESENTED IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS OR AS OTHERWISE NOTED.  COMPANY OVERVIEW  ARMOUR IS A MARYLAND CORPORATION FORMED TO INVEST IN AND MANAGE A LEVERAGED PORTFOLIO OF MBS AND MORTGAGE LOANS. WE INVEST IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY A U.S. GSE, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC, OR A GOVERNMENT AGENCY SUCH AS GINNIE MAE (COLLECTIVELY, AGENCY SECURITIES). THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED RATE HOME LOANS, THE REMAINING ARE EITHER BACKED BY HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE OR ADJUSTABLE RATE HOME LOANS. OTHER SECURITIES BACKED BY RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES IN WHICH WE INVEST, FOR WHICH THE PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST IS NOT GUARANTEED BY A GSE OR GOVERNMENT AGENCY MAY BENEFIT FROM CREDIT ENHANCEMENT DERIVED FROM STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS SUCH AS SUBORDINATION, OVER COLLATERALIZATION OR INSURANCE (COLLECTIVELY, \"CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\"). FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY ALSO INVEST IN INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS. \"AGENCY SECURITIES\" TOGETHER WITH \"CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES\" AND \"INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES\", ARE COLLECTIVELY \"MBS\". THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, AN INVESTMENT ADVISOR REGISTERED WITH THE SEC (SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE SEEK TO CREATE SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH THOUGHTFUL INVESTMENT AND RISK MANAGEMENT THAT PRODUCES CURRENT YIELD AND SUPERIOR RISK ADJUSTED RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM. OUR FOCUS ON RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE FINANCE SUPPORTS HOME OWNERSHIP FOR A BROAD AND DIVERSE SPECTRUM OF AMERICANS BY BRINGING PRIVATE CAPITAL INTO THE MORTGAGE MARKETS.  WE EARN RETURNS ON THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND OUR COSTS, INCLUDING THE INTEREST COST OF THE FUNDS WE BORROW, AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO OUR HEDGES. WE IDENTIFY AND ACQUIRE MBS, FINANCE OUR ACQUISITIONS WITH BORROWINGS UNDER A SERIES OF SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT THE MOST COMPETITIVE INTEREST RATES AVAILABLE TO US AND THEN COST-EFFECTIVELY HEDGE OUR INTEREST RATE AND OTHER RISKS BASED ON OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES AND OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S VIEW OF THE MARKET. SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS APPROACH REQUIRES US TO ADDRESS INTEREST RATE RISK, MAINTAIN ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND EFFECTIVELY HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISKS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE MARKET WILL UNDERGO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMING YEARS AS THE ROLE OF GSES, SUCH AS FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC, IS DIMINISHED, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL CREATE ATTRACTIVE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US. WE EXECUTE OUR BUSINESS PLAN IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTENTION OF CONTINUING TO QUALIFY AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE AND AVOIDING REGULATION AS AN INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT.  WE HAVE ELECTED TO BE TAXED AS A REIT UNDER THE CODE. WE WILL GENERALLY NOT BE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DISTRIBUTE OUR TAXABLE INCOME TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND AS LONG AS WE SATISFY THE ONGOING REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE INCLUDING MEETING CERTAIN ASSET, INCOME AND STOCK OWNERSHIP TESTS.  FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS AND THE SUPPLY OF AND DEMAND FOR SUCH ASSETS. RECENT EVENTS, SUCH AS THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW, CAN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS IN WAYS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND MAY PRODUCE RESULTS OUTSIDE OF TYPICAL OPERATING VARIANCES. OUR NET INTEREST INCOME VARIES PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, BORROWING COSTS AND PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, THE BEHAVIOR OF WHICH INVOLVES VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. WE LOOK TO INVEST ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF MORTGAGE INVESTMENTS, FROM AGENCY SECURITIES, FOR WHICH THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE GUARANTEED BY A GSE, TO CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, NON-PRIME MORTGAGE LOANS AND UNRATED EQUITY TRANCHES OF CMBS. AS SUCH, WE EXPECT OUR INVESTMENTS TO BE SUBJECT TO RISKS ARISING FROM DELINQUENCIES AND FORECLOSURES, THEREBY EXPOSING  37  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO POTENTIAL LOSSES. WE ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGING CREDIT SPREADS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE ACM\u2019S IN-DEPTH INVESTMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS MULTIPLE SECTORS OF THE MORTGAGE MARKET, PRUDENT ASSET SELECTION AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY ENABLE US TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT LOSSES, OUR MARKET VALUE LOSSES AND FINANCING COSTS. PREPAYMENT RATES, AS REFLECTED BY THE RATE OF PRINCIPAL PAY DOWNS AND INTEREST RATES VARY ACCORDING TO THE TYPE OF INVESTMENT, CONDITIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS, COMPETITION AND OTHER FACTORS, NONE OF WHICH CAN BE PREDICTED WITH ANY CERTAINTY. IN GENERAL, AS PREPAYMENT RATES ON OUR ASSETS THAT ARE PURCHASED AT A PREMIUM INCREASE, RELATED PURCHASE PREMIUM AMORTIZATION INCREASES, THEREBY REDUCING THE NET YIELD ON SUCH ASSETS. BECAUSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR ACTIVITIES, OUR OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISKS AND PREPAYMENT RISKS EFFECTIVELY WHILE MAINTAINING OUR STATUS AS A REIT.  FOR ANY PERIOD DURING WHICH CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES EARNED ON OUR ASSETS DO NOT COINCIDE WITH INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON OUR BORROWINGS, SUCH ASSETS WILL TEND TO REPRICE MORE SLOWLY THAN THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES. CONSEQUENTLY, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, PARTICULARLY SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME. WITH THE MATURITIES OF OUR ASSETS GENERALLY OF A LONGER TERM THAN THOSE OF OUR LIABILITIES, INTEREST RATE INCREASES WILL TEND TO DECREASE OUR NET INTEREST INCOME AND THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR ASSETS (AND THEREFORE OUR BOOK VALUE). SUCH RATE INCREASES COULD POSSIBLY RESULT IN OPERATING LOSSES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS.  PREPAYMENTS ON MBS AND THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGE LOANS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES AND A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS, POLICY DECISIONS BY REGULATORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. TO THE EXTENT WE HOLD MBS ACQUIRED AT A PREMIUM OR DISCOUNT TO PAR, OR FACE VALUE, CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT RATES MAY IMPACT OUR ANTICIPATED YIELD. IN PERIODS OF DECLINING INTEREST RATES, PREPAYMENTS ON OUR MBS WILL LIKELY INCREASE. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REINVEST THE PROCEEDS OF SUCH PREPAYMENTS AT COMPARABLE YIELDS, OUR NET INTEREST INCOME MAY DECLINE.  WHILE WE USE STRATEGIES TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE SOME OF OUR INTEREST RATE RISK, WE DO NOT HEDGE ALL OF OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES, AS THERE ARE PRACTICAL LIMITATIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INSULATE OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO FROM ALL POTENTIAL NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES IN A MANNER THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SEEK ATTRACTIVE NET SPREADS ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. ALSO, SINCE WE HAVE NOT ELECTED TO USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING, EARNINGS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP WILL FLUCTUATE EVEN IN SITUATIONS WHERE OUR DERIVATIVES ARE OPERATING AS INTENDED. AS A RESULT OF THIS MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO FLUCTUATE FAR MORE THAN IF WE WERE TO DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. COMPARISONS WITH COMPANIES THAT USE CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL OR PART OF THEIR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES MAY NOT BE MEANINGFUL. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED UNDER THE SECTION CAPTIONED \u201cDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\u201d BELOW, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  IN ADDITION TO THE USE OF DERIVATIVES TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK, A VARIETY OF OTHER FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE; THESE FACTORS INCLUDE  \u2022  OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE;  \u2022  OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING AND BORROWING CAPACITY;  \u2022  THE REIT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE CODE; AND  \u2022  THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR AN EXCLUSION UNDER THE 1940 ACT AND OTHER REGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS.  OUR MANAGER  SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  MARKET AND INTEREST RATE TRENDS AND THE EFFECT ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO  THIRD QUARTER TRENDS  GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING TRADE POLICIES CAUSED VOLATILITY IN BOTH THE EQUITY AND FIXED INCOME MARKETS THIS YEAR. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2019, THE 10-YEAR US TREASURY YIELD DROPPED FROM 2.69% TO A LOW OF 1.46% BEFORE ENDING THE THIRD  38  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  QUARTER AT 1.67%. SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR, MORTGAGE RATES HAVE DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOMEOWNERS TO REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES. THE RESULT HAS BEEN A HIGHER PREPAYMENT RATE  FOR MORTGAGE SECURITIES. OUR STRATEGY IN BUYING SPECIFIC MORTGAGE SECURITIES IS TO TRY TO IDENTIFY CHARACTERISTICS THAT MIGHT INDICATE LOWER PREPAYMENT PROPENSITY AS MORTGAGE RATES DECLINE. THE AVERAGE CPR ON OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO HAS INCREASED FROM 3.50% IN Q1 2019 TO  11.80%  IN Q3 2019. INCREASED CPRS RESULT IN INCREASED AMORTIZATION EXPENSE BECAUSE MOST OF OUR MORTGAGE SECURITIES WERE BOUGHT AT PREMIUM DOLLAR PRICES. PREPAYMENT RATES TEND TO DECLINE OVER TIME IF RATES REMAIN STABLE, AS HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE INCLINED AND ABLE TO REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES DO SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR STRATEGY FOR SELECTING SPECIFIC MORTGAGE SECURITIES RESULTS IN RELATIVELY SMALLER INCREASES IN PREPAYMENT RATES, THOSE INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES MAY DECLINE MORE SLOWLY OVER TIME.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RATES HAVE ALSO EXHIBITED INCREASING VOLATILITY OVER THE QUARTER, PARTICULARLY AROUND THE END OF EACH CALENDAR MONTH. THE VOLATILITY REACHED ITS HEIGHT IN MID-SEPTEMBER, WITH OVERNIGHT RATES TOPPING OUT AT 10% AS REPURCHASE AGREEMENT BORROWERS STRUGGLED TO FIND CAPACITY. WE WERE ABLE TO FINANCE OUR PORTFOLIO CONTINUOUSLY AND AS PLANNED THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER. OUR AVERAGE COST OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING WAS  2.55%  ANNUALIZED IN Q3 2019 COMPARED TO  2.69%  IN Q2 2019. BUCKLER PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE AND INSIGHT AS TO MARKET CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THIS VOLATILE PERIOD. THE FED HAS ANNOUNCED A PROGRAM TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO SHORT TERM FINANCING MARKETS WHICH MAY REDUCE VOLATILITY GOING FORWARD. NEVERTHELESS, WE EXPECT THAT REPO MARKETS MAY CONTINUE TO SHOW HIGHER VOLATILITY THAN THEY HAVE IN PAST QUARTERS.  THIS QUARTER, WE REDUCED OUR NET TBA AGENCY SECURITIES EXPOSURE BY ENTERING IN TO CERTAIN TBA SHORT POSITIONS. THE TBA SHORT POSITIONS REPRESENT DIFFERENT SECURITIES AND MATURITIES THAN OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITY LONG POSITIONS, AND ACCORDINGLY, MAY PERFORM SOMEWHAT DIFFERENTLY. WHILE WE EXPECT OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES SHORT POSITIONS TO PERFORM WELL COMPARED TO OUR RELATED MORTGAGE SECURITIES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THEIR RELATIVE PERFORMANCE.  DEVELOPMENTS AT FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC  THE PAYMENTS WE RECEIVE ON THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST DEPEND UPON A STEADY STREAM OF PAYMENTS BY BORROWERS ON THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AND THE FULFILLMENT OF GUARANTEES BY GSES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S INTERVENTION IN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WILL CONTINUE TO BE ADEQUATE OR ASSURED FOR THE LONGER-TERM VIABILITY OF THESE GSES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES MAY LEAD TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF AND TRADING MARKET FOR AGENCY SECURITIES IN THE LONG TERM. ACCORDINGLY, IF THE GSES DEFAULTED ON THEIR GUARANTEED OBLIGATIONS, SUFFERED LOSSES OR CEASED TO EXIST, THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  THE PASSAGE OF ANY NEW FEDERAL LEGISLATION AFFECTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC MAY CREATE MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND REDUCE THE ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED CREDIT QUALITY OF SECURITIES ISSUED OR GUARANTEED BY THEM. IF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WERE REFORMED OR WOUND DOWN, IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT EFFECT, IF ANY, THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE EXISTING FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AGENCY SECURITIES. THE FOREGOING COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICING, SUPPLY, LIQUIDITY AND VALUE OF THE AGENCY SECURITIES IN WHICH WE INVEST AND OTHERWISE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  ON JUNE 3, 2019, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC STARTED ISSUING A NEW COMMON SECURITY, THE UNIFORM MBS, IN PLACE OF THEIR PREVIOUS OFFERINGS OF MBS. THE NEW UNIFORM MBS WAS ISSUED USING A NEW COMMON SECURITIZATION PLATFORM (\"CSP\"). THE UNIFORM MBS MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE PREVIOUS FANNIE MAE MBS AND HAS BECOME THE BASIS FOR THE TBA MBS MARKET PLACE. PREVIOUSLY EXISTING FREDDIE MAC MBS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR EXCHANGE INTO THE NEW UNIFORM MBS. THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW UNIFORM MBS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR EXISTING MBS AND WE DO NOT EXPECT OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO TO BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE. AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY UNIFORM MBS SECURITIES.  39  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES AND FUNDING COSTS  CHANGES IN FED POLICY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, SINCE OUR COST OF FUNDS IS LARGELY DEPENDENT ON SHORT-TERM RATES. AN INCREASE IN OUR COST OF FUNDS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON OUR MBS WOULD CAUSE OUR NET INCOME TO DECLINE. BELOW IS THE FED'S TARGET RANGE FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, AT EACH FED MEETING SINCE DECEMBER 2015.  MEETING DATE  LOWER RANGE  HIGHER RANGE  SEPTEMBER 2019  1.75%  2.00%  JULY 2019  2.00%  2.25%  JUNE 2019  2.25%  2.50%  APRIL/MAY 2019  2.25%  2.50%  MARCH 2019  2.25%  2.50%  JANUARY 2019  2.25%  2.50%  DECEMBER 2018  2.25%  2.50%  SEPTEMBER 2018  2.00%  2.25%  JUNE 2018  1.75%  2.00%  MARCH 2018  1.50%  1.75%  JANUARY 2018  1.25%  1.50%  JUNE 2017  1.00%  1.25%  MARCH 2017  0.75%  1.00%  DECEMBER 2016  0.50%  0.75%  DECEMBER 2015  0.25%  0.50%  OUR BORROWINGS IN THE REPURCHASE MARKET HAVE ALSO HISTORICALLY CLOSELY TRACKED THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. TRADITIONALLY, A LOWER FEDERAL FUNDS RATE HAS INDICATED A TIME OF INCREASED NET INTEREST MARGIN AND HIGHER ASSET VALUES. VOLATILITY IN THESE RATES AND DIVERGENCE FROM THE HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP AMONG THESE RATES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. IF RATES WERE TO INCREASE AS A RESULT, OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AND THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO MIGHT SUFFER AS A RESULT.  40  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH SHOWS 30-DAY LIBOR AS COMPARED TO THE EFFECTIVE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE ON A MONTHLY BASIS FROM  SEPTEMBER 30, 2017  TO  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES AND MORTGAGE SPREADS  OUR SECURITIES ARE VALUED AT AN INTEREST RATE SPREAD VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES (MORTGAGE SPREAD). THIS MORTGAGE SPREAD VARIES OVER TIME AND CAN BE ABOVE OR BELOW LONG-TERM AVERAGES, DEPENDING UPON MARKET PARTICIPANTS' CURRENT DESIRE TO OWN SECURITIES OVER OTHER INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. WHEN THE MORTGAGE SPREAD GETS SMALLER (OR NEGATIVE) VERSUS LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES, OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE POSITIVELY AFFECTED. WHEN THIS SPREAD GETS LARGER (OR POSITIVE), OUR BOOK VALUE WILL BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.  MORTGAGE SPREADS CAN VARY DUE TO MOVEMENTS IN SECURITIES VALUATIONS, MOVEMENTS IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WE MAINLY USE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS (INCLUDING SWAPTIONS) TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE AGAINST CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR SECURITIES. WE DO NOT USE SUCH HEDGING CONTRACTS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CONTRACT OR PURCHASED ANY ASSET SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF MORTGAGE SPREADS ON OUR BOOK VALUE.  41  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NET INCOME (LOSS) SUMMARY  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  THE INCREASE IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND ASSET YIELDS OFFSET THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH LED TO THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME (LOSS) WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOSSES ON OUR DERIVATIVES DUE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCES AND TBA PRICES.  42  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  NET INTEREST INCOME  NET INTEREST INCOME IS A FUNCTION OF BOTH OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO SIZE AND NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD.  2019  VS.  2018  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO INCREASED BY  30.9%  FROM  $9,768,984  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  TO  $12,786,113  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  43  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  \u2022  OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO YIELDS INCREASED BY  0.4%  AND OUR INTEREST EXPENSE ON OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS INCREASED BY  0.6%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u2022  NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED DUE TO THE GROWTH IN OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. INTEREST EXPENSE ALSO INCREASED,  ALTHOUGH AT A SLOWER RATE THAN OUR NET INTEREST INCOME, DUE TO THE RISE IN THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE ON OUR FINANCING. THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FACTORS CAUSED NET INTEREST INCOME TO INCREASE FROM 2018 TO 2019. OUR NET INTEREST RATE SPREAD WAS  1.31%  AND  1.64%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WERE CARRIED AT A NET PREMIUM TO PAR VALUE WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE AMORTIZED COST OF  102.4%  AND  103.0%  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATES ON THESE SECURITIES BEING HIGHER THAN PREVAILING MARKET RATES.

NO  OTTI WAS RECOGNIZED FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , WE RECOGNIZED ADDITIONAL LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES, PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED DURING 2017, TOTALING  $(12,090)  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO OTTI OF OUR REMAINING AGENCY SECURITIES AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  \u2022  LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  \u2022  GAIN ON INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES IN Q1 2019 OF  $682  AS WELL AS THE SALE OF  $18,822  INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES IN Q2 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF  $(805).  \u2022  GAIN (LOSS) ON U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES RESULTED FROM THE SALES OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OF  $256,984  AND  $1,786,090  , WHICH RESULTED IN A REALIZED (LOSS) GAIN OF  $(736)  AND  $1,967  , RESPECTIVELY.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  EXPENSES  THE COMPANY IS MANAGED BY ACM, PURSUANT TO MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ARMOUR AND JAVELIN. THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEES ARE DETERMINED BASED ON GROSS EQUITY RAISED. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT FEES INCREASE WHEN WE RAISE CAPITAL AND DECLINE WHEN WE REPURCHASE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED STOCK AND LIQUIDATE DISTRIBUTIONS AS APPROVED AND SO DESIGNATED BY A MAJORITY OF THE BOARD. HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECREASES TO 0.75% PER ANNUM FOR GROSS EQUITY RAISED IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION PURSUANT TO THE ARMOUR MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE EFFECTIVE AVERAGE MANAGEMENT FEE RATE DECLINES AS EQUITY IS RAISED. GROSS EQUITY RAISED WAS  $2,936,347  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  $2,629,694  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  48  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  PROFESSIONAL FEES INCLUDE SECURITIES CLEARING, LEGAL, AUDIT AND CONSULTING COSTS AND ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY THE SIZE AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, THE VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS WE EXECUTE AND THE EXTENT OF RESEARCH AND DUE DILIGENCE ACTIVITIES WE UNDERTAKE ON POTENTIAL TRANSACTIONS.  INSURANCE INCLUDES PREMIUMS FOR BOTH GENERAL BUSINESS AND DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY COVERAGE. THE FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS DUE TO CHANGES IN PREMIUMS.  COMPENSATION INCLUDES BOTH NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION AS WELL AS THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AWARDED TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES THROUGH ACM. FLUCTUATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD ARE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF THE CHANGE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS VESTING TO OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND OTHER ACM EMPLOYEES.  OTHER EXPENSES INCLUDE FEES FOR MARKET AND PRICING DATA, ANALYTICS AND RISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS AND PORTFOLIO RELATED DATA PROCESSING COSTS AS WELL AS STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING FEES AND SIMILAR STOCKHOLDER RELATED EXPENSES, NET OF OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE FINAL DIVIDEND AMOUNT ON THE FULLY REDEEMED SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK OF  $375  WAS ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) INCLUDES ALL CHANGES IN EQUITY DURING A PERIOD, EXCEPT THOSE RESULTING FROM INVESTMENTS BY OWNERS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO OWNERS. FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) TOTALED  $89,341  AND  $449,558  AND  $(27,134)  AND  $(152,122)  , RESPECTIVELY, REFLECTING NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON AVAILABLE FOR SALE AGENCY SECURITIES NET OF AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED UPON SALE.  FINANCIAL CONDITION  OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AGENCY SECURITIES BACKED BY FIXED RATE HOME LOANS. FROM TIME TO TIME, A PORTION OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES MAY BE BACKED BY HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE AND ADJUSTABLE RATE HOME LOANS AS WELL AS UNSECURED NOTES AND BONDS ISSUED BY GSES, U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AND MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN INCOME TESTS WE MUST SATISFY FOR OUR QUALIFICATION AS A REIT. OUR CHARTER PERMITS US TO INVEST IN THESE ASSET CLASSES.  49  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE CHARTS BELOW PRESENT THE BREAKOUT BY PERCENTAGE OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATES INDICATED.  AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND TBA AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE TYPICALLY PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT PREMIUM PRICES. THE PREMIUM PRICE PAID OVER PAR VALUE ON THOSE ASSETS IS EXPENSED AS THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES EXPERIENCE REPAYMENT OR PREPAYMENT. THE LOWER THE CONSTANT PREPAYMENT RATE, THE LOWER THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND EARNINGS ARE HIGHER. IF PREPAYMENT RATES INCREASE, THE AMOUNT OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD WILL GO UP. THESE INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES WOULD ACT TO DECREASE THE YIELD ON AN ASSET AND WOULD DECREASE EARNINGS.  WE ACCOUNT FOR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IF IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE AGENCY SECURITY UPON SETTLEMENT OF THE CONTRACT. TBA AGENCY SECURITIES ARE FORWARD CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE (\u201cLONG POSITION\u201d) OR SALE (\u201cSHORT POSITION\u201d) OF AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREDETERMINED PRICE, FACE AMOUNT, ISSUER, COUPON AND STATED MATURITY ON AN AGREED-UPON FUTURE DATE. THE SPECIFIC AGENCY SECURITIES DELIVERED PURSUANT TO THE CONTRACT UPON THE SETTLEMENT DATE, PUBLISHED EACH MONTH BY THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION, ARE NOT KNOWN AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF TBA AGENCY SECURITIES BASED ON SIMILAR METHODS USED TO VALUE OUR AGENCY SECURITIES.

THE NET CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING AGENCY SECURITY IN THE TBA AGENCY SECURITY AND THE COST BASIS OR THE FORWARD PRICE TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED FOR THE UNDERLYING AGENCY SECURITY. SECURITIES ACTUALLY DELIVERED MAY HAVE SHORTER MATURITIES.  (3)  INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES PRINCIPAL AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE UNDERLYING AGENCY SECURITIES FROM WHICH THE INTEREST-ONLY SECURITY IS DERIVED. WE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO RECEIVE ANY OF THOSE PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS.  RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME COMMENCES ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE PURCHASE TRANSACTION AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE SALE TRANSACTION. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD INVESTMENT RELATED PAYABLES WITH RESPECT TO UNSETTLED PURCHASES OF AGENCY SECURITIES OF  $166,052  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENT RELATED RECEIVABLES. AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENT RELATED PAYABLES OR RECEIVABLES.  OUR NET INTEREST INCOME IS PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YIELD ON OUR ASSETS AND THE FINANCING (BORROWING AND HEDGING) COST OF OWNING THOSE ASSETS. SINCE WE TEND TO PURCHASE AGENCY SECURITIES AT A PREMIUM TO PAR, THE MAIN ITEM THAT CAN AFFECT THE YIELD ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AFTER THEY ARE PURCHASED IS THE RATE AT WHICH THE MORTGAGE BORROWERS REPAY THE LOAN. WHILE THE SCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPAL PORTION OF THE HOMEOWNERS\u2019 REGULAR MONTHLY PAYMENTS, ARE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE, THE UNSCHEDULED REPAYMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY REFINANCING OF THE MORTGAGE BUT CAN ALSO RESULT FROM REPURCHASES OF DELINQUENT, DEFAULTED, OR MODIFIED LOANS, ARE LESS SO. BEING ABLE TO ACCURATELY ESTIMATE AND MANAGE THESE REPAYMENT RATES IS A CRITICAL PORTION OF THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, NOT ONLY FOR ESTIMATING CURRENT YIELD BUT ALSO FOR CONSIDERING THE RATE OF REINVESTMENT OF THOSE PROCEEDS INTO NEW SECURITIES, THE YIELDS WHICH THOSE NEW SECURITIES MAY ADD TO OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO AND OUR HEDGING STRATEGY.  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , THE ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE LOANS UNDERLYING OUR AGENCY SECURITIES HAD FIXED-INTEREST RATES FOR AN AVERAGE PERIOD OF APPROXIMATELY  6 MONTHS  AND  8  MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER WHICH TIME THE INTEREST RATES RESET AND BECOME ADJUSTABLE. AFTER A RESET DATE, INTEREST RATES ON OUR ADJUSTABLE AND HYBRID ADJUSTABLE AGENCY SECURITIES FLOAT BASED ON SPREADS OVER VARIOUS INDICES, TYPICALLY LIBOR OR THE ONE-YEAR CONSTANT MATURITY  52  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

THESE INTEREST RATES ARE SUBJECT TO CAPS THAT LIMIT THE AMOUNT THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE CAN INCREASE DURING ANY YEAR, KNOWN AS AN ANNUAL CAP AND THROUGH THE MATURITY OF THE SECURITY, KNOWN AS A LIFETIME CAP.  CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES  WE PURCHASE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AT PRICES WHICH INCORPORATE OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES. THESE EXPECTATIONS DETERMINE THE YIELDS WE RECEIVE ON OUR ASSETS.

U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES  FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY PURCHASE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES TO TAILOR THE OVERALL RISK CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO. WHILE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES PROVIDE OVERALL INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE, THEY ARE GENERALLY NOT SENSITIVE TO THE OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN MBS. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE SECURED BY OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND BEAR INTEREST AT RATES THAT HAVE HISTORICALLY MOVED IN CLOSE RELATIONSHIP TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND LIBOR. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED BORROWING RELATIONSHIPS WITH NUMEROUS INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS AND OTHER LENDERS,  24  AND  23  OF WHICH HAD OPEN REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH US AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE EXCESS COLLATERAL, KNOWN AS A \u201cHAIRCUT.\u201d AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE AVERAGE HAIRCUT PERCENTAGE WAS  5.01%  COMPARED TO  5.48%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . THE CHANGE IN THE AVERAGE HAIRCUT PERCENTAGE REFLECTS BETTER FINANCING OF SOME OF OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AS THE CREDIT RATING HAS INCREASED FROM NON-INVESTMENT GRADE TO INVESTMENT GRADE ON THOSE SECURITIES.  54  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS  WE USE VARIOUS INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS TO MANAGE OUR INTEREST RATE RISK AS WE DEEM PRUDENT IN LIGHT OF MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE ASSOCIATED COSTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A HIGH QUALITY CREDIT RATING AND WITH FUTURES EXCHANGES. WE GENERALLY PAY A FIXED RATE AND RECEIVE A FLOATING RATE WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FIXING A PORTION OF OUR BORROWING COSTS AND HEDGING THE CHANGE IN OUR BOOK VALUE TO SOME DEGREE. THE FLOATING RATE WE RECEIVE IS GENERALLY THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR LIBOR. OUR POLICIES DO NOT CONTAIN SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AS TO THE PERCENTAGES OR AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATE RISK THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HEDGE. FOR INTEREST RATE RISK MITIGATION PURPOSES, WE CONSIDER AGENCY SECURITIES TO BE ARMS IF THEIR INTEREST RATE IS EITHER CURRENTLY SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT ACCORDING TO PREVAILING RATES OR IF THEY ARE WITHIN 18 MONTHS OF THE PERIOD WHERE SUCH ADJUSTMENTS WILL OCCUR. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT OUR DERIVATIVES WILL HAVE THE DESIRED BENEFICIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE HAVE NOT ELECTED CASH FLOW HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AS ALLOWED BY GAAP. SINCE WE DO NOT DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, REALIZED AS WELL AS UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL IMPACT OUR GAAP EARNINGS.  USE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY FAIL TO PROTECT OR COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US BECAUSE, AMONG OTHER THINGS.  \u2022  AVAILABLE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT CORRESPOND DIRECTLY WITH THE INTEREST RATE RISK FOR WHICH PROTECTION IS SOUGHT (E.G., THE DIFFERENCE IN INTEREST RATE MOVEMENTS FOR LONG-TERM U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES COMPARED TO AGENCY SECURITIES);  \u2022  THE DURATION OF THE DERIVATIVES MAY NOT MATCH THE DURATION OF THE RELATED LIABILITY;  \u2022  THE COUNTERPARTY TO A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT WITH US MAY DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATION TO PAY OR NOT PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE COLLATERAL POSTED MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PROTECT AGAINST ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS;  \u2022  WE MAY LOSE COLLATERAL WE HAVE PLEDGED TO SECURE OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER A DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT IF THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY BECOMES INSOLVENT OR FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY;  \u2022  WE MAY EXPERIENCE A TERMINATION EVENT UNDER ONE OR MORE OF OUR DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS RELATED TO OUR REIT STATUS, EQUITY LEVELS AND PERFORMANCE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A PAYOUT TO THE ASSOCIATED COUNTERPARTY AND A TAXABLE LOSS TO US;  \u2022  THE CREDIT-QUALITY OF THE PARTY OWING MONEY ON THE DERIVATIVES MAY BE DOWNGRADED TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IT IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO SELL OR ASSIGN OUR SIDE OF THE HEDGING TRANSACTION; AND  \u2022  THE VALUE OF DERIVATIVES MAY BE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP TO REFLECT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE; DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS, OR \u201cMARK-TO-MARKET LOSSES,\u201d WOULD REDUCE OUR NET INCOME OR INCREASE ANY NET LOSS.  55  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.

AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES LONG AND SHORT POSITIONS HAD A NET NOTIONAL BALANCE OF ZERO. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD TBA AGENCY SECURITIES WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $900,000  . COUNTERPARTY RISK OF INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS ARE LIMITED TO SOME DEGREE BECAUSE OF DAILY MARK-TO-MARKET AND COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS. THESE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNED TO LOCK IN A PORTION OF FUNDING COSTS FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ASSETS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO HELP ASSURE THE REALIZATION OF ATTRACTIVE NET INTEREST MARGINS AND TO VARY INVERSELY IN VALUE WITH OUR MBS. SUCH CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PREPAYMENTS WHICH, IF NOT REALIZED, WILL CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM EXPECTATIONS.  ALTHOUGH WE ATTEMPT TO STRUCTURE OUR DERIVATIVES TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN ASSET PRICES, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE ACTUAL AND EXPECTED PRE-PAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES AS WELL AS THE VOLATILITY IN MORTGAGE INTEREST RATES RELATIVE TO U.S. TREASURY AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT RATES MAKES ACHIEVING HIGH LEVELS OF OFF-SET DIFFICULT.

FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , THE NET UNREALIZED LOSS OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES DECREASED BY  $(58,270)  AND  $(253,267)  . THE NET UNREALIZED GAIN (LOSS) ON AGENCY SECURITIES IS DUE TO MARKET PRICE FLUCTUATIONS.  AS REQUIRED BY THE DODD-FRANK ACT, THE COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION HAS ADOPTED RULES REQUIRING CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS TO BE CLEARED THROUGH A DERIVATIVES CLEARING ORGANIZATION. WE ARE REQUIRED TO CLEAR CERTAIN NEW INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS. CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS MAY HAVE HIGHER MARGIN REQUIREMENTS THAN UN-CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WE PREVIOUSLY HAD. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AN ACCOUNT WITH A FUTURES COMMISSION MERCHANT FOR THIS PURPOSE. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENTERED INTO ANY CLEARED INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS.  WE ARE REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR TBA AGENCY SECURITIES AS DERIVATIVES WHEN IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NOT TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. HOWEVER, FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE TBA AGENCY SECURITIES PRIMARILY TO EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISH PORTFOLIO POSITIONS. SEE THE SECTION, \"AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND TBA AGENCY SECURITIES\" ABOVE.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .

(2) REPRESENTS FEES TO BE PAID TO ACM UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS (SEE  NOTE 11  AND  NOTE 16  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  57  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  (3)  REPRESENTS COMPENSATION TO BE PAID TO THE BOARD IN THE FORM OF CASH AND COMMON EQUITY.  WE HAD CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS UNDER DERIVATIVES AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . WE HAD INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL BALANCE OF  $7,075,000  , A WEIGHTED AVERAGE SWAP RATE OF  1.76%  AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE TERM OF  44 MONTHS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , OUR LIQUIDITY TOTALED  $607,660  , CONSISTING OF  $160,484  OF CASH PLUS  $447,176  OF UNPLEDGED AGENCY SECURITIES (INCLUDING SECURITIES RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL). OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF FUNDS ARE BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS, MONTHLY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATING RESULTS. OTHER SOURCES OF FUNDS MAY INCLUDE PROCEEDS FROM EQUITY AND DEBT OFFERINGS AND ASSET SALES (SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). WE GENERALLY MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY TO PAY DOWN BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE ARRANGEMENTS TO REDUCE BORROWING COSTS AND OTHERWISE EFFICIENTLY MANAGE OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT CAPITAL. BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF OUR BORROWINGS CAN BE ADJUSTED ON A DAILY BASIS, THE LEVEL OF CASH CARRIED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN OUR POTENTIAL LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS.  OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE TO PURCHASE MBS, PAY INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL ON OUR BORROWINGS, FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND PAY DIVIDENDS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE PURCHASE OR SELL ASSETS FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT UP TO 90 DAYS IN THE FUTURE TO LOCK IN PURCHASE PRICES OR SALES PROCEEDS. WE GENERALLY SEEK TO BORROW (ON A RECOURSE BASIS) BETWEEN SIX AND TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY. AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE FINANCED OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH  $11,679,094  AND  $7,037,651  OF BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIOS AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WERE  8.45  :1 AND  6.25:1  , RESPECTIVELY. OUR LEVERAGE RATIO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AT PERIOD END BY TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT PERIOD END.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE PURCHASED  $9,667,024  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $1,065,321  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $4,641,443  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $342,374  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , WE PURCHASED  $4,221,351  OF SECURITIES USING PROCEEDS FROM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , WE RECEIVED CASH OF  $554,267  FROM PREPAYMENTS AND SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR MBS. WE HAD A NET CASH DECREASE FROM OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OF  $(337,183)  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  AND MADE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $157,928  ON OUR LIABILITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PURSUE ADDITIONAL LENDING COUNTERPARTIES IN ORDER TO HELP INCREASE OUR FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND ABILITY TO WITHSTAND PERIODS OF CONTRACTING LIQUIDITY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS.  CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $(112,313)  AND  $47,375  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH COLLATERAL POSTED TO COUNTERPARTIES RELATED TO OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN NET GAIN (LOSS) ON OUR DERIVATIVES. OUR AVERAGE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WAS  $12,786,113  AND  $9,768,984  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE SOLD  16,064  OF COMMON SHARES UNDER TWO UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND OUR COMMON STOCK ATM SALES AGREEMENT, FOR AN INCREASE IN EQUITY OF  $321,860  . DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE SOLD  833  SHARES UNDER THE PREFERRED B ATM SALES AGREEMENTS AND HAD COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES OF  (955)  SHARES. WE ALSO FULLY REDEEMED ALL 2,180,572 ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF OUR SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK ($25.00 PER SHARE, $54.5 MILLION IN THE AGGREGATE LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE) TO THE HOLDERS OF RECORD FOR OUR SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AS OF JUNE 14, 2019. PURSUANT TO THIS REDEMPTION, EACH SHARE OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK WAS CANCELED AND REPRESENTED SOLELY THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF  $25.00  PER SHARE OF SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK ON JULY 26, 2019. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, HOLDERS OF RECORD OF THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK ON JULY 15, 2019 RECEIVED  58  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  THE FULL MONTHLY DIVIDEND FOR JULY. THE FINAL DIVIDEND AMOUNT OF  $375  WAS PAID ON JULY 29, 2019 AND WAS RECORDED AS OTHER EXPENSE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING DISCUSSED ABOVE, FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE ENTERED INTO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER A TYPICAL REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, WE PURCHASE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM A BORROWER IN EXCHANGE FOR CASH AND AGREE TO SELL THE SAME SECURITIES BACK IN THE FUTURE. WE THEN SELL SUCH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES TO THIRD PARTIES AND RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY TO RETURN THE SECURITIES TO THE ORIGINAL BORROWER. REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT RECEIVABLES AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENT LIABILITIES ARE PRESENTED NET WHEN THEY MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA, INCLUDING BEING WITH THE SAME COUNTERPARTY, BEING GOVERNED BY THE SAME MRA, SETTLEMENT THROUGH THE SAME BROKERAGE OR CLEARING ACCOUNT AND MATURING ON THE SAME DAY. THE PRACTICAL EFFECT OF THESE TRANSACTIONS IS TO REPLACE A PORTION OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FINANCING OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO WITH SHORT POSITIONS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS HELPS TO REDUCE INTEREST RATE RISK, AND THEREFORE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY RISK. BOTH PARTIES TO THE REPURCHASE AND REVERSE REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE DAILY MARGIN CALLS BASED ON CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL OBTAINED AND/OR PLEDGED. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS, REPAYMENTS ON REPURCHASE BORROWINGS, REACQUISITION OF SECURITIES TO BE RETURNED TO BORROWERS AND THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AS REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES PORTFOLIO CAN TRIGGER MARGIN CALLS BY OUR LENDERS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AN EVENT OF DEFAULT OR TERMINATION EVENT UNDER THE STANDARD MRA WOULD GIVE OUR COUNTERPARTY THE OPTION TO TERMINATE ALL REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS EXISTING WITH US AND REQUIRE ANY AMOUNT DUE TO BE PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY.  CHANGING CAPITAL OR OTHER FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE OUR LENDERS TO EXIT THE REPURCHASE MARKET, INCREASE FINANCING RATES, TIGHTEN LENDING STANDARDS OR INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF REQUIRED EQUITY CAPITAL OR HAIRCUT WE POST, ANY OF WHICH COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR COSTLY FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING.  FINANCIAL SECTOR VOLATILITY CAN ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED DEMAND AND PRICES FOR HIGH QUALITY DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING AGENCY SECURITIES. WHILE INCREASED PRICES MAY INCREASE THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES, HIGHER VALUES MAY ALSO REDUCE THE RETURN ON REINVESTMENT OF CAPITAL, THEREBY LOWERING OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY.  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH REPRESENTS THE OUTSTANDING BALANCES OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS (BEFORE THE EFFECT OF NETTING REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS), WHICH FINANCE MOST OF OUR MBS. OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS BALANCE WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR CHANGE IN CAPITAL, LEVERAGE TARGETS AND THE MARKET PRICES OF OUR ASSETS. THE BALANCE OF REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING WILL FLUCTUATE WITHIN ANY GIVEN MONTH BASED ON CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PARTICULAR MBS PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL (INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF PRINCIPAL PAYDOWNS) AND THE LEVEL AND TIMING OF INVESTMENT AND REINVESTMENT ACTIVITY.  59  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  SEE  NOTE 9  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION.  EFFECTS OF MARGIN REQUIREMENTS, LEVERAGE AND CREDIT SPREADS  OUR MBS HAVE VALUES THAT FLUCTUATE ACCORDING TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR MBS WILL DECREASE AS PREVAILING INTEREST RATES OR CREDIT SPREADS INCREASE. WHEN THE VALUE OF THE SECURITIES PLEDGED TO SECURE A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT DECREASES TO THE POINT WHERE THE POSITIVE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COLLATERAL VALUE AND THE LOAN AMOUNT IS LESS THAN THE HAIRCUT, OUR LENDERS MAY ISSUE A MARGIN CALL, WHICH MEANS THAT THE LENDER WILL REQUIRE US TO PAY THE MARGIN CALL IN CASH OR PLEDGE ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL TO MEET THAT MARGIN CALL. UNDER OUR REPURCHASE FACILITIES, OUR LENDERS HAVE FULL DISCRETION TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE MBS WE PLEDGE TO THEM. MOST OF OUR LENDERS WILL VALUE SECURITIES BASED ON RECENT TRADES IN THE MARKET. LENDERS ALSO ISSUE MARGIN CALLS AS THE PUBLISHED CURRENT PRINCIPAL BALANCE FACTORS CHANGE ON THE POOL OF MORTGAGES UNDERLYING THE SECURITIES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL WHEN SCHEDULED AND UNSCHEDULED PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS ARE ANNOUNCED MONTHLY.  WE EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS AND UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DURING A PERIOD OF DECLINING MARKET VALUE FOR MBS AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS AS FREQUENTLY AS DAILY. IN SEEKING TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS ESTABLISHED BY OUR LENDERS, WE MAINTAIN A POSITION OF CASH AND UNPLEDGED SECURITIES. WE REFER TO THIS POSITION AS OUR LIQUIDITY. THE LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO MEET MARGIN CALLS IS DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY OUR LEVERAGE LEVELS, OUR HAIRCUTS AND THE PRICE CHANGES ON OUR SECURITIES. IF INTEREST RATES INCREASE AS A RESULT OF A YIELD CURVE SHIFT OR FOR ANOTHER REASON OR IF CREDIT SPREADS WIDEN, THE PRICES OF OUR COLLATERAL (AND OUR UNPLEDGED ASSETS THAT CONSTITUTE OUR LIQUIDITY) WILL DECLINE AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE MARGIN CALLS. WE WILL USE OUR LIQUIDITY TO MEET SUCH MARGIN CALLS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LEVELS OF LIQUIDITY TO MEET ANY MARGIN CALLS. IF OUR HAIRCUTS INCREASE, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL PROPORTIONATELY DECREASE. IF WE INCREASE OUR BORROWINGS, OUR LIQUIDITY WILL DECREASE BY THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL HAIRCUT ON THE INCREASED LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR MRAS CONTAIN A RESTRICTION THAT PROHIBITS OUR LEVERAGE FROM EXCEEDING TWELVE TIMES OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY AS WELL AS TERMINATION EVENTS IN THE CASE OF SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN EQUITY CAPITAL.  60  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF LIQUIDITY IN RELATION TO OUR ASSETS THAT ENABLES US TO MEET REASONABLY ANTICIPATED MARGIN CALLS BUT THAT ALSO ALLOWS US TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY INVESTED IN MBS. WE MAY MISJUDGE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF OUR LIQUIDITY BY MAINTAINING EXCESSIVE LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD LOWER OUR INVESTMENT RETURNS, OR BY MAINTAINING INSUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD FORCE US TO INVOLUNTARILY LIQUIDATE ASSETS INTO UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND HARM OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REGARDING LIQUIDITY  BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO, LEVERAGE RATE AND AVAILABLE BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE US TO MEET ANTICIPATED SHORT-TERM (ONE YEAR OR LESS) LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS TO FUND OUR INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES, MEET OUR FINANCING OBLIGATIONS, PAY FEES UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND FUND OUR DISTRIBUTIONS TO STOCKHOLDERS AND PAY GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES.  WE MAY INCREASE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES BY OBTAINING LONG-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OR MAKING PUBLIC OR PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING CLASSES OF PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK AND SENIOR OR SUBORDINATED NOTES TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM (GREATER THAN ONE YEAR) LIQUIDITY. SUCH FINANCING WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS FOR CAPITAL RAISES AND FOR THE INVESTMENT OF ANY PROCEEDS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY OBTAIN ANY SUCH FINANCING.  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  SEE  NOTE 13  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT MAINTAINED ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ENTITIES OFTEN REFERRED TO AS STRUCTURED FINANCE, OR SPECIAL PURPOSE OR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES. FURTHERMORE, AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 31, 2018  , WE HAD NOT GUARANTEED ANY OBLIGATIONS OF ANY UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR ENTERED INTO ANY COMMITMENT OR INTENT TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO ANY SUCH ENTITIES. ALL OF OUR TRANSACTIONS WITH BUCKLER ARE REFLECTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  SEE  NOTE 3  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES. SEE  NOTE 4  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED CHANGES.  VALUATION OF INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR MBS AND DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE. OUR AGENCY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE, AND THEREFORE UNREALIZED CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED DIRECTLY IN TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AS ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR LOSS. OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS TRADING SECURITIES, AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AS INCOME OR LOSS. WE DO NOT USE HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR OUR DERIVATIVES FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND THEREFORE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT FAIR VALUE CHANGES ON DERIVATIVES OFFSET FAIR VALUE CHANGES IN OUR MBS, THE FLUCTUATION IN OUR STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY WILL BE LOWER. FOR EXAMPLE, RISING INTEREST RATES MAY TEND TO RESULT IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OUR REPORTED NET INCOME EVEN WHILE OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY DECLINES.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES USE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE PRICING MODELS THAT MAY INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COUPONS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, SPREAD TO THE TREASURY CURVES AND INTEREST RATE SWAP CURVES, DURATION, PERIODIC AND LIFE CAPS AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF AN AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR AGENCY SECURITIES. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS PRICING  61  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  USED TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, COMPARISONS OF SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR ALTERNATIVE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES, DEALER PRICING INDICATIONS AND COMPARISONS TO A THIRD PARTY PRICING MODEL.  THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES THAT INCORPORATE COMMON MARKET PRICING METHODS THAT MAY INCLUDE CURRENT INTEREST RATE CURVES, FORWARD INTEREST RATE CURVES AND MARKET SPREADS TO INTEREST RATE CURVES. MANAGEMENT COMPARES PRICING INFORMATION RECEIVED TO DEALER QUOTES TO ENSURE THAT THE CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES. THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES INCORPORATE SUCH FACTORS AS COLLATERAL TYPE, BOND STRUCTURE AND PRIORITY OF PAYMENTS, COUPONS, PREPAYMENT SPEEDS, DEFAULTS, DELINQUENCIES AND SEVERITIES. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITY IS NOT AVAILABLE FROM THE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES OR SUCH DATA APPEARS UNRELIABLE, WE OBTAIN PRICING INDICATIONS FROM UP TO THREE DEALERS WHO MAKE MARKETS IN SIMILAR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS PRICING USED TO ENSURE THAT CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS ARE PROPERLY REFLECTED. THIS REVIEW INCLUDES, BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO, COMPARISONS OF SIMILAR MARKET TRANSACTIONS OR ALTERNATIVE THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES, DEALER PRICING INDICATIONS AND COMPARISONS TO A THIRD PARTY PRICING MODEL.  FAIR VALUE FOR THE U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN OUR SECURITIES PORTFOLIO IS BASED ON OBTAINING A VALUATION FOR EACH U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES FROM THIRD PARTY PRICING SERVICES AND/OR DEALER QUOTES.  REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AGENCY SECURITIES  SECURITY PURCHASE AND SALE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING PURCHASES AND SALES FOR FORWARD SETTLEMENT, ARE RECORDED ON THE TRADE DATE TO THE EXTENT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL TAKE OR MAKE TIMELY PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE RELATED SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME AND ARE DETERMINED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. WE REALIZE GAINS AND LOSSES ON OUR AGENCY SECURITIES UPON THEIR SALE. AT THAT TIME, PREVIOUSLY UNREALIZED AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ARE RECLASSIFIED AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAIN OR LOSS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE SELL AGENCY SECURITIES IN LATER PERIODS AFTER CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AGENCY SECURITIES HAVE OCCURRED, WE MAY REPORT SIGNIFICANT NET INCOME OR NET LOSS WITHOUT A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN OUR TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.  DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR AGENCY SECURITIES THAT REPRESENT AND OTTI ARE ALSO TREATED AS REALIZED LOSSES AND REPORTED IN NET INCOME AS OTHER LOSS. WE EVALUATE AGENCY SECURITIES FOR OTTI AT LEAST ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND MORE FREQUENTLY WHEN ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONCERNS WARRANT SUCH EVALUATION. WE CONSIDER AN IMPAIRMENT TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IF WE (1) HAVE THE INTENT TO SELL THE AGENCY SECURITIES, (2) BELIEVE IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITIES BEFORE RECOVERY (FOR EXAMPLE, BECAUSE OF LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS OR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS), OR (3) A CREDIT LOSS EXISTS. IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED ESTABLISH A NEW COST BASIS FOR THE RELATED AGENCY SECURITIES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON SUBSEQUENT SALES ARE DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO SUCH NEW COST BASIS.  GAINS AND LOSSES ON CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES, INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AND U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES  WE CARRY OUR CREDIT RISK AND NON-AGENCY SECURITIES AND INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND REFLECT CHANGES IN THOSE FAIR VALUES IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES.  WE CARRY OUR U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AT FAIR VALUE AND REFLECT CHANGES IN THOSE FAIR VALUES IN NET INCOME AS OTHER GAINS AND LOSSES.  INFLATION  VIRTUALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE INTEREST RATE-SENSITIVE IN NATURE. AS A RESULT, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCE OUR PERFORMANCE FAR MORE THAN INFLATION. CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES DO NOT NECESSARILY CORRELATE WITH INFLATION RATES OR CHANGES IN INFLATION RATES. OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND ANY DISTRIBUTIONS WE MAY MAKE WILL BE DETERMINED BY OUR BOARD BASED IN PART ON OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME AS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS  62  ARMOUR RESIDENTIAL REIT, INC.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CONTINUED)  OF THE CODE; IN EACH CASE, OUR ACTIVITIES AND BALANCE SHEET ARE MEASURED WITH REFERENCE TO FAIR VALUE WITHOUT CONSIDERING INFLATION.

ESSEX OWNS ALL OF ITS INTERESTS IN ITS REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP. ESSEX IS THE SOLE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP AND, AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , HAD AN APPROXIMATELY  96.6%  GENERAL PARTNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS TWO COMPONENTS: CONSTANT MONITORING OF EXISTING MARKETS, AND EVALUATION OF NEW MARKETS TO IDENTIFY AREAS WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT UNDERLIE RENTAL GROWTH. THE COMPANY\u2019S STRONG FINANCIAL CONDITION SUPPORTS ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY BY ENHANCING ITS ABILITY TO QUICKLY SHIFT ACQUISITION, DEVELOPMENT, REDEVELOPMENT, AND DISPOSITION ACTIVITIES TO MARKETS THAT WILL OPTIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PORTFOLIO.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED OR HAD OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  249  OPERATING APARTMENT COMMUNITIES, COMPRISING  60,620  APARTMENT HOMES, EXCLUDING THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN PREFERRED EQUITY CO-INVESTMENTS, LOAN INVESTMENTS,  ONE  OPERATING COMMERCIAL BUILDING, AND  SEVEN  ACTIVE DEVELOPMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S APARTMENT COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE FOLLOWING MAJOR REGIONS.  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  (PRIMARILY LOS ANGELES, ORANGE, SAN DIEGO, AND VENTURA COUNTIES)  NORTHERN CALIFORNIA  (THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA)  SEATTLE  METRO  (SEATTLE METROPOLITAN AREA)  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WAS COMPRISED OF  FIVE  CONSOLIDATED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  TWO  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND VARIOUS CONSOLIDATED PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AGGREGATING  1,960  APARTMENT HOMES, WITH TOTAL INCURRED COSTS OF  $1.0 BILLION  , AND ESTIMATED REMAINING PROJECT COSTS OF  $0.3 BILLION  , $0.2 BILLION OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS, FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS OF  $1.3 BILLION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED APARTMENT COMMUNITIES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

COMPARISON OF THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  THE COMPANY\u2019S AVERAGE FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S STABILIZED APARTMENT COMMUNITIES OR \"SAME-PROPERTY\" (STABILIZED PROPERTIES CONSOLIDATED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  ) WAS  96.0%  AND  96.4%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS DEFINED AS THE PERCENTAGE RESULTING FROM DIVIDING ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME BY TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME. ACTUAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS CONTRACTUAL RENTAL INCOME PURSUANT TO LEASES WITHOUT CONSIDERING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. TOTAL POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES, WITH OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT CONTRACTUAL RENTAL RATES PURSUANT TO  40  LEASES AND VACANT APARTMENT HOMES VALUED AT ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY IS A MEANINGFUL MEASURE OF OCCUPANCY BECAUSE IT CONSIDERS THE VALUE OF EACH VACANT APARTMENT HOME AT ITS ESTIMATED MARKET RATE.  MARKET RATES ARE DETERMINED USING THE RECENTLY SIGNED EFFECTIVE RATES ON NEW LEASES AT THE PROPERTY AND ARE USED AS THE STARTING POINT IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE MARKET RATES OF VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE COMPANY MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THESE RATES BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERALL SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR HOUSING, CONCENTRATION OF NEW APARTMENT DELIVERIES WITHIN THE SAME SUBMARKET WHICH CAN CAUSE PERIODIC DISRUPTION DUE TO GREATER RENTAL CONCESSIONS TO INCREASE LEASING VELOCITY, AND RENTAL AFFORDABILITY. FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT COMPLETELY REFLECT SHORT-TERM TRENDS IN PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY AND FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY DISCLOSED BY OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS TO CALCULATE ACTUAL RENT FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES AND MARKET RENTS FOR VACANT APARTMENT HOMES. THE CALCULATION OF FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY COMPARES CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR OCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES TO ESTIMATED MARKET RENTS FOR UNOCCUPIED APARTMENT HOMES, AND THUS THE CALCULATION COMPARES THE GROSS VALUE OF ALL APARTMENT HOMES EXCLUDING DELINQUENCY AND CONCESSIONS. FOR APARTMENT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES IN LEASE-UP WITHOUT STABILIZED OCCUPANCY FIGURES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PHYSICAL OCCUPANCY RATE IS THE APPROPRIATE PERFORMANCE METRIC. WHILE AN APARTMENT COMMUNITY IS IN THE LEASE-UP PHASE, THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY MOTIVATION IS TO STABILIZE THE PROPERTY WHICH MAY ENTAIL THE USE OF RENT CONCESSIONS AND OTHER INCENTIVES, AND THUS FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY, WHICH IS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL INCOME, IS NOT CONSIDERED THE BEST METRIC TO QUANTIFY OCCUPANCY.  THE REGIONAL BREAKDOWN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SAME-PROPERTY PORTFOLIO FOR FINANCIAL OCCUPANCY FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  IS AS FOLLOWS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO RELATED FORWARD SALE AGREEMENTS WHEREBY, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION, IT MAY SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM UNDER FORWARD SALES AGREEMENTS. THE USE OF A FORWARD SALES AGREEMENT WOULD ALLOW THE COMPANY TO LOCK IN A SHARE PRICE ON THE SALE OF SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT THE TIME THE AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED, BUT DEFER RECEIVING THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF SHARES UNTIL A LATER DATE. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY ISSUED  228,271  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE 2018 ATM PROGRAM AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $321.56  PER SHARE FOR PROCEEDS OF  $73.4 MILLION  .

DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AND RETIRED 234,061 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK TOTALING $57.0 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $243.48 PER SHARE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $250.0 MILLION OF PURCHASE AUTHORITY REMAINING UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN.  ESSEX PAYS QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS FROM CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. UNTIL IT IS DISTRIBUTED, CASH AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION IS INVESTED BY THE COMPANY PRIMARILY IN INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES HELD AVAILABLE FOR SALE OR IS USED BY THE COMPANY TO REDUCE BALANCES OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS LINE OF CREDIT.  DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS NEW COMMUNITIES THAT ARE BEING CONSTRUCTED, OR ARE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED AND ARE IN A PHASE OF LEASE-UP AND HAVE NOT YET REACHED STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WAS COMPRISED OF  FIVE  CONSOLIDATED PROJECTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT,  TWO  UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURE PROJECTS UNDER  45  DEVELOPMENT AND VARIOUS CONSOLIDATED PREDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AGGREGATING  1,960  APARTMENT HOMES, WITH TOTAL INCURRED COSTS OF  $1.0 BILLION  , AND ESTIMATED REMAINING PROJECT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $0.3 BILLION  ,  $0.2 BILLION  OF WHICH REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS, FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED PROJECT COSTS OF  $1.3 BILLION.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT AND PREDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE BY USING A COMBINATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SOURCES: ITS WORKING CAPITAL, AMOUNTS AVAILABLE ON ITS LINES OF CREDIT, CONSTRUCTION LOANS, NET PROCEEDS FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EQUITY AND DEBT ISSUANCES, AND PROCEEDS FROM THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, IF ANY.  REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE  THE COMPANY DEFINES REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AS EXISTING PROPERTIES OWNED OR RECENTLY ACQUIRED, WHICH HAVE BEEN TARGETED FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY WITH THE EXPECTATION OF INCREASED FINANCIAL RETURNS THROUGH PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT. DURING REDEVELOPMENT, APARTMENT HOMES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR RENT AND, AS A RESULT, MAY HAVE LESS THAN STABILIZED OPERATIONS. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN  FOUR  MAJOR REDEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES AGGREGATING  1,327  APARTMENT HOMES WITH ESTIMATED REDEVELOPMENT COSTS OF  $132.7 MILLION  , OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY  $17.0 MILLION  REMAINS TO BE EXPENDED. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CEASE FUNDING OF THE REDEVELOPMENT PIPELINE AS NEEDED.  DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY  THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE CAPS, AND TOTAL RETURN SWAP CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE VALUATION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS IS DETERMINED USING WIDELY ACCEPTED VALUATION TECHNIQUES INCLUDING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS ON THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF EACH DERIVATIVE. THIS ANALYSIS REFLECTS THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING THE PERIOD TO MATURITY, AND USES OBSERVABLE MARKET-BASED INPUTS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE FAIR VALUES OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND TOTAL RETURN SWAPS ARE DETERMINED USING THE MARKET STANDARD METHODOLOGY OF NETTING THE DISCOUNTED FUTURE FIXED CASH RECEIPTS (OR PAYMENTS) AND THE DISCOUNTED EXPECTED VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS). THE VARIABLE CASH PAYMENTS (OR RECEIPTS) ARE BASED ON AN EXPECTATION OF FUTURE INTEREST RATES (FORWARD CURVES) DERIVED FROM OBSERVABLE MARKET INTEREST RATE CURVES. THE COMPANY INCORPORATES CREDIT VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO APPROPRIATELY REFLECT BOTH ITS OWN NONPERFORMANCE RISK AND THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTY\u2019S NONPERFORMANCE RISK IN THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL SOURCES  THE COMPANY UTILIZES CO-INVESTMENTS AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE OF CAPITAL FOR ACQUISITIONS OF BOTH OPERATING AND DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITIES. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 806 APARTMENT HOMES IN COMMUNITIES ACTIVELY UNDER DEVELOPMENT WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS OF $0.6 BILLION. TOTAL ESTIMATED REMAINING COSTS ARE APPROXIMATELY $87.0 MILLION, OF WHICH THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN THESE DEVELOPMENT JOINT VENTURES WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $43.5 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD AN INTEREST IN 10,827 APARTMENT HOMES OF OPERATING COMMUNITIES WITH JOINT VENTURES FOR A TOTAL BOOK VALUE OF $863.8 MILLION AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS UNCONSOLIDATED INTERESTS IN CERTAIN JOINT VENTURES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS HAVE A MATERIALLY DIFFERENT IMPACT ON ITS LIQUIDITY, CASH FLOWS, CAPITAL RESOURCES, CREDIT OR MARKET RISK THAN ITS CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 4, CO-INVESTMENTS, IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR CARRYING VALUES AND COMBINED SUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF THESE UNCONSOLIDATED INVESTMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DEFINES CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGEMENT TO EXERCISE THEIR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX JUDGMENTS. THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO THE FOLLOWING KEY AREAS: (I) ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF INVESTMENTS IN REAL ESTATE. SPECIFICALLY, THE ALLOCATION BETWEEN LAND AND BUILDINGS; AND (II) EVALUATION OF EVENTS AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATING WHETHER THE COMPANY\u2019S RENTAL PROPERTIES MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.  46  THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES HAVE NOT CHANGED MATERIALLY FROM THE INFORMATION REPORTED IN NOTE 2, SUMMARY OF CRITICAL AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.

ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE MADE AS OF THE DATE HEREOF, THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR SUPPLEMENT THIS INFORMATION FOR ANY REASON, AND THEREFORE, THEY MAY NOT REPRESENT THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS AFTER THE DATE OF THIS REPORT.  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS AND UNITHOLDERS (\"FFO\") IS A FINANCIAL MEASURE THAT IS COMMONLY USED IN THE REIT INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY PRESENTS FFO AND FFO EXCLUDING NON-CORE ITEMS (REFERRED TO AS \"CORE FFO\") AS SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURES. FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT USED BY THE COMPANY AS, NOR SHOULD THEY BE  47  CONSIDERED TO BE, ALTERNATIVES TO NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PERFORMANCE OR AS ALTERNATIVES TO CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO FUND ITS CASH NEEDS.  FFO AND CORE FFO ARE NOT MEANT TO REPRESENT A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND DO NOT PRESENT, NOR DO THEY INTEND TO PRESENT, A COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NET INCOME COMPUTED UNDER U.S. GAAP IS THE PRIMARY MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE AND THAT FFO AND CORE FFO ARE ONLY MEANINGFUL WHEN THEY ARE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH NET INCOME.  THE COMPANY CONSIDERS FFO AND CORE FFO TO BE USEFUL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS OF AN EQUITY REIT BECAUSE, TOGETHER WITH NET INCOME AND CASH FLOWS, FFO AND CORE FFO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ADDITIONAL BASES TO EVALUATE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND ABILITY OF A REIT TO INCUR AND SERVICE DEBT AND TO FUND ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND TO PAY DIVIDENDS. BY EXCLUDING GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO SALES OF DEPRECIATED OPERATING PROPERTIES AND EXCLUDING REAL ESTATE DEPRECIATION (WHICH CAN VARY AMONG OWNERS OF IDENTICAL ASSETS IN SIMILAR CONDITION BASED ON HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING AND USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES), FFO CAN HELP INVESTORS COMPARE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A REAL ESTATE COMPANY BETWEEN PERIODS OR AS COMPARED TO DIFFERENT COMPANIES. BY FURTHER ADJUSTING FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CORE BUSINESS OPERATIONS, CORE FFO ALLOWS INVESTORS TO COMPARE THE CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY TO ITS PERFORMANCE IN PRIOR REPORTING PERIODS AND TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF OTHER REAL ESTATE COMPANIES WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF ITEMS THAT BY THEIR NATURE ARE NOT COMPARABLE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND TEND TO OBSCURE THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTUAL OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP, PROVIDE THE MOST MEANINGFUL PICTURE OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND ITS OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  IN CALCULATING FFO, THE COMPANY FOLLOWS THE DEFINITION FOR THIS MEASURE PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\"NAREIT\"), WHICH IS THE LEADING REIT INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, UNDER THE NAREIT FFO DEFINITION, THE TWO MOST SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO NET INCOME ARE (I) THE EXCLUSION OF HISTORICAL COST DEPRECIATION AND (II) THE EXCLUSION OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALE OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY AGREES THAT THESE TWO NAREIT ADJUSTMENTS ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  (A)  HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE ASSETS IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP ASSUMES, THROUGH DEPRECIATION CHARGES, THAT THE VALUE OF REAL ESTATE ASSETS DIMINISHES PREDICTABLY OVER TIME. NAREIT STATED IN ITS WHITE PAPER ON FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS \"SINCE REAL ESTATE ASSET VALUES HAVE HISTORICALLY RISEN OR FALLEN WITH MARKET CONDITIONS, MANY INDUSTRY INVESTORS HAVE CONSIDERED PRESENTATIONS OF OPERATING RESULTS FOR REAL ESTATE COMPANIES THAT USE HISTORICAL COST ACCOUNTING TO BE INSUFFICIENT BY THEMSELVES.\" CONSEQUENTLY, NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO REFLECTS THE FACT THAT REAL ESTATE, AS AN ASSET CLASS, GENERALLY APPRECIATES OVER TIME AND DEPRECIATION CHARGES REQUIRED BY U.S. GAAP DO NOT REFLECT THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC REALITIES.  (B)  REITS WERE CREATED AS A LEGAL FORM OF ORGANIZATION IN ORDER TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF REAL ESTATE AS AN ASSET CLASS THROUGH INVESTMENT IN FIRMS THAT WERE IN THE BUSINESS OF LONG-TERM OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT OF REAL ESTATE.  THE EXCLUSION, IN NAREIT\u2019S DEFINITION OF FFO, OF GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THE SALES OF PREVIOUSLY DEPRECIATED OPERATING REAL ESTATE ASSETS ALLOWS INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO READILY IDENTIFY THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE LONG-TERM ASSETS THAT FORM THE CORE OF A REIT\u2019S ACTIVITY AND ASSISTS IN COMPARING THOSE OPERATING RESULTS BETWEEN PERIODS.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT HAS CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THE NAREIT DEFINITION OF FFO TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, THERE IS JUDGMENT INVOLVED AND OTHER REITS\u2019 CALCULATION OF FFO MAY VARY FROM THE NAREIT DEFINITION FOR THIS MEASURE, AND THUS THEIR DISCLOSURE OF FFO MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CALCULATION.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE IS A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS TO FFO AND CORE FFO FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS).  48  ESSEX PROPERTY TRUST, INC.

INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES A NET UNREALIZED GAIN OF $4.4 MILLION.  (3) INTEREST RATE SWAPS GENERALLY ARE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS). HOWEVER, BECAUSE CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST RATE SWAPS DO NOT HAVE A 0% LIBOR FLOOR, WHILE RELATED HEDGED DEBT IN THESE CASES IS SUBJECT TO A 0% LIBOR FLOOR, THE PORTION OF THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS MISMATCH, IF ANY, IS RECORDED AS A NON-CASH INTEREST RATE HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS THROUGH INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE PRESENTATION OF SAME-PROPERTY NOI ASSISTS WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATIONS PRIOR TO THE ALLOCATION OF DEPRECIATION AND ANY CORPORATE-LEVEL OR FINANCING-RELATED COSTS. NOI REFLECTS THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF A COMMUNITY AND ALLOWS FOR AN EASY COMPARISON OF THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES OR GROUPS OF COMMUNITIES. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE PROSPECTIVE BUYERS OF REAL ESTATE HAVE DIFFERENT FINANCING AND OVERHEAD STRUCTURES, WITH VARYING MARGINAL IMPACTS TO OVERHEAD BY ACQUIRING REAL ESTATE, NOI IS CONSIDERED BY MANY IN THE REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY TO BE A USEFUL MEASURE FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A REAL ESTATE ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS. THE COMPANY DEFINES SAME-PROPERTY NOI AS SAME-PROPERTY REVENUES LESS SAME-PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PROPERTY TAXES.

EXECUTIVE  OVERVIEW  KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION, A MARYLAND CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\u2019S LARGEST PUBLICLY TRADED OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS.   THE TERMS \u201cKIMCO,\u201d THE \u201cCOMPANY,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cOUR\u201d AND \u201cUS\u201d EACH REFER TO KIMCO REALTY CORPORATION AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES, UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S MISSION IS TO CREATE DESTINATIONS FOR EVERYDAY LIVING THAT INSPIRE A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND DELIVER VALUE TO OUR MANY STAKEHOLDERS.  THE COMPANY IS A SELF-ADMINISTERED REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) AND HAS OWNED AND OPERATED OPEN-AIR SHOPPING CENTERS FOR OVER 60 YEARS.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED, NOR DOES IT EXPECT TO RETAIN, ANY REIT ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS PROPERTIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD INTERESTS IN 420 SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES, AGGREGATING 73.6 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GROSS LEASABLE AREA (\u201cGLA\u201d), LOCATED IN 27 STATES AND PUERTO RICO. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD 247 OTHER PROPERTY INTERESTS, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE COMPANY\u2019S PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND OTHER REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS, TOTALING 4.5 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF GLA. THE COMPANY\u2019S OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN REAL ESTATE CONSIST OF ITS CONSOLIDATED PORTFOLIO AND PORTFOLIOS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS AN ECONOMIC INTEREST, SUCH AS PROPERTIES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS, WHERE THE COMPANY PARTNERS WITH INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND ALSO RETAINS MANAGEMENT.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING STRATEGIES ARE TO (I) OWN AND OPERATE ITS SHOPPING CENTER PROPERTIES AT THEIR HIGHEST POTENTIAL THROUGH MAXIMIZING AND MAINTAINING RENTAL INCOME AND OCCUPANCY LEVELS, (II) ATTRACT LOCAL AREA CUSTOMERS TO ITS SHOPPING CENTERS, WHICH OFFER OFF-PRICE MERCHANDISE AND DAY-TO-DAY NECESSITIES RATHER THAN HIGH-PRICED LUXURY ITEMS, AND (III) MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET.  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS TO INVEST CAPITAL INTO HIGH QUALITY ASSETS FOCUSING ON MAJOR METROPOLITAN-AREA U.S. MARKETS, PREDOMINANTLY ON THE EAST AND WEST COASTS AND IN THE SUNBELT REGION, WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY STRONG DEMOGRAPHICS, SIGNIFICANT PROJECTED POPULATION GROWTH, AND WHERE THE COMPANY PERCEIVES SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ENTRY WHILE DISPOSING OF LESSER QUALITY ASSETS IN LESS DESIRABLE LOCATIONS. THROUGH THIS STRATEGY, THE COMPANY HAS STEADILY PROGRESSED IN ITS TRANSFORMATION OF ITS PORTFOLIO AND WILL CONTINUE THESE EFFORTS AS DEEMED NECESSARY TO MAXIMIZE THE QUALITY AND GROWTH OF ITS PORTFOLIO. THE PROPERTIES ACQUIRED ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN MAJOR METROPOLITAN AREAS ALLOWING TENANTS TO GENERATE HIGHER FOOT TRAFFIC RESULTING IN HIGHER SALES VOLUME. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS WILL ENABLE IT TO MAINTAIN HIGHER OCCUPANCY LEVELS, RENTAL RATES AND RENTAL GROWTH. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY, ON A SELECTIVE BASIS, HAS EMBARKED ON SEVERAL GROUND-UP DEVELOPMENT AND RE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WHICH INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY ALSO INCLUDES THE RETAIL RE-TENANTING, RENOVATION AND EXPANSION OF ITS EXISTING CENTERS AND ACQUIRED CENTERS, WHILE ALSO PURSUING REDEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE OVERALL VALUE WITHIN ITS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE ESTABLISHED INCOME-PRODUCING REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES AND PROPERTIES REQUIRING SIGNIFICANT RE-TENANTING AND REDEVELOPMENT, PRIMARILY IN GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY PRESENTLY OPERATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY SELECTIVELY ACQUIRE LAND PARCELS IN ITS KEY MARKETS FOR REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER INVESTMENTS IN OTHER REAL ESTATE SECTORS AND IN GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS WHERE IT DOES NOT PRESENTLY OPERATE SHOULD SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO SIMPLIFY ITS BUSINESS BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ITS JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS.  AS PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INVESTMENT STRATEGY EACH PROPERTY IS EVALUATED FOR ITS HIGHEST AND BEST USE, WHICH MAY INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL AND MIXED-USE COMPONENTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC INVESTMENTS RELATED TO RETAILER CONTROLLED REAL ESTATE SUCH AS, REPOSITIONING UNDERPERFORMING RETAIL LOCATIONS, RETAIL REAL ESTATE FINANCING AND BANKRUPTCY TRANSACTION SUPPORT. THE COMPANY HAS AN ACTIVE CAPITAL RECYCLING PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES FOR THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PROPERTIES. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE FOR ANY OF THESE ASSETS IS LESS THAN THEIR NET CARRYING VALUES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND SUCH AMOUNTS COULD BE MATERIAL.

SINCE CASH USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS REDUCES AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR CAPITAL INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY GENERALLY INTENDS TO MAINTAIN A CONSERVATIVE DIVIDEND PAYOUT RATIO, RESERVING SUCH AMOUNTS AS IT CONSIDERS NECESSARY FOR THE EXPANSION AND RENOVATION OF SHOPPING CENTERS IN ITS PORTFOLIO, DEBT REDUCTION, THE ACQUISITION OF INTERESTS IN NEW PROPERTIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS AS SUITABLE OPPORTUNITIES ARISE AND SUCH OTHER FACTORS AS THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS CONSIDERS APPROPRIATE.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY PRIMARILY RECOVERED ITS BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE CLAIMS DURING 2018 AND 2017, IT WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS AND PROCESS ANY FUTURE BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF INDEMNITY AND WILL SUBMIT INSURANCE CLAIMS FOR ITS LOSSES, IF ANY, UNDER ITS BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE POLICY.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER  \u2013  THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXES ON ITS ACTIVITIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO AND MEXICO.  IN GENERAL, UNDER LOCAL COUNTRY LAW APPLICABLE TO THE STRUCTURES THE COMPANY HAS IN PLACE AND APPLICABLE TREATIES, THE REPATRIATION OF CASH TO THE COMPANY FROM ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO AND MEXICO GENERALLY ARE NOT SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING TAX. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AND ALSO INCLUDES IN ITS TAX PROVISION NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES ON CERTAIN INVESTMENTS LOCATED IN JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY THE COMPANY AT THE REIT LEVEL AND NOT IN THE COMPANY\u2019S TAXABLE REIT SUBSIDIARY. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A U.S. INCOME TAX IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPATRIATION OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  FUNDS  F  ROM OPERATIONS  FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (\u201cFFO\u201d) IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE UTILIZED TO EVALUATE THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES. IN DECEMBER 2018, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (\u201cNAREIT\u201d) ISSUED \u201cNAREIT FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT\u201d WHICH CLARIFIES, WHERE NECESSARY, EXISTING GUIDANCE AND CONSOLIDATES ALERTS AND POLICY BULLETINS INTO A SINGLE DOCUMENT FOR EASE OF USE.  NAREIT DEFINES FFO AS NET INCOME/(LOSS) AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), EXCLUDING (I) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION RELATED TO REAL ESTATE, (II) GAINS OR LOSSES FROM SALES OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS, (III) GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGE IN CONTROL, (IV) IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS IN ENTITIES WHEN THE IMPAIRMENT IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF DEPRECIABLE REAL ESTATE HELD BY THE ENTITY AND (V) AFTER ADJUSTMENTS FOR UNCONSOLIDATED PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES CALCULATED TO REFLECT FFO ON THE SAME BASIS. INCLUDED IN THE 2018 RESTATEMENT IS AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AN ELECTION TO INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS INCIDENTAL TO ITS MAIN BUSINESS IN THE CALCULATION OF FFO. THE MAIN BUSINESS OF A REIT IS ACQUIRING, OWNING, OPERATING, DEVELOPING AND REDEVELOPING REAL ESTATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS RENTAL OF REAL ESTATE.  INCIDENTAL ASSETS MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, LAND PERIPHERAL TO OPERATING PROPERTIES, PROPERTY DEVELOPED FOR SALE, AND SECURITIES. THE NAREIT FFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT (\u201cFFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT\u201d) IS EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND INTERIM PERIODS REPORTED WITHIN THOSE PERIODS.  AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE FFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO EXCLUDE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ASSETS AND IMPAIRMENTS OF ASSETS INCIDENTAL TO ITS MAIN BUSINESS AND TO EXCLUDE MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN VALUE OF ITS EQUITY SECURITIES IN CALCULATING FFO. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER INCLUDE GAINS/IMPAIRMENTS ON LAND PARCELS, GAINS/LOSSES (REALIZED OR UNREALIZED) FROM MARKETABLE SECURITIES OR GAINS/IMPAIRMENTS ON PREFERRED EQUITY PARTICIPATIONS IN NAREIT DEFINED FFO.  THE COMPANY PRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS IT CONSIDERS IT AN IMPORTANT SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND BELIEVES IT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES IN THE EVALUATION OF REITS, MANY OF WHICH PRESENT FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS WHEN REPORTING RESULTS. COMPARISON OF OUR PRESENTATION OF FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES FOR OTHER REITS MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE MEANINGFUL DUE TO POSSIBLE DIFFERENCES IN THE APPLICATION OF THE NAREIT DEFINITION USED BY SUCH REITS.  THE COMPANY ALSO PRESENTS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED AS AN ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURE AS IT BELIEVES IT IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF ITS CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDES INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE TO COMPARE THE COMPANY\u2019S PERFORMANCE ACROSS REPORTING PERIODS ON A CONSISTENT BASIS BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ARE INDICATIVE OF OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED IS GENERALLY CALCULATED BY THE COMPANY AS FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS EXCLUDING CERTAIN TRANSACTIONAL INCOME AND EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING IMPAIRMENTS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT REFLECTIVE OF THE RESULTS WITHIN THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING REAL ESTATE PORTFOLIO.  FFO IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES\u2019 OPERATING PERFORMANCES, WHICH DOES NOT REPRESENT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND THEREFORE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE FOR NET INCOME OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY.  OUR METHOD OF CALCULATING FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM METHODS USED BY OTHER REITS AND, ACCORDINGLY, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SUCH OTHER REITS.  THE COMPANY\u2019S RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AND FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS AS ADJUSTED, IS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE BELOW (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA). IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF NAREIT\u2019S FFO WHITE PAPER \u2013 2018 RESTATEMENT, THE COMPANY HAS RECLASSIFIED $4.2 MILLION AND $14.4 MILLION FROM TRANSACTIONAL INCOME INTO FFO AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON SHAREHOLDERS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, RELATING TO INCIDENTAL GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE SALE OF ASSETS AND MARK-TO-MARKET CHANGES IN EQUITY SECURITIES.

SAME PROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME  (\u201c  S  AME PROPERTY NOI\u201d)  SAME PROPERTY NOI IS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF REAL ESTATE COMPANIES\u2019 OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE TO NET INCOME IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP OR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS A MEASURE OF LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SAME PROPERTY NOI AS AN IMPORTANT OPERATING PERFORMANCE MEASURE BECAUSE IT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS TO MEASURE ONLY THE NET OPERATING INCOME OF PROPERTIES THAT HAVE BEEN OWNED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE ENTIRE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR REPORTING PERIODS. IT EXCLUDES PROPERTIES UNDER REDEVELOPMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND PENDING STABILIZATION; PROPERTIES ARE DEEMED STABILIZED AT THE EARLIER OF (I) REACHING 90% LEASED OR (II) ONE YEAR FOLLOWING A PROJECT\u2019S INCLUSION IN OPERATING REAL ESTATE. SAME PROPERTY NOI ASSISTS IN ELIMINATING DISPARITIES IN NET INCOME DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF PROPERTIES DURING THE PARTICULAR PERIOD PRESENTED, AND THUS PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE MEASURE FOR THE COMPARISON OF THE COMPANY'S PROPERTIES.  SAME PROPERTY NOI IS CALCULATED USING REVENUES FROM RENTAL PROPERTIES (EXCLUDING STRAIGHT-LINE RENT ADJUSTMENTS, LEASE TERMINATION FEES, TIFS AND AMORTIZATION OF ABOVE/BELOW MARKET RENTS) LESS CHARGES FOR BAD DEBT, OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, REAL ESTATE TAXES AND RENT EXPENSE PLUS THE COMPANY\u2019S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF SAME PROPERTY NOI FROM UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE JOINT VENTURES, CALCULATED ON THE SAME BASIS.

IN ADDITION, THERE WAS ADVERSE PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT RECORDED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 UNDER THE 2010 ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION (\u201cA&EP\u201d) LOSS PORTFOLIO TRANSFER AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY AND OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS  CNA\u2019S COMMERCIAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS (\u201cPROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS\u201d) INCLUDE ITS SPECIALTY, COMMERCIAL AND INTERNATIONAL LINES OF BUSINESS. CNA\u2019S OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS INCLUDE ITS LONG TERM CARE BUSINESS THAT IS IN  RUN-OFF,  CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES, INCLUDING INTEREST ON CNA\u2019S CORPORATE DEBT, AND CERTAIN PROPERTY AND CASUALTY BUSINESSES IN  RUN-OFF,  INCLUDING CNA RE AND A&EP. CNA\u2019S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PRIMARILY MARKETED THROUGH INDEPENDENT AGENTS, BROKERS AND MANAGING GENERAL UNDERWRITERS TO A WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE BUSINESSES, INSURANCE COMPANIES, ASSOCIATIONS, PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER GROUPS. WE BELIEVE THE PRESENTATION OF CNA AS ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT IS APPROPRIATE IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ON SEGMENT REPORTING. HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, WE PROVIDE GREATER DETAIL WITH RESPECT TO CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS AND OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS TO ENHANCE THE READER\u2019S UNDERSTANDING AND TO PROVIDE FURTHER TRANSPARENCY INTO KEY DRIVERS OF CNA\u2019S FINANCIAL RESULTS.  IN ASSESSING CNA\u2019S INSURANCE OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY UTILIZES THE CORE INCOME (LOSS) FINANCIAL MEASURE. CORE INCOME (LOSS) IS CALCULATED BY EXCLUDING FROM NET INCOME (LOSS) (I) NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES, (II) INCOME OR LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, (III) ANY CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE AND (IV) DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY REMEASUREMENT AS A RESULT OF AN ENACTED U.S. FEDERAL TAX RATE CHANGE. IN ADDITION, CORE INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS. THE CALCULATION OF CORE INCOME (LOSS) EXCLUDES NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES BECAUSE NET INVESTMENT GAINS OR LOSSES ARE GENERALLY DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY CONSISTENT WITH KEY DRIVERS OF UNDERWRITING PERFORMANCE, AND ARE THEREFORE NOT CONSIDERED AN INDICATION OF TRENDS IN INSURANCE OPERATIONS. CORE INCOME (LOSS) IS DEEMED TO BE A  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURE AND MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS MEASURE IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS AS MANAGEMENT USES THIS MEASURE TO ASSESS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS  IN EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS, CNA UTILIZES THE LOSS RATIO, THE EXPENSE RATIO, THE DIVIDEND RATIO AND THE COMBINED RATIO. THESE RATIOS ARE CALCULATED USING GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS. THE LOSS RATIO IS THE PERCENTAGE OF NET INCURRED CLAIM AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE EXPENSE RATIO IS THE PERCENTAGE OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITING AND ACQUISITION EXPENSES, INCLUDING THE AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS, TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE DIVIDEND RATIO IS THE RATIO OF POLICYHOLDERS\u2019 DIVIDENDS INCURRED TO NET EARNED PREMIUMS. THE COMBINED RATIO IS THE SUM OF THE LOSS, EXPENSE AND DIVIDEND RATIOS. IN ADDITION, CNA ALSO UTILIZES RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE, RATE, RETENTION AND NEW BUSINESS IN EVALUATING OPERATING TRENDS. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED CHANGE IN AVERAGE PREMIUM ON POLICIES THAT RENEW, INCLUDING RATE AND EXPOSURE CHANGES. RATE REPRESENTS THE AVERAGE CHANGE IN PRICE ON POLICIES THAT RENEW EXCLUDING EXPOSURE CHANGES. FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS WITHIN SMALL BUSINESS, WHERE QUANTIFIABLE, RATE INCLUDES THE INFLUENCE OF NEW BUSINESS AS WELL. EXPOSURE REPRESENTS THE MEASURE OF RISK USED IN THE PRICING OF THE INSURANCE PRODUCT. RETENTION REPRESENTS THE PERCENTAGE OF PREMIUM DOLLARS RENEWED IN COMPARISON TO THE EXPIRING PREMIUM DOLLARS FROM POLICIES AVAILABLE TO RENEW. RENEWAL PREMIUM CHANGE, RATE AND RETENTION PRESENTED FOR THE PRIOR PERIOD ARE UPDATED TO REFLECT SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY ON POLICIES WRITTEN IN THE PERIOD. NEW BUSINESS REPRESENTS PREMIUMS FROM POLICIES WRITTEN WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AND ADDITIONAL POLICIES WRITTEN WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS. GROSS WRITTEN PREMIUMS, EXCLUDING THIRD PARTY CAPTIVES, EXCLUDES BUSINESS WHICH IS MOSTLY CEDED TO THIRD PARTY CAPTIVES, INCLUDING BUSINESS RELATED TO LARGE WARRANTY PROGRAMS.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE THE RESULTS OF CNA\u2019S PROPERTY & CASUALTY OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.

CORE INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 INCLUDED A $24 MILLION REDUCTION IN LONG TERM CARE CLAIM RESERVES RESULTING FROM THE 2018 ANNUAL CLAIM EXPERIENCE STUDY.  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 2018  CORE LOSS WAS $139 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF $56 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD. THE DRIVERS OF CORE INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE THREE MONTH DISCUSSION ABOVE. THE PRIOR PERIOD INCLUDED  NON-RECURRING  COSTS OF $27 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSITION TO A NEW IT INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICE PROVIDER. IN ADDITION, THE 2018 PERIOD INCLUDED ADVERSE NET PRIOR YEAR RESERVE DEVELOPMENT FOR A&EP UNDER THE LOSS PORTFOLIO TRANSFER, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1.  LONG TERM CARE POLICYHOLDER RESERVES  ANNUALLY, CNA ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS LONG TERM CARE FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES BY PERFORMING THE GPV TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS A PREMIUM DEFICIENCY. SEE THE INSURANCE RESERVES SECTION OF OUR MD&A INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE RESERVING PROCESS.  PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVES FOR LONG TERM CARE WERE BASED ON THE ACTUARIAL BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS ESTABLISHED AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AS A RESULT OF A RESERVE UNLOCKING. THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 GPV INDICATED THE CARRIED RESERVES INCLUDED A MARGIN OF APPROXIMATELY $182 MILLION. THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 GPV INDICATED A PREMIUM DEFICIENCY OF $216 MILLION AND FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES WERE INCREASED ACCORDINGLY. AS A RESULT, THE LONG TERM CARE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVES CARRIED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REPRESENT MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST ESTIMATE ASSUMPTIONS AT THAT DATE WITH NO MARGIN FOR ADVERSE DEVIATION. A SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES IN THE GPV RESULTS IS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  (IN MILLIONS)  LONG TERM CARE ACTIVE LIFE RESERVE - CHANGE IN ESTIMATED RESERVE MARGIN  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 ESTIMATED MARGIN  $182  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS  (280  )  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING MORBIDITY ASSUMPTIONS  32  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING PERSISTENCY ASSUMPTIONS AND INFORCE POLICY INVENTORY  (234  )  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING PREMIUM RATE ACTION ASSUMPTIONS  58  CHANGES IN UNDERLYING EXPENSE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS  26  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PREMIUM DEFICIENCY  $(216  )  THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTIONS DRIVEN BY LOWER EXPECTED REINVESTMENT RATES, CONTEMPLATING BOTH NEAR-TERM MARKET INDICATIONS AND LONG-TERM NORMATIVE ASSUMPTIONS. THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY WAS ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE RECOGNITION OF MARGIN IN EARNINGS IN RECENT QUARTERS AND CHANGES IN PERSISTENCY ASSUMPTIONS, PRIMARILY FROM LOWER PROJECTED ACTIVE LIFE MORTALITY RATES. THESE UNFAVORABLE DRIVERS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED RATE INCREASES ON ACTIVE RATE INCREASE PROGRAMS, NEW PLANNED RATE INCREASE FILINGS AND FAVORABLE CHANGES TO THE UNDERLYING MORBIDITY AND EXPENSE ASSUMPTIONS.  AS A RESULT OF THE PREMIUM DEFICIENCY, CNA\u2019S PROJECTIONS NO LONGER INDICATE A PATTERN OF EXPECTED PROFITS IN EARLIER FUTURE YEARS FOLLOWED BY EXPECTED LOSSES IN LATER FUTURE YEARS. AS SUCH, CNA WILL NO LONGER ESTABLISH ADDITIONAL FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES FOR PROFITS FOLLOWED BY LOSSES IN PERIODS WHERE THE LONG TERM CARE BUSINESS GENERATES CORE INCOME. THE NEED FOR THESE ADDITIONAL FUTURE POLICY BENEFIT RESERVES WILL BE  RE-EVALUATED  IN CONNECTION WITH THE NEXT GPV, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE ESTIMATED PRETAX IMPACT ON CNA\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM VARIOUS HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS TO ITS ACTIVE LIFE RESERVE ASSUMPTIONS. THE ANNUAL GPV PROCESS INVOLVES UPDATING ALL ASSUMPTIONS TO THE THEN CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE, AND HISTORICALLY ALL SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS HAVE BEEN REVISED EACH YEAR. IN THE HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS TABLE BELOW, CNA HAS ASSUMED THAT REVISIONS TO SUCH ASSUMPTIONS WOULD OCCUR IN EACH POLICY TYPE, AGE AND DURATION WITHIN EACH POLICY GROUP AND WOULD OCCUR ABSENT ANY CHANGES, MITIGATING OR OTHERWISE, IN THE OTHER ASSUMPTIONS. ALTHOUGH SUCH HYPOTHETICAL REVISIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED OR ANTICIPATED, CNA BELIEVES THEY COULD OCCUR BASED ON PAST VARIANCES IN EXPERIENCE AND ITS EXPECTATIONS OF THE RANGES OF FUTURE EXPERIENCE THAT COULD REASONABLY OCCUR. ANY ACTUAL ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON THE SPECIFIC POLICIES AFFECTED AND, THEREFORE, MAY DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INDUSTRY-WIDE FLOATER UTILIZATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 66% BASED ON INDUSTRY ANALYST REPORTS, WHICH WAS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER BUT AN INCREASE FROM APPROXIMATELY 58% FOR THE COMPARABLE QUARTER OF 2018. DURING 2019, THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN AVERAGE DAYRATES IN SOME GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS; HOWEVER, DAYRATES REMAIN LOW COMPARED TO PREVIOUS PERIODS, AS THE INCREASE IN OIL PRICES FROM EARLIER LOWS HAS NOT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DAYRATES AT A SUSTAINED OR CONSISTENT LEVEL. SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS INDICATE THAT, BASED ON HISTORICAL DATA, UTILIZATION RATES WILL HAVE TO INCREASE TO THE 80%-RANGE BEFORE PRICING POWER SHIFTS TO THE DRILLING CONTRACTOR FROM THE CUSTOMER.  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, THE NUMBER OF CONTRACT TENDERS FOR 2020 AND 2021 FLOATER PROJECT COMMENCEMENTS INCREASED, PRIMARILY FOR WORK IN THE NORTH SEA AND AUSTRALIA MARKETS. PRESENTLY, MANY OF THESE TENDERS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO SINGLE-WELL CONTRACTS, WITH OPTIONS FOR FUTURE WELLS. ALTHOUGH SOME GEOGRAPHIC AREAS APPEAR TO BE IMPROVING, OTHER MARKETS SHOW LITTLE OR NO SIGN OF RECOVERY AT THIS TIME.  FROM A SUPPLY PERSPECTIVE, SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS HAVE REPORTED A THREE RIG DECREASE IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY OF FLOATER RIGS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. HOWEVER, THE OFFSHORE CONTRACT DRILLING MARKET REMAINS OVERSUPPLIED, PROVIDING FOR A CHALLENGING OFFSHORE DRILLING MARKET IN THE NEAR TERM. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, INDUSTRY ANALYSTS REPORT THAT THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 80 STACKED OR UNCONTRACTED FLOATERS AND APPROXIMATELY 30 NEWBUILD FLOATERS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019 THROUGH 2022. OF THESE RIGS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS REPORT THAT ONLY ONE RIG IS CURRENTLY CONTRACTED FOR FUTURE WORK. IN ADDITION, DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, APPROXIMATELY 70 CONTRACTED FLOATERS ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ROLLING OFF THEIR CURRENT CONTRACTS, WHICH WILL FURTHER ADD TO THE OVER-SUPPLY OF FLOATERS.  AS A RESULT OF THESE CHALLENGES, DIAMOND OFFSHORE AND OTHER OFFSHORE DRILLERS ARE CONTINUING TO ACTIVELY SEEK WAYS TO DRIVE EFFICIENCY, REDUCE  NON-PRODUCTIVE  TIME ON RIGS AND PROVIDE TECHNICAL INNOVATION TO CUSTOMERS. DIAMOND OFFSHORE ANTICIPATES THAT THESE EFFICIENCIES AND INNOVATIONS WILL RESULT IN THE FASTER DRILLING AND COMPLETION OF WELLS, LEADING TO LOWER OVERALL WELL COSTS TO THE BENEFIT OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG WAS $1.8 BILLION AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 (BASED ON INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME) AND $2.0 BILLION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2019 (THE DATE REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018). THE CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG BY YEAR AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 IS $0.2 BILLION IN 2019 (FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 2019), $0.8 BILLION IN 2020 AND AN AGGREGATE OF $0.8 BILLION IN 2021 THROUGH 2024. CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2019 EXCLUDES FUTURE GROSS MARGIN COMMITMENTS OF $30 MILLION FOR 2019, APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION FOR 2020 AND AN AGGREGATE $75 MILLION IN 2021 THROUGH 2023, PAYABLE BY A CUSTOMER IN THE FORM OF A GUARANTEE OF GROSS MARGIN TO BE EARNED ON FUTURE CONTRACTS OR BY DIRECT PAYMENT AT THE END OF EACH OF THE THREE RESPECTIVE PERIODS, PURSUANT TO TERMS OF AN EXISTING CONTRACT.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG INCLUDES ONLY FIRM COMMITMENTS (TYPICALLY REPRESENTED BY SIGNED CONTRACTS) AND IS CALCULATED BY MULTIPLYING THE CONTRACTED OPERATING DAYRATE BY THE FIRM CONTRACT PERIOD. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CALCULATION ALSO ASSUMES FULL UTILIZATION OF ITS DRILLING EQUIPMENT FOR THE CONTRACT PERIOD (EXCLUDING SCHEDULED SHIPYARD AND SURVEY DAYS); HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL REVENUE EARNED AND THE ACTUAL PERIODS DURING WHICH REVENUES ARE EARNED WILL BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS AND PERIODS STATED ABOVE DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECTING UTILIZATION SUCH AS WEATHER CONDITIONS AND UNSCHEDULED REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG EXCLUDES REVENUES FOR MOBILIZATION, DEMOBILIZATION, CONTRACT PREPARATION AND CUSTOMER REIMBURSABLES. CHANGES IN DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CONTRACT DRILLING BACKLOG BETWEEN PERIODS ARE GENERALLY A FUNCTION OF THE PERFORMANCE OF WORK ON TERM CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS THE EXTENSION OR MODIFICATION OF EXISTING TERM CONTRACTS AND THE EXECUTION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CUSTOMERS MAY SEEK TO TERMINATE OR RENEGOTIATE ITS CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS REPORTED BACKLOG.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR DIAMOND OFFSHORE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 AS PRESENTED IN NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EFFECT OF INCREMENTAL REVENUE EARNING DAYS, DUE TO FEWER  NON-PRODUCTIVE  DAYS AND FEWER PLANNED SHIPYARD PROJECTS AND MOBILIZATION OF RIGS. CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE INCREASED $14 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AND OTHER RIG OPERATING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS FOR A RIG WHICH WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOEWS CORPORATION INCREASED $21 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, REFLECTING LOWER MARGINS FROM CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUES, HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES SINCE THE LATTER PART OF 2018 AND A LOSS OF $3 MILLION (AFTER TAX AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS) ON THE DISPOSITION OF ASSETS. THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL CLAIM IN THE 2018 PERIOD.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 2018  CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUE DECREASED $158 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DAILY REVENUE EARNED AND THE EFFECT OF FEWER REVENUE EARNING DAYS. CONTRACT DRILLING EXPENSE INCREASED $32 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL AMORTIZATION OF PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED CONTRACT PREPARATION AND MOBILIZATION COSTS AND INCREASED RIG OPERATING COSTS FOR THE CURRENT FLEET. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED COSTS FOR THE RIG THAT WAS SOLD IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND LOWER FUEL COSTS FOR THE CURRENT FLEET.  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOEWS CORPORATION INCREASED $83 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, REFLECTING LOWER MARGINS FROM CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CONTRACT DRILLING REVENUES, HIGHER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE COMPLETION OF SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATION PROJECTS IN 2019 AND A LOWER TAX BENEFIT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THESE UNFAVORABLE IMPACTS ON RESULTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL CLAIM IN THE 2018 PERIOD AND THE ABSENCE OF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN THE 2018 PERIOD.  BOARDWALK PIPELINES  FIRM AGREEMENTS  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE CAPACITY IS CONTRACTED FOR UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS. FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, APPROXIMATELY 88% OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 REVENUES, EXCLUDING RETAINED FUEL, WERE DERIVED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS. BOARDWALK PIPELINES EXPECTS TO EARN REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $10.3 BILLION FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS FOR TRANSPORTATION, STORAGE AND OTHER SERVICES, OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THOSE AGREEMENTS. THIS AMOUNT HAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION FROM THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT AT DECEMBER 31, 2018, FROM CONTRACTS ENTERED INTO DURING 2019. FOR BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 CUSTOMERS THAT ARE CHARGED MAXIMUM TARIFF RATES RELATED TO ITS FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION REGULATED OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES, THE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS REFLECT THE CURRENT TARIFF RATE FOR SUCH SERVICES FOR THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENTS, HOWEVER, THE TARIFF RATES MAY BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENT. THE ESTIMATED REVENUES FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE ESTIMATED REVENUES THAT ARE ANTICIPATED UNDER EXECUTED PRECEDENT TRANSPORTATION AGREEMENTS FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS. THE REVENUES EXPECTED TO BE EARNED FROM FIXED FEES UNDER COMMITTED FIRM AGREEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL REVENUES BOARDWALK PIPELINES HAS RECOGNIZED AND MAY RECOGNIZE UNDER FIRM AGREEMENTS BASED ON ACTUAL UTILIZATION OF THE CONTRACTED PIPELINE OR STORAGE CAPACITY, ANY EXPECTED REVENUES FOR PERIODS AFTER THE EXPIRATION DATES OF THE EXISTING AGREEMENTS OR EXECUTION OF PRECEDENT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH PROJECTS OR OTHER EVENTS THAT OCCURRED OR WILL OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  CONTRACT RENEWALS  EACH YEAR A PORTION OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 FIRM TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE AGREEMENTS EXPIRE. DEMAND FOR FIRM SERVICE IS PRIMARILY BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH CAN VARY ACROSS BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 PIPELINE SYSTEMS. THE AMOUNT OF CHANGE IN FIRM RESERVATION FEES UNDER CONTRACT REFLECTS THE OVERALL MARKET TRENDS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT FROM BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 GROWTH PROJECTS. BOARDWALK PIPELINES FOCUSES ITS MARKETING EFFORTS ON ENHANCING THE VALUE OF THE CAPACITY THAT IS UP FOR RENEWAL AND WORKS WITH CUSTOMERS TO MATCH GAS SUPPLIES FROM VARIOUS BASINS TO NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS, INCLUDING AGGREGATING SUPPLIES AT KEY LOCATIONS ALONG ITS PIPELINES TO PROVIDE  END-USE  CUSTOMERS WITH ATTRACTIVE AND DIVERSE SUPPLY OPTIONS. IF THE MARKET PERCEIVES THE VALUE OF BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 AVAILABLE CAPACITY TO BE LOWER THAN ITS LONG-TERM VIEW OF THE CAPACITY, BOARDWALK PIPELINES MAY SEEK TO SHORTEN CONTRACT TERMS UNTIL MARKET PERCEPTION IMPROVES.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR BOARDWALK PIPELINES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 AS PRESENTED IN NOTE 13 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED UNDER ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.

OTHER REVENUES INCREASED $27 MILLION AND $36 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S OPERATIONS OF $35 MILLION AND $43 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN 2019. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIOD, THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PASS-THROUGH EFFECT OF LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR RESIN PRICES. CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S CONTRACTS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR RESIN PRICE CHANGES TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS ON A SHORT-TERM LAG, GENERALLY ABOUT ONE MONTH. WHEN A PASS-THROUGH OCCURS, REVENUES AND EXPENSES GENERALLY CHANGE BY THE SAME AMOUNT SO THAT CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S GROSS MARGIN RETURNS TO THE SAME LEVEL AS PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN PRICES.  OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES INCREASED $20 MILLION AND $26 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S EXPENSES OF $35 MILLION AND $44 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS IN 2019 AND OPERATING PERSONNEL EXPENSES AT CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CORPORATE OVERHEAD EXPENSES. INTEREST EXPENSES INCREASED $4 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDING CONSOLIDATED CONTAINER\u2019S 2019 ACQUISITIONS.  NET RESULTS IMPROVED $26 MILLION AND $80 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH THE 2018 PERIODS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  PARENT COMPANY  PARENT COMPANY CASH AND INVESTMENTS, NET OF RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, TOTALED $3.5 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $3.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECEIVED $817 MILLION IN DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING A SPECIAL DIVIDEND FROM CNA OF $485 MILLION. CASH INFLOWS ALSO INCLUDED $183 MILLION FROM LOEWS HOTELS & CO. CASH OUTFLOWS INCLUDED THE PAYMENT OF $643 MILLION TO FUND TREASURY STOCK PURCHASES AND $57 MILLION OF CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. AS A HOLDING COMPANY WE DEPEND ON DIVIDENDS FROM OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND RETURNS ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO FUND OUR OBLIGATIONS. WE ALSO HAVE AN  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FILE WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) REGISTERING THE FUTURE SALE OF AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LIABILITIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THERE ARE NO PARENT COMPANY GUARANTEES.

AS OF OCTOBER 25, 2019, THERE WERE 297,438,996 SHARES OF LOEWS COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING.  FUTURE USES OF OUR CASH MAY INCLUDE INVESTING IN OUR SUBSIDIARIES, NEW ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDENDS AND/OR REPURCHASES OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS TO HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND BUSINESS NEEDS.  SUBSIDIARIES  CNA\u2019S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $980 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED WITH $868 MILLION FOR THE 2018 PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN PREMIUMS COLLECTED AND LOWER INCOME TAXES PAID. CNA BELIEVES THAT ITS PRESENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS CURRENT AND EXPECTED WORKING CAPITAL AND DEBT OBLIGATION NEEDS.  CNA DECLARED AND PAID DIVIDENDS OF $3.05 PER SHARE ON ITS COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING A SPECIAL DIVIDEND OF $2.00 PER SHARE, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

CNA\u2019S DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING CNA\u2019S EARNINGS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS NEEDS AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS.  CNA HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT, EQUITY OR HYBRID SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME.  DIVIDENDS FROM THE CONTINENTAL CASUALTY COMPANY (\u201cCCC\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF CNA, ARE SUBJECT TO THE INSURANCE HOLDING COMPANY LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS, THE DOMICILIARY STATE OF CCC. UNDER THESE LAWS, ORDINARY DIVIDENDS, OR DIVIDENDS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE PRIOR APPROVAL BY THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE (\u201cDEPARTMENT\u201d), ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE GREATER OF THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S STATUTORY NET INCOME OR 10% OF STATUTORY SURPLUS AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS. ADDITIONALLY, ORDINARY DIVIDENDS MAY ONLY BE PAID FROM EARNED SURPLUS, WHICH IS CALCULATED BY REMOVING UNREALIZED GAINS FROM UNASSIGNED SURPLUS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CCC WAS IN A POSITIVE EARNED SURPLUS POSITION. THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DIVIDEND CCC COULD PAY DURING 2019 THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE DEPARTMENT\u2019S PRIOR APPROVAL IS APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION, LESS DIVIDENDS PAID DURING THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTHS MEASURED AT THAT POINT IN TIME. CCC PAID DIVIDENDS OF $116 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND $940 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CCC IS ABLE TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $327 MILLION OF DIVIDENDS THAT WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO PRIOR APPROVAL OF THE DEPARTMENT. THE ACTUAL LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS PAID IN ANY YEAR IS DETERMINED AFTER AN ASSESSMENT OF AVAILABLE DIVIDEND CAPACITY, HOLDING COMPANY LIQUIDITY AND CASH NEEDS AS WELL AS THE IMPACT THE DIVIDENDS WILL HAVE ON THE STATUTORY SURPLUS OF THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE COMPANY.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DECREASED $203 MILLION AS COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD, DUE TO LOWER CASH COLLECTED FROM THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACT DRILLING SERVICES AND HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, NET OF REFUNDS, PRIMARILY IN DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS. INCREMENTAL CASH USED FOR OPERATIONS DURING THE 2019 PERIOD WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE IN CASH EXPENDITURES RELATED TO CONTRACT DRILLING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION TO $130 MILLION FOR A TOTAL SPEND OF APPROXIMATELY $360 MILLION TO $380 MILLION IN 2019. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 INCLUDE SPENDING ASSOCIATED WITH PROJECTS UNDER ITS CAPITAL MAINTENANCE AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UPGRADES FOR THE  OCEAN BLACKHAWK  ,  OCEAN BLACKHORNET  AND  OCEAN COURAGE  AND OTHER LARGE SHIPYARD PROJECTS. IN ADDITION, OTHER SPECIFIC PROJECTS FOR 2019 INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION IN CAPITALIZED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REACTIVATION AND UPGRADE OF THE  OCEAN ONYX  AND APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE REACTIVATION OF THE  OCEAN ENDEAVOR.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAS NO SIGNIFICANT PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, EXCEPT FOR THOSE RELATED TO ITS DIRECT RIG OPERATIONS, WHICH ARISE DURING THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS OF OCTOBER 25, 2019, DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAD $1.2 BILLION AVAILABLE UNDER ITS CREDIT AGREEMENTS.  ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2019, S&P GLOBAL RATINGS (\u201cS&P\u201d) DOWNGRADED DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CORPORATE AND SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES CREDIT RATINGS TO CCC+ FROM B. THE RATING OUTLOOK FROM S&P CHANGED TO STABLE FROM NEGATIVE. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S CURRENT CORPORATE CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (\u201cMOODY\u2019S\u201d) IS B2 AND ITS CURRENT SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES CREDIT RATING FROM MOODY\u2019S IS B3. THE RATING OUTLOOK FROM MOODY\u2019S IS NEGATIVE. THESE CREDIT RATINGS ARE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND COULD RAISE DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S COST OF FINANCING. CONSEQUENTLY, DIAMOND OFFSHORE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL DEBT IN AMOUNTS AND/OR WITH TERMS THAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE REASONABLE. THESE RATINGS COULD LIMIT DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S ABILITY TO PURSUE OTHER BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.  DIAMOND OFFSHORE WILL MAKE PERIODIC ASSESSMENTS OF ITS CAPITAL SPENDING PROGRAMS BASED ON INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IF IT DETERMINES THEY ARE REQUIRED. DIAMOND OFFSHORE, MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, ISSUE DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, TO FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, THE ACQUISITION OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DIAMOND OFFSHORE HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT, EQUITY OR HYBRID SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. DIAMOND OFFSHORE\u2019S ABILITY TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS BY ISSUING DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES WILL BE DEPENDENT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CREDIT RATINGS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND ITS CONTROL AT THE TIME DIAMOND OFFSHORE SEEKS SUCH ACCESS.  BOARDWALK PIPELINES\u2019 CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $81 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE 2018 PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN NET INCOME AND THE TIMING OF RECEIVABLES.

BOARDWALK PIPELINES MAY SEEK TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS TO FUND SOME OR ALL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR GROWTH PROJECTS, ACQUISITIONS OR FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. BOARDWALK PIPELINES HAS AN EFFECTIVE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER WHICH IT MAY PUBLICLY ISSUE DEBT SECURITIES, WARRANTS OR RIGHTS FROM TIME TO TIME.

INVESTMENTS  INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES OF  NON-INSURANCE  SUBSIDIARIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, INCLUDING SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS. THE PARENT COMPANY PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING SHORT SALES AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS GENERALLY PRESENT GREATER VOLATILITY, LESS LIQUIDITY AND GREATER RISK THAN FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED WITHIN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2013 CORPORATE.  WE ENTER INTO SHORT SALES AND INVEST IN CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED FOR ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES, INCOME ENHANCEMENTS TO OUR PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND TO BENEFIT FROM ANTICIPATED FUTURE MOVEMENTS IN THE UNDERLYING MARKETS. IF SUCH MOVEMENTS DO NOT OCCUR AS ANTICIPATED, THEN SIGNIFICANT LOSSES MAY OCCUR. MONITORING PROCEDURES INCLUDE SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEW OF DAILY REPORTS OF EXISTING POSITIONS AND VALUATION FLUCTUATIONS TO SEEK TO ENSURE THAT OPEN POSITIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PORTFOLIO STRATEGY.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CREDIT EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH  NON-PERFORMANCE  BY COUNTERPARTIES TO OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE UNCOLLATERALIZED CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS. WE MITIGATE THE RISK OF  NON-PERFORMANCE  BY MONITORING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF COUNTERPARTIES AND DIVERSIFYING DERIVATIVES BY USING MULTIPLE COUNTERPARTIES. WE OCCASIONALLY REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM OUR DERIVATIVE INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF THE EXPOSURE AND THE CREDIT RATING OF THE COUNTERPARTY.

CNA\u2019S VIEWS ON THE CURRENT INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT, TAX REGULATIONS, ASSET CLASS VALUATIONS, SPECIFIC SECURITY ISSUER AND BROADER INDUSTRY SEGMENT CONDITIONS AS WELL AS DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS THAT ENTER INTO AN INVESTMENT DECISION. CNA ALSO CONTINUALLY MONITORS EXPOSURE TO ISSUERS OF SECURITIES HELD AND BROADER INDUSTRY SECTOR EXPOSURES AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME ADJUST SUCH EXPOSURES BASED ON ITS VIEWS OF A SPECIFIC ISSUER OR INDUSTRY SECTOR.  A FURTHER CONSIDERATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CNA\u2019S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES AND THE ABILITY TO ALIGN THE DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO TO THOSE LIABILITIES AND TO MEET FUTURE LIQUIDITY NEEDS, MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF INCOME SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING INSURANCE LIABILITIES. FOR PORTFOLIOS WHERE FUTURE LIABILITY CASH FLOWS ARE DETERMINABLE AND TYPICALLY LONG TERM IN NATURE, CNA SEGREGATES INVESTMENTS FOR ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT PURPOSES. THE SEGREGATED INVESTMENTS SUPPORT THE LONG TERM CARE AND STRUCTURED SETTLEMENT LIABILITIES IN OTHER INSURANCE OPERATIONS.

TAX MATTERS  TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT  ON  DECEMBER 22, 2017  , THE TCJA WAS SIGNED INTO LAW, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ENACTED SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX CHANGES TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM  35%  TO  21%  AS OF  JANUARY 1, 2018  , AND CERTAIN OTHER PROVISIONS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO THE PUBLIC UTILITY INDUSTRY, INCLUDING CONTINUATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE DEDUCTIBILITY, THE EXCLUSION FROM UTILIZING BONUS DEPRECIATION AND THE NORMALIZATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. IN 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S  14  REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS BEGAN TO CONSIDER THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA. THE COMPANY HAS ADJUSTED CUSTOMER RATES TO REFLECT THE LOWER INCOME TAX RATE IN  11  STATES. IN  ONE  OF THOSE  11  STATES, A PORTION OF THE TAX SAVINGS IS BEING USED TO REDUCE CERTAIN REGULATORY ASSETS. IN  ONE  ADDITIONAL STATE, THE COMPANY IS USING THE TAX SAVINGS TO OFFSET ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND TO REDUCE A REGULATORY ASSET. PROCEEDINGS IN THE OTHER  TWO  REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS REMAIN PENDING.  THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA REQUIRED A RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED INCOME TAXES THAT MATERIALLY IMPACTED ITS 2017 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE PORTION OF THIS RE-MEASUREMENT RELATED TO THE  REGULATED BUSINESSES  WAS SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY A REGULATORY LIABILITY, AS THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE EXCESS ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAXES (\u201cEADIT\u201d) CREATED BY THE TCJA WILL BE USED TO BENEFIT ITS REGULATED CUSTOMERS IN FUTURE RATES.  SIX  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES ARE AMORTIZING EADIT AND CREDITING CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING  ONE  WHICH IS USING THE EADIT TO OFFSET FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE TIMING OF THE AMORTIZATION OF EADIT CREDITS BY THE  EIGHT  REMAINING REGULATED SUBSIDIARIES TO BE ADDRESSED IN PENDING OR FUTURE RATE CASES OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS.  ON MARCH 23, 2018, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED THE CONSOLIDATED APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2018 (THE \u201cCAA\u201d). THE CAA CORRECTS AND CLARIFIES SOME ASPECTS OF THE TCJA RELATED TO BONUS DEPRECIATION ELIGIBILITY. SPECIFICALLY, PROPERTY THAT WAS EITHER ACQUIRED, OR AS TO WHICH CONSTRUCTION BEGAN PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 27, 2017, IS ELIGIBLE FOR BONUS DEPRECIATION. THE COMPANY HAD A FEDERAL NOL CARRYOVER BALANCE AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE FULLY UTILIZED UNTIL 2020, WHICH IS WHEN THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL BECOME A CASH TAXPAYER FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES.  LEGISLATIVE UPDATES  DURING 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S REGULATORY JURISDICTIONS ENACTED THE FOLLOWING LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED AND IS EFFECTIVE AS OF  OCTOBER 30, 2019  .  \u2022  IN ILLINOIS, THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A 10-YEAR EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM\u2019S VIABILITY ACT, ILLINOIS\u2019 FAIR MARKET VALUE LEGISLATION. IN ADDITION TO EXTENDING THE ACT, THE UPDATED LAW REMOVES THE PREVIOUS SIZE RESTRICTION AND ALLOWS ALL MUNICIPALITIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM.  \u2022  INDIANA SENATE ENROLLED ACT 472 ALLOWS NON-MUNICIPAL UTILITIES TO BENEFIT FROM FULL APPRAISAL RECOVERY OF THEIR ASSETS IN A SALE.  \u2022  INDIANA HOUSE ENROLLED ACT 1406 ESTABLISHED THE FIRST STATE APPROPRIATION FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AT $20 MILLION PER YEAR.  \u2022  INDIANA SENATE ENROLLED ACT 4 EXTENDS LEVELING LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE BIANNUAL WATER LOSS AUDITS AND ESTABLISHES THE STATE REVOLVING FUND ADMINISTRATOR AS THE CENTRAL COORDINATOR FOR WATER ISSUES IN THE STATE.  \u2022  IN PENNSYLVANIA, HOUSE BILL 751, NOW ACT 53 OF 2019, ALLOWS WATER AND WASTEWATER UTILITIES RESPONSIBLE FOR FUNDING THE INCOME TAXES ON TAXABLE CONTRIBUTIONS AND ADVANCES TO RECORD THE INCOME TAXES PAID IN ACCUMULATED DEFERRED INCOME TAXES FOR ACCOUNTING AND RATEMAKING PURPOSES.  \u2022  IN WEST VIRGINIA, HOUSE BILL 117 ALLOWS QUALIFIED LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS TO APPLY FOR A 20% DISCOUNT ON THEIR WASTEWATER BILL.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONDEMNATION AND EMINENT DOMAIN  ALL OR PORTIONS OF THE  REGULATED BUSINESSES  \u2019 UTILITY ASSETS COULD BE ACQUIRED BY STATE, MUNICIPAL OR OTHER GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THROUGH ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING METHODS: (I) EMINENT DOMAIN (ALSO KNOWN AS CONDEMNATION); (II) THE RIGHT OF PURCHASE GIVEN OR RESERVED BY A MUNICIPALITY OR POLITICAL SUBDIVISION WHEN THE ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF PUBLIC CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY (\u201cCPCN\u201d) WAS GRANTED; AND (III) THE RIGHT OF PURCHASE GIVEN OR RESERVED UNDER THE LAW OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE UTILITY SUBSIDIARY WAS INCORPORATED OR FROM WHICH IT RECEIVED ITS CPCN. THE ACQUISITION CONSIDERATION RELATED TO SUCH A PROCEEDING INITIATED BY A LOCAL GOVERNMENT MAY BE DETERMINED CONSISTENT WITH APPLICABLE EMINENT DOMAIN LAW, OR MAY BE NEGOTIATED OR FIXED BY APPRAISERS AS PRESCRIBED BY THE LAW OF THE STATE OR IN THE PARTICULAR CPCN.  AS SUCH, THE  REGULATED BUSINESSES  ARE PERIODICALLY SUBJECT TO CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, A CITIZENS GROUP IN MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA SUCCESSFULLY ADDED \u201cMEASURE J\u201d TO THE NOVEMBER 6, 2018 ELECTION BALLOT ASKING VOTERS TO DECIDE WHETHER THE MONTEREY PENINSULA WATER MANAGEMENT DISTRICT (THE \u201cMPWMD\u201d) SHOULD CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY CONCERNING THE POTENTIAL PURCHASE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIARY\u2019S MONTEREY WATER SERVICE ASSETS (THE \u201cMONTEREY SYSTEM ASSETS\u201d), AND, IF FEASIBLE, TO PROCEED WITH A PURCHASE OF THOSE ASSETS WITHOUT AN ADDITIONAL PUBLIC VOTE. THIS SERVICE TERRITORY REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 40,000 CUSTOMERS. ON NOVEMBER 27, 2018, MEASURE J WAS CERTIFIED TO HAVE PASSED.  ON AUGUST 19, 2019, THE MPWMD\u2019S GENERAL MANAGER ISSUED A REPORT THAT RECOMMENDS THAT THE MPWMD BOARD (1) DEVELOP CRITERIA TO DETERMINE WHICH WATER SYSTEMS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR ACQUISITION, (2) EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ACQUIRING THE MONTEREY SYSTEM ASSETS AND CONSIDER PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF SMALLER SYSTEMS ONLY IF MPWMD BECOMES THE OWNER OF A LARGER SYSTEM, (3) EVALUATE WHETHER IT IS IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST TO ACQUIRE THE MONTEREY SYSTEM ASSETS AND SUFFICIENTLY SATISFY THE CRITERION OF \u201cFEASIBLE\u201d AS PROVIDED IN MEASURE J, (4) ENSURE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FOR COST SAVINGS BEFORE AGREEING TO COMMENCE AN ACQUISITION, AND (5) DEVELOP MORE FULLY ALTERNATE OPERATING PLANS BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO CONSIDER A RESOLUTION OF NECESSITY. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE WPMWD\u2019S FEASIBILITY STUDY WILL BE ISSUED IN EARLY NOVEMBER 2019, WITH PUBLIC HEARINGS TO FOLLOW. IF THE MPWMD WERE ULTIMATELY TO DETERMINE THAT AN ACQUISITION OF THE MONTEREY SYSTEM ASSETS IS FEASIBLE, THEN THE MPWMD WOULD COMMENCE A MULTI-YEAR EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEEDING AGAINST THE COMPANY\u2019S CALIFORNIA SUBSIDIARY TO FIRST ESTABLISH THE MPWMD\u2019S RIGHT TO TAKE THE SYSTEM ASSETS AND, IF SUCH RIGHT IS ESTABLISHED, DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF JUST COMPENSATION TO BE PAID FOR THE SYSTEM ASSETS.  ALSO, FIVE MUNICIPALITIES IN THE CHICAGO, ILLINOIS AREA (APPROXIMATELY 30,300 CUSTOMERS IN TOTAL) FORMED A WATER AGENCY AND FILED AN EMINENT DOMAIN LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY\u2019S ILLINOIS SUBSIDIARY IN JANUARY 2013, SEEKING TO CONDEMN THE WATER PIPELINE THAT SERVES THOSE FIVE MUNICIPALITIES. BEFORE FILING ITS EMINENT DOMAIN LAWSUIT, THE WATER AGENCY MADE AN OFFER OF $38 MILLION FOR THE PIPELINE. A JURY TRIAL WILL TAKE PLACE TO ESTABLISH THE VALUE OF THE PIPELINE. THE PARTIES HAVE FILED WITH THE COURT UPDATED VALUATION REPORTS. ALTHOUGH THE DATE OF THE VALUATION TRIAL HAS NOT CURRENTLY BEEN SCHEDULED, IT IS NOT LIKELY TO COMMENCE BEFORE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  FURTHERMORE, THE LAW IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE  REGULATED BUSINESSES  OPERATE PROVIDES FOR EMINENT DOMAIN RIGHTS ALLOWING PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TO FILE A LAWSUIT TO SEEK JUST COMPENSATION AGAINST A PUBLIC UTILITY, IF A PUBLIC UTILITY\u2019S INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE A SUBSTANTIAL CAUSE OF DAMAGE TO THAT PROPERTY. IN THESE ACTIONS, THE PLAINTIFF WOULD NOT HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE PUBLIC UTILITY ACTED NEGLIGENTLY. IN CALIFORNIA, MOST RECENTLY, LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED IN CONNECTION WITH LARGE-SCALE NATURAL EVENTS SUCH AS WILDFIRES. SOME HAVE INCLUDED ALLEGATIONS THAT INFRASTRUCTURE OF CERTAIN UTILITIES TRIGGERED THE NATURAL EVENT THAT RESULTED IN DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTY. IN SOME CASES, THE PUC HAS ALLOWED CERTAIN COSTS OR LOSSES INCURRED BY THE UTILITY TO BE RECOVERED FROM CUSTOMERS IN RATES, BUT IN OTHER CASES SUCH RECOVERY IN RATES HAS BEEN DISALLOWED. ALSO, THE UTILITY MAY HAVE OBTAINED INSURANCE THAT COULD RESPOND TO SOME OR ALL OF SUCH LOSSES, ALTHOUGH THE UTILITY WOULD BE AT RISK FOR ANY LOSSES NOT ULTIMATELY SUBJECT TO RATE OR INSURANCE RECOVERY OR LOSSES THAT EXCEED THE LIMITS OF SUCH INSURANCE.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER, THERE WAS A BENEFIT IN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE TAX LAW, STATE INCOME APPORTIONMENT, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF EADIT RESULTING FROM THE TCJA, WHICH IS GENERALLY REFLECTED IN CUSTOMER RATES BEGINNING IN 2019.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTRACTS AND APPLICABLE CONTRACT LAW, IF THE COMPANY IS DOWNGRADED BY A CREDIT RATING AGENCY, ESPECIALLY IF SUCH DOWNGRADE IS TO A LEVEL BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A COUNTERPARTY WOULD ATTEMPT TO RELY ON SUCH A DOWNGRADE AS A BASIS FOR MAKING A DEMAND FOR ADEQUATE ASSURANCE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, WHICH COULD INCLUDE A DEMAND THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDES COLLATERAL TO SECURE ITS OBLIGATIONS.

WE USE THESE MEASURES, AND BELIEVE INVESTORS WILL FIND THEM HELPFUL, IN UNDERSTANDING THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATIONS SEPARATE FROM ITEMS THAT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. WE HAVE INCURRED COMPARABLE CHARGES AND COSTS IN PRIOR PERIODS, AND SIMILAR TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS.

FURTHER INFORMATION ON EACH OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS IS INCLUDED BELOW.  LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT AND OTHER RELATED COSTS.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE INCURRED A $0.3 MILLION LOSS ON THE EXTINGUISHMENT OF CERTAIN FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  IN JANUARY 2018, WE ELIMINATED CERTAIN POSITIONS FOLLOWING THE CONSOLIDATION OF SELECT BACK-OFFICE FUNCTIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE INTEGRATION OF OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTS SUPPORT FUNCTIONS INTO OUR EXISTING CORPORATE SUPPORT FUNCTIONS. THESE CHANGES INCLUDE A REDUCTION IN ADMINISTRATIVE STAFFING AND THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN OFFICE LOCATIONS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $8.5 MILLION AND $13.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT PRIMARILY RELATED TO UPGRADES TO OUR BACK-OFFICE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE INCURRED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $9.2 MILLION AND $22.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF SEVERANCE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND THE CLOSURE OF OFFICES WITH LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH NON-CANCELABLE TERMS. WE PAID $7.9 MILLION AND $18.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THESE RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS.  IN 2019, WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION TO $5 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO UPGRADES TO OUR BACK-OFFICE SOFTWARE SYSTEMS. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WILL BE RECORDED IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT.  INCREMENTAL CONTRACT STARTUP COSTS - LARGE MUNICIPAL CONTRACT.  ALTHOUGH OUR BUSINESS REGULARLY INCURS STARTUP COSTS UNDER MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS, WE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY IN THE TABLES ABOVE THE STARTUP COSTS WITH RESPECT TO AN INDIVIDUAL MUNICIPAL CONTRACT (AND DO NOT ADJUST FOR OTHER STARTUP COSTS UNDER OTHER CONTRACTS IN 2019 OR 2018). WE DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COSTS INVOLVED WITH THIS PARTICULAR MUNICIPAL CONTRACT AND THE UNUSUAL NATURE FOR THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH THEY WERE INCURRED.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE INCURRED COSTS OF $0.7 MILLION, AND DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE INCURRED COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION AND $5.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A LARGE MUNICIPAL CONTRACT. THESE COSTS DID NOT MEET THE CAPITALIZATION CRITERIA PRESCRIBED BY THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD.  ADOPTION OF THE TAX ACT.  THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TAX ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE RECORDED PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATES OF THE TAX ACT'S EFFECT TO OUR DEFERRED TAXES, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, AND ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE ADJUSTED THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2017 FOR THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX, DEFERRED TAXES AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS INCREASED OUR TAX PROVISION BY $0.3 MILLION.  GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, NET.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECORDED A NET GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO BUSINESS DIVESTITURES OF $24.0 MILLION AND $23.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECORDED A NET GAIN ON DISPOSITION OF ASSETS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO BUSINESS DIVESTITURES OF $4.6 MILLION AND $5.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  ACQUISITION INTEGRATION AND DEAL COSTS.  ALTHOUGH OUR BUSINESS REGULARLY INCURS COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, WE SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFY IN THE TABLES ABOVE THE INTEGRATION AND DEAL COSTS INCURRED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. WE DO THIS BECAUSE OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PARTICULAR ACQUISITION ACTIVITY DURING THESE TIME PERIODS. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE INCURRED ACQUISITION RELATED INTEGRATION AND DEAL COSTS OF $1.9 MILLION AND $4.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  IN OCTOBER 2019, CERTAIN OF OUR OWNED AND OPERATED FACILITIES IN OUR GROUP 1 SEGMENT WERE IMPACTED BY SEPARATE FIRE-RELATED EVENTS. WE ARE ESTIMATING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF ANY DAMAGE TO THE FACILITIES, AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES OR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AS A RESULT OF THESE EVENTS.  2020 PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL OUTLOOK  ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  WE ARE PROVIDING OUR PRELIMINARY FINANCIAL OUTLOOK FOR 2020. THIS DOES NOT REPRESENT FULL DETAILED GUIDANCE, BUT RATHER A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE BASED ON CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF 2019 PERFORMANCE, EARLY INDICATORS FROM THE 2020 BUDGET PROCESS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

WE USE THIS MEASURE, AND BELIEVE INVESTORS WILL FIND IT HELPFUL, IN UNDERSTANDING THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATIONS SEPARATE FROM ITEMS THAT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD. WE HAVE INCURRED COMPARABLE CHARGES AND COSTS IN PRIOR PERIODS, AND SIMILAR TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED IN FUTURE PERIODS. OUR DEFINITION OF ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE  WE GENERATE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM OUR SOLID WASTE COLLECTION OPERATIONS. OUR REMAINING REVENUE IS FROM OTHER SERVICES, INCLUDING TRANSFER STATION, LANDFILL DISPOSAL, RECYCLING, AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. OUR RESIDENTIAL, SMALL-CONTAINER AND LARGE-CONTAINER COLLECTION OPERATIONS IN SOME MARKETS ARE BASED ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH MUNICIPALITIES. CERTAIN OF OUR MUNICIPAL CONTRACTS HAVE ANNUAL PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSES THAT ARE TIED TO CHANGES IN AN UNDERLYING BASE INDEX SUCH AS A CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. WE GENERALLY PROVIDE SMALL-CONTAINER AND LARGE-CONTAINER COLLECTION SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS UNDER CONTRACTS WITH TERMS UP TO THREE YEARS. OUR TRANSFER STATIONS AND LANDFILLS GENERATE REVENUE FROM DISPOSAL OR TIPPING FEES CHARGED TO THIRD PARTIES. OUR RECYCLING PROCESSING FACILITIES GENERATE REVENUE FROM TIPPING FEES CHARGED TO THIRD PARTIES AND THE SALE OF RECYCLED COMMODITIES. OUR REVENUE FROM ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES CONSISTS MAINLY OF FEES WE CHARGE FOR THE TREATMENT AND DISPOSAL OF LIQUID AND SOLID WASTE DERIVED FROM THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND NATURAL GAS. OTHER REVENUE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM NATIONAL ACCOUNTS, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF REVENUE GENERATED FROM NATIONWIDE OR REGIONAL CONTRACTS IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OUR OPERATING AREAS WHERE THE ASSOCIATED WASTE HANDLING SERVICES ARE SUBCONTRACTED TO LOCAL OPERATORS. CONSEQUENTLY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS REVENUE IS OFFSET WITH RELATED SUBCONTRACT COSTS, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN COST OF OPERATIONS.

AVERAGE YIELD IS DEFINED AS REVENUE GROWTH FROM THE CHANGE IN AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT OF SERVICE, EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE. CORE PRICE IS DEFINED AS PRICE INCREASES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND FEES, EXCLUDING FUEL RECOVERY FEES, NET OF PRICE DECREASES TO RETAIN CUSTOMERS. WE ALSO MEASURE CHANGES IN AVERAGE YIELD AND CORE PRICE AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED-BUSINESS REVENUE, DEFINED AS TOTAL REVENUE EXCLUDING RECYCLED COMMODITIES AND FUEL RECOVERY FEES, TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR PRICING STRATEGIES. AVERAGE YIELD AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED-BUSINESS REVENUE WAS 2.9% AND 3.0% FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, AND 2.5% AND 2.4% FOR THE SAME RESPECTIVE PERIODS IN 2018. CORE PRICE AS A PERCENTAGE OF RELATED-BUSINESS REVENUE WAS 5.0% FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND 4.2% AND 4.0% FOR THE SAME RESPECTIVE PERIODS IN 2018.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING CHANGES IN OUR REVENUE AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  \u2022  AVERAGE YIELD INCREASED REVENUE BY 2.8% DURING BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO PRICE INCREASES IN ALL LINES OF BUSINESS.  \u2022  THE FUEL RECOVERY FEE PROGRAM, WHICH MITIGATES OUR EXPOSURE TO INCREASES IN FUEL PRICES, DECREASED REVENUE BY (0.2)% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN FUEL PRICES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE FUEL RECOVERY FEE PROGRAM INCREASED REVENUE BY 0.1% DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL REVENUE SUBJECT TO THE FUEL RECOVERY FEES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN FUEL PRICES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  \u2022  VOLUME INCREASED REVENUE BY 0.1% DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO ONE ADDITIONAL WORKDAY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL-CONTAINER COLLECTION VOLUMES AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. VOLUME DECREASED REVENUE BY (0.4)% DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO VOLUME DECLINES IN OUR RESIDENTIAL AND SMALL-CONTAINER COLLECTION LINES OF BUSINESS. THE VOLUME DECLINES IN OUR COLLECTION LINES OF BUSINESS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO CERTAIN NON-REGRETTABLE LOSSES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. IN ADDITION, SPECIAL WASTE LANDFILL VOLUMES DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  \u2022  RECYCLING PROCESSING AND COMMODITY SALES DECREASED REVENUE BY (0.3)% AND (0.1)% DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN OVERALL COMMODITY PRICES AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR RECYCLED COMMODITIES, EXCLUDING GLASS AND ORGANICS, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $72 AND $81 PER TON, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $106 AND $103 PER TON FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGING MARKET DEMAND FOR RECYCLED COMMODITIES CAUSES VOLATILITY IN COMMODITY PRICES. AT CURRENT VOLUMES AND MIX OF MATERIALS, WE BELIEVE A $10 PER TON CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF RECYCLED COMMODITIES WILL CHANGE BOTH ANNUAL REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION.  \u2022  ACQUISITIONS, NET OF DIVESTITURES, INCREASED REVENUE BY 1.2% AND 0.7% DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO OUR CONTINUED GROWTH STRATEGY OF ACQUIRING PRIVATELY HELD SOLID WASTE, RECYCLING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES COMPANIES THAT COMPLEMENT OUR EXISTING BUSINESS PLATFORM.  \u2022  ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DECREASED REVENUE BY (0.4)% AND (0.3)% DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN DRILLING ACTIVITY AND INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE PERMIAN BASIN.  COST OF OPERATIONS  COST OF OPERATIONS INCLUDES LABOR AND RELATED BENEFITS, WHICH CONSISTS OF SALARIES AND WAGES, HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS, INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND PAYROLL TAXES. IT ALSO INCLUDES TRANSFER AND DISPOSAL COSTS REPRESENTING TIPPING FEES PAID TO THIRD PARTY DISPOSAL FACILITIES AND TRANSFER STATIONS; MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS RELATING TO OUR VEHICLES, EQUIPMENT AND CONTAINERS, INCLUDING RELATED LABOR AND BENEFIT COSTS; TRANSPORTATION AND SUBCONTRACT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS FOR INDEPENDENT HAULERS THAT TRANSPORT OUR WASTE TO DISPOSAL FACILITIES AND COSTS FOR LOCAL OPERATORS WHO PROVIDE WASTE HANDLING SERVICES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR NATIONAL ACCOUNTS IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OUR STANDARD OPERATING AREAS; FUEL, WHICH INCLUDES THE DIRECT COST OF FUEL USED BY OUR VEHICLES, NET OF FUEL TAX CREDITS; DISPOSAL FEES AND TAXES, CONSISTING OF LANDFILL TAXES, HOST COMMUNITY FEES AND ROYALTIES; LANDFILL OPERATING COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL ASSURANCE, LEACHATE DISPOSAL, REMEDIATION CHARGES AND OTHER LANDFILL MAINTENANCE COSTS; RISK MANAGEMENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE CASUALTY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS; COST OF GOODS SOLD, WHICH INCLUDES MATERIAL COSTS PAID TO SUPPLIERS; AND OTHER, WHICH INCLUDES EXPENSES SUCH AS FACILITY OPERATING COSTS, EQUIPMENT RENT AND GAINS OR LOSSES ON SALE OF ASSETS USED IN OUR OPERATIONS.

AS SUCH, YOU SHOULD TAKE CARE WHEN COMPARING OUR COST OF OPERATIONS BY COMPONENT TO THAT OF OTHER COMPANIES.  OUR COST OF OPERATIONS INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 PARTLY DUE TO ONE ADDITIONAL WORKDAY AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. OUR COST OF OPERATIONS FURTHER INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018 AS A RESULT OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  LABOR AND RELATED BENEFITS INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS DUE TO HIGHER HOURLY AND SALARIED WAGES AS A RESULT OF ANNUAL MERIT INCREASES ALONG WITH INCREASED HEADCOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ACQUISITION-RELATED GROWTH.  \u2022  TRANSFER AND DISPOSAL COSTS INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THIRD PARTY DISPOSAL RATES. DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE TOTAL WASTE VOLUME WE COLLECTED WAS DISPOSED AT LANDFILL SITES THAT WE OWN OR OPERATE (INTERNALIZATION).  \u2022  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF TRUCKS, INCLUDING THE COST OF PARTS AND INTERNAL LABOR.  \u2022  TRANSPORTATION AND SUBCONTRACT COSTS INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS DUE TO INCREASED THIRD PARTY TRANSPORTATION RATES AND ACQUISITION RELATED ACTIVITY.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  FUEL COSTS DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 DUE TO A DECLINE IN BOTH FUEL PRICES AND COLLECTION VOLUMES. THE DECREASE IN FUEL COSTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG) TAX CREDITS OF APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION THAT WERE ENACTED IN 2018, RETROACTIVELY EFFECTIVE TO 2017 AND RECOGNIZED DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN 2019. THE NATIONAL AVERAGE DIESEL FUEL COST PER GALLON FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $3.02 AND $3.05, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO $3.24 AND $3.15 FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.  AT CURRENT CONSUMPTION LEVELS, WE BELIEVE A TWENTY-CENT PER GALLON CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL WOULD CHANGE OUR FUEL COSTS BY APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION PER YEAR. OFFSETTING THESE CHANGES IN FUEL EXPENSE WOULD BE CHANGES IN OUR FUEL RECOVERY FEE CHARGED TO OUR CUSTOMERS. AT CURRENT PARTICIPATION RATES, A TWENTY-CENT PER GALLON CHANGE IN THE PRICE OF DIESEL FUEL CHANGES OUR FUEL RECOVERY FEE BY APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION PER YEAR.  \u2022  LANDFILL OPERATING COSTS INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED LEACHATE TREATMENT, TRANSPORTATION, AND DISPOSAL COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CERTAIN FAVORABLE REMEDIATION ADJUSTMENTS.

DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, LANDFILL DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED IN AGGREGATE DOLLARS, PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE ONE-TIME AMORTIZATION ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WHICH DID NOT RECUR IN 2019 AND AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL AVERAGE DEPLETION RATE.  AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  EXPENSES FOR AMORTIZATION OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE $4.8 MILLION AND $14.4 MILLION, OR 0.2% OF REVENUE, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO $14.9 MILLION AND $45.0 MILLION, OR 0.6% OF REVENUE, FOR EACH OF THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THIS MAY REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR FUTURE OPERATING TIMELINE AND PROCEDURES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN CHANGES TO OUR EXPECTED LIABILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE REMEDIATION LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THIS SITE WAS $149.1 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019. WE BELIEVE THE REMAINING REASONABLY POSSIBLE HIGH-END OF OUR RANGE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $171 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE AMOUNT RECORDED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  WEST LAKE LANDFILL SUPERFUND SITE.  OUR SUBSIDIARY BRIDGETON LANDFILL, LLC IS ONE OF SEVERAL CURRENTLY DESIGNATED POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES FOR THE WEST LAKE LANDFILL SUPERFUND SITE (WEST LAKE) IN MISSOURI. ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2018, THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) ISSUED A RECORD OF DECISION AMENDMENT FOR WEST LAKE THAT INCLUDES A TOTAL UNDISCOUNTED COST ESTIMATE OF $229 MILLION OVER A FOUR- TO FIVE-YEAR DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE. ON MARCH 11, 2019, THE EPA ISSUED SPECIAL NOTICE LETTERS UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 (CERCLA) TO BRIDGETON LANDFILL, LLC AND THE OTHER CURRENTLY DESIGNATED POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES TO INITIATE NEGOTIATIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE REMEDY. AT THIS TIME WE ARE NEITHER ABLE TO PREDICT THE FINAL DESIGN OF THAT REMEDY, NOR ESTIMATE HOW MUCH OF THE FUTURE RESPONSE COSTS OF THE SITE OUR SUBSIDIARY MAY AGREE OR BE REQUIRED TO PAY. DURING ANY SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS OR LITIGATION, OUR SUBSIDIARY WILL VIGOROUSLY CONTEST LIABILITY FOR THE COSTS OF REMEDIATING RADIOLOGICALLY-IMPACTED MATERIALS GENERATED ON BEHALF OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AND DELIVERED TO THE SITE BY AN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION LICENSEE AND ITS SUBCONTRACTOR. CURRENTLY, WE BELIEVE WE ARE ADEQUATELY RESERVED FOR OUR EXPECTED REMEDIATION LIABILITY. HOWEVER, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS RELATED TO REMEDY DESIGN, DIVISIBILITY, OR ALLOCATION MAY REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR EXPECTED REMEDIATION LIABILITY.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL NEED TO ADJUST OUR ACCRUED LANDFILL AND ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH INFORMATION IMPACTS THE COSTS, TIMING OR DURATION OF THE REQUIRED ACTIONS. FUTURE CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES OF THE COSTS, TIMING OR DURATION OF THE REQUIRED ACTIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

CASH PAID FOR INCOME TAXES WAS A NET REFUND OF $4.3 MILLION AND A NET PAYMENT OF $43.5 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u2022  OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED $9.3 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO A $58.6 MILLION INCREASE IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR CAPPING, CLOSURE AND POST-CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS WAS $47.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $42.5 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR CAPPING, CLOSURE, AND POST-CLOSURE OBLIGATIONS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CAPPING AND POST-CLOSURE PAYMENTS AT CERTAIN OF OUR LANDFILL SITES.  \u2022  CASH PAID FOR REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS WAS $0.8 MILLION LOWER DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF OBLIGATIONS.  CASH PAID FOR INTEREST, EXCLUDING NET SETTLEMENTS FOR OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND LOCKS, WAS $257.1 MILLION AND $255.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE USE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENTS.

WE INTEND TO FINANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ACQUISITIONS THROUGH CASH ON HAND, RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, AND TAX-EXEMPT BONDS AND OTHER FINANCINGS. WE EXPECT TO PRIMARILY USE CASH AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES TO PAY FOR FUTURE BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

DEBT  FOR DISCUSSION AND DETAIL REGARDING OUR DEBT, REFER TO NOTE 7,  DEBT,  TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CREDIT FACILITIES  IN 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A $2.25 BILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE CREDIT FACILITY), WHICH REPLACED OUR $1.0 BILLION AND $1.25 BILLION UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITIES THAT WOULD HAVE MATURED IN MAY 2021 AND JUNE 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES IN JUNE 2023. WE MAY REQUEST TWO ONE-YEAR EXTENSIONS OF THE MATURITY DATE BUT NONE OF THE LENDERS ARE COMMITTED TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH EXTENSION. THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO INCLUDES A FEATURE THAT ALLOWS US TO INCREASE AVAILABILITY, AT OUR OPTION, BY AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF UP TO $1.0 BILLION THROUGH INCREASED COMMITMENTS FROM EXISTING LENDERS OR THE ADDITION OF NEW LENDERS. AT OUR OPTION, BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT A BASE RATE, OR A EURODOLLAR RATE, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN BASED ON OUR DEBT RATINGS (ALL AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT).  THE CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS. TO THE EXTENT WE ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS, WE CANNOT PAY DIVIDENDS OR REPURCHASE COMMON STOCK. COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS ALSO IS A CONDITION FOR ANY INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AND FAILURE TO MEET THESE COVENANTS WOULD ENABLE THE LENDERS TO REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF ANY OUTSTANDING LOANS (WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LIQUIDITY). AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO WAS 7.53 COMPARED TO THE 3.00 MINIMUM REQUIRED BY THE COVENANTS, AND OUR TOTAL DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO WAS 2.96 COMPARED TO THE 3.50 MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY THE COVENANTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, AND WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  EBITDA, WHICH IS A NON-U.S. GAAP MEASURE, IS CALCULATED AS DEFINED IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT, EBITDA IS USED SOLELY TO PROVIDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH DEBT COVENANTS AND IS NOT COMPARABLE TO EBITDA USED BY OTHER COMPANIES OR USED BY US FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY TOTALED $1,710.6 MILLION AND $1,694.1 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CREDIT FACILITY CAN BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD $170.0 MILLION AND $159.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAD $352.0 MILLION AND $379.6 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  WE ALSO HAVE AN UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH BEARS INTEREST AT LIBOR, PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN AND IS SUBJECT TO FACILITY FEES DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT, REGARDLESS OF USAGE. WE CAN USE BORROWINGS UNDER THE UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE AGREEMENT GOVERNING OUR UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY REQUIRES US TO COMPLY WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS. THE UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY AT ANY TIME. WE HAD $12.2 MILLION OF BORROWINGS AND $33.4 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNCOMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES  IN AUGUST 2019, WE ISSUED $900.0 MILLION OF 2.500% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2024 (THE 2.500% NOTES). WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE 2.500% NOTES TO REPAY $650.0 MILLION OF 5.500% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED IN SEPTEMBER 2019. ANY REMAINING PROCEEDS WERE USED TO REPAY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITIES AS WELL AS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THIS OFFERING, WE AMENDED INTEREST RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $375.0 MILLION AND DEDESIGNATED THE HEDGING RELATIONSHIP. THERE WAS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RECOGNIZED IN THE TERMINATION OF THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES. IN ADDITION, WE ENTERED INTO AN OFFSETTING INTEREST RATE SWAP TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE AMENDED AGREEMENTS. FOR FURTHER DETAIL REGARDING THE EFFECT OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ON INTEREST EXPENSE, REFER TO NOTE 12,  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  , TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  IN 2018, WE ISSUED $800.0 MILLION OF 3.950% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2028 (THE 3.950% NOTES). WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE 3.950% NOTES TO REPAY $700.0 MILLION OF 3.800% SENIOR NOTES THAT MATURED IN MAY 2018, AND ANY REMAINING PROCEEDS WERE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS OFFERING, WE TERMINATED INTEREST RATE LOCK AGREEMENTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $600.0 MILLION, RESULTING IN NET PROCEEDS OF $31.1 MILLION. THERE WAS NO INEFFECTIVENESS RECOGNIZED IN THE TERMINATION OF THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES.  OUR SENIOR NOTES AND DEBENTURES ARE GENERAL UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS. INTEREST IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY.  TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE REFINANCED $35.0 MILLION OF TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS AND ISSUED $30.0 MILLION OF NEW TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD $1,066.3 MILLION OF CERTAIN VARIABLE RATE TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS OUTSTANDING WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2020 TO 2049. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD $1,036.8 MILLION OF CERTAIN VARIABLE RATE TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS OUTSTANDING WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2019 TO 2044. APPROXIMATELY 100% OF OUR TAX-EXEMPT FINANCINGS ARE REMARKETED QUARTERLY BY REMARKETING AGENTS TO EFFECTIVELY MAINTAIN A VARIABLE YIELD. THE HOLDERS OF THE BONDS CAN PUT THEM BACK TO THE REMARKETING AGENTS AT THE END OF EACH INTEREST PERIOD. TO DATE, THE REMARKETING AGENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO REMARKET ALL OF OUR VARIABLE RATE UNSECURED TAX-EXEMPT BONDS.  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCE LEASES  WE HAD FINANCE LEASE LIABILITIES OF $112.4 MILLION AND $109.5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 2019 TO 2049 AND 2019 TO 2046, RESPECTIVELY.  CREDIT RATINGS  OUR CONTINUED ACCESS TO THE DEBT CAPITAL MARKETS AND TO NEW FINANCING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS OUR BORROWING COSTS, DEPEND ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND MAINTAINING STRONG CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE BBB+, BAA2 AND BBB BY STANDARD & POOR\u2019S RATINGS SERVICES, MOODY\u2019S INVESTORS SERVICE AND FITCH RATINGS, INC., RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR CREDIT RATINGS WERE DOWNGRADED, ESPECIALLY ANY DOWNGRADE TO BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THE DEBT MARKETS WITH THE SAME FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY, OUR COST OF FUNDS AND OTHER TERMS FOR NEW DEBT ISSUANCES, COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.  INTENDED USES OF CASH  WE INTEND TO USE EXCESS CASH ON HAND AND CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DEBT REPAYMENTS. DEBT REPAYMENTS MAY INCLUDE PURCHASES OF OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS IN THE SECONDARY MARKET OR OTHERWISE. WE BELIEVE OUR EXCESS CASH, CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR AVAILABILITY TO DRAW FROM OUR CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND MATURING OBLIGATIONS AS THEY COME DUE.  WE MAY CHOOSE TO VOLUNTARILY RETIRE CERTAIN PORTIONS OF OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT BEFORE THEIR MATURITY DATES USING CASH FROM OPERATIONS OR ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS. WE ALSO MAY EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES IN CAPITAL MARKETS TO FUND REDEMPTIONS SHOULD MARKET CONDITIONS BE FAVORABLE. EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT WILL RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEBT IS REPAID.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET DEBT OR SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS, OTHER THAN SHORT-TERM OPERATING LEASES AND FINANCIAL ASSURANCES, WHICH ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS DEBT. WE HAVE NO TRANSACTIONS OR OBLIGATIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES THAT ARE NOT DISCLOSED, CONSOLIDATED INTO OR REFLECTED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE HAVE NOT GUARANTEED ANY THIRD-PARTY DEBT.  SEASONALITY AND SEVERE WEATHER  OUR OPERATIONS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY PERIODS OF INCLEMENT OR SEVERE WEATHER, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTE COLLECTED UNDER OUR EXISTING CONTRACTS (WITHOUT CORRESPONDING COMPENSATION), DELAY THE COLLECTION AND DISPOSAL OF WASTE, REDUCE THE VOLUME OF WASTE DELIVERED TO OUR DISPOSAL SITES, OR DELAY THE CONSTRUCTION OR EXPANSION OF OUR LANDFILLS AND OTHER FACILITIES. OUR OPERATIONS ALSO CAN BE FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY SEVERE WEATHER, WHICH COULD INCREASE THE VOLUME OF WASTE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE ARE ABLE TO CHARGE FOR OUR ADDITIONAL SERVICES.

OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DISTRIBUTES PERIPHERALS, IT SYSTEMS INCLUDING DATA CENTER SERVER AND STORAGE SOLUTIONS, SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKING, COMMUNICATIONS AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS (\u201cCE\u201d) AND COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS. WITHIN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, WE ALSO PROVIDE SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS. OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT OFFERS A PORTFOLIO OF TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS AND END-TO-END BUSINESS SERVICES FOCUSED ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT, PROCESS OPTIMIZATION, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, FRONT AND BACK-OFFICE AUTOMATION AND BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION TO CLIENTS IN TEN IDENTIFIED INDUSTRY VERTICALS.  IN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT, WE DISTRIBUTE MORE THAN 30,000 TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS (AS MEASURED BY ACTIVE SKUS) FROM MORE THAN 400 IT, CE AND ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (\u201cOEM\u201d) SUPPLIERS, TO MORE THAN 25,000 RESELLERS, SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, AND RETAILERS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, JAPAN AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA. WE PURCHASE PERIPHERALS, IT SYSTEMS, SYSTEM COMPONENTS, SOFTWARE, NETWORKING, COMMUNICATIONS, SECURITY EQUIPMENT, CE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRODUCTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SELL THEM TO OUR RESELLER AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS. WE PERFORM A SIMILAR FUNCTION FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION OF LICENSED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. OUR RESELLER CUSTOMERS INCLUDE VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (\u201cVARS\u201d), CORPORATE RESELLERS, GOVERNMENT RESELLERS, SYSTEM INTEGRATORS, DIRECT MARKETERS, AND NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS. WE COMBINE OUR CORE STRENGTHS IN DISTRIBUTION WITH DEMAND GENERATION, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT AND DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS TO HELP OUR CUSTOMERS ACHIEVE GREATER EFFICIENCIES IN TIME TO MARKET, COST MINIMIZATION, REAL-TIME LINKAGES IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND AFTER-MARKET PRODUCT SUPPORT.

OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IS CHARACTERIZED BY LOW GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR GROSS MARGIN, AND LOW INCOME FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR OPERATING MARGIN. THE MARKET FOR IT AND CE PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY DECLINING UNIT PRICES AND SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES. WE SET OUR SALES PRICE BASED ON THE MARKET SUPPLY AND DEMAND CHARACTERISTICS FOR EACH PRODUCT OR BUNDLE OF PRODUCTS WE DISTRIBUTE AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE.  IN OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT, WE PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE OUR CLIENTS' CUSTOMER LIFE CYCLES TO ACQUIRE, SUPPORT AND RENEW CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, TO AUTOMATE AND OPTIMIZE PROCESSES, TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF EVERY CUSTOMER INTERACTION AND TO IMPROVE BUSINESS OUTCOMES.

THE EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATE IN THIS BUSINESS AND THE RISK OF LOSING EXPERIENCED EMPLOYEES IS HIGH.

EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, WE ADOPTED CERTAIN OTHER NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION OF THESE PRONOUNCEMENTS WAS NOT MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  ACQUISITIONS  WE CONTINUALLY SEEK TO AUGMENT ORGANIC GROWTH IN BOTH OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS WITH STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND ASSETS THAT COMPLEMENT AND EXPAND OUR EXISTING CAPABILITIES. WE ALSO DIVEST BUSINESSES THAT WE DEEM NO LONGER STRATEGIC TO OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS. IN OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WE SEEK TO ACQUIRE NEW OEM RELATIONSHIPS, ENHANCE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES AND THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEM SUPPLIERS, AND EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT. IN OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT, WE SEEK TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CAPABILITIES AND DOMAIN EXPERTISE IN OUR KEY VERTICALS, EXPAND OUR GEOGRAPHIC FOOTPRINT AND FURTHER EXPAND INTO HIGHER VALUE SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE ARE ALSO STRATEGICALLY FOCUSED ON FURTHER INCREASING OUR SCALE TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMERS.  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION  ON OCTOBER 5, 2018, WE ACQUIRED 100% OF CONVERGYS, A CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE OUTSOURCING COMPANY, FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $2.3 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION IS RELATED TO OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT AND WE BELIEVE THE ACQUISITION ADDS SCALE, DIVERSIFIES OUR REVENUE BASE, EXPANDS OUR SERVICE DELIVERY FOOTPRINT AND STRENGTHENS OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION AS A TOP GLOBAL PROVIDER OF CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT SERVICES.

REVENUE IN CONSTANT CURRENCY IS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IN THE BILLING CURRENCY USING THEIR COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIOD CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE. GENERALLY, WHEN THE DOLLAR EITHER STRENGTHENS OR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, THE GROWTH AT CONSTANT CURRENCY RATES OR ADJUSTING FOR CURRENCY WILL BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN GROWTH REPORTED AT ACTUAL EXCHANGE RATES.  \u2022  NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, WHICH IS OPERATING INCOME AS ADJUSTED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  \u2022  NON-GAAP OPERATING MARGIN, WHICH IS NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, AS DEFINED ABOVE, DIVIDED BY REVENUE.  \u2022  ADJUSTED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, OR ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH IS NON-GAAP OPERATING INCOME, AS DEFINED ABOVE, PLUS DEPRECIATION.  \u2022  NON-GAAP DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (\u201cEPS\u201d), WHICH IS DILUTED EPS EXCLUDING THE PER SHARE, TAX EFFECTED IMPACT OF (I) ACQUISITION-RELATED AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, (II) AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND (III) ACQUISITION RELATED CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION AND THE PER SHARE AMOUNT OF THE NET IMPACT OF THE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017.  WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS USEFUL TO THE READER TO BETTER ASSESS AND UNDERSTAND OUR BASE OPERATING PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARING RESULTS WITH PREVIOUS PERIODS AND FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING IN FUTURE PERIODS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE MANAGEMENT TYPICALLY MONITORS THE BUSINESS ADJUSTED FOR THESE ITEMS IN ADDITION TO GAAP RESULTS. MANAGEMENT ALSO USES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES TO ESTABLISH OPERATIONAL GOALS AND, IN SOME CASES, FOR MEASURING PERFORMANCE FOR COMPENSATION PURPOSES. AS THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES EMPLOYED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE DECREASE DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS ALSO DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE NONTAXABLE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION GAIN RELATED TO THE WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION AND THE DISCRETE IMPACT OF A PROVISIONAL NET TAX CHARGE OF $24.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE TCJA RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019  AUGUST 31, 2018  (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (A)  $6,203,659  $4,822,268  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  (B)  3,452,976  2,727,276  DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING  (C) = (B)/((A)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  51  52  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING  COST OF REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (D)  $5,477,669  $4,392,151  INVENTORIES  (E)  2,787,159  1,927,713  DAYS INVENTORY OUTSTANDING  (F) = (E)/((D)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  47  40  DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING  COST OF REVENUE (PRODUCTS AND SERVICES)  (G)  $5,477,669  $4,392,151  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE  (H)  2,932,046  2,235,139  DAYS PAYABLE OUTSTANDING  (I) = (H)/((G)/THE NUMBER OF DAYS DURING THE PERIOD)  49  47  CASH CONVERSION CYCLE  (J) = (C)+(F)-(I)  49  45  CASH FLOWS  OUR TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS BUSINESS IS WORKING CAPITAL INTENSIVE. OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE PRIMARILY TO FINANCE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY. WE  RELY HEAVILY ON TERM LOANS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS, AND OUR REVOLVER PROGRAMS FOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. WE HAVE FINANCED OUR GROWTH AND CASH NEEDS TO DATE PRIMARILY THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. AS A GENERAL RULE, WHEN SALES VOLUMES ARE INCREASING, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY INCREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN DECREASED CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONVERSELY, WHEN SALES VOLUME DECREASES, OUR NET INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL DOLLARS TYPICALLY DECREASES, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN INCREASES IN CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CONCENTRIX WORKING CAPITAL IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. OUR CASH CONVERSION CYCLE WAS 49 DAYS AND 45 DAYS AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY LEVELS, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN SHIPMENTS WAS DEFERRED IN ACCORDANCE WITH REVENUE RECOGNITION RULES, AS WELL AS HIGHER BUSINESS VOLUMES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  TO INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE AND BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY FURTHER EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPANSION WOULD REQUIRE AN INITIAL INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL, PERSONNEL, FACILITIES AND OPERATIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS OR ACQUISITIONS WOULD LIKELY BE FUNDED PRIMARILY BY OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS, OR THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $202.5 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO NET INCOME OF $324.7 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $295.1 MILLION, AND A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $148.1 MILLION. THESE CASH INFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $390.0 MILLION, A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $119.6 MILLION, AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $69.1 MILLION.  THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AND PAYMENTS, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS ALSO LOWER DUE TO LOWER DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR  SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, WHERE WE CARRY HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORIES, AND HIGHER ANTICIPATED SEASONAL DEMAND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION  AND DEPRECIATION, PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, A $19.0 MILLION GAIN RECORDED UPON THE SETTLEMENT OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION IN FISCAL YEAR 2017, AND DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $40.4  MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO  A DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $387.5 MILLION, AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $83.3 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN VENDOR RECEIVABLE OF $55.8 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET INCOME OF $184.8 MILLION, ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS OF $140.5  MILLION, A DECREASE IN INVENTORIES OF $103.4 MILLION AND A NET CHANGE IN OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $57.6 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND VENDOR RECEIVABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING AND HIGHER DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING COMPARED TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUE IN THE TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS SEGMENT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 COMPARED TO A SEASONALLY HIGH FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2017. IN ADDITION, INVENTORIES WERE LOWER IN OUR SYSTEMS DESIGN AND INTEGRATION SOLUTIONS BUSINESS DUE TO HIGHER STOCKING REQUIREMENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO COMPONENT SHORTAGES. THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY TIMING OF  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PAYMENTS. THE ADJUSTMENTS FOR NON-CASH ITEMS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND THE DEFERRED TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW U.S. TAX RATE DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $102.3 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $93.4 MILLION RELATED TO INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN BOTH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND $8.6 MILLION OF CASH PAID RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED AWARDS ASSUMED UNDER THE  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $74.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $75.5 MILLION, RELATED SUBSTANTIALLY TO OUR CONCENTRIX SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, WE MADE A FINAL PAYMENT OF $8.2 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF TIGERSPIKE AND RECEIVED A REFUND OF $2.3 MILLION FROM DATATEC TOWARDS THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN PRE-ACQUISITION INTRA-DATATEC GROUP TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  WAS $298.4 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS OF $214.1 MILLION. CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WAS USED TO PAY DOWN REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DREW THE LAST TRANCHE OF $250.0 MILLION UNDER A TERM LOAN FACILITY OBTAINED IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 FOR THE CONVERGYS ACQUISITION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURES ASSUMED AS PART OF THE ACQUISITION AND THE REMAINDER WAS USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL. THE COMPANY ALSO RETURNED CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $57.5 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS,  $15.2  MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON  STOCK. $14.0 MILLION OF CASH WAS USED TO PAY THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO OUR WESTCON-COMSTOR AMERICAS ACQUISITION.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $223.1 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF $114.8 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS UNDER OUR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS AND A RETURN OF CASH TO STOCKHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF $56.0 MILLION OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND $41.8 MILLION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE PAID $8.0 MILLION IN FEES TO LENDERS TO SECURE TERM LOAN COMMITMENTS TO FUND THE  CONVERGYS ACQUISITION.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR CASH AND CASH  EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $262.3 MILLION AND $454.7 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019  AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OF OUR TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, THE CASH HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WAS $193.8 MILLION AND $301.1 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL TAX ON REPATRIATION INTO THE UNITED STATES. REPATRIATION OF SOME FOREIGN BALANCES IS RESTRICTED BY LOCAL LAWS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE FULLY UTILIZED AND REINVESTED ALL FOREIGN CASH TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPANSION. IF IN THE FUTURE OUR INTENTIONS CHANGE, AND WE REPATRIATE THE CASH BACK TO THE UNITED STATES, WE WILL REPORT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THE IMPACT OF STATE AND WITHHOLDING TAXES DEPENDING UPON THE PLANNED TIMING AND MANNER OF SUCH REPATRIATION. PRESENTLY, WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES, CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY WITHIN THE UNITED STATES TO FUND CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENT AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCES, THE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR EXISTING SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CURRENT AND PLANNED WORKING CAPITAL AND INVESTMENT NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IN ALL GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FOR OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED CONVERGYS BUSINESS. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT OUR LONGER-TERM WORKING CAPITAL, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ANTICIPATED STOCK REPURCHASES, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SATISFIED THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, FROM OUR BORROWING FACILITIES AND FUTURE FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES.  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE RENEWED OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECURITIZATION PROGRAM AND OUR U.S. CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT DESCRIBED BELOW ON, OR PRIOR TO, THEIR RESPECTIVE EXPIRATION DATES. WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THESE AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS WILL NOT BE RENEWED AS WE  CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD CREDIT STANDING WITH THE PARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WE HAVE HAD SIMILAR BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS WITH VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT OUR YEARS AS A PUBLIC COMPANY.

WE DO NOT ASSUME ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  AMYRIS, INC. (THE COMPANY,  AMYRIS, WE, US OR OUR) IS A LEADING INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY THAT APPLIES ITS TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO ENGINEER, MANUFACTURE  AND SELL HIGH PERFORMANCE, NATURAL, SUSTAINABLY-SOURCED PRODUCTS INTO THE HEALTH & WELLNESS, CLEAN BEAUTY, AND FLAVOR &  FRAGRANCE MARKETS. OUR PROVEN TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM ENABLES US TO RAPIDLY ENGINEER MICROBES AND USE THEM AS CATALYSTS TO METABOLIZE  RENEWABLE, PLANT-SOURCED SUGARS INTO LARGE VOLUME, HIGH-VALUE INGREDIENTS. OUR BIOTECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND INDUSTRIAL FERMENTATION  PROCESS REPLACE EXISTING COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVE MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY USED OUR TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP AND  PRODUCE EIGHT DISTINCT MOLECULES AT COMMERCIAL VOLUMES, LEADING TO MORE THAN 15 COMMERCIAL INGREDIENTS USED BY THOUSANDS OF LEADING  GLOBAL BRANDS.  WE BELIEVE THAT INDUSTRIAL  SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY REPRESENTS A THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION, BRINGING TOGETHER BIOLOGY AND ENGINEERING TO GENERATE NEW, MORE SUSTAINABLE  MATERIALS TO MEET THE GROWING GLOBAL DEMAND FOR BIO-BASED REPLACEMENTS FOR PETROLEUM-BASED AND TRADITIONAL ANIMAL- OR PLANT-DERIVED  INGREDIENTS. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD DEMAND FOR OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS THROUGH AN EXTENSIVE SALES NETWORK PROVIDED BY OUR  COLLABORATION PARTNERS THAT REPRESENT LEADING COMPANIES FOR OUR TARGET MARKET SECTORS. WE ALSO HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF DIRECT SALES  AND DISTRIBUTORS WHO SUPPORT OUR CLEAN BEAUTY MARKET. VIA OUR PARTNERSHIP MODEL, OUR PARTNERS INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF EACH  MOLECULE TO BRING IT FROM THE LAB TO COMMERCIAL SCALE AND USE THEIR EXTENSIVE SALES FORCE TO SELL OUR INGREDIENTS AND FORMULATIONS  TO THEIR CUSTOMERS AS PART OF THEIR CORE BUSINESS. WE CAPTURE LONG-TERM REVENUE BOTH THROUGH THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF THE MOLECULE  TO OUR PARTNERS AND THROUGH ROYALTY REVENUES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) FROM OUR PARTNERS' PRODUCT SALES TO THEIR  CUSTOMERS.  WE WERE FOUNDED IN 2003  IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA BY A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY. OUR FIRST MAJOR MILESTONE CAME  IN 2005 WHEN, THROUGH A GRANT FROM THE BILL & MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION, WE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY CAPABLE OF CREATING MICROBIAL  STRAINS THAT PRODUCE ARTEMISINIC ACID, WHICH IS A PRECURSOR OF ARTEMISININ, AN EFFECTIVE ANTI-MALARIAL DRUG. IN 2008, WE GRANTED  ROYALTY-FREE LICENSES TO ALLOW SANOFI-AVENTIS TO PRODUCE ARTEMISINIC ACID USING OUR TECHNOLOGY. BUILDING ON OUR SUCCESS WITH ARTEMISINIC  ACID, IN 2007 WE BEGAN APPLYING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE AND SELL SUSTAINABLE ALTERNATIVES TO A BROAD RANGE  OF MARKETS.  WE FOCUSED OUR  INITIAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS PRIMARILY ON THE PRODUCTION OF BIOFENE\u00ae, OUR BRAND OF RENEWABLE FARNESENE, A LONG-CHAIN, BRANCHED  HYDROCARBON MOLECULE THAT WE MANUFACTURE THROUGH FERMENTATION USING ENGINEERED MICROBES. OUR FARNESENE DERIVATIVES ARE SOLD IN  THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS AS NUTRACEUTICALS, SKINCARE PRODUCTS, FRAGRANCES, SOLVENTS, POLYMERS, AND LUBRICANT INGREDIENTS. THE COMMERCIALIZATION  OF FARNESENE PUSHED US TO CREATE A MORE COST EFFICIENT, FASTER AND ACCURATE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IN THE LAB AND DRIVE MANUFACTURING  COSTS DOWN. THIS INVESTMENT HAS ENABLED OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM TO RAPIDLY DEVELOP MICROBIAL STRAINS AND COMMERCIALIZE TARGET MOLECULES.  IN 2014, WE BEGAN MANUFACTURING ADDITIONAL MOLECULES FOR THE FLAVOR & FRAGRANCE INDUSTRY; IN 2015 WE BEGAN INVESTING TO EXPAND  OUR CAPABILITIES TO OTHER SMALL MOLECULE CHEMICAL CLASSES BEYOND TERPENES VIA OUR COLLABORATION WITH THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH  PROJECTS AGENCY (DARPA); AND IN 2016 WE EXPANDED INTO PROTEINS.  WE HAVE INVESTED OVER  $600 MILLION IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGY TO CREATE MICROBES THAT PRODUCE MOLECULES FROM SUGAR OR OTHER FEEDSTOCKS AT COMMERCIAL  SCALE. THIS PLATFORM HAS BEEN USED TO DESIGN, BUILD, OPTIMIZE AND UPSCALE STRAINS PRODUCING EIGHT DISTINCT MOLECULES AT COMMERCIAL  VOLUMES, LEADING TO MORE THAN 15 COMMERCIAL INGREDIENTS USED BY THOUSANDS OF LEADING GLOBAL BRANDS. OUR TIME TO MARKET FOR MOLECULES  HAS DECREASED FROM SEVEN YEARS TO LESS THAN A YEAR FOR OUR MOST RECENT MOLECULE, MAINLY DUE TO OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGY  PLATFORM WE HAVE BUILT.  35  OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM  HAS BEEN IN ACTIVE USE SINCE 2007 AND HAS BEEN INTEGRATED WITH OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION SINCE 2011, CREATING AN ORGANISM DEVELOPMENT  PROCESS THAT WE BELIEVE MAKES US AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN THE SUCCESSFUL SCALE-UP AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF BIOTECH-PRODUCED INGREDIENTS.  THE KEY PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS OF OUR PLATFORM THAT WE BELIEVE DIFFERENTIATE US INCLUDE OUR PROPRIETARY COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS,  STRAIN CONSTRUCTION TOOLS, SCREENING AND ANALYTICS TOOLS, AND ADVANCED LAB AUTOMATION AND DATA INTEGRATION. HAVING THIS FULLY INTEGRATED  WITH OUR LARGE-SCALE MANUFACTURING PROCESS AND CAPABILITY ENABLES US TO ALWAYS ENGINEER WITH THE END SPECIFICATION AND REQUIREMENTS  GUIDING OUR TECHNOLOGY. OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDES INDUSTRY-LEADING STRAIN ENGINEERING AND LAB AUTOMATION LOCATED  IN EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA, PILOT SCALE PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN EMERYVILLE, CALIFORNIA AND CAMPINAS, BRAZIL, A DEMONSTRATION-SCALE  FACILITY IN CAMPINAS, BRAZIL AND A COMMERCIAL-SCALE PRODUCTION FACILITY IN LELAND, NORTH CAROLINA, WHICH IS OWNED AND OPERATED  BY OUR APRINNOVA JOINT VENTURE TO CONVERT OUR BIOFENE INTO SQUALANE AND OTHER FINAL PRODUCTS.  WE ARE ABLE TO USE A  WIDE VARIETY OF FEEDSTOCKS FOR PRODUCTION, BUT HAVE FOCUSED ON ACCESSING BRAZILIAN SUGARCANE FOR OUR LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION BECAUSE  OF ITS RENEWABILITY, LOW COST AND RELATIVE PRICE STABILITY. WE HAVE ALSO SUCCESSFULLY USED OTHER FEEDSTOCKS SUCH AS SUGAR BEETS,  CORN DEXTROSE, SWEET SORGHUM AND CELLULOSIC SUGARS AT VARIOUS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  SEVERAL YEARS AGO, WE  MADE THE STRATEGIC DECISION TO TRANSITION OUR BUSINESS MODEL FROM COLLABORATING AND COMMERCIALIZING MOLECULES IN LOW MARGIN COMMODITY  MARKETS TO HIGHER MARGIN SPECIALTY MARKETS. WE BEGAN THE TRANSITION BY FIRST COMMERCIALIZING AND SUPPLYING FARNESENE-DERIVED SQUALANE  AS A COSMETIC INGREDIENT SOLD TO FORMULATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO COLLABORATION AND SUPPLY AGREEMENTS FOR THE  DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF MOLECULES WITHIN THE FLAVOR & FRAGRANCE AND CLEAN BEAUTY MARKETS WHERE WE UTILIZE OUR  STRAIN GENERATION TECHNOLOGY TO DEVELOP MOLECULES THAT MEET THE CUSTOMER\u2019S RIGOROUS SPECIFICATIONS.  DURING THIS TRANSITION,  WE SOLIDIFIED THE BUSINESS MODEL OF PARTNERING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE, HIGH PERFORMING, LOW-COST MOLECULES THAT  REPLACE AN INGREDIENT IN THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMMERCIALLY SCALE AND MANUFACTURE THOSE MOLECULES, AND SHARE IN THE PROFITS EARNED  BY OUR CUSTOMERS ONCE OUR CUSTOMER SELLS ITS PRODUCT INTO THESE SPECIALTY MARKETS. THESE THREE STEPS CONSTITUTE OUR COLLABORATION  REVENUES, RENEWABLE PRODUCT REVENUES, AND ROYALTY REVENUES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE REVENUES).  DURING 2017, WE COMPLETED  SEVERAL DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH DSM AND OTHERS FOR NEW PRODUCTS SUCH AS VITAMIN A, A HUMAN NUTRITION MOLECULE AND OTHERS, AND  IN LATE 2018 WE BEGAN COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF A NEW SWEETENER PRODUCT DEVELOPED FROM THE REB M MOLECULE, WHICH IS  A SUPERIOR SWEETENER AND SUGAR REPLACEMENT. OUR GOAL IS TO BRING TWO TO THREE NEW MOLECULES PER YEAR TO COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN  THE FUTURE.  IN 2017, WE DECIDED  TO MONETIZE THE USE OF ONE OF OUR LOWER MARGIN MOLECULES, FARNESENE, IN THE VITAMIN E AND LUBRICANTS SPECIALTY MARKETS WHILE RETAINING  ANY ASSOCIATED ROYALTIES, AND LICENSED FARNESENE TO KONINKLIJKE DSM N.V. (DSM) FOR USE IN THESE FIELDS. ALSO IN 2017, WE SOLD TO  DSM OUR SUBSIDIARY AMYRIS BRASIL LTDA. (AMYRIS BRASIL), WHICH OPERATED OUR PURPOSE-BUILT, LARGE-SCALE MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED  IN BROTAS, BRAZIL.  THE BROTAS FACILITY  WAS BUILT TO BATCH MANUFACTURE ONE COMMODITY PRODUCT AT A TIME (ORIGINALLY FOR HIGH-VOLUME PRODUCTION OF BIOFUELS, A BUSINESS AMYRIS  HAS EXITED), WHICH IS AN INEFFICIENT MANUFACTURING PROCESS THAT IS NOT SUITED FOR THE HIGH MARGIN SPECIALTY MARKETS IN WHICH WE  OPERATE TODAY. WE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURE NINE SPECIALTY PRODUCTS AND EXPECT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE  BY TWO TO THREE PRODUCTS A YEAR. THE INEFFICIENCIES WE EXPERIENCED INCLUDED HAVING TO IDLE THE FACILITY FOR TWO WEEKS AT A TIME  TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PRODUCT BATCH MANUFACTURE. THESE INEFFICIENCIES CAUSED OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.  WE ARE BUILDING A NEW PURPOSE-BUILT, LARGE-SCALE SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PLANT IN BRAZIL, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL ALLOW FOR THE  MANUFACTURE OF FIVE PRODUCTS CONCURRENTLY AND OVER 10 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS ANNUALLY. AS PART OF THE DECEMBER 2017 SALE OF BROTAS,  WE CONTRACTED WITH DSM FOR THE USE OF BROTAS TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR US TO FULFILL OUR PRODUCT SUPPLY COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS  UNTIL OUR NEW PRODUCTION FACILITY BECOMES OPERATIONAL.  IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE  OBTAINED THE NECESSARY PERMITS AND BROKE GROUND ON OUR SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PLANT (SIP). WE EXPECT THE FACILITY TO BE FULLY OPERATIONAL  IN Q1 OF 2021. THIS FACILITY WILL ALLOW US TO MANUFACTURE FIVE PRODUCTS AT ONCE AND TO PRODUCE BOTH OUR SPECIALTY INGREDIENTS PORTFOLIO  AND OUR NEW SWEETENER PRODUCT. DURING CONSTRUCTION, WE ARE MANUFACTURING OUR PRODUCTS AT FOUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING SITES IN BRAZIL,  THE U.S. AND SPAIN.  IN ADDITION, IN MAY  2019 WE ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH RAIZEN ENERGIA S.A. (RAIZEN) FOR THE FORMATION AND OPERATION OF A JOINT VENTURE RELATING  TO THE PRODUCTION, SALE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ALTERNATIVE SWEETENER PRODUCTS WHEREBY THE PARTIES WOULD CONSTRUCT A MANUFACTURING  FACILITY EXCLUSIVELY FOR SWEETENER MOLECULES ON LAND OWNED BY RAIZEN AND LEASED TO THE JOINT VENTURE; SEE NOTE 12, \u201cSUBSEQUENT  EVENTS\u201d IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR MORE DETAILS.  36  ALSO, IN MAY 2019, WE  CONSUMMATED A $300 MILLION RESEARCH, COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH LAVVAN, INC., A NEWLY FORMED INVESTMENT-BACKED COMPANY  (LAVVAN), FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CANNABINOIDS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, WE WOULD PERFORM RESEARCH  AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND LAVVAN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE CANNABINOIDS DEVELOPED UNDER THE AGREEMENT.  THE CANNABINOID AGREEMENT IS BEING PRINCIPALLY FUNDED ON A MILESTONE BASIS, WITH AMYRIS ALSO ENTITLED TO RECEIVE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTARY  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FROM LAVVAN. WE COULD RECEIVE AGGREGATE FUNDING OF UP TO $300 MILLION OVER THE TERM OF THE CANNABINOID  AGREEMENT IF ALL OF THE MILESTONES ARE ACHIEVED. ADDITIONALLY, THE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR PROFIT SHARE TO AMYRIS ON LAVVAN'S GROSS  PROFIT MARGIN ONCE PRODUCTS ARE COMMERCIALIZED; THESE PAYMENTS WILL BE DUE FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS.  SALES AND REVENUE  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  FROM PRODUCT SALES, LICENSE FEES AND ROYALTIES, AND GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  WE HAVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATION  ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH WE RECEIVE PAYMENTS FROM OUR COLLABORATORS, WHICH INCLUDE DARPA, DSM, FIRMENICH SA (FIRMENICH), GIVAUDAN  INTERNATIONAL SA (GIVAUDAN), AND OTHERS. SOME OF OUR COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENTS PROVIDE FOR ADVANCE PAYMENTS TO US IN CONSIDERATION  FOR GRANTS OF EXCLUSIVITY OR RESEARCH EFFORTS THAT WE WILL PERFORM. IN 2017 WE SIGNED COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS FOR AN INFANT NUTRITION  INGREDIENT, AND IN 2018 WE SIGNED A COLLABORATION AGREEMENT FOR TWO VITAMINS THAT WE EXPECT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO OUR COLLABORATION  REVENUE AND ULTIMATELY PRODUCT SALES. OUR COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS, WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO ACHIEVE MILESTONES PRIOR TO RECEIVING  PAYMENTS, ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) IF AND WHEN  THEY ARE COMMERCIALIZED. SEE NOTE 10, \u201cREVENUE RECOGNITION\u201d IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A FOR ADDITIONAL  INFORMATION.  ALL OF OUR NON-GOVERNMENT  PARTNERSHIPS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL TERMS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MOLECULES WE SUCCESSFULLY UPSCALE AND PRODUCE AT COMMERCIAL VOLUMES. THE  FIRST MOLECULE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR US OUTSIDE OF FARNESENE WAS A FRAGRANCE MOLECULE LAUNCHED IN 2015. SINCE THE LAUNCH, THE  PRODUCT HAS CONTINUED TO GROW IN SALES YEAR OVER YEAR. IN 2016, WE LAUNCHED OUR SECOND FRAGRANCE MOLECULE AND IN 2017, WE LAUNCHED  OUR THIRD FRAGRANCE MOLECULE AS WELL AS OUR FIRST COSMETIC ACTIVE INGREDIENT. OUR PARTNERS FOR THESE MOLECULES ARE INDICATING CONTINUED  STRONG GROWTH DUE TO THEIR COST ADVANTAGED POSITION, HIGH PURITY AND SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTION METHOD. WE ARE CONTINUING TO IDENTIFY  NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO APPLY OUR TECHNOLOGY AND DELIVER SUSTAINABLE ACCESS TO KEY MOLECULES. AS A RESULT, WE HAVE A PIPELINE THAT  WE BELIEVE CAN DELIVER TWO TO THREE NEW MOLECULES EACH YEAR OVER THE COMING YEARS WITH A FLAVOR INGREDIENT, A COSMETIC ACTIVE INGREDIENT  AND A FRAGRANCE MOLECULE. IN 2019, WE ARE COMMERCIALLY PRODUCING AND SHIPPING OUR REB M PRODUCT THAT IS A SUPERIOR SWEETENER AND  SUGAR REPLACEMENT FOR FOOD AND BEVERAGES.  AS PART OF THE DSM ACQUISITION  IN 2017 OF OUR FARNESENE FOR VITAMIN E BUSINESS, WE WOULD RECEIVE A ROYALTY PAYMENT ON CERTAIN SALES BY NENTER & CO., INC.  OF VITAMIN E UTILIZING FARNESENE PRODUCED AND SOLD BY DSM FROM OUR TECHNOLOGY. IN ADDITION, DSM WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY US MINIMUM  ROYALTIES TOTALING $18.1 MILLION FOR 2019 AND 2020, OF WHICH WE RECEIVED $9.3 MILLION AS A DISCOUNTED ACCELERATED PAYMENT (FROM  AN ORIGINAL PAYMENT AMOUNT OF $10.0 MILLION) DURING 2018. IN APRIL 2019, WE ASSIGNED THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE SUCH ROYALTY PAYMENTS  TO DSM; SEE NOTE 12, \u201cSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\u201d IN PART 1, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER  COLLABORATION MOLECULES IN OUR DEVELOPMENT PIPELINE WITH PARTNERS INCLUDING DSM, GIVAUDAN AND FIRMENICH THAT WE EXPECT WILL CONTRIBUTE  REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES AND ROYALTIES (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS VALUE SHARE) IF AND WHEN THEY ARE COMMERCIALIZED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION  AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN  PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP). WE BELIEVE THAT THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION ARE THOSE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND REQUIRE  THE MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGEMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MATTERS  THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. BECAUSE OF THIS UNCERTAINTY, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES INCLUDE.  \u2022  RECOGNITION OF REVENUE INCLUDING ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS;  \u2022  VALUATION AND ALLOCATION OF FAIR VALUE TO VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF COMPLEX RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  THE VALUATION OF FREESTANDING AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, WHICH IMPACTS GAINS OR LOSSES ON SUCH DERIVATIVES,  THE CARRYING VALUE OF DEBT, PREFERRED STOCK, INTEREST EXPENSE AND DEEMED DIVIDENDS; AND  \u2022  THE VALUATION OF DEBT FOR WHICH WE HAVE ELECTED FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING.  37  FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES AND POLICIES, SEE NOTE 1, \"BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\" IN PART I,  ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THE 2018 10-K/A.

WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES SINCE OUR INCEPTION, AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES AND NEGATIVE  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS FOLLOWING ISSUANCE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS  . AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL,  EXCLUDING CASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS  , OF $199.4 MILLION, (COMPARED TO NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL  (EXCLUDING CASH) OF $119.5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018), AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $1.6 BILLION, AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  OF $5.2 MILLION (COMPARED TO $45.4 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018).  AS  OF MARCH 31,  2019, OUR DEBT (INCLUDING RELATED PARTY DEBT), NET OF DEFERRED DISCOUNT AND ISSUANCE COSTS OF $13.5 MILLION, TOTALED $215.8 MILLION,  OF WHICH $153.8 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT. OUR  DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATIONS THROUGH MARCH 31, 2020 ARE $179.8 MILLION  ,  INCLUDING $23.5 MILLION OF ANTICIPATED CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS  . OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS CONTAIN  VARIOUS COVENANTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR BUSINESS THAT COULD CAUSE US TO BE AT RISK OF DEFAULTS, SUCH AS RESTRICTIONS  ON ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS AND CROSS-DEFAULT CLAUSES. A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS  , OR CURE NON-COMPLIANCE OR  OBTAIN WAIVERS FOR COVENANTS VIOLATIONS,  AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING  ANY FAILURE TO MAKE A PAYMENT WHEN REQUIRED, WOULD GENERALLY RESULT IN EVENTS OF DEFAULT UNDER SUCH INSTRUMENTS, WHICH COULD PERMIT  ACCELERATION OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS. IF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS IS ACCELERATED, IT WOULD GENERALLY ALSO CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT  UNDER OUR OTHER OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS,  PERMITTING ACCELERATION OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS.  ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2019,  WE FAILED TO PAY AN AGGREGATE OF $63.6 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE WHEN DUE.  THE FAILURE RESULTED IN AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE AND ALSO TRIGGERED CROSS-DEFAULTS UNDER OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS  OF AMYRIS WHICH PERMITTED THE HOLDERS OF SUCH INDEBTEDNESS TO ACCELERATE THE AMOUNTS OWING UNDER SUCH INSTRUMENTS. WE SUBSEQUENTLY  RECEIVED WAIVERS FROM SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HOLDERS OF SUCH OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO ACCELERATE. AS A RESULT, THE  INDEBTEDNESS WITH RESPECT TO WHICH AMYRIS HAS OBTAINED SUCH WAIVERS CONTINUES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  THE INDEBTEDNESS REFLECTED BY THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE CONTINUES TO BE CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY ON OUR BALANCE SHEET.  IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE PAYMENT DEFAULT, THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IN ACCORDANCE  WITH THE TERMS OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE.  WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO  REPAY THE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE. TO DATE, NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE HOLDER OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE  HAVE NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A FAVORABLE OUTCOME FOR US WILL BE REACHED. WE HAVE EXECUTED A TERM  SHEET WITH AN EXISTING INVESTOR FOR A TERM LOAN, THE PROCEEDS OF WHICH WOULD BE USED TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE SECOND EXCHANGE  NOTE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ITS EXPECTED TIMELINE, OR ON ACCEPTABLE  TERMS, IF AT ALL. EVEN IF WE DO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING, IT WILL NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO REPAY THE SECOND EXCHANGE NOTE IN FULL  WITHOUT OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FINANCING, WHICH WE ARE ATTEMPTING TO SOURCE. THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT  INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, WHICH  CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. DUE TO THE FACTORS DESCRIBED  ABOVE, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THESE CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WILL DEPEND, IN LARGE PART, ON OUR ABILITY  TO EXTEND EXISTING DEBT MATURITIES BY RESTRUCTURING A MAJORITY OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WHICH IS UNCERTAIN AND OUTSIDE MANAGEMENT'S  CONTROL. THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS  UNCERTAINTY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS  A GOING CONCERN, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER OUR EXISTING DEBT FACILITIES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN ACCELERATION  OF OUR OBLIGATION TO REPAY ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THOSE FACILITIES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO LIQUIDATE OUR ASSETS. IN SUCH  A SCENARIO, THE VALUES WE RECEIVE FOR OUR ASSETS IN LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THE VALUES REFLECTED  IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR OPERATING PLAN FOR  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS CONTEMPLATES A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR NET CASH OUTFLOWS, RESULTING FROM (I) REVENUE GROWTH FROM SALES  OF EXISTING AND NEW PRODUCTS WITH POSITIVE GROSS MARGINS, (II) REDUCED PRODUCTION COSTS AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING AND TECHNICAL  DEVELOPMENTS, AND (III) CASH INFLOWS FROM GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO  GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PRODUCT SALES, LICENSES AND ROYALTIES, AND PAYMENTS FROM EXISTING AND NEW COLLABORATION  PARTNERS, AND NEW FINANCING COMMITMENTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS AND COVENANTS, WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING  FROM EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS, WHICH MAY NOT OCCUR IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, AGREE TO BURDENSOME COVENANTS,  GRANT FURTHER SECURITY INTERESTS IN OUR ASSETS, ENTER INTO COLLABORATION AND LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO RELINQUISH  COMMERCIAL RIGHTS, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE.  40  IF WE DO NOT ACHIEVE  OUR PLANNED OPERATING RESULTS, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WOULD BE JEOPARDIZED AND WE MAY NEED TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING  ACTIONS TO SUPPORT OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  \u2022  SHIFT FOCUS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS AND CUSTOMERS WITH SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED INVESTMENT IN NEW PRODUCT AND COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT  EFFORTS;  \u2022  REDUCE EXPENDITURES FOR THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS, INCLUDING CONSULTANTS, PROFESSIONAL ADVISORS AND OTHER VENDORS;  \u2022  REDUCE OR DELAY UNCOMMITTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND COMMISSIONING OF THE  NEW PRODUCTION FACILITY IN BRAZIL, NON-ESSENTIAL FACILITY AND LAB EQUIPMENT, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS; AND  \u2022  CLOSELY MONITOR OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS, AS WELL AS SUSPEND OPERATIONS AT PILOT PLANTS AND  DEMONSTRATION FACILITIES.  IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN  COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS AS CURRENTLY CONTEMPLATED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,  DELAYS OR FAILURES IN OUR ABILITY TO.  \u2022  ACHIEVE PLANNED PRODUCTION LEVELS;  \u2022  DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS WITHIN PLANNED TIMELINES OR AT PLANNED SCALES; AND  \u2022  CONTINUE OTHER CORE ACTIVITIES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND OPERATIONS  FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WITH CASH AND INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY ON HAND, CASH INFLOWS FROM COLLABORATIONS, GRANTS, PRODUCT SALES,  LICENSE AND ROYALTIES AND EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY. SOME OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COLLABORATIONS  ARE SUBJECT TO RISK THAT WE MAY NOT MEET MILESTONES. FUTURE EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS, IF NEEDED, ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. OUR PLANNED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL  EXPENDITURE NEEDS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 ARE DEPENDENT ON SIGNIFICANT INFLOWS OF CASH FROM RENEWABLE PRODUCT SALES, LICENSE  AND ROYALTIES AND EXISTING COLLABORATION PARTNERS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL FUNDING FROM NEW COLLABORATIONS.  CASH FLOWS DURING  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018  CASH  FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR PRIMARY USES OF  CASH FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE COSTS RELATED TO THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENDITURES,  OFFSET BY CASH RECEIVED FROM RENEWABLE PRODUCT SALES, LICENSES AND ROYALTIES, AND GRANTS AND COLLABORATIONS.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $37.0 MILLION, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF A $66.2 MILLION NET LOSS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $16.3 MILLION OF FAVORABLE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS THAT WERE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $4.6 MILLION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION, $3.5  MILLION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND A $2.1 MILLION LOSS ON CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DEBT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WAS A $13.0 MILLION  DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $25.2 MILLION, CONSISTING OF A $92.8 MILLION NET LOSS, $67.3  MILLION OF FAVORABLE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS AND A $0.4 MILLION DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. THE NON-CASH ADJUSTMENTS WERE PRIMARILY  COMPRISED OF A $58.4 MILLION LOSS FROM CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND $4.8 MILLION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AMORTIZATION.  CASH FLOWS FROM  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019  AND MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.0 MILLION, AND $1.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED OF PROPERTY,  PLANT AND EQUIPMENT PURCHASES.  CASH FLOWS FROM  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.2 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $0.6 MILLION OF DEBT  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, PARTLY OFFSET BY $0.5 MILLION OF NET PROCEEDS FROM DEBT ISSUANCE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.7 MILLION, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF $6.5 MILLION OF DEBT  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS.  41  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  MARCH 31, 2019,  WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED IN ITEM 303(A)(4)(II) OF REGULATION S-K.

FIXED  AND VARIABLE INTEREST RATES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5, \"DEBT\" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K/A.  FUTURE INTEREST PAYMENTS SHOWN ABOVE FOR VARIABLE-RATE DEBT INSTRUMENTS ARE MEASURED ON THE BASIS OF INTEREST RATES FOR SUCH INSTRUMENTS  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THE FIXED INTEREST RATES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5, \"DEBT\" IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF  THE 2018 10-K/A.  42  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES  WE MAINTAIN DISCLOSURE  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED UNDER RULE 13A-15(E) PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE  ACT). IN DESIGNING AND EVALUATING THE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT ANY DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND  PROCEDURES, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE ASSURANCE OF ACHIEVING THE DESIRED CONTROL OBJECTIVES,  AND MANAGEMENT NECESSARILY IS REQUIRED TO APPLY ITS JUDGMENT IN EVALUATING THE COST-BENEFIT OF POSSIBLE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION  OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS  OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR PRINCIPAL  EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE NOT EFFECTIVE  AT THE REASONABLE ASSURANCE LEVEL AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THIS CONCLUSION WAS BASED ON THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR INTERNAL  CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DESCRIBED IN PART II, ITEM 9A \u201cCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\u201d OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K/A FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A). THE MATERIAL WEAKNESSES HAVE NOT BEEN REMEDIATED  AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  A MATERIAL WEAKNESS IS A DEFICIENCY, OR COMBINATION  OF DEFICIENCIES, IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING SUCH THAT THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT  OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL OR INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF NOT REMEDIATED, THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DESCRIBED IN THE 2018 FORM 10-K/A COULD  RESULT IN A MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT OF OUR ANNUAL OR INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT WOULD NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED  ON A TIMELY BASIS.  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING  DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER  ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER  FINANCIAL REPORTING.  INHERENT LIMITATIONS  ON EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS  OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING  OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  OR OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW  WELL-DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE CONTROL SYSTEM\u2019S OBJECTIVES WILL  BE MET. THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS  MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. FURTHER, BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION  OF CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD WILL NOT OCCUR OR THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND  INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. THE DESIGN OF ANY SYSTEM OF CONTROLS IS BASED IN PART ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT  THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY DESIGN WILL SUCCEED IN ACHIEVING ITS STATED GOALS UNDER  ALL POTENTIAL FUTURE CONDITIONS. PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO  RISKS. OVER TIME, CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS OR DETERIORATION IN THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE  WITH POLICIES OR PROCEDURES.  43  PART II  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  ON APRIL 3, 2019, A SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT  WAS FILED AGAINST AMYRIS AND OUR CEO, JOHN G. MELO, AND FORMER CFO (AND CURRENT CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICER), KATHLEEN VALIASEK, IN  THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED  CLASS THAT WOULD COMPRISE ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES THAT PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE ACQUIRED OUR SECURITIES BETWEEN MARCH 15, 2018 AND  MARCH 19, 2019. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES SECURITIES LAW VIOLATIONS BASED ON STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY DURING SUCH  PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE FILING OF THE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT DESCRIBED ABOVE, ON JUNE 21, 2019 AND OCTOBER 1, 2019,  RESPECTIVELY, TWO SEPARATE PURPORTED SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS WERE FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT  OF CALIFORNIA (BONNER V. DOERR, ET AL., CASE NO. 4:19-CV-03621 AND CARLSON V. DOERR, ET AL., CASE NO. 4:19-CV-06230) BASED ON SIMILAR  ALLEGATIONS TO THOSE MADE IN THE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS NAME AMYRIS, INC.  AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT AND NAME A NUMBER OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS.  THE LAWSUITS SEEK TO RECOVER, ON THE COMPANY'S BEHALF, UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES PURPORTEDLY SUSTAINED BY THE COMPANY IN CONNECTION WITH  ALLEGEDLY MISLEADING STATEMENTS AND OMISSIONS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S SECURITIES FILINGS. THE DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS  ALSO SEEK A SERIES OF CHANGES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES, RESTITUTION TO THE COMPANY FROM THE INDIVIDUAL  DEFENDANTS, AND AN AWARD OF ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES. THESE CASES ARE IN THE INITIAL PLEADINGS STAGE. WE BELIEVE THE COMPLAINTS LACK  MERIT, AND INTEND TO DEFEND OURSELVES VIGOROUSLY. GIVEN THE EARLY STAGE OF THESE PROCEEDINGS, IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO RELIABLY  DETERMINE ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITY THAT COULD RESULT FROM THESE MATTERS.  WE MAY BE INVOLVED,  FROM TIME TO TIME, IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. SUCH MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO  MANY UNCERTAINTIES AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS OR OTHERWISE  WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  THE RISKS DESCRIBED  IN PART I, ITEM 1A, \"RISK FACTORS\" IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND  THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD DECLINE. THESE RISK FACTORS DO NOT IDENTIFY ALL RISKS THAT WE FACE; OUR OPERATIONS  COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS THAT ARE NOT PRESENTLY KNOWN TO US OR THAT WE CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR OPERATIONS.  DUE TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, OUR PAST FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY NOT BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE,  AND HISTORICAL TRENDS SHOULD NOT BE USED TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

(UNAUDITED; TABULAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES AND STORE DATA)  THE 2019 AND 2018 THIRD QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE TWELVE-WEEK PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 8, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 9, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2019 AND 2018 THREE FISCAL QUARTERS REFERENCED HEREIN REPRESENT THE  THIRTY-SIX-WEEK  PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 8, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 9, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  DOMINO\u2019S IS THE LARGEST PIZZA COMPANY IN THE WORLD BASED ON GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WITH MORE THAN 16,500 LOCATIONS IN OVER 85 MARKETS. FOUNDED IN 1960, OUR ROOTS ARE IN CONVENIENT PIZZA DELIVERY, WHILE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR SALES ALSO COME FROM CARRYOUT CUSTOMERS. DOMINO\u2019S GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY CHARGING ROYALTIES AND FEES TO OUR INDEPENDENT FRANCHISEES. THE COMPANY ALSO GENERATES REVENUES AND EARNINGS BY SELLING FOOD, EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO FRANCHISEES PRIMARILY IN THE U.S. AND CANADA, AND BY OPERATING A NUMBER OF OUR OWN STORES IN THE U.S. FRANCHISEES PROFIT BY SELLING PIZZA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY ITEMS TO THEIR LOCAL CUSTOMERS. IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE GENERALLY GRANT GEOGRAPHICAL RIGHTS TO THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND TO MASTER FRANCHISEES. THESE MASTER FRANCHISEES ARE CHARGED WITH DEVELOPING THEIR GEOGRAPHICAL AREA, AND THEY CAN PROFIT BY  SUB-FRANCHISING  AND SELLING INGREDIENTS AND EQUIPMENT TO THOSE  SUB-FRANCHISEES,  AS WELL AS BY RUNNING PIZZA STORES DIRECTLY. EVERYONE IN THE SYSTEM CAN BENEFIT, INCLUDING THE END CONSUMER, WHO CAN FEED THEIR FAMILY DOMINO\u2019S MENU ITEMS CONVENIENTLY AND ECONOMICALLY.  OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE DRIVEN LARGELY BY RETAIL SALES AT OUR FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES. CHANGES IN RETAIL SALES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN SAME STORE SALES AND STORE COUNTS. WE MONITOR BOTH OF THESE METRICS VERY CLOSELY, AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND PROFITS, AND WE STRIVE TO CONSISTENTLY INCREASE BOTH METRICS. RETAIL SALES DRIVE ROYALTY PAYMENTS FROM FRANCHISEES, AS WELL AS COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES. RETAIL SALES ARE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA  \u00ae  BRAND, THE RESULTS OF OUR EXTENSIVE ADVERTISING THROUGH VARIOUS MEDIA CHANNELS, THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION AND DIGITAL ORDERING, OUR ABILITY TO EXECUTE OUR STRONG AND PROVEN BUSINESS MODEL AND THE OVERALL GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

OUR U.S. CARRYOUT BUSINESS EXPERIENCED CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH. WHILE OUR OVERALL U.S. DELIVERY BUSINESS CONTINUES TO GROW, OUR U.S. DELIVERY SAME STORE SALES GROWTH HAS BEEN PRESSURED BY OUR CURRENT STRATEGY TO INCREASE STORE CONCENTRATION IN CERTAIN MARKETS WHERE WE COMPETE AS WELL AS FROM AGGRESSIVE COMPETITIVE ACTIVITY.  WE ALSO CONTINUED OUR GLOBAL EXPANSION WITH THE OPENING OF 214 NET NEW STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, BRINGING OUR  YEAR-TO-DATE  TOTAL TO 614. WE OPENED 174 NET NEW STORES INTERNATIONALLY AND 40 NET NEW STORES IN THE U.S. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. OVERALL, WE BELIEVE THIS GLOBAL STORE GROWTH, ALONG WITH OUR STRONG SALES, EMPHASIS ON TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND MARKETING INITIATIVES, HAVE COMBINED TO STRENGTHEN OUR BRAND.  GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH ARE TOTAL WORLDWIDE RETAIL SALES AT FRANCHISE AND COMPANY-OWNED STORES, INCREASED 5.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 5.2% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE STORE COUNTS DURING THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS AS WELL AS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS INCREASE, RESULTING FROM A GENERALLY STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR WHEN COMPARED TO THE CURRENCIES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. U.S. SAME STORE SALES GROWTH REFLECTED THE SUSTAINED POSITIVE SALES TRENDS AND THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, MARKETING AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES GROWTH ALSO REFLECTED CONTINUED POSITIVE PERFORMANCE.  TOTAL REVENUES INCREASED $34.8 MILLION, OR 4.4%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $117.7 MILLION, OR 5.0%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL RETAIL SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN AND GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES. THE INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE REVENUES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF 59 COMPANY-OWNED STORES TO CERTAIN OF OUR EXISTING U.S. FRANCHISEES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 (THE \u201cSECOND QUARTER STORE SALE\u201d). THESE CHANGES IN REVENUES ARE DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $10.6 MILLION, OR 8.0%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $33.4 MILLION, OR 8.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUES FROM U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISED STORES, AS WELL AS HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN MARGINS. A  PRE-TAX  GAIN OF $5.9 MILLION RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF 12 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  NET INCOME INCREASED $2.3 MILLION, OR 2.7%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $21.1 MILLION, OR 8.4%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. THESE INCREASES IN NET INCOME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2019 RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTING FROM A HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE AND A SLIGHTLY HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE FOLLOWING OUR DEBT RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTION COMPLETED ON APRIL 24, 2018 (THE \u201c2018 RECAPITALIZATION\u201d).

THESE DECREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. COMPANY-OWNED SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.3% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

U.S. FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 2.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 3.2% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF U.S. FRANCHISE STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD, AS A RESULT OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. OUR MARKET BASKET PRICING TO STORES INCREASED 2.8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.3% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ESTIMATED INCREASE IN U.S. SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES OF $9.8 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $21.6 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.7 MILLION, OR 9.0%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $7.7 MILLION, OR 6.2%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER VOLUMES FROM INCREASED ORDERS AND AN INCREASE IN MARKET BASKET PRICING. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $0.2 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $4.1 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEE REVENUES  REVENUES FROM INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE ROYALTIES AND FEES INCREASED $4.2 MILLION, OR 8.3%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $9.9 MILLION, OR 6.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE INCREASES WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STORES OPEN DURING THE PERIOD AND HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. THESE INCREASES IN REVENUES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OF $1.5 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND $8.1 MILLION IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 1.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 2.0% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTERNATIONAL FRANCHISE SAME STORE SALES INCREASED 3.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND 4.0% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COST OF SALES / OPERATING MARGIN  THIRD QUARTER  THIRD QUARTER  THREE FISCAL  THREE FISCAL  OF 2019  OF 2018  QUARTERS OF 2019  QUARTERS OF 2018  CONSOLIDATED REVENUES  $820.8  100.0%  $786.0  100.0%  $2,468.4  100.0%  $2,350.7  100.0%  CONSOLIDATED COST OF SALES  504.6  61.5%  490.7  62.4%  1,513.2  61.3%  1,462.0  62.2%  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN  $316.3  38.5%  $295.3  37.6%  $955.2  38.7%  $888.7  37.8%  COST OF SALES CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF COMPANY-OWNED STORE AND SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS INCURRED TO GENERATE RELATED REVENUES.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN (WHICH WE DEFINE AS REVENUES LESS COST OF SALES) INCREASED $21.0 MILLION, OR 7.1%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $66.5 MILLION, OR 7.5%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER GLOBAL FRANCHISE REVENUES AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN VOLUMES. FRANCHISE REVENUES DO NOT HAVE A COST OF SALES COMPONENT, SO CHANGES IN THESE REVENUES HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE OPERATING MARGIN.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.

OPERATING MARGIN IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SAME STORE SALES. AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES, THE U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORE OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE CHANGES IN OPERATING MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.  \u2022  FOOD COSTS DECREASED 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 27.1% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE LEVERAGING OF HIGHER SAME STORE SALES.

THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE CONTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO THE HIGH LABOR RATES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE SOLD STORES OPERATED. THE REDUCTION IN LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF STORE REVENUES IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE LABOR RATES IN OUR REMAINING COMPANY-OWNED STORE MARKETS.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SUPPLY CHAIN REVENUES, THE SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATING MARGIN INCREASED 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCUREMENT SAVINGS, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER LABOR COSTS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $3.3 MILLION, OR 4.2%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $11.5 MILLION, OR 4.6%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. A  PRE-TAX  GAIN OF $5.9 MILLION RECOGNIZED FROM THE SALE OF 12 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER ADVERTISING EXPENSES, RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE, PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES. A $2.4 MILLION  PRE-TAX  LOSS RELATED TO THE SECOND QUARTER STORE SALE AND CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGICAL INITIATIVES AND OTHER AREAS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES  U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING EXPENSES INCREASED $7.0 MILLION, OR 8.5%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $21.5 MILLION, OR 8.8%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES. U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING COSTS ARE ACCRUED AND EXPENSED WHEN THE RELATED U.S. FRANCHISE ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, AS OUR CONSOLIDATED  NOT-FOR-PROFIT  ADVERTISING FUND IS OBLIGATED TO EXPEND SUCH REVENUES ON ADVERTISING AND THESE REVENUES CANNOT BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET DECREASED $0.4 MILLION, OR 1.2%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $2.2 MILLION, OR 2.2%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE DEBT BALANCE, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION AND OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES. A HIGHER WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE INCREASE IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.3 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 IN CONNECTION WITH THE 2018 RECAPITALIZATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S WEIGHTED AVERAGE BORROWING RATE WAS 4.1% IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AND WAS 4.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND 4.0% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCREASED $8.7 MILLION, OR 57.5%, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED $10.2 MILLION, OR 23.3%, IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED TO 21.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND INCREASED TO 16.6% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO 15.3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 AND 14.9% IN THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2018. HIGHER  PRE-TAX  INCOME AND LOWER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER TAX EXPENSE IN BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE OPERATED WITH MINIMAL POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OR NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OUR RECEIVABLE COLLECTION PERIODS AND INVENTORY TURN RATES ARE FASTER THAN THE NORMAL PAYMENT TERMS ON OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE GENERALLY COLLECT OUR RECEIVABLES WITHIN THREE WEEKS FROM THE DATE OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE GENERALLY EXPERIENCE 35 TO 45 INVENTORY TURNS PER YEAR. IN ADDITION, OUR SALES ARE NOT TYPICALLY SEASONAL, WHICH FURTHER LIMITS OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. THE USE OF OUR ONGOING CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS, INVEST IN OUR BUSINESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL AMOUNTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL OF $2.3 MILLION, EXCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $177.3 MILLION, ADVERTISING FUND ASSETS, RESTRICTED, OF $109.5 MILLION AND ADVERTISING FUND LIABILITIES OF $104.9 MILLION. WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES TOTAL UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $66.7 MILLION.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019, WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SAME STORE SALES VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, OUR INTERNATIONAL AND U.S. BUSINESSES GREW STORE COUNTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2019. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO GENERATE POSITIVE OPERATING CASH FLOWS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO USE OUR UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, EXCESS CASH FROM OUR RECAPITALIZATION TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESS, SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS, PAY DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED UPON OUR CURRENT LEVEL OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED GROWTH, WE BELIEVE THAT THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, OUR CURRENT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTE FACILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO FUND THESE ITEMS AND CONTINUE TO REDUCE DEBT COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OF THE EVENTS DESCRIBED UNDER \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OR THAT FUTURE BORROWINGS WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES OR OTHERWISE TO ENABLE US TO SERVICE OUR INDEBTEDNESS OR TO MAKE ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. OUR FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES AND TO SERVICE, EXTEND OR REFINANCE OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES WILL BE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.  RESTRICTED CASH  AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $140.9 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD FOR FUTURE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS AND OTHER WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OF OUR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIZATION STRUCTURE, $36.2 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH HELD IN A THREE-MONTH INTEREST RESERVE AS REQUIRED BY THE RELATED DEBT AGREEMENTS AND $0.2 MILLION OF OTHER RESTRICTED CASH FOR A TOTAL OF $177.3 MILLION OF RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE ALSO HELD $68.7 MILLION OF ADVERTISING FUND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, WHICH CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE THE DOMINO\u2019S PIZZA BRAND.  LONG-TERM DEBT  AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $3.44 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, OF WHICH $35.9 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS A CURRENT LIABILITY. OUR FIXED AND FLOATING RATE NOTES FROM THE RECAPITALIZATIONS WE COMPLETED IN 2018, 2017 AND 2015 HAVE ORIGINAL SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS OF $8.8 MILLION IN THE REMAINDER OF 2019, $35.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2020 AND 2021, $888.0 MILLION IN 2022, $26.3 MILLION IN EACH OF 2023 AND 2024, $1.14 BILLION IN 2025, $14.0 MILLION IN 2026 AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2027. AS OF SEPTEMBER 8, 2019, WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES AND $126.9 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING, NET OF LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED OF $48.1 MILLION. THE LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR CASUALTY INSURANCE PROGRAMS AND SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER LEASES. BORROWINGS UNDER THE VARIABLE FUNDING NOTES ARE AVAILABLE TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND, SUBJECT TO OTHER LIMITATIONS, OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES INCLUDING DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\u2019S INVESTIGATION FOCUSED PRINCIPALLY ON CERTAIN  CUSTOMER TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY DURING FISCAL YEARS 2017 AND 2018.  ON JANUARY 14, 2019, THE COMPANY REPORTED THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE\u2019S INTERNAL INVESTIGATION WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED, THE PRINCIPAL FINDINGS OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, AND THE REMEDIAL ACTIONS TO BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATION.  THE AUDIT COMMITTEE PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUES RELATED TO FISCAL QUARTERS OCCURRING DURING THE 2017 AND 2018 FISCAL YEARS OF THE COMPANY.  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S FORMER INDEPENDENT AUDITOR NOTIFIED THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF ITS RESIGNATION. THE FORMER AUDITOR ALSO INDICATED THAT RELIANCE SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON: (I) THE REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM DATED AUGUST 22, 2017 RELATING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017; AND (II) THE COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEWS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE AUDITOR ALSO RECALLED ITS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED AUDIT REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017.  ON FEBRUARY 4, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, AND BASED UPON THE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED REVENUES PROPOSED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, DETERMINED THAT THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON: (1) THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2017; AND (2) THE QUARTERLY AND YEAR-TO-DATE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR SEPTEMBER 30, 2017, DECEMBER 31, 2017, AND MARCH 31, 2018.

THESE ISSUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LACK OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION FOR VARIOUS HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING RESERVES AND POLICIES, FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY AND CONSISTENTLY COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL INTEGRATION OF CANTALOUPE, AND THE INADEQUATE PERFORMANCE OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROLS DURING THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR.  BASED UPON THESE NON-INVESTIGATORY ADJUSTMENTS, ON OCTOBER 7, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, UPON THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, DETERMINED THAT THE FOLLOWING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREVIOUSLY ISSUED BY THE COMPANY SHOULD NO LONGER BE RELIED UPON: (1) THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015; (2) THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2016; AND (3) THE QUARTERLY AND YEAR-TO-DATE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR SEPTEMBER 30, 2016, DECEMBER 31, 2016, AND MARCH 31, 2017.

THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $39.9 MILLION OF CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK IN A PUBLIC OFFERING AND $35.1 MILLION OF NET CASH PROCEEDS RESULTING FROM OUR TERM LOAN AND LINE OF CREDIT ISSUED UNDER OUR NOVEMBER 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  DUE TO THE COMPANY'S DELAY IN FILING ITS PERIODIC REPORTS, BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 28, 2018, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS TO PROVIDE FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE DELIVERY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND RELATED COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES REQUIRED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE NOVEMBER 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE LENDER BY NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2019. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY INCURRED EXTENSION FEES DUE TO THE LENDER,  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOTALING  $0.2 MILLION  , BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 28, 2018 AND JUNE 30, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 THE COMPANY PREPAID  $20.0 MILLION  OF THE BALANCE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN,  $0.6 MILLION  OF WHICH WAS APPLIED TO THE INSTALLMENT PAYMENT DUE ON MARCH 31, 2019 AND THE REMAINDER OF WHICH WAS APPLIED TO THE LAST REPAYMENT INSTALLMENT OBLIGATIONS DUE UNDER THE TERM LOAN. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY PREPAID THE REMAINING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF THE TERM LOAN OF $1.5 MILLION AND AGREED TO PERMANENTLY REDUCE THE AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO $10 MILLION WHICH REPRESENTED THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE ON THE DATE THEREOF. THE AGREEMENTS ALSO PROVIDE THAT THE COMPANY CANNOT INCUR ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITHOUT THE LENDER\u2018S PRIOR CONSENT. FURTHER, THE PARTIES AGREED THAT THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE LIBOR PLUS  4%  UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE COMPANY DELIVERS CERTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION REQUIRED UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  ON MARCH 29, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY OBTAINED WAIVERS OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE EVENT OF DEFAULT IS THE RESULT OF THE COMPANY HAVING MAINTAINED DEPOSITS ON ACCOUNT WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNTS PERMITTED BY THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND NOT HAVING TRANSFERRED CERTAIN DEPOSIT ACCOUNTS TO THE LENDER. THE WAIVER REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO REMEDY THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY MARCH 31, 2020 BY WHICH TIME THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE UNDERLYING COVENANT. ALTHOUGH AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 THE COMPANY WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO AND THE TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, PURSUANT TO THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 EXTENSION AGREEMENT, THE LENDER AGREED THAT ANY SUCH FAILURE WOULD NOT CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT PENDING THE DELIVERY TO THE LENDER OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES BY NO LATER THAN OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED ALL AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN AS CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF  DECEMBER 31, 2018  AND  JUNE 30, 2018.  PURSUANT TO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT DATED OCTOBER 9, 2019 BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ANTARA CAPITAL MASTER FUND LP (\u201cANTARA\u201d), ON OCTOBER 9, 2019, THE COMPANY SOLD TO ANTARA 3,800,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $5.25 PER SHARE FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $19,950,000. ON OCTOBER 9, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A COMMITMENT LETTER (\u201cCOMMITMENT LETTER\u201d) WITH ANTARA, PURSUANT TO WHICH ANTARA HAS COMMITTED TO EXTEND TO THE COMPANY A $30 MILLION SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY (\u201cTERM FACILITY\u201d). THE TERM FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER 31, 2019. PURSUANT TO THE COMMITMENT LETTER, THE COMPANY WOULD DRAW $15 MILLION OF THE TERM FACILITY CONCURRENTLY WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION, AND SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION, WOULD DRAW AN ADDITIONAL $15 MILLION DURING THE PERIOD COMMENCING ON THE NINE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY AND TERMINATING ON THE EIGHTEEN-MONTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE EXECUTION OF THE DEFINITIVE LOAN DOCUMENTATION.  THE COMPANY HAS THE FOLLOWING PRIMARY SOURCES OF CAPITAL AVAILABLE: (1) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND OF  $63.2 MILLION  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018 WHICH WAS $27.5 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019; (2) THE CASH WHICH MAY BE PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR; (3) POTENTIAL SALES TO THIRD PARTY LENDERS OF ALL OR A PORTION OF OUR FINANCE RECEIVABLES; AND (4) GROSS CASH PROCEEDS OF $19,950,000 FROM THE ISSUANCE OF OUR SHARES TO ANTARA AS REFERRED TO ABOVE; AND (5) AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $30 MILLION UNDER THE TERM FACILITY AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  AS MORE FULLY SET FORTH IN THE 2019 FORM 10-K THAT HAS BEEN FILED CONCURRENTLY WITH THIS FORM 10-Q, MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT, DURING THE 2020 FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY ITS BANK DEBT OF $10.0 MILLION, SALES TAX LIABILITY ESTIMATED TO BE NO MORE THAN $16 MILLION, AND THE ADDITIONAL COSTS OF PREPARING THE 2019 FORM 10-K AND RELATED ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL BE INCURRED PRIMARILY DURING THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020. IN ADDITION, MANAGEMENT HAS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED EFFICIENCIES IN WORKING CAPITAL THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR CASH BALANCES.  THEREFORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPITAL RESOURCES TO OPERATE ITS ANTICIPATED BUSINESS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "USA TECHNOLOGIES INC", "CIK": 896429, "Date": "2019-10-09T00:00:00", "Ticker": "USAT", "Name": "USA Technologies Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3578.0, "Business": "PA", "Incorporated": "PA", "IRS": 232679963.0, "key": "20191009USAT", "labelr1": -14.722222222222225, "labelr2": 6.840390879478827, "labelr3": 10.0609756097561, "labelr4": 0.4155124653739647, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5787213999999999, "prof1": 0.42127857, "return1&2": 1.0687477379659789, "return1&2&3": 0.961221288719402, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9572272944449444, "return2": 0.9315960912052116, "return1": 1.1472222222222224, "return3": 0.899390243902439, "return4": 0.9958448753462604, "1_day_return": -14.722222222222225, "cumulative_return1": 0.013509176693149057, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 2455, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9428693763056235, "cumreturn1b": 0.894635928974984, "cumreturn1c": 0.9832599129403067, "cumreturndow": 0.9992789330839211, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9971260667318125}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2460, "level_0": 2525, "index": 79370, "text": "ITEM 2.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  EFFECTIVE MARCH 1, 2019, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS TO BETTER REFLECT THE WAY THE COMPANY NOW MANAGES ITS BUSINESS. TO REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S REVISED PERSPECTIVE, THE COMPANY NOW CLASSIFIES ITS OPERATIONS IN THE FOLLOWING THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND BIOMETRICS. PRIOR YEAR SEGMENT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. SEE NOTE 22 TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR SEGMENT INFORMATION.  PRODUCTS INCLUDED IN THESE SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS INCLUDE.  \u25aa  MOBILE MULTI-MEDIA VIDEO PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IN-DASH, OVERHEAD AND HEADREST SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  AUTOSOUND PRODUCTS INCLUDING RADIOS AND AMPLIFIERS,  \u25aa  SATELLITE RADIOS INCLUDING PLUG AND PLAY MODELS AND DIRECT CONNECT MODELS,  \u25aa  SMART PHONE TELEMATICS APPLICATIONS,  33  \u25aa  AUTOMOTIVE SECURITY, VEHICLE ACCESS AND REMOTE ST  ART SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  AUTOMOTIVE POWER ACCESSORIES,  \u25aa  REAR OBSERVATION AND COLLISION AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS,  \u25aa  DRIVER DISTRACTION PRODUCTS, AND  \u25aa  POWER LIFT GATES.

BIOMETRICS PRODUCTS INCLUDE.  \u25aa  IRIS IDENTIFICATION PRODUCTS, AND  \u25aa  BIOMETRIC SECURITY RELATED PRODUCTS.  WE BELIEVE OUR SEGMENTS MAY HAVE EXPANDING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WITH CERTAIN LEVELS OF VOLATILITY RELATED TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, NEW CAR SALES, INCREASED COMPETITION BY MANUFACTURERS, PRIVATE LABELS, TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS, DISCRETIONARY CONSUMER SPENDING AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  ALSO, ALL OF OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE FLUCTUATIONS WHICH COULD AFFECT THE CARRYING VALUE OF INVENTORIES AND GROSS MARGINS IN THE FUTURE.  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS BY ACQUIRING NEW BRANDS, EMBRACING NEW TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND APPLYING THIS TO A CONTINUED STREAM OF NEW PRODUCTS THAT SHOULD INCREASE GROSS MARGINS AND IMPROVE OPERATING INCOME. IN ADDITION, IT IS OUR INTENTION TO CONTINUE TO ACQUIRE SYNERGISTIC COMPANIES THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO LEVERAGE OUR OVERHEAD, PENETRATE NEW MARKETS AND EXPAND EXISTING PRODUCT CATEGORIES THROUGH OUR BUSINESS CHANNELS. NOTWITHSTANDING THE ABOVE, IF THE APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY ARISES, THE COMPANY WILL EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL DIVESTITURE OF A PRODUCT LINE OR BUSINESS.  ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS  THERE WERE NO ACQUISITIONS OR DISPOSITIONS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES REPORTED IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE JUDGMENTS CAN BE SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX, AND CONSEQUENTLY, ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES RELATE TO REVENUE RECOGNITION; ACCRUED SALES INCENTIVES; ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE RESERVES; INVENTORY VALUATION; VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS; VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF GOODWILL, TRADEMARKS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS; WARRANTIES; STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION; RECOVERABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS; AND THE RESERVE FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AT THE DATE OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS IDENTIFIED IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019. SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR CHANGES TO THE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES RELATED TO THEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S USE OF THE DISCRETE METHOD OF ESTIMATING ITS U.S. TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT) BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 (SEE NOTE 12).  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS YOU READ THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, REFER TO THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME, WHICH PRESENT THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SET FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS DATA FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018.  35  NET SALES  AUGUST 31,  2019  2018  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  $26,845  $40,006  $(13,161  )  (32.9  )%  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS  63,034  68,328  (5,294  )  (7.7  )%  BIOMETRICS  254  184  70  38.0%  CORPORATE  113  349  (236  )  (67.6  )%  TOTAL NET SALES  $90,246  $108,867  $(18,621  )  (17.1  )%  SIX MONTHS ENDED  AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS  $56,487  $79,652  $(23,165  )  (29.1  )%  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS  126,687  129,232  (2,545  )  (2.0  )%  BIOMETRICS  260  412  (152  )  (36.9  )%  CORPORATE  266  426  (160  )  (37.6  )%  TOTAL NET SALES  $183,700  $209,722  $(26,022  )  (12.4  )%  AUTOMOTIVE SALES REPRESENTED 29.7% AND 30.7% OF THE NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 36.7% AND 38.0% IN THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES IN THIS SEGMENT DECREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EVO REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT LINE, WHICH WAS DUE IN PART TO LAUNCH DELAYS FOR CERTAIN VEHICLE MODELS, AS WELL AS SLOWER SALES FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT BEGAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SOFTENING OF GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY SALES IN BOTH PERIODS. THE COMPANY\u2019S OEM SECURITY AND REMOTE START SALES ALSO DECLINED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF COMPETITION, AS WELL AS THE DISCONTINUATION OF PASSIVE ENTRY PROGRAMS WITH ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, SALES OF AFTERMARKET SATELLITE RADIO AND HEADREST PRODUCTS HAVE DECLINED IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN STANDARD FACTORY EQUIPPED VEHICLES WITH THESE OPTIONS, AS WELL AS DUE TO PRICE COMPETITION FOR AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCTS. OFFSETTING THE SALES DECLINES IN THIS SEGMENT FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WERE INCREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SAFETY AND SECURITY PRODUCTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SALES REPRESENTED 69.8% AND 69.0% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 62.8% AND 61.6% IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. SALES DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUCH AS THE ITS PROJECT NURSERY LINE, AS A RESULT OF THE ELIMINATION OF BABY VIDEO MONITORS, AND IN WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, DUE A REDUCTION IN PRODUCT PLACEMENT WITH ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LARGER CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES BY ANOTHER. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUED TO SEE A DECLINE IN SALES OF CERTAIN HOOK-UP AND POWER PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS HEADPHONES AND REMOTES, AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEMAND AND TECHNOLOGY, AND DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CONTINUING RATIONALIZATION OF SKU\u2019S WITH THE GOAL OF LIMITING SALES OF LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS. WITHIN EUROPE, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN SALES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, AS WELL AS IN THE DIY BUSINESS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF A SLOWDOWN IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THERE WAS ALSO A DECREASE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCTS, AS A RESULT OF PRIOR YEAR LOAD-IN SALES OF TWO NEW PRODUCT LINES THAT LAUNCHED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD. OFFSETTING THESE DECREASES, THE COMPANY HAD AN INCREASE IN SALES WITHIN BOTH OF ITS PREMIUM MOBILITY AND PREMIUM WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKER CATEGORIES AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF NEW LINES OF SOUNDBARS AND WIRELESS EARBUDS, AS WELL AS STRONGER SALES OF SEVERAL EXISTING PRODUCTS. ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM COMMERCIAL SPEAKER PRODUCTS HAVE ALSO HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT ON SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. BOTH RECEPTION AND KARAOKE PRODUCT SALES WERE UP FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF EXPANDED SKU OFFERINGS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND STRONGER MARKET SHARE, AND SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACTIVITY BANDS HAVE INCREASED YEAR OVER YEAR AS A RESULT OF INCREASED MOTION PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS FOR PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING THE APPLE WATCH. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCT SALES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF ITS NEW DOMESTIC PRODUCT LINES THAT LAUNCHED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  BIOMETRICS SALES REPRESENTED 0.3% AND 0.1% OF OUR NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 0.2% IN BOTH OF THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN SALES OF ITS NANO NXT PERIMETER ACCESS PRODUCT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS A RESULT OF DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS MADE TO THE PRODUCT.  ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING ITS EXT OUTDOOR PERIMETER ACCESS PRODUCT DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WHICH WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE SEGMENT DID NOT HAVE INVENTORY AS  36  THE NNXT PRODUCT SOLD OUT IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THIS RESULTED IN THE OVERALL DECREASE IN SALES FOR THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT FOR T  HE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT  DECREASED  440 AND 360 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THE DECREASE IN MARGINS WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECLINES IN HIGHER MARGIN OEM SECURITY, REMOTE START, AND REAR SEAT ENTERTAINMENT SALES, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN LOWER ABSORPTION OF FIXED OVERHEAD COSTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR PERIODS, FURTHER DECREASING MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECLINE IN AFTERMARKET HEADREST PRODUCT SALES, WHICH TYPICALLY GENERATE HIGHER MARGINS FOR THE SEGMENT. MARGINS HAVE ALSO BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 BY TARIFF INCREASES, AS CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA, WHILE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS WERE RELOCATED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LABOR COSTS. AS AN OFFSET TO THESE MARGIN DECLINES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE AUTOMOTIVE ELECTRONICS SEGMENT EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN SATELLITE RADIO SALES, WHICH CONTRIBUTE LOWER MARGINS TO THE GROUP, WHILE INCREASED SALES OF CERTAIN AFTERMARKET SECURITY PRODUCTS CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO MARGINS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS SEGMENT DECREASED 110 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. MARGINS HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 BY TARIFF INCREASES, AS CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN CHINA, WHILE PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN OTHER PRODUCTS WERE RELOCATED TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH HIGHER LABOR COSTS. MARGIN DECLINES WERE ALSO DRIVEN BY DECLINING SALES OF PRODUCTS WITH TYPICALLY HIGHER MARGINS, SUCH AS HOOK-UP AND REMOTES, AND THE COMPANY\u2019S PROJECT NURSERY PRODUCT LINE, AS WELL BY SALES DECLINES WITHIN THE EUROPEAN MARKET AND HIGHER WAREHOUSING COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO THE USE OF A THIRD PARTY FOR WAREHOUSING SERVICES IN EUROPE BEGINNING DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. MARGIN INCREASES DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WERE DRIVEN PARTIALLY BY INCREASED SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S HIGH MARGIN PREMIUM WIRELESS AND BLUETOOTH SPEAKERS, MOBILITY PRODUCTS, AND COMMERCIAL SPEAKERS, AS WELL AS INCREASED SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S KARAOKE PRODUCTS. FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, MARGINS WERE ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE COMPANY\u2019S PREMIUM HOME SEPARATE SPEAKER PRODUCTS AS A RESULT OF HIGHER SALES, AS WELL AS DISCOUNTS OFFERED ON OLDER PRODUCT IN THE PRIOR YEAR THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES IN THE BIOMETRICS SEGMENT DECREASED 767 AND 385 BASIS POINTS FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THESE DECREASES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF CERTAIN FULLY RESERVED INVENTORY DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF INVENTORY  37  RESERVES AND CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER MARGINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RELEASE OF CERTAIN INVENTORY RESERVES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020,  WHICH HAD A POSITIV  E IMPACT ON THE SEGMENT\u2019S GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.

SELLING EXPENSES DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS RELATED TO FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, LOWER COMMISSIONS AS A RESULT OF THE DECLINE IN SALES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS, AND LOWER ADVERTISING COSTS AND DISPLAY AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AS MANY DISPLAYS AND FIXTURES ARE FULLY AMORTIZED OR HAVE BEEN REMOVED. THESE EXPENSE DECREASES WERE OFFSET BY SALARY INCREASES WITHIN SELLING RESULTING FROM TRANSFERS OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES FROM GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES TAKING PLACE IN FISCAL 2019, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL HIRES AT THE COMPANY\u2019S KLIPSCH SUBSIDIARY.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY GRANTED 200,000 FULLY VESTED COMMON SHARES TO THE COMPANY\u2019S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AS WELL AS GRANTED ADDITIONAL SHARES WHICH VEST ON FUTURE DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT SIGNED IN JULY 2019, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1,000 FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A REIMBURSEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $2,000 FOR CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS RESULTING FROM THE FAVORABLE OUTCOME OF A LAWSUIT, WHICH DID NOT REPEAT DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. DISREGARDING THESE SPECIFIC ITEMS, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WOULD HAVE DECREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019. OFFSETTING THE INCREASES TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DISCUSSED ABOVE WERE DECREASES IN SALARY EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN HEADCOUNT AND THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES TO SELLING IN CONJUNCTION WITH FISCAL 2019 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS LOWER OFFICE AND EQUIPMENT RENTAL EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF COST CONTAINMENT MEASURES.  ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DECREASED AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, EXPENSES WERE DOWN PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING RELATED TO PROJECTS THAT WERE COMPLETED DURING THE PERIODS, AS WELL AS DUE TO THE MOVEMENT OF CERTAIN PROJECTS UTILIZING OUTSIDE CONTRACTORS TO IN-HOUSE EMPLOYEES AT EYELOCK. THESE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES RELATED TO THE START OF NEW PROJECTS AND HIGHER CERTIFICATION FEES FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS HIGHER CUSTOMER REIMBURSEMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR PERIODS.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATED ITS PROJECTIONS FOR SEVERAL BRANDS IN ITS FORMER CONSUMER ACCESSORY AND AUTOMOTIVE SEGMENTS BASED ON LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED RESULTS DUE TO LOWER PRODUCT LOAD-INS, INCREASED COMPETITION FOR CERTAIN PRODUCT LINES, A STREAMLINING OF SKU\u2019S, AND ITS MARKETING STRATEGY FOR ONE OF ITS BRANDS. AS A RESULT OF  38  THIS EVALUATION, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT SEVERAL OF ITS TRADEMARKS WERE IMPAIRED  ,  RESULTING IN A TOTAL CHARGE OF $9,814 FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018  .

DURING FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN AMENDMENT TO ITS WELLS FARGO LENDING AGREEMENT IN WHICH THE FEES CHARGED FOR THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE LINE OF CREDIT WERE LOWERED. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY SUSPENDED ITS DOMESTIC SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCING, THUS RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF THE RELATED FEES.  EQUITY IN INCOME OF EQUITY INVESTEE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF INCOME FROM ITS 50% NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ASA ELECTRONICS LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES (\"ASA\"). THE DECREASE IN INCOME FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IS A RESULT OF LOWER SALES IN CERTAIN MARKETS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN PRODUCT RECALL EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 THAT WERE NOT PRESENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND AN INCREASE IN WARRANTY COSTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT.  DURING FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS INVESTMENT IN RXNETWORKS, A NON-CONTROLLED CORPORATION, CONSISTING OF SHARES OF THE INVESTEE\u2019S PREFERRED STOCK. VOXX RECOGNIZED A GAIN DURING FISCAL 2018 FOR THE SALE OF THIS INVESTMENT; HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THE CASH PROCEEDS WERE SUBJECT TO A HOLD-BACK PROVISION, WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE GAIN RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2018. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE HOLD-BACK PROVISION EXPIRED, AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED THE REMAINING PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE, RECORDING AN INVESTMENT GAIN FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN VENEZUELA, WHICH ARE HELD FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY MADE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE PROPERTIES AS A RESULT OF THE COUNTRY'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC DETERIORATION, WHICH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT CURRENCY DEVALUATION IN AUGUST OF 2018. THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 REPRESENTING THE REMAINING BALANCE OF THESE PROPERTIES.  OTHER, NET INCLUDES NET FOREIGN CURRENCY GAINS OR LOSSES, INTEREST INCOME, RENTAL INCOME, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS INCOME AND EXPENSE. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, OTHER, NET INCREASED DUE PRIMARILY TO THE PROCEEDS FROM A KEY MAN LIFE INSURANCE POLICY IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,000, RELATED TO A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF KLIPSCH GROUP, INC. THAT VOXX BECAME THE BENEFICIARY OF IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF KLIPSCH IN FISCAL 2012.  INCOME TAX PROVISION  THE COMPANY\u2019S PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES CONSISTS OF FEDERAL, FOREIGN AND STATE TAXES NECESSARY TO ALIGN THE COMPANY\u2019S YEAR-TO-DATE TAX PROVISION WITH THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE RATE THAT IT EXPECTS TO ACHIEVE FOR THE FULL YEAR.  AT EACH INTERIM PERIOD, THE COMPANY UPDATES ITS ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND RECORDS CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY. THE AUTHORITATIVE GUIDANCE FOR ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ALLOWS USE OF THE YEAR-TO-DATE (THE \u201cDISCRETE METHOD\u201d) WHEN A RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE CANNOT BE MADE. DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE USE OF THE DISCRETE METHOD FOR U.S. OPERATIONS IS MORE APPROPRIATE THAN THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE METHOD DUE TO SENSITIVITY TO SMALL CHANGES TO PROJECTED PRE-TAX EARNINGS, WHICH RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE  39  CUSTOMARY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND PRETAX INCOME.  AS SUCH, THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED A FOREIGN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND APPLIED THAT TO ITS FOREIGN YEAR  TO DATE RESULTS  AND HAS CALCULATED THE U.S. TAX PROVISION (BENEFIT)  BASED ON PRE-TAX RESULTS THROUGH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  . THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IS REFLECTED IN THE TAX PROVISION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 18.4% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $6,049 AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 58.9% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $14,164, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CALCULATION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION ON A DISCRETE BASIS, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL ASSETS, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES  . IN ADDITION, THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCREASED FOR TAX CREDITS AND LOSS JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A LIMITED TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECOGNIZED.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF 13.8% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $11,066 AND AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF 40.5% ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $17,829, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CALCULATION OF THE U.S. TAX PROVISION ON A DISCRETE BASIS, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, AN INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL ASSETS, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO  THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST RELATED TO EYELOCK LLC, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAXES, NONDEDUCTIBLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES, AND INCOME TAXED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AT VARYING TAX RATES.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE ARE NOT FINANCIAL MEASURES RECOGNIZED BY GAAP. EBITDA REPRESENTS NET (LOSS) INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO VOXX INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE AND BANK CHARGES, TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA REPRESENTS EBITDA ADJUSTED FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INVESTMENT GAINS, LIFE INSURANCE PROCEEDS, AS WELL TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BASED ON ADJUSTED EBITDA.  WE PRESENT EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE IN THIS FORM 10-Q BECAUSE WE CONSIDER THEM TO BE USEFUL AND APPROPRIATE SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE. ADJUSTED EBITDA AND DILUTED ADJUSTED EBITDA PER COMMON SHARE HELP US TO EVALUATE OUR PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN GAAP CALCULATIONS THAT MAY NOT HAVE A DIRECT CASH IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION, THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN COSTS OR GAINS RELATING TO CERTAIN EVENTS ALLOWS FOR A MORE MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, AND ACCESS TO EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING THE INTERCOMPANY LOAN FUNDING WE PROVIDE TO OUR MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, EYELOCK LLC. IN THE EVENT THEY DO NOT, WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDS IN THE FUTURE TO SUPPORT OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS OR FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND MAY SEEK TO RAISE SUCH ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE SALE OF PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCINGS AS WELL AS FROM OTHER SOURCES.  NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FUTURE OR THAT IF AVAILABLE, SUCH FINANCING WILL BE OBTAINABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE WHEN REQUIRED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT MAINTAIN ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, TRANSACTIONS, OBLIGATIONS OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT UPON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW, WE ASSUME  NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AFTER THE DATE OF THE FILING OF THIS REPORT.  OVERVIEW  THE  COMPANY OPERATES WITH TWO SALES GROUPS, SURGE COMPONENTS (\u201cSURGE\u201d) AND CHALLENGE ELECTRONICS (\u201cCHALLENGE\u201d).  SURGE IS A SUPPLIER OF ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THESE PRODUCTS INCLUDE CAPACITORS, WHICH ARE ELECTRICAL ENERGY STORAGE  DEVICES, AND DISCRETE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPONENTS, SUCH AS RECTIFIERS, TRANSISTORS AND DIODES, WHICH ARE SINGLE FUNCTION LOW POWER  SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE PACKAGED ALONE AS COMPARED TO INTEGRATED CIRCUITS SUCH AS MICROPROCESSORS. THE PRODUCTS SOLD BY  SURGE ARE TYPICALLY UTILIZED IN THE ELECTRONIC CIRCUITRY OF DIVERSE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AUTOMOBILES, AUDIO  PRODUCTS, TEMPERATURE CONTROL PRODUCTS, LIGHTING PRODUCTS, ENERGY RELATED PRODUCTS, COMPUTER RELATED PRODUCTS, VARIOUS TYPES OF  CONSUMER PRODUCTS, GARAGE DOOR OPENERS, HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES, POWER SUPPLIES AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT. THESE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD TO  BOTH ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS OEMS, WHO INCORPORATE THEM INTO THEIR PRODUCTS, AND TO DISTRIBUTORS  OF THE LINES OF PRODUCTS WE SELL, WHO RESELL THESE PRODUCTS WITHIN THEIR CUSTOMER BASE. THESE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED PREDOMINANTLY  IN ASIA BY APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS. WE ACT AS THE MASTER DISTRIBUTION AGENT UTILIZING INDEPENDENT SALES  REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATIONS IN NORTH AMERICA TO SELL AND MARKET THE PRODUCTS FOR ONE SUCH MANUFACTURER PURSUANT TO A WRITTEN  AGREEMENT. WHEN WE ACT AS A SALES AGENT, OUR SUPPLIER WHO SOLD THE PRODUCT TO THE CUSTOMER THAT WE INTRODUCED TO OUR SUPPLIER  PAYS US A COMMISSION. THE AMOUNT OF THE COMMISSION IS DETERMINED ON A SALE BY SALE BASIS DEPENDING ON THE PROFIT MARGIN OF THE  PRODUCT. COMMISSION REVENUE TOTALED $462,111 AND $31,968 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY,  WHICH INCREASE WAS DUE TO COMMISSION INCOME ON NEW AND EXISTING ACCOUNTS.  CHALLENGE  IS ENGAGED IN THE SALE OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS. IN 1999, CHALLENGE BEGAN AS A DIVISION TO SELL AUDIBLE COMPONENTS. WE HAVE  BEEN ABLE TO INCREASE THE TYPES OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL BECAUSE SOME OF OUR SUPPLIERS INTRODUCED NEW PRODUCTS, AND WE ALSO LOCATED  OTHER PRODUCTS FROM NEW SUPPLIERS. OUR CORE PRODUCTS INCLUDE BUZZERS, SPEAKERS, MICROPHONES, RESONATORS, ALARMS, CHIMES, FILTERS,  AND DISCRIMINATORS. WE NOW ALSO WORK WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE OUR SUPPLIERS CUSTOMIZE MANY OF THE PRODUCTS WE SELL FOR MANY  CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OWN DESIGNS AND THOSE THAT WE WORK WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO HAVE OUR SUPPLIERS REDESIGN FOR  THEM AT OUR SUPPLIERS\u2019 FACTORIES. WE HAVE AN ENGINEER ON OUR STAFF WHO WORKS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS ON SUCH REDESIGNS AND  ASSISTS WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCT LINES. WE ARE CONTINUALLY LOOKING TO EXPAND THE LINE OF PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL. WE  SELL THESE PRODUCTS THROUGH INDEPENDENT REPRESENTATIVES THAT EARN A COMMISSION ON THE PRODUCTS WE SELL. WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH  LOCAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL DISTRIBUTORS TO SELL THESE PRODUCTS TO LOCAL ACCOUNTS IN EVERY STATE.  IN  SEPTEMBER 2018, WE FILED A U.S. PATENT APPLICATION WITH THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE FOR AN IMPROVED PINPOINT  ALARM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE AN INDIVIDUAL\u2019S ABILITY TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION OF AN ALARM VERSUS STANDARD SINGLE, MULTI-FREQUENCY,  OR BROADBAND ALARMS. THE IMPROVED ALARM CAN BE USED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING REVERSING VEHICLES, MEDICAL EMERGENCY  NOTIFICATION, AND HARDWARE DEVICES THAT USE BLUETOOTH OR OTHER WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN COMBINATION WITH MOBILE SOFTWARE  APPLICATIONS TO LOCATE LOST ITEMS, INCLUDING PHONES, WALLETS, AND KEYS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE  PRODUCTS THAT WE SELL DO NOT HAVE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS OR COPYRIGHTS REGISTERED IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE  OR IN ANY STATE. WE RELY ON THE KNOW-HOW, EXPERIENCE AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE  PRODUCTS DO NOT INFRINGE ON ANY PATENTS OR TRADEMARKS OF OTHER PARTIES, OR VIOLATE PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS, IT IS POSSIBLE  THAT INFRINGEMENT OF EXISTING OR FUTURE PATENTS, TRADEMARKS OR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS OF OTHERS MAY OCCUR.  THE  COMPANY HAS A HONG KONG OFFICE TO EFFECTIVELY HANDLE THE TRANSFER BUSINESS FROM UNITED STATES CUSTOMERS PURCHASING AND MANUFACTURING  IN ASIA AFTER DESIGNING THE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS OFFICE HAS STRENGTHENED THE COMPANY\u2019S GLOBAL POSITION, IMPROVING  OUR CAPABILITIES AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMER BASE.  THE  ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO CHANGE, AS MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE DECLINED, ESPECIALLY DUE TO TARIFFS, BUT ALSO DUE  TO A DOWNTURN IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE COMPANY STARTED TO FEEL SOME BUSINESS DOWNTURN FROM SOME  OF ITS CUSTOMERS.  21  THE  WORLD OF BUSINESS IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING BECAUSE OF \u201cDISRUPTORS,\u201d WHICH ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TRADITIONAL BUSINESS  PRACTICES THAT DID NOT PREVIOUSLY EXIST, SUCH AS TARIFFS.    THESE CHANGES ALSO INCLUDE CUSTOMERS MOVING THEIR MANUFACTURING  OPERATIONS FROM NORTH AMERICA TO ASIA, AND THE TREND OF GLOBALIZATION. THIS TREND MAKES BUSINESS MORE COMPLICATED AND COSTLY FOR  THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY MUST HAVE A PRESENCE IN ASIA TO SERVICE AND FURTHER DEVELOP THE BUSINESS. FOR THESE REASONS, WE ESTABLISHED  SURGE LTD., OUR ASIA SUBSIDIARY. CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA.  CUSTOMERS HAVE MOVED TO REDUCE THEIR SUPPLY CHAIN, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY. IN SOME MARKET SEGMENTS, DEMAND FOR  ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS HAS DECREASED, AND IN OTHER SEGMENTS, THE DEMAND IS STILL STRONG, SUCH AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY. SOME  TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE, WHILE CUSTOMERS DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS USING DIFFERENT KINDS OF COMPONENTS.  MANAGEMENT  IS CONCERNED THAT THE REST OF 2019 INTO 2020 WILL BE A YEAR OF CHANGE AND CHALLENGE. THESE CHALLENGES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY  IN NEGATIVE WAYS, POSSIBLY REDUCING SALES AND OR PROFITABILITY. IN ORDER FOR THE COMPANY TO GROW, WE WILL DEPEND ON, AMONG OTHER  THINGS, THE CONTINUED STRENGTH AND GROWTH OF THE ELECTRONICS AND SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRIES, OUR ABILITY TO WITHSTAND INTENSE PRICE  COMPETITION, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR ABILITY TO RETAIN AND ATTRACT SALES AND OTHER KEY PERSONNEL IN ORDER TO  EXPAND OUR MARKETING CAPABILITIES, OUR ABILITY TO SECURE ADEQUATE SOURCES OF PRODUCTS, WHICH ARE IN DEMAND ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE  TERMS, OUR SUCCESS IN EXECUTING AND MANAGING GROWTH,  INCLUDING MONITORING  AN EXPANDED LEVEL OF OPERATIONS  AND  SYSTEMS, CONTROLLING COSTS, THE AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCING, AND OUR ABILITY TO DEAL SUCCESSFULLY, WITH NEW AND FUTURE  DISRUPTORS. THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN IS STRONGLY IMPACTED BY THE TARIFFS WHICH ARE NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE GROWTH OF OUR  CUSTOMERS AND MANY OF THE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN CHINA. HOWEVER, AT THIS TIME THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL  ADVERSE EFFECT FROM THE TARIFFS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE  THE  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON THE COMPANY\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTABILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS  AND AN ASSESSMENT OF INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISK AS WELL AS THE AGING OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF THERE IS A  CHANGE IN ACTUAL DEFAULTS FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE COMPANY\u2019S ESTIMATES OF RECOVERABILITY OF AMOUNTS  DUE COULD BE AFFECTED AND THE COMPANY WOULD ADJUST THE ALLOWANCE ACCORDINGLY.  REVENUE  RECOGNITION  REVENUE  IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE PRICE IS FIXED AND DETERMINABLE, COLLECTABILITY  IS REASONABLY ASSURED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THIS OCCURS WHEN PRODUCT IS SHIPPED FROM  THE COMPANY\u2019S WAREHOUSE. FOR DIRECT SHIPMENTS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS TO OUR CUSTOMER, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PRODUCT IS  SHIPPED FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S SUPPLIER. THE COMPANY ACTS AS A SALES AGENT FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS BUYING DIRECT FROM ONE OF ITS  SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANY REPORTS THESE COMMISSIONS AS REVENUES IN THE PERIOD EARNED.  THE  COMPANY PERFORMS ONGOING CREDIT EVALUATIONS OF ITS CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAINS RESERVES FOR POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSSES.  INVENTORY  VALUATION  INVENTORIES  ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORIES TO MARKET VALUE ARE BASED ON STOCK ROTATION, HISTORICAL  SALES REQUIREMENTS AND OBSOLESCENCE AS WELL AS IN THE CHANGES IN THE BACKLOG. RESERVES REQUIRED FOR OBSOLESCENCE WERE NOT MATERIAL  IN ANY OF THE PERIODS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED. IF MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN THOSE PROJECTED BY MANAGEMENT,  ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORIES COULD BE REQUIRED. FOR EXAMPLE, EACH ADDITIONAL 1% OF OBSOLETE INVENTORY WOULD REDUCE OPERATING  INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $40,000.  THE  COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF ITS VENDORS AND ASSUMES THE RISK OF CHANGES IN THE PRICES OF ITS  PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THERE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT RISK WITH REGARDS TO THE LACK OF PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS  AS MANY OF ITS INVENTORY ITEMS ARE PURCHASED TO FULFILL PURCHASE ORDERS RECEIVED.  INCOME  TAXES  WE  HAVE MADE A NUMBER OF ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE REPORTING OF A DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET TO PREPARE OUR FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR VALUATION  ALLOWANCE RELATING TO DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. OUR ESTIMATES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  NET  SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $1,431,808 OR 6.1%, TO $24,957,943 AS COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $23,526,135  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $1,195,861  OR 12.9%, TO $8,085,849, AS COMPARED TO NET SALES OF $9,281,710 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN BUSINESS WITH NEW CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL BUSINESS WITH EXISTING  CUSTOMERS. WE ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO A DECREASED DEMAND AT CERTAIN  CUSTOMERS DUE TO A DOWNTURN IN BUSINESS DUE TO TARIFFS AS WELL AS A GENERAL DEMAND. WE ALSO ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE TO A DECREASE  IN BUSINESS WITH CERTAIN EXISTING CUSTOMERS. NET SALES FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 REFLECT $978,807 AND  $292,166, RESPECTIVELY OF TARIFF COSTS THAT THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO PASS ON TO ITS CUSTOMERS.  22  OUR  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $1,367,740 TO $7,208,904, OR 23.4% AS COMPARED TO $5,841,164  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED TO 28.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 24.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31,  2019 INCREASED BY $308,153 TO $2,415,556, OR 14.6% AS COMPARED TO $2,107,403 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GROSS  MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED TO 29.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 22.7% FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. THE INCREASES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS BEING SOLD AT A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN. MANAGEMENT  HAS CONTINUED TO TARGET CUSTOMERS WITH HIGHER MARGINS AND HAS BEEN ABLE TO NEGOTIATE REDUCED COSTS WITH FACTORIES RESULTING IN  A HIGHER GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE. A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE CAN ALSO BE ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASES IN  COMMISSION INCOME ON NEW AND EXISTING ACCOUNTS. OUR INDUSTRY WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE PRESSURE FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PRICE REDUCTIONS.  SOME OF THEM DEMAND PERIODIC PRICE REDUCTIONS ON A QUARTERLY OR SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS, AS OPPOSED TO ANNUAL FIXED PRICING. WE WORK  WITH ELECTRONIC MANUFACTURING SERVICE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS WHO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS WHO DO NOT HAVE THEIR  OWN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. AT TIMES WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RECOVER THESE PRICE REDUCTIONS FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANY HAS AGREEMENTS  WITH THESE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS TO PROVIDE PERIODIC COST REDUCTIONS THROUGH REBATES IN THE AMOUNT OF 5%. THESE REDUCTIONS  ONLY AFFECT FUTURE SHIPMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND DO NOT AFFECT EXISTING ORDERS. THESE REDUCTIONS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON  OUR PROFIT MARGINS SINCE THEY REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF COMMISSIONS WE CAN EARN. EVEN THOUGH THIS REBATE CAN IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN, THESE SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS REPRESENT VERY SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY, BECAUSE THEY CAN  HELP THE COMPANY BECOME AN APPROVED SUPPLIER AT THE CUSTOMERS THEY MANUFACTURE FOR, AND THEY PURCHASE OUR COMPONENTS FOR THESE  CUSTOMERS. WE BELIEVE IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO ACHIEVE BUSINESS AT THESE CUSTOMERS WITHOUT THE HELP OF THESE  SUBCONTRACTOR CUSTOMERS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EXPERIENCED A MATERIAL ADVERSE  EFFECT FROM TARIFF COSTS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA, WHICH WENT INTO EFFECT AS OF JULY 6, 2018. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN  ABLE TO PASS ALONG THESE COSTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED REVENUES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO MOVING SOME CUSTOMER  DELIVERIES DIRECTLY TO HONG KONG IN ORDER TO MITIGATE SOME OF THESE COSTS.  SELLING  AND SHIPPING EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $2,011,634, AN INCREASE OF $50,157, OR 2.6%, AS COMPARED TO  $1,961,477 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. SELLING AND SHIPPING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019  WAS $717,399, AN INCREASE OF $11,761, OR 1.7%, AS COMPARED TO $705,638 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  WE ATTRIBUTE  THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN SELLING EXPENSES SUCH AS SALESMAN COMPENSATION AND  TRAVEL AND AUTO EXPENSES, OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN COMMISSION, FREIGHT OUT AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN SALESMAN COMPENSATION AND TRAVEL EXPENSES, OFFSET BY DECREASES IN FREIGHT  OUT, COMMISSION EXPENSES AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES.  GENERAL  AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $3,458,541, AN INCREASE OF $243,816, OR 7.6%, AS COMPARED  TO $3,214,725 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST  31, 2019 WAS $1,087,154, AN INCREASE OF $65,594, OR 6.4%, AS COMPARED TO $1,021,560 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 IS DUE TO INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSE, INSURANCE EXPENSE,  AS WELL AS TEMPORARY HELP, BAD DEBT EXPENSES, PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES AND PAYROLL EXPENSES OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COMPUTER EXPENSES,  PROFESSIONAL FEES, CONSULTING EXPENSES, MAINTENANCE EXPENSES AND BANK CHARGES. WE ATTRIBUTE THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 TO INCREASES IN RENT EXPENSES AND INSURANCE EXPENSES AS WELL AS INCREASES TO TEMPORARY HELP EXPENSES, TELEPHONE,  PUBLIC COMPANY EXPENSES AND BAD DEBT EXPENSES, OFFSET BY DECREASES TO MAINTENANCE EXPENSE, OFFICE EXPENSES AND PAYROLL EXPENSES.  DEPRECIATION  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $28,878, A DECREASE OF $7,852, OR 21.4%, AS COMPARED TO $36,730 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31 2018. DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $9,626, A DECREASE OF $2,618,  OR 21.4%, AS COMPARED TO $12,244 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASE TO THE COMPANY PURCHASING  LESS NEW EQUIPMENT DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  OTHER  INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $245, AN INCREASE OF $242 COMPARED TO $3 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST  31, 2018. OTHER INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 WAS $242, AN INCREASE OF $241 COMPARED TO $1 FOR THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  INTEREST  EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $2,079, A DECREASE OF $11,251, OR 84.4% COMPARED TO $13,330 FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $652, A DECREASE OF $2,944, OR 81.9%  COMPARED TO $3,596 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE DECREASES TO THE COMPANY PAYING DOWN THE LINE  OF CREDIT IN 2018.  TAX  BENEFIT FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $126,683, A DECREASE OF $200,164 AS COMPARED TO A TAX EXPENSE OF $73,481  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $78,304, A DECREASE OF $105,112  AS COMPARED TO A TAX EXPENSE OF $26,808 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. THE CHANGES RESULT FROM OUR NET INCOME FOR  SUCH PERIODS AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S REVISED ESTIMATE OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME AND THE RELATED IMPACT ON THE REPORTED  DEFERRED TAX. THE CHANGE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. THE DEGREE OF VARIABILITY  INHERENT IN THE ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IS SIGNIFICANT AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE IN THE NEAR TERM. THE COMPANY REVIEWS  ITS ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME IN EACH REPORTING PERIOD AND ADJUSTMENTS TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ARE REFLECTED IN THE  CURRENT OPERATIONS.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FOREGOING, NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $1,834,700, COMPARED TO A NET INCOME OF $541,424  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  NET INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 WAS $679,271, COMPARED  TO NET INCOME OF $337,558 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.  23  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS  OF AUGUST 31, 2019 WE HAD CASH OF $2,346,896, AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $7,385,242. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR WORKING CAPITAL LEVELS ARE  ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING REQUIREMENTS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, WE HAD NET CASH FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $598,071, AS COMPARED TO NET CASH  FLOW PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $66,215 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. THE INCREASE IN CASH FLOW PROVIDED  FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULTED FROM INCREASES IN CASH PROVIDED BY NET INCOME AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AS PARTIALLY OFFSET  BY INCREASES IN INVENTORY, PREPAID EXPENSES AND TAXES AND OTHER ASSETS AS WELL AS DECREASES IN ACCRUED EXPENSES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  WE  HAD NET CASH FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $(7,221) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AS COMPARED TO NET CASH  FLOW USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $(31,939) FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018. WE ATTRIBUTE THE CHANGE TO THE  COMPANY PURCHASING LESS NEW EQUIPMENT DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  WE  HAD NET CASH FLOW USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $(5,817) DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $(300,000)  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, PLEASE REFER TO THE BELOW SECTION OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q TITLED \u201cCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES, ALL REFERENCES TO \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d, OR \u201cNEUROMETRIX\u201d IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q REFER TO NEUROMETRIX, INC.  OVERVIEW  NEUROMETRIX IS A COMMERCIAL STAGE, INNOVATION DRIVEN HEALTHCARE COMPANY COMBINING NEUROSTIMULATION AND DIGITAL MEDICINE. OUR CORE EXPERTISE IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING HAS BEEN REFINED OVER NEARLY TWO DECADES OF DESIGNING, BUILDING AND MARKETING MEDICAL DEVICES THAT STIMULATE NERVES AND ANALYZE NERVE RESPONSE FOR DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. WE CREATED THE MARKET FOR POINT-OF-CARE NERVE TESTING AND WERE FIRST TO MARKET WITH SOPHISTICATED WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN. WE HAVE AN EXPERIENCED MANAGEMENT TEAM AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR BUSINESS IS FULLY INTEGRATED WITH IN-HOUSE CAPABILITIES SPANNING PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, REGULATORY AFFAIRS AND COMPLIANCE, SALES AND MARKETING, AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT. WE DERIVE REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF MEDICAL DEVICES AND AFTER-MARKET CONSUMABLE PRODUCTS AND ACCESSORIES. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD IN THE UNITED STATES AND SELECT OVERSEAS MARKETS AND ARE CLEARED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) AND REGULATORS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE HAVE TWO PRINCIPAL PRODUCT LINES.  \u2022  WEARABLE NEUROSTIMULATION THERAPEUTIC DEVICES  \u2022  POINT-OF-CARE NEUROPATHY DIAGNOSTIC TESTS  CHRONIC PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. IT IS DEFINED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AS ANY PAIN LASTING MORE THAN 12 WEEKS. THIS CONTRASTS WITH ACUTE PAIN WHICH IS A NORMAL BODILY RESPONSE TO INJURY OR TRAUMA. CHRONIC PAIN MAY BE TRIGGERED BY AN INJURY OR THERE MAY BE AN ONGOING CAUSE SUCH AS DISEASE OR ILLNESS. THERE MAY ALSO BE NO CLEAR CAUSE. IN INDIVIDUALS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC PAIN, PAIN SIGNALS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSMITTED IN THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OVER EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME OFTEN LEADING TO OTHER HEALTH PROBLEMS. THESE CAN INCLUDE FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, DECREASED APPETITE, AND MOOD CHANGES WHICH CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN CARRYING OUT IMPORTANT ACTIVITIES AND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO DISABILITY AND DESPAIR. IN GENERAL, CHRONIC PAIN CANNOT BE CURED. TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING PAIN AND IMPROVING FUNCTION. THE GOAL IS EFFECTIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT.  CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS OVER 100 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MORE THAN 1.5 BILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL IMPACT OF CHRONIC PAIN ON HEALTH CARE COSTS IN THE UNITED STATES IS OVER $250 BILLION PER YEAR AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY IS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED $300 BILLION PER YEAR. THE MOST COMMON APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IS PAIN MEDICATION. THIS INCLUDES OVER-THE-COUNTER (OTC) INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ANALGESICS AS WELL AS PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS, BOTH NON-OPIOID AND OPIOID. THE APPROACH TO TREATMENT IS INDIVIDUALIZED, DRUG COMBINATIONS MAY BE EMPLOYED, AND THE RESULTS ARE OFTEN HIT OR MISS. SIDE EFFECTS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDICTION ARE REAL AND THE RISKS ARE SUBSTANTIAL. INCREASINGLY, FEDERAL, STATE AND PRIVATE-PAYER RESTRICTIONS ARE BEING IMPOSED ON PRESCRIPTION OPIOIDS AS A RESPONSE TO THOSE RISKS. REFLECTING THE COMPLEXITY OF CHRONIC PAIN AND THE DIFFICULTY IN TREATING IT, WE BELIEVE THAT INADEQUATE RELIEF LEADS 25% TO 50% OF PAIN SUFFERERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVES TO PRESCRIPTION PAIN MEDICATIONS. THESE ALTERNATIVES INCLUDE NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, ACUPUNCTURE, CHIROPRACTIC CARE, NON-PRESCRIPTION ANALGESICS, ELECTRICAL STIMULATORS, BRACES, SLEEVES, PADS AND OTHER ITEMS. IN TOTAL THESE PAIN RELIEF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION IN ANNUAL SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES.  NERVE STIMULATION IS A WELL-ESTABLISHED CATEGORY OF TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC PAIN. THIS TREATMENT APPROACH IS AVAILABLE THROUGH IMPLANTABLE SPINAL CORD STIMULATION REQUIRING SURGERY WITH ITS ATTENDANT RISKS. NON-INVASIVE APPROACHES INVOLVING TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS) HAVE ACHIEVED LIMITED EFFICACY IN PRACTICE DUE TO DEVICE LIMITATIONS, INEFFECTIVE DOSING AND LOW PATIENT ADHERENCE. OUR QUELL WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR CHRONIC PAIN ADDRESSES THESE LIMITATIONS AND HAS RESULTED IN QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVEMENTS FOR MANY CHRONIC PAIN SUFFERERS WHO HAVE USED THE PRODUCT, WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED THROUGH POST-MARKET ANALYSIS OF USER DATA SUBMITTED TO US FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES VIA THE QUELL APP, CLINICAL STUDIES, AND USER REVIEWS.  DIABETES IS A WORLDWIDE EPIDEMIC WITH AN ESTIMATED AFFECTED POPULATION OF OVER 400 MILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE OVER 30 MILLION PEOPLE WITH DIABETES AND ANOTHER 80 MILLION PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. THE ANNUAL DIRECT COST OF  14  TREATING DIABETES IN THE UNITED STATES EXCEEDS $100 BILLION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE DANGEROUS ACUTE MANIFESTATIONS OF DIABETES, THE PRIMARY BURDEN OF THE DISEASE IS IN ITS LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS WHICH INCLUDE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, NERVE DISEASE AND RESULTING CONDITIONS SUCH AS FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY REQUIRE AMPUTATION, EYE DISEASE LEADING TO BLINDNESS, AND KIDNEY FAILURE. THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM COMPLICATION OF DIABETES AFFECTING OVER 50% OF THE DIABETIC POPULATION IS NERVE DISEASE OR DIABETIC NEUROPATHY. DIABETIC PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (DPN) IS THE PRIMARY TRIGGER FOR DIABETIC FOOT ULCERS WHICH MAY PROGRESS TO THE POINT OF REQUIRING AMPUTATION. PEOPLE WITH DIABETES HAVE A 15-25% LIFETIME RISK OF FOOT ULCERS AND APPROXIMATELY 15% OF FOOT ULCERS LEAD TO AMPUTATION. FOOT ULCERS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE COMPLICATION OF DIABETES WITH A TYPICAL COST OF $5,000 TO $50,000 PER EPISODE. IN ADDITION, BETWEEN 16% AND 26% OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN IN THEIR FEET AND LOWER LEGS.  EARLY DETECTION OF DPN IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THERE ARE NO TREATMENT OPTIONS ONCE THE NERVES HAVE DEGENERATED. TODAY\u2019S DIAGNOSTIC METHODS FOR DPN RANGE FROM A SIMPLE MONOFILAMENT TEST FOR LACK OF SENSORY PERCEPTION IN THE FEET TO A NERVE CONDUCTION STUDY PERFORMED BY A SPECIALIST. OUR DPNCHECK TECHNOLOGY PROVIDES A POINT-OF-CARE, LOW COST, QUANTITATIVE TEST FOR PERIPHERAL NERVE DISEASE, INCLUDING DPN. IT ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT MEDICAL NEED AND IS PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE IN MASS SCREENINGS OF POPULATIONS THAT ARE LIKELY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DPN. DPNCHECK HAS BEEN VALIDATED IN NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES.  IN 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A COLLABORATION WITH GLAXOSMITHKLINE (\"GSK\"). THE GSK COLLABORATION ESTABLISHED A FRAMEWORK FOR THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF QUELL, LAUNCHED IN THE UNITED STATES IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AND TO BE LAUNCHED BY GSK INTERNATIONALLY, AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF AREAS OF MARKETING RESPONSIBILITY. THE INITIAL TERM OF THE GSK COLLABORATION RUNS THROUGH 2020. THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, GSK HAS PAID US $19.9 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND HAS CONTRIBUTED $1.3 MILLION TOWARD DEVELOPMENT COSTS. A TOTAL OF $5.1 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS, BOTH DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL, REMAIN OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS.

FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS LARGELY DEPENDS ON REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, AND ON ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION. A LOW LEVEL OF MARKET INTEREST IN QUELL OR DPNCHECK, A DECLINE IN OUR CONSUMABLES SALES, UNANTICIPATED INCREASES IN OUR OPERATING COSTS, OR UNANTICIPATED SETBACKS TOWARD THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE GSK MILESTONES WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH.

WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN FOR THE ONE-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY. WE HELD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $3.2 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . WE BELIEVE THAT THESE RESOURCES, FUTURE GSK COLLABORATION MILESTONE PAYMENTS, AND THE CASH TO BE GENERATED FROM FUTURE PRODUCT SALES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR PROJECTED OPERATING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL NEEDS IN 2020. WE CONTINUE TO FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND UNCERTAINTIES AND, AS A RESULT, OUR AVAILABLE CAPITAL RESOURCES MAY BE CONSUMED MORE RAPIDLY THAN CURRENTLY EXPECTED DUE TO (A) DECREASES IN SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS; (B) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE TO THE BUSINESS THAT AFFECT ONGOING OPERATING EXPENSES; (C) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY; (D) REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS; (E) CHANGES WE MAY MAKE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING PLANS; (F) DELAYS IN THE TIMING OF ACHIEVING GSK MILESTONES; (G) THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION CIVIL INVESTIGATIVE DEMAND ENFORCEMENT ACTION INVOLVING QUELL; AND (H) OTHER ITEMS AFFECTING OUR FORECASTED LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES AND USE OF CASH RESOURCES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FUNDING THROUGH ACHIEVEMENT OF MILESTONES UNDER THE GSK COLLABORATION, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE FINANCING, COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS, OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CREDIT LINES OR OTHER DEBT FINANCING SOURCES. HOWEVER, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH FUNDING IN A TIMELY MANNER OR ON FAVORABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC COVERING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES FOR SALE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE FUNDING WHEN NEEDED OR OTHERWISE CONSIDERED APPROPRIATE AT PRICES AND ON TERMS TO BE DETERMINED AT THE TIME OF ANY SUCH OFFERINGS. PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS TO FORM S-3, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO SELL SHARES UNDER THE SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, DURING ANY 12-MONTH PERIOD, IN AN AMOUNT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO ONE-THIRD OF THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HELD BY NON-AFFILIATES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY ISSUING EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES, EITHER THROUGH THE SALE OF SECURITIES PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT OR BY OTHER MEANS, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS MAY EXPERIENCE DILUTION, AND THE NEW EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES AND PRIVILEGES SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATION, LICENSING OR OTHER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR POTENTIAL PRODUCTS OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES, OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDS, WE MAY BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, OR OTHER OPERATIONS AND POTENTIALLY DELAY PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE EVENTS OCCURS, OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION GOALS WOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  OUR COMMON STOCK IS QUOTED ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cNURO.\u201d ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET IS MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM CLOSING BID PRICE OF $1.00. THE CLOSING BID PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL MARKET WAS $0.33 ON OCTOBER 11, 2019.  19  ON JUNE 3, 2019, WE RECEIVED A NOTICE FROM THE LISTING QUALIFICATIONS DEPARTMENT OF THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET INDICATING THAT, FOR THE LAST 30 CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, THE BID PRICE FOR OUR COMMON STOCK HAD CLOSED BELOW THE MINIMUM $1.00 PER SHARE REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED INCLUSION IN THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET UNDER NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5550(A)(2). THE NOTIFICATION LETTER STATES THAT PURSUANT TO NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5810(C)(3)(A), THE COMPANY WILL BE AFFORDED 180 CALENDAR DAYS, OR UNTIL DECEMBER 2, 2019, TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT. IN ORDER TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE, SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK MUST MAINTAIN A MINIMUM BID CLOSING PRICE OF AT LEAST $1.00 PER SHARE FOR A MINIMUM OF TEN CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. IF WE DO NOT REGAIN COMPLIANCE BY DECEMBER 2, 2019, NASDAQ WILL PROVIDE WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO US THAT OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE DELISTED. AT THAT TIME, WE MAY APPEAL NASDAQ\u2019S DELISTING DETERMINATION TO A NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATIONS PANEL. ALTERNATIVELY, WE MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 180 DAY GRACE PERIOD IF WE SATISFY ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS, OTHER THAN THE MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT, FOR LISTING ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET SET FORTH IN NASDAQ LISTING RULE 5505. THE NOTIFICATION LETTER HAS NO EFFECT AT THIS TIME ON THE LISTING OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET.  AS A PART OF OUR EFFORTS TO REGAIN COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ CAPITAL MARKET REQUIREMENTS, WE INTEND TO SEEK SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AUTHORIZING OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO EXECUTE A REVERSE STOCK SPLIT, SHOULD THEY DEEM IT ADVISABLE, IN THE RANGE OF 1:4 TO 1:10 AT OUR SPECIAL MEETING SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 12, 2019.

OVERVIEW  AT INTUITIVE, WE BELIEVE THAT MINIMALLY INVASIVE CARE IS LIFE-ENHANCING CARE. INTUITIVE BRINGS MORE THAN TWO DECADES OF LEADERSHIP IN ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY AND SOLUTIONS TO ITS OFFERINGS, AND DEVELOPS, MANUFACTURES, AND MARKETS THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM. WHILE SURGERY AND ACUTE INTERVENTIONS HAVE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE PAST DECADES, THERE REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR BETTER OUTCOMES AND DECREASED VARIABILITY OF THESE OUTCOMES ACROSS CARE TEAMS. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT IS EXERTING A LARGE AND INCREASING BURDEN ON CRITICAL RESOURCES, INCLUDING THE PROFESSIONALS WHO STAFF CARE TEAMS: SURGEONS, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS, NURSES, AND OTHER STAFF. AT THE SAME TIME, GOVERNMENTS ARE STRAINING TO COVER THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THEIR POPULATIONS AND ARE DEMANDING LOWER TOTAL COST PER PATIENT TO TREAT DISEASE. IN THE FACE OF THESE CHALLENGES, WE BELIEVE SCIENTIFIC, PROCESS, AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES IN BIOLOGY, COMPUTING, IMAGING, ALGORITHMS, AND ROBOTICS OFFER THE PROMISE OF NEW METHODS TO SOLVE OLD AND DIFFICULT PROBLEMS.  AT INTUITIVE, WE ADDRESS THESE NEEDS BY FOCUSING ON WHAT HOSPITALS HAVE TERMED THE QUADRUPLE AIM. FIRST, WE FOCUS ON PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND DECREASE VARIABILITY IN THE HANDS OF CARE TEAMS. SECOND, WE SEEK TO  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPROVE THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE BY MINIMIZING DISRUPTION TO LIVES AND CREATING GREATER PREDICTABILITY FOR THE TREATMENT EXPERIENCE. THIRD, WE SEEK TO IMPROVE CARE TEAM SATISFACTION BY CREATING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DEPENDABLE, SMART, AND OPTIMIZED FOR THE CARE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THEY ARE USED. FINALLY, WE SEEK TO LOWER THE TOTAL COST TO TREAT PER PATIENT EPISODE WHEN COMPARED WITH EXISTING TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES, PROVIDING A RETURN ON INVESTMENT FOR HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND VALUE FOR PAYERS.  DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ENABLE SURGEONS TO EXTEND THE BENEFITS OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY (\u201cMIS\u201d) TO MANY PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE UNDERGO A MORE INVASIVE SURGERY BY USING COMPUTATIONAL, ROBOTIC, AND IMAGING TECHNOLOGIES TO OVERCOME MANY OF THE LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL OPEN SURGERY OR CONVENTIONAL MIS. SURGEONS USING A DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM OPERATE WHILE SEATED COMFORTABLY AT A CONSOLE VIEWING A 3D, HIGH-DEFINITION IMAGE OF THE SURGICAL FIELD. THIS IMMERSIVE CONSOLE CONNECTS SURGEONS TO THE SURGICAL FIELD AND THEIR INSTRUMENTS. WHILE SEATED AT THE CONSOLE, THE SURGEON MANIPULATES INSTRUMENT CONTROLS IN A NATURAL MANNER, SIMILAR TO OPEN SURGICAL TECHNIQUE. OUR TECHNOLOGY IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH A RANGE OF ARTICULATION OF THE SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS USED IN THE SURGICAL FIELD ANALOGOUS TO THE MOTIONS OF A HUMAN WRIST, WHILE FILTERING OUT THE TREMOR INHERENT IN A SURGEON\u2019S HAND. IN DESIGNING OUR PRODUCTS, WE FOCUS ON MAKING OUR TECHNOLOGY EASY AND SAFE TO USE.  OUR DA VINCI PRODUCTS FALL INTO FIVE BROAD CATEGORIES: DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS; DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS; DA VINCI STAPLING; DA VINCI ENERGY; AND DA VINCI VISION, INCLUDING FIREFLY FLUORESCENCE IMAGING SYSTEMS AND DA VINCI ENDOSCOPES. WE ALSO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE SUITE OF SERVICES, TRAINING, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WITHIN OUR INTEGRATED ECOSYSTEM, OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO DECREASE VARIABILITY IN SURGERY BY OFFERING DEPENDABLE, CONSISTENT FUNCTIONALITY AND USER EXPERIENCES FOR SURGEONS SEEKING BETTER OUTCOMES. WE TAKE A HOLISTIC \u2018SYSTEMS\u2019 APPROACH TO OFFER INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS DESIGNED TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE MIS INTERVENTION MORE AVAILABLE AND APPLICABLE.  WE HAVE COMMERCIALIZED THE FOLLOWING DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS: THE DA VINCI STANDARD SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 1999, THE DA VINCI S SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2006, THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2009, AND THE FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN 2014. WE HAVE EXTENDED OUR FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM BY ADDING THE DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017, AND THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, COMMERCIALIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH OF OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. OUR PLANS FOR THE ROLLOUT OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDE PUTTING SYSTEMS IN THE HANDS OF EXPERIENCED DA VINCI USERS FIRST WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\"FDA\") CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGICAL AND CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA WHERE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE USED FOR A BROAD SET OF PROCEDURES. WE PLAN TO SEEK U.S. FDA CLEARANCES FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS FOR DA VINCI SP OVER TIME. THE SUCCESS OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IS DEPENDENT ON POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR THE PROCEDURES FOR WHICH IT HAS BEEN CLEARED AS WELL AS SECURING ADDITIONAL CLINICAL CLEARANCES. ALL DA VINCI SYSTEMS INCLUDE A SURGEON\u2019S CONSOLE (OR CONSOLES), IMAGING ELECTRONICS, A PATIENT-SIDE CART, AND COMPUTATIONAL HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.  WE OFFER OVER 80 DIFFERENT MULTI-PORT DA VINCI INSTRUMENTS TO PROVIDE SURGEONS FLEXIBILITY IN CHOOSING THE TYPES OF TOOLS NEEDED TO PERFORM A PARTICULAR SURGERY. THESE MULTI-PORT INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY ROBOTICALLY CONTROLLED AND PROVIDE END EFFECTORS (TIPS) THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE USED IN EITHER OPEN OR LAPAROSCOPIC SURGERY. WE OFFER ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION FOR THE DA VINCI XI AND DA VINCI X PLATFORMS, INCLUDING THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND AND DA VINCI STAPLER PRODUCTS, TO PROVIDE SURGEONS WITH SOPHISTICATED, COMPUTER-AIDED TOOLS TO PRECISELY AND EFFICIENTLY INTERACT WITH TISSUE. DA VINCI X AND DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS SHARE THE SAME INSTRUMENTS WHEREAS THE DA VINCI SI SURGICAL SYSTEM USES INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH X OR XI SYSTEMS. WE CURRENTLY OFFER NINE CORE INSTRUMENTS ON OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM. WE PLAN TO EXPAND THE SP INSTRUMENT OFFERING OVER TIME.  TRAINING TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDE OUR DA VINCI SKILLS SIMULATOR, OUR DA VINCI CONNECT REMOTE CASE OBSERVATION AND MENTORING TOOL, AND OUR DUAL CONSOLE FOR USE IN SURGEON PROCTORING AND COLLABORATIVE SURGERY.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE U.S. FDA CLEARED OUR ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM TO ENABLE MINIMALLY INVASIVE BIOPSY IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG. OUR ION SYSTEM WILL EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING BEYOND SURGERY INTO DIAGNOSTICS WITH THIS FIRST APPLICATION. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE ARE EARLY IN THE LAUNCH AND HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM INSTALLED BASE. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRICING, COMPETITION, MARKET AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, THE EFFECTIVE FORECASTING AND MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCT DEMAND, INVENTORY LEVELS, THE MANAGEMENT OF MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY COSTS, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION.  BUSINESS MODEL  OVERVIEW  WE GENERATE REVENUE FROM THE PLACEMENTS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, IN SALES OR SALES-TYPE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UP-FRONT OR IN OPERATING LEASE TRANSACTIONS WHERE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. WE EARN RECURRING  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REVENUE FROM THE SALES OF INSTRUMENTS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASES. THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM GENERALLY SELLS FOR BETWEEN $0.5 MILLION AND $2.5 MILLION, DEPENDING UPON THE MODEL, CONFIGURATION, AND GEOGRAPHY, AND REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INVESTMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS WHEN PURCHASED. OUR INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES HAVE LIMITED LIVES AND WILL EITHER EXPIRE OR WEAR OUT AS THEY ARE USED IN SURGERY, AT WHICH POINT THEY NEED TO BE REPLACED. WE GENERALLY EARN BETWEEN $700 AND $3,500 OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE PER SURGICAL PROCEDURE PERFORMED, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE SPECIFIC PROCEDURES PERFORMED AND THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF INSTRUMENTS USED. WE TYPICALLY ENTER INTO SERVICE CONTRACTS AT THE TIME SYSTEMS ARE SOLD AT AN ANNUAL FEE BETWEEN $80,000 AND $190,000, DEPENDING UPON THE CONFIGURATION OF THE UNDERLYING SYSTEM AND COMPOSITION OF THE SERVICES OFFERED UNDER THE CONTRACT. THESE SERVICE CONTRACTS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN RENEWED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL CONTRACTUAL SERVICE PERIODS.  THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM PROGRAM HAS A BUSINESS MODEL CONSISTENT WITH THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. CONSISTENT WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, WE INITIALLY PLACE THE ION SYSTEM AS A PIECE OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. ONCE THE SYSTEM IS INSTALLED, WE EARN RECURRING REVENUE FROM SALES OF CONSUMABLES USED IN BIOPSIES AND ONGOING SERVICES. ION SYSTEMS WILL BE PRESENTED SEPARATELY FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS INSTALLED BASE. FOR 2019, WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION SYSTEM IN THE U.S. IN A MEASURED FASHION. THE ASSOCIATED IMPACT TO REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT.  RECURRING REVENUE  RECURRING REVENUE CONSISTS OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE, SERVICE REVENUE, AND OPERATING LEASE REVENUE. RECURRING REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.6 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $2.2 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2017, AND $1.9 BILLION, OR 71% OF TOTAL REVENUE IN 2016.  INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE HAS GROWN AT A FASTER RATE THAN SYSTEMS REVENUE OVER TIME. INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE INCREASED TO $2.0 BILLION IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $1.6 BILLION IN 2017 AND $1.4 BILLION IN 2016. THE GROWTH OF INSTRUMENT AND ACCESSORY REVENUE LARGELY REFLECTS CONTINUED PROCEDURE ADOPTION.  SERVICE REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY THE GROWTH OF THE BASE OF INSTALLED DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. THE INSTALLED BASE OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,986 AT DECEMBER 31, 2018; 13% TO APPROXIMATELY 4,409 AT DECEMBER 31, 2017; AND 9% TO APPROXIMATELY 3,919 AT DECEMBER 31, 2016. SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED TO $635.1 MILLION IN 2018, COMPARED WITH $572.9 MILLION IN 2017 AND $510.7 MILLION IN 2016.  INTUITIVE SURGICAL DA VINCI SYSTEM LEASING  SINCE 2013, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SALES-TYPE AND OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS DIRECTLY WITH CERTAIN QUALIFIED CUSTOMERS AS A WAY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW THEY ACQUIRE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AND EXPAND THEIR ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY PROGRAMS WHILE LEVERAGING OUR BALANCE SHEET. THESE LEASES GENERALLY HAVE COMMERCIALLY COMPETITIVE TERMS AS COMPARED WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY ENTITIES THAT OFFER EQUIPMENT LEASING. WE INCLUDE BOTH OPERATING AND SALES-TYPE LEASES IN OUR SYSTEM SHIPMENT AND INSTALLED BASE DISCLOSURES. WE EXCLUDE OPERATING LEASES AND ION SYSTEMS FROM OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM AVERAGE SELLING PRICE (\u201cASP\u201d) COMPUTATIONS.  IN THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, WE SHIPPED 272, 139, AND 95 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, UNDER LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH 229, 108, AND 62 SYSTEMS, RESPECTIVELY, WERE OPERATING LEASES OR USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS. REVENUE FROM OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. MORE RECENTLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN LARGE CUSTOMERS WHEREBY SYSTEM AND SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE SYSTEMS ARE USED. WE SET OPERATING LEASE AND USAGE-BASED PRICING AT A MODEST PREMIUM RELATIVE TO PURCHASED SYSTEMS REFLECTING THE TIME VALUE OF MONEY AND, IN THE CASE OF USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS, THE RISK THAT SYSTEM UTILIZATION MAY FALL SHORT OF ANTICIPATED LEVELS. THE PROPORTION OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM USAGE-BASED ARRANGEMENTS HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR OPERATING LEASE METRICS HEREIN. OPERATING LEASE REVENUE HAS GROWN FASTER THAN OVERALL SYSTEMS REVENUE AND WAS $51.4 MILLION, $25.9 MILLION, AND $16.6 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. GENERALLY, LEASE TRANSACTIONS GENERATE SIMILAR GROSS MARGINS AS OUR SALE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, A TOTAL OF 560 DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WERE INSTALLED AT CUSTOMERS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEM LEASING PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH FLEXIBILITY REGARDING HOW THEY ACQUIRE OR OBTAIN ACCESS TO DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE LEASING AND ALTERNATIVE FINANCING STRUCTURES, SUCH AS USAGE-BASED PAYMENT MODELS, HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-RECEIVED, AND WE ARE WILLING TO EXPAND THE PROPORTION OF THESE STRUCTURES BASED ON CUSTOMER DEMAND. AS REVENUE FOR OPERATING LEASES IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LEASE TERMS, TOTAL SYSTEMS REVENUE GROWTH IS REDUCED IN A PERIOD WHEN THE NUMBER OF OPERATING LEASE PLACEMENTS INCREASES AS A PROPORTION OF TOTAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS.  FOR SOME OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, OUR CUSTOMERS ARE PROVIDED WITH THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE LEASED SYSTEM AT CERTAIN POINTS DURING AND/OR AT THE END OF THE LEASE TERM. REVENUE GENERATED FROM CUSTOMER PURCHASES OF SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS (\u201cLEASE BUYOUTS\u201d) WAS $48.8 MILLION, $39.5 MILLION, AND $38.2 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, 2017, AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. WE EXPECT THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CUSTOMER EXERCISES OF THE BUYOUT OPTIONS WILL FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF WHEN, AND IF, CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO EXERCISE THEIR BUYOUT OPTIONS.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SYSTEMS REVENUE  SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ARE DRIVEN BY PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST MARKETS. IN GEOGRAPHIES WHERE DA VINCI PROCEDURE ADOPTION IS IN AN EARLY STAGE, SYSTEM SALES WILL PRECEDE PROCEDURE GROWTH. SYSTEM PLACEMENTS ALSO VARY DUE TO SEASONALITY LARGELY ALIGNED WITH HOSPITAL BUDGETING CYCLES. WE TYPICALLY PLACE A HIGHER PROPORTION OF ANNUAL SYSTEM PLACEMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND A LOWER PROPORTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS CUSTOMER BUDGETS ARE RESET. SYSTEM REVENUE GREW 21% TO $1,127.1 MILLION IN 2018; 16% TO $928.4 MILLION IN 2017; AND 11% TO $800.0 MILLION IN 2016. SYSTEMS REVENUE IS ALSO AFFECTED BY THE PROPORTION OF SYSTEMS PLACED THAT ARE UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS, RECURRING OPERATING LEASE REVENUE, OPERATING LEASE BUYOUTS, PRODUCT MIX, ASPS, TRADE-IN ACTIVITIES, AND CUSTOMER MIX.  PROCEDURE MIX / PRODUCTS  OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY USED FOR SOFT TISSUE SURGERY FOR AREAS OF THE BODY BETWEEN THE PELVIS AND THE NECK, PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES, PROCEDURES RANGE IN COMPLEXITY FROM CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TO LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. CANCER AND OTHER HIGHLY COMPLEX PROCEDURES TEND TO BE REIMBURSED AT HIGHER RATES THAN LESS COMPLEX PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. THUS, HOSPITALS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATING LESS COMPLEX, BENIGN CONDITIONS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO PROVIDE HOSPITALS WITH ATTRACTIVE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC SOLUTIONS ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF PROCEDURE COMPLEXITY. OUR FULLY FEATURED DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM WITH ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING THE ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER AND ENDOWRIST STAPLER PRODUCTS, AND OUR INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION PRODUCT TARGETS THE MORE COMPLEX PROCEDURE SEGMENT. OUR DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM AND SINGLE-SITE INSTRUMENTS ARE TARGETED TOWARDS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKETS AND PROCEDURES. OUR DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM COMPLEMENTS THE DA VINCI XI AND X SURGICAL SYSTEMS BY ENABLING SURGEONS TO ACCESS NARROW WORKSPACES.  PROCEDURE SEASONALITY  MORE THAN HALF OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES PERFORMED ARE FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY BENIGN HERNIA REPAIRS, HYSTERECTOMIES, AND CHOLECYSTECTOMIES. THESE BENIGN PROCEDURES AND OTHER SHORT-TERM ELECTIVE PROCEDURES TEND TO BE MORE SEASONAL THAN CANCER OPERATIONS AND SURGERIES FOR OTHER LIFE THREATENING CONDITIONS. SEASONALITY IN THE U.S. FOR THESE PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS TYPICALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER FOURTH QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN MORE PATIENTS HAVE MET ANNUAL DEDUCTIBLES AND LOWER FIRST QUARTER PROCEDURE VOLUME WHEN DEDUCTIBLES ARE RESET. SEASONALITY OUTSIDE THE U.S. VARIES AND IS MORE PRONOUNCED AROUND LOCAL HOLIDAYS AND VACATION PERIODS.  DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS  WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DIRECT SALES ORGANIZATIONS IN THE U.S., EUROPE (EXCLUDING SPAIN, PORTUGAL, ITALY, GREECE, AND MOST EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES), JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA, INDIA, TAIWAN, AND CHINA. IN MAY AND DECEMBER 2018, WE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS IN INDIA AND TAIWAN, RESPECTIVELY. IN JANUARY 2019, OUR INTUITIVE-FOSUN JOINT VENTURE BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. IN THE REMAINDER OF OUR OUS MARKETS, WE PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS.  REGULATORY ACTIVITIES  OVERVIEW  OUR PRODUCTS MUST MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF A LARGE AND GROWING BODY OF INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THAT GOVERN THE PRODUCT SAFETY, EFFICACY, ADVERTISING, LABELING, SAFETY REPORTING DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MATERIALS CONTENT AND SOURCING, TESTING, CERTIFICATION, PACKAGING, INSTALLATION, USE, AND DISPOSAL OF OUR PRODUCTS. EXAMPLES OF SUCH STANDARDS INCLUDE ELECTRICAL SAFETY STANDARDS, SUCH AS THOSE OF THE INTERNATIONAL ELECTROTECHNICAL COMMISSION, AND COMPOSITION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE REDUCTION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVES. FAILURE TO MEET THESE STANDARDS COULD LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MARKET OUR PRODUCTS IN THOSE REGIONS THAT REQUIRE COMPLIANCE TO SUCH STANDARDS.  OUR PRODUCTS AND OPERATIONS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO INCREASINGLY STRINGENT MEDICAL DEVICE, PRIVACY, AND OTHER REGULATIONS BY REGIONAL, FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT TIMELINES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND/OR INDICATIONS MAY BE EXTENDED RELATIVE TO PAST EXPERIENCE AS A RESULT OF THESE REGULATIONS.  CLEARANCES AND APPROVALS  WE HAVE OBTAINED THE CLEARANCES REQUIRED TO MARKET OUR MULTI-PORT PRODUCTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OF OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (STANDARD, S, SI, XI, AND X SYSTEMS) FOR OUR TARGETED SURGICAL SPECIALTIES WITHIN THE U.S., SOUTH KOREA, JAPAN, AND THE EUROPEAN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

WE ARE INTRODUCING THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS  TM  AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF IRIS IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE RECEIVED CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM IN CHINA. THE XI CLEARANCE DOES NOT INCLUDE ADVANCED ENERGY, STAPLING, OR WIRELESS TABLE MOTION PRODUCTS THAT ATTACH TO THE XI SYSTEM. SEPARATE CLEARANCES ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH OF THESE PRODUCTS BY CHINA NATIONAL MEDICAL PRODUCTS ADMINISTRATION (\u201cNMPA\u201d).  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH COMMISSION PUBLISHED ON ITS OFFICIAL WEBSITE THE QUOTA FOR MAJOR MEDICAL EQUIPMENT TO BE IMPORTED AND SOLD IN CHINA THROUGH 2020. THE GOVERNMENT WILL ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS SURGICAL SYSTEMS INTRODUCED BY OTHERS. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS.  IN JULY 2018, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 60, OUR DA VINCI ENDOWRIST 60MM STAPLER. IN JANUARY 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET SUREFORM 45.WE HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN TO MARKET SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45 AND 60 (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SUREFORM 60 AND SUREFORM 45 STAPLERS IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR A SINGLE PORT APPROACH (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). IN MARCH 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. WE ALSO RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA IN MAY 2018. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SYSTEMS WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IN APRIL 2018, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DA VINCI VESSEL SEALER EXTEND IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW).  IN APRIL 2017, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE FOR OUR  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN EUROPE. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN MAY 2017, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE TO MARKET OUR  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE U.S. WE RECEIVED REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR THE  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AND APRIL 2018, RESPECTIVELY (SEE THE DESCRIPTION OF THE  DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM IN THE NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SECTION BELOW). REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI  X SURGICAL SYSTEM MAY BE RECEIVED IN OTHER MARKETS OVER TIME.  THE JAPANESE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LABOR, AND WELFARE (\u201cMHLW\u201d) CONSIDERS REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES IN APRIL OF EVEN-NUMBERED YEARS. THE PROCESS FOR OBTAINING REIMBURSEMENT REQUIRES JAPANESE UNIVERSITY HOSPITALS AND SURGICAL SOCIETIES, WITH OUR SUPPORT, TO SEEK REIMBURSEMENT. THERE ARE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PROCEDURES, INCLUDING THOSE THAT REQUIRE IN-COUNTRY CLINICAL DATA/ECONOMIC DATA. IN APRIL 2012 AND APRIL 2016, THE MHLW GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS FOR DA VINCI PROSTATECTOMY (\u201cDVP\u201d) AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, RESPECTIVELY. MOST PROSTATECTOMIES AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMIES WERE OPEN PROCEDURES PRIOR TO DA VINCI REIMBURSEMENT. DA VINCI PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY PROCEDURES ARE HIGHER THAN OPEN PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS. AN ADDITIONAL 12 DA VINCI PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, LOW ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND WILL BE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL, LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE 12 PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURES. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECALLS AND CORRECTIONS  MEDICAL DEVICE COMPANIES HAVE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS TO CORRECT OR REMOVE MEDICAL DEVICES IN THE FIELD THAT COULD POSE A RISK TO HEALTH. THE DEFINITION OF \u201cRECALLS AND CORRECTIONS\u201d IS EXPANSIVE AND INCLUDES REPAIR, REPLACEMENT, INSPECTIONS, RELABELING, AND ISSUANCE OF NEW OR ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OR REINFORCEMENT OF EXISTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND TRAINING WHEN SUCH ACTIONS ARE TAKEN FOR SPECIFIC REASONS OF SAFETY OR COMPLIANCE. THESE FIELD ACTIONS REQUIRE STRINGENT DOCUMENTATION, REPORTING, AND MONITORING WORLDWIDE. THERE ARE OTHER ACTIONS THAT A MEDICAL DEVICE MANUFACTURER MAY TAKE IN THE FIELD WITHOUT REPORTING INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ROUTINE SERVICING AND STOCK ROTATIONS.  AS WE DETERMINE WHETHER A FIELD ACTION IS REPORTABLE IN ANY REGULATORY JURISDICTION, WE PREPARE AND SUBMIT NOTIFICATIONS TO THE APPROPRIATE REGULATORY AGENCY FOR THE PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. REGULATORS CAN REQUIRE THE EXPANSION, RECLASSIFICATION, OR CHANGE IN SCOPE AND LANGUAGE OF THE FIELD ACTION. IN GENERAL, UPON SUBMITTING REQUIRED NOTIFICATIONS TO REGULATORS REGARDING A FIELD ACTION THAT IS A RECALL OR CORRECTION, WE WILL NOTIFY CUSTOMERS REGARDING THE FIELD ACTION, PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED IN THEIR NATIONAL LANGUAGE, AND ARRANGE, AS REQUIRED, RETURN OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED PRODUCT OR A FIELD SERVICE VISIT TO PERFORM THE CORRECTION.  FIELD ACTIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN OUTCOMES FROM REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CAN RESULT IN ADVERSE EFFECTS ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, DELAYS BY CUSTOMERS OF PURCHASE DECISIONS, REDUCTION OR STOPPAGE OF THE USE OF INSTALLED SYSTEMS, AND REDUCED REVENUE AS WELL AS INCREASED EXPENSES.  PROCEDURES  WE MODEL PATIENT VALUE AS EQUAL TO  PROCEDURE EFFICACY / INVASIVENESS  . IN THIS EQUATION,  PROCEDURE EFFICACY  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF THE SUCCESS OF THE SURGERY IN RESOLVING THE UNDERLYING DISEASE AND  INVASIVENESS  IS DEFINED AS A MEASURE OF PATIENT PAIN AND DISRUPTION OF REGULAR ACTIVITIES. WHEN THE PATIENT VALUE OF A DA VINCI PROCEDURE IS GREATER THAN THAT OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS, PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM SEEKING OUT SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS THAT OFFER DA VINCI SURGERY, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A LOCAL MARKET SHARE SHIFT. ADOPTION OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES OCCURS PROCEDURE BY PROCEDURE AND MARKET BY MARKET AND IS DRIVEN BY THE RELATIVE PATIENT VALUE AND TOTAL TREATMENT COSTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES AS COMPARED TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE SAME DISEASE STATE OR CONDITION.  WORLDWIDE PROCEDURES  OUR DA VINCI SYSTEMS AND INSTRUMENTS ARE REGULATED INDEPENDENTLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND REGIONS OF THE WORLD. THE DISCUSSION OF INDICATIONS FOR USE AND REPRESENTATIVE OR TARGET PROCEDURES IS INTENDED SOLELY TO PROVIDE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE MARKET FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND IS NOT INTENDED TO PROMOTE FOR SALE OR USE ANY INTUITIVE SURGICAL PRODUCT OUTSIDE OF ITS LICENSED OR CLEARED LABELING AND INDICATIONS FOR USE.  THE ADOPTION OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED SURGERY USING THE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO GROW FOR THOSE PROCEDURES THAT OFFER GREATER PATIENT VALUE THAN NON-DA VINCI ALTERNATIVES AND COMPETITIVE TOTAL ECONOMICS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OUR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS ARE USED PRIMARILY IN GENERAL SURGERY, GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY, UROLOGIC SURGERY, CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, AND HEAD AND NECK SURGERY. WE FOCUS OUR ORGANIZATION AND INVESTMENTS ON DEVELOPING, MARKETING, AND TRAINING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR PROCEDURES IN WHICH DA VINCI CAN BRING PATIENT VALUE RELATIVE TO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS AND/OR ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GENERAL SURGERY INCLUDE HERNIA REPAIR (BOTH VENTRAL AND INGUINAL) AND COLORECTAL PROCEDURES. TARGET PROCEDURES IN GYNECOLOGY INCLUDE DA VINCI HYSTERECTOMY (\u201cDVH\u201d), FOR BOTH CANCER AND BENIGN CONDITIONS, AND SACROCOLPOPEXY. TARGET PROCEDURES IN UROLOGY INCLUDE DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY. IN CARDIOTHORACIC SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE DA VINCI LOBECTOMY AND DA VINCI  MITRAL VALVE REPAIR. IN HEAD AND NECK SURGERY, TARGET PROCEDURES INCLUDE CERTAIN PROCEDURES RESECTING BENIGN AND MALIGNANT TUMORS CLASSIFIED AS T1 AND T2. NOT ALL THE INDICATIONS, PROCEDURES, OR PRODUCTS DESCRIBED MAY BE AVAILABLE IN A GIVEN COUNTRY OR REGION OR ON ALL GENERATIONS OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. SURGEONS AND THEIR PATIENTS NEED TO CONSULT THE PRODUCT LABELING IN THEIR SPECIFIC COUNTRY AND FOR EACH PRODUCT IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CLEARED USES, AS WELL AS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS, RESTRICTIONS, OR CONTRAINDICATIONS.  IN 2018, APPROXIMATELY 1,037,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES WERE PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 877,000 AND 753,000 SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS IN 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH IN OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE VOLUME IN 2018 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES AND WORLDWIDE UROLOGIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. PROCEDURES  OVERALL U.S. PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 753,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 644,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 563,000 IN 2016. GENERAL SURGERY WAS OUR LARGEST AND FASTEST GROWING U.S. SPECIALTY IN 2018 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME THAT GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 325,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 246,000 IN 2017 AND 186,000 IN 2016. GYNECOLOGY WAS OUR SECOND LARGEST U.S. SURGICAL SPECIALTY IN 2018 WITH PROCEDURE VOLUME OF APPROXIMATELY 265,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH 252,000 IN 2017 AND 246,000 IN 2016. U.S. UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME WAS APPROXIMATELY 128,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 118,000 IN 2017 AND 109,000 IN 2016.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PROCEDURES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.  OVERALL OUS PROCEDURE VOLUME WITH DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 284,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 233,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 190,000 IN 2016. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN MOST OUS MARKETS WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY UROLOGY PROCEDURE VOLUME, WHICH GREW TO APPROXIMATELY 175,000 IN 2018, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 149,000 IN 2017 AND APPROXIMATELY 124,000 IN 2016. GENERAL SURGERY AND GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY PROCEDURES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH.  RECENT BUSINESS EVENTS AND TRENDS  PROCEDURES  OVERALL.  TOTAL DA VINCI PROCEDURES GREW APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 18% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 17% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CONSISTENT YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, MOST NOTABLY HERNIA REPAIR, CHOLECYSTECTOMY, COLORECTAL, AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. YEAR-TO-DATE U.S. PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN THORACIC PROCEDURES, AS WELL AS MODERATE GROWTH IN MORE MATURE UROLOGIC AND GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURE CATEGORIES.  PROCEDURE VOLUME OUS GREW APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. CONSISTENT YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN DVP PROCEDURES AND EARLIER STAGE GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY (PARTICULARLY COLORECTAL), GYNECOLOGY, KIDNEY CANCER, AND THORACIC PROCEDURES. WE BELIEVE GROWTH IN THESE GLOBAL MARKETS IS BEING DRIVEN BY INCREASED ACCEPTANCE AMONG SURGEONS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS, SUPPORTED BY EXPANDED GLOBAL EVIDENCE VALIDATING THE CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC VALUE OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES.  U.S. GENERAL SURGERY.  GROWTH IN GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES CONTINUED TO DRIVE THE MAJORITY OF INCREMENTAL PROCEDURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. INGUINAL AND VENTRAL HERNIA REPAIRS CONTRIBUTED THE MOST INCREMENTAL CASES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS THEY DID IN 2018 AND 2017. WE BELIEVE THAT GROWTH IN DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR REFLECTS IMPROVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES WITHIN CERTAIN PATIENT POPULATIONS AS WELL AS POTENTIAL COST BENEFITS RELATIVE TO CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS. WE BELIEVE HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURES REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY WITH THE POTENTIAL TO DRIVE GROWTH IN FUTURE PERIODS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN SURGICAL COMPLEXITY ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OF VARIOUS HERNIA PATIENT POPULATIONS AND VARYING SURGEON OPINION REGARDING OPTIMAL SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF AND TO WHAT EXTENT DA VINCI HERNIA REPAIR PROCEDURE VOLUME WILL GROW IN THE FUTURE. WE EXPECT A LARGE PORTION OF HERNIA REPAIRS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PERFORMED VIA DIFFERENT MODALITIES OF SURGERY.  ADOPTION OF DA VINCI FOR COLORECTAL PROCEDURES, WHICH INCLUDES SEVERAL UNDERLYING PROCEDURES, INCLUDING LOW ANTERIOR RESECTIONS FOR RECTAL CANCERS AND CERTAIN COLON PROCEDURES FOR BENIGN AND CANCEROUS CONDITIONS, HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IS SUPPORTED BY OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE DA VINCI XI  SURGICAL SYSTEM, ENDOWRIST STAPLER, ENDOWRIST VESSEL SEALER, AND INTEGRATED TABLE MOTION.  IN RECENT QUARTERS, WE HAVE SEEN INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH FROM OTHER U.S. GENERAL SURGERY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING CHOLECYSTECTOMY AND BARIATRIC PROCEDURES. OUR THIRD QUARTER 2018 INTRODUCTION OF THE SUREFORM 60MM STAPLER PRODUCT PROVIDES SURGEONS A BETTER OPTIMIZED ROBOTIC TOOL SET FOR BARIATRIC PROCEDURES.  U.S. GYNECOLOGY  . GROWTH IN GYNECOLOGY PROCEDURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED MODESTLY COMPARED TO 2018, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN BENIGN HYSTERECTOMY PROCEDURES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, GROWTH IN HYSTERECTOMY FOR CANCER. COMBINING ROBOTIC, LAPAROSCOPIC, AND VAGINAL APPROACHES, MIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 80% OF THE U.S. HYSTERECTOMY MARKET FOR BENIGN CONDITIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROWTH IN GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAS PRIMARILY BEEN DRIVEN BY CONSOLIDATION OF GYNECOLOGIC PROCEDURES INTO HIGHER VOLUME SURGEONS THAT FOCUS ON CANCER AND COMPLEX SURGERIES.  GLOBAL UROLOGY.  GLOBAL UROLOGY PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR OVERALL PROCEDURE GROWTH. IN THE U.S., DVP IS THE STANDARD OF CARE FOR THE SURGICAL TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER, AND WE BELIEVE GROWTH IS LARGELY ALIGNED WITH SURGICAL VOLUMES OF PROSTATE CANCER. FOR OUS, DVP IS AT VARIOUS STAGES OF ADOPTION IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE WORLD BUT IS THE LARGEST OVERALL DA VINCI PROCEDURE. YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 GROWTH IN OUS DVP WAS CONSISTENT WITH GROWTH IN 2018.  KIDNEY CANCER PROCEDURES HAVE ALSO BEEN A STRONG CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR RECENT GLOBAL UROLOGY GROWTH. CLINICAL PUBLICATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE USE OF A DA VINCI SYSTEM INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PATIENT WILL RECEIVE NEPHRON SPARING SURGERY THROUGH A PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, WHICH IS TYPICALLY SURGICAL SOCIETY GUIDELINE-RECOMMENDED THERAPY.  OUS PROCEDURES.  YEAR-TO-DATE 2019 OUS PROCEDURE GROWTH RATE REFLECTS CONTINUED DA VINCI ADOPTION IN EUROPEAN AND ASIAN MARKETS. IN 2018 AND THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA MODERATED, AS THE PREVIOUS SYSTEMS QUOTA EXPIRED AT THE END OF 2015 AND SYSTEMS INSTALLED IN CHINA ARE HIGHLY UTILIZED. IN OCTOBER 2018, THE CHINA NATIONAL HEALTH  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMMISSION ANNOUNCED A NEW QUOTA TO ALLOW THE SALE OF 154 NEW SURGICAL ROBOTS INTO CHINA THROUGH 2020, WHICH COULD INCLUDE DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, PROCEDURE GROWTH IN CHINA ACCELERATED, AS INITIAL SYSTEMS PLACED DURING THESE QUARTERS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL CAPACITY IN THE FIELD. THIS QUOTA APPLIES TO THE DA VINCI SI AND RECENTLY APPROVED XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS (REFER TO THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION IN THE \u201cCLEARANCES AND APPROVALS\u201d SECTION), AS WELL AS COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS WHEN AND IF CLEARED BY NMPA. SALES OF DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER THE QUOTA ARE UNCERTAIN, AS THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON PROVINCIAL ALLOCATION PROCESSES AND HOSPITALS COMPLETING A TENDER PROCESS AND RECEIVING ASSOCIATED APPROVALS. IN JAPAN, WE EXPERIENCED STRONG PROCEDURE GROWTH AFTER RECEIVING THE NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS FOR DVP AND PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY, IN 2012 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, AS ADOPTION FOR THESE PROCEDURES HAS PROGRESSED TOWARDS HIGHER LEVELS OF PENETRATION, GROWTH IN THESE TWO UROLOGIC PROCEDURES HAS MODERATED. A TOTAL OF 12 ADDITIONAL DA VINCI  PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED NATIONAL REIMBURSEMENT STATUS EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2018, INCLUDING GASTRECTOMY, ANTERIOR RESECTION, LOBECTOMY, AND HYSTERECTOMY, FOR BOTH MALIGNANT AND BENIGN CONDITIONS. PROCEDURE GROWTH IN JAPAN HAS ACCELERATED SINCE THE NEW PROCEDURES WERE GRANTED REIMBURSEMENT STATUS. HOWEVER, THESE ADDITIONAL 12 REIMBURSED PROCEDURES HAVE VARYING LEVELS OF CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION AND ARE REIMBURSED AT RATES EQUAL TO THE CONVENTIONAL LAPAROSCOPIC PROCEDURES. GIVEN THE REIMBURSEMENT LEVEL AND LAPAROSCOPIC PENETRATION FOR THESE PROCEDURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ADOPTION WILL OCCUR OR THAT THE ADOPTION PACE FOR THESE PROCEDURES WILL BE SIMILAR TO ANY OTHER DA VINCI PROCEDURE. IF THESE PROCEDURES ARE NOT ADOPTED AND WE ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADEQUATE PROCEDURE REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES, THEN THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN JAPAN COULD BE LIMITED.  SYSTEM DEMAND  FUTURE DEMAND FOR DA VINCI SURGICAL SYSTEMS WILL BE IMPACTED BY FACTORS INCLUDING HOSPITAL RESPONSE TO THE EVOLVING HEALTH CARE ENVIRONMENT UNDER THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION, PROCEDURE GROWTH RATES, HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION TRENDS, EVOLVING SYSTEM UTILIZATION AND POINT OF CARE DYNAMICS, CAPITAL REPLACEMENT TRENDS, ADDITIONAL REIMBURSEMENTS IN VARIOUS GLOBAL MARKETS, INCLUDING JAPAN, THE TIMING AROUND GOVERNMENTAL TENDERS AND AUTHORIZATIONS, INCLUDING CHINA, THE TIMING OF WHEN WE RECEIVE REGULATORY CLEARANCE IN OUR OTHER OUS MARKETS FOR OUR DA VINCI XI SURGICAL SYSTEM, DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, AND RELATED INSTRUMENTS, MARKET RESPONSE AS WELL AS OTHER ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS. MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR RECENTLY LAUNCHED DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM AND THE NATURE AND TIMING OF ADDITIONAL DA VINCI SP REGULATORY INDICATIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT FUTURE SYSTEM PLACEMENTS. DEMAND MAY ALSO BE IMPACTED BY ROBOTIC SURGERY COMPETITION, INCLUDING FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE INTRODUCED PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF ROBOTIC SURGERY OR HAVE MADE EXPLICIT STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR EFFORTS TO ENTER THE FIELD INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AVATERA MEDICAL GMBH; CMR SURGICAL LIMITED; JOHNSON & JOHNSON (INCLUDING THEIR RECENT ACQUISITION OF AURIS HEALTH, INC.); MEDICAROID INC.; MEDROBOTICS CORP.; MEDTRONIC PLC.; MEERECOMPANY INC.; OLYMPUS CORP.; SAMSUNG CORPORATION; SMART ROBOT TECHNOLOGY GROUP CO. LTD.; TITAN MEDICAL, INC.; TRANSENTERIX, INC.; VERB SURGICAL INC. (A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN JOHNSON & JOHNSON AND GOOGLE INC.); AND WEGO HOLDING CO., LTD.  MANY OF THE ABOVE FACTORS WILL ALSO IMPACT FUTURE DEMAND FOR OUR RECENTLY CLEARED ION SYSTEM, AS WE EXTEND OUR COMMERCIAL OFFERING INTO DIAGNOSTICS, ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, OUR ABILITY TO OPTIMIZE MANUFACTURING AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPETITION, CLINICAL DATA TO DEMONSTRATE VALUE, AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE.  NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS  SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP AND GRAY RELOAD.  IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD. SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP IS A SINGLE-USE, FULLY WRISTED STAPLING INSTRUMENT WITH A CURVED TIP INTENDED FOR RESECTION, TRANSECTION, AND/OR CREATION OF ANASTOMOSES. SUREFORM 45 GRAY RELOAD IS A NEW, SINGLE-USE CARTRIDGE THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE STAGGERED ROWS OF IMPLANTABLE STAPLES AND A STAINLESS STEEL KNIFE. THE SUREFORM 45 CURVED-TIP STAPLER AND GRAY RELOAD HAVE PARTICULAR UTILITY IN THORACIC PROCEDURES AND ROUND OUT OUR SUREFORM 45 PORTFOLIO, WHICH INCLUDES THE SUREFORM 45 STAPLER AND WHITE, BLUE, GREEN, AND BLACK RELOADS. NOT ALL RELOADS OR STAPLERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR USE ON ALL SYSTEMS OR IN ALL COUNTRIES.  DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS.  IN JUNE 2019, WE RECEIVED CE MARK CLEARANCE IN EUROPE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS, AN ENHANCED 3D ENDOSCOPE FOR USE WITH OUR DA VINCI X AND XI SURGICAL SYSTEMS. FOLLOWING THE CE MARK, IN JULY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS. THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS LEVERAGES NEW SENSOR TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW FOR INCREASED SHARPNESS AND COLOR ACCURACY. THE DA VINCI ENDOSCOPE PLUS IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE AND IS EXPECTED TO LAUNCH IN THE U.S. LATER IN 2019.  DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA.  IN JUNE 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA, A LIGHTWEIGHT, 2D CAMERA HEAD, WHICH CAN BE CONNECTED TO THIRD-PARTY LAPAROSCOPES. THIS ALLOWS THE LAPAROSCOPIC IMAGE TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE DA VINCI X/XI VISION CART TO ADDRESS ASPECTS OF DA VINCI PROCEDURES THAT MAY REQUIRE USE OF A LAPAROSCOPE, THUS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR REDUNDANT EQUIPMENT IN THE OPERATING ROOM AND INCREASING PROCEDURE EFFICIENCY. WE ARE INTRODUCING THE DA VINCI HANDHELD CAMERA IN A MEASURED FASHION IN 2019 WITH A BROAD LAUNCH EXPECTED IN EARLY 2020.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE ION ENDOLUMINAL SYSTEM, OUR NEW FLEXIBLE, ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED PLATFORM DESIGNED TO NAVIGATE THROUGH VERY SMALL LUNG AIRWAYS TO REACH PERIPHERAL NODULES FOR BIOPSIES. THE ION SYSTEM USES AN ULTRA-THIN ARTICULATING ROBOTIC CATHETER THAT CAN MOVE 180 DEGREES IN ALL DIRECTIONS. THE OUTER DIAMETER OF THE CATHETER IS 3.5MM, WHICH PHYSICIANS CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH SMALL AND TORTUOUS AIRWAYS TO REACH NODULES IN ANY AIRWAY SEGMENT WITHIN THE LUNG. THE ION SYSTEM\u2019S FLEXIBLE BIOPSY NEEDLE CAN ALSO PASS THROUGH VERY TIGHT BENDS VIA ION\u2019S CATHETER TO COLLECT TISSUE IN THE PERIPHERAL LUNG. THE CATHETER\u2019S 2MM WORKING CHANNEL CAN ALSO ACCOMMODATE OTHER BIOPSY TOOLS, SUCH AS BIOPSY FORCEPS OR CYTOLOGY BRUSHES, IF NECESSARY. WE ARE INTRODUCING ION IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND COLLECT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL DATA. WE HAVE SOLD 3 ION SYSTEMS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  IRIS.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR OUR IRIS AUGMENTED REALITY PRODUCT. IRIS IS A SERVICE THAT DELIVERS A 3D IMAGE OF THE PATIENT ANATOMY (INITIALLY TARGETING KIDNEYS) TO AID SURGEONS IN BOTH THE PRE- AND INTRA-OPERATIVE SETTINGS. WE ARE NOW IN THE EARLY STAGES OF AN IRIS PILOT STUDY IN THE FIELD AT A SMALL GROUP OF U.S. HOSPITALS TO GAIN INITIAL PRODUCT EXPERIENCE AND INSIGHTS.  DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM.  IN MAY 2018, WE OBTAINED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR UROLOGIC SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR  A SINGLE PORT APPROACH  . IN MARCH 2019, WE RECEIVED U.S. FDA CLEARANCE FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM FOR CERTAIN TRANSORAL PROCEDURES. THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM INCLUDES THREE, MULTI-JOINTED, WRISTED INSTRUMENTS AND THE FIRST DA VINCI FULLY WRISTED, 3DHD CAMERA. THE INSTRUMENTS AND THE CAMERA ALL EMERGE THROUGH A SINGLE CANNULA AND ARE TRIANGULATED AROUND THE TARGET ANATOMY TO AVOID EXTERNAL INSTRUMENT COLLISIONS THAT CAN OCCUR IN NARROW SURGICAL WORKSPACES. THE SYSTEM ENABLES FLEXIBLE PORT PLACEMENT AND BROAD INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RANGE OF MOTION (E.G., 360 DEGREES OF ANATOMICAL ACCESS) THROUGH THE SINGLE SP ARM. SURGEONS CONTROL THE FULLY ARTICULATING INSTRUMENTS AND THE CAMERA ON THE DA VINCI SP SYSTEM, WHICH USES THE SAME FOURTH GENERATION SURGEON CONSOLE AS THE DA VINCI X AND XI SYSTEMS. THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM PROVIDES SURGEONS WITH ROBOTIC-ASSISTED TECHNOLOGY DESIGNED FOR DEEP AND NARROW ACCESS TO TISSUE IN THE BODY. WE ANTICIPATE PURSUING FURTHER REGULATORY CLEARANCES FOR THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM, INCLUDING COLORECTAL APPLICATIONS, BROADENING THE APPLICABILITY OF THE SP PLATFORM OVER TIME. WE CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE THE DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEM IN A MEASURED FASHION WHILE WE OPTIMIZE TRAINING PATHWAYS AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN. WE HAVE PLACED 38 DA VINCI SP SURGICAL SYSTEMS WITH CUSTOMERS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  DA VINCI X SURGICAL SYSTEM.  IN MAY 2017, WE LAUNCHED A NEW DA VINCI MODEL, THE DA VINCI X, IN THE U.S. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM PROVIDES SURGEONS AND HOSPITALS WITH ACCESS TO SOME OF THE MOST ADVANCED FOURTH GENERATION DA VINCI SURGERY TECHNOLOGY AT A LOWER COST. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM USES THE SAME VISION CART AND SURGEON CONSOLE THAT ARE FOUND ON OUR FLAGSHIP PRODUCT, THE DA VINCI XI SYSTEM. FOR NEW CUSTOMERS, THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM PROVIDES A COST EFFECTIVE CAPITAL ENTRY POINT WHILE PROVIDING A PATHWAY FOR UPGRADING TO OTHER FOURTH GENERATION SYSTEMS. EXISTING CUSTOMERS MAY NEGOTIATE TO TRADE IN THEIR OLDER DA VINCI SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO STANDARDIZE THEIR ROBOTICS PROGRAMS ONTO THE FOURTH GENERATION PLATFORM, CHOOSING WHICH SYSTEM MODEL BY CONSIDERING CLINICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.  THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM ENABLES OPTIMIZED, FOCUSED-QUADRANT SURGERY, INCLUDING PROCEDURES LIKE PROSTATECTOMY, HERNIA REPAIR, AND BENIGN HYSTERECTOMY, AMONG OTHERS. THE SYSTEM FEATURES FLEXIBLE PORT PLACEMENT AND 3D DIGITAL OPTICS, WHILE INCORPORATING THE SAME ADVANCED INSTRUMENTS AND ACCESSORIES AS THE DA VINCI XI. THE DA VINCI X SYSTEM DRIVES OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES THROUGH SET-UP TECHNOLOGY THAT USES VOICE AND LASER GUIDANCE, DRAPE DESIGN THAT SIMPLIFIES SURGERY PREPARATIONS, AND A LIGHTWEIGHT, FULLY INTEGRATED ENDOSCOPE.

ON AUGUST 31, 2019, UPON THE SATISFACTION OF CLOSING CONDITIONS, WE ACQUIRED CONTROL OF THESE ASSETS AND OPERATIONS, WHICH COLLECTIVELY MET THE DEFINITION OF A BUSINESS. TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF $100.6 MILLION, AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE, CONSISTED OF AN INITIAL CASH PAYMENT OF $34.4 MILLION AND DEFERRED CASH PAYMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $66.2 MILLION. THE TIMING OF THE FUTURE PAYMENTS IS BASED UPON ACHIEVING CERTAIN INTEGRATION STEPS, WHICH OCCUR DURING 2019 AND 2020 AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED AROUND THE END OF 2020.  THE PROCESS TO MANUFACTURE ENDOSCOPES IS COMPLEX, AND WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT WE CAN SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE THE ENDOSCOPE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO RETAIN THE EMPLOYEES OF SCHO\u0308LLY OR ITS CURRENT SUPPLIERS. THE INTEGRATION PROCESS WILL BE COMPLEX AND INVOLVES THE INTEGRATION OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ACROSS MULTIPLE SITES GLOBALLY. THE INTEGRATION MAY REQUIRE EXPENSES AND TIME IN EXCESS OF EXPECTATIONS. INTEGRATING THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION WILL ALSO INVOLVE GETTING CERTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS AND RE-CERTIFICATION OF MANUFACTURING SITES. IF WE CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE OR MANUFACTURE ENDOSCOPES SUBSEQUENT TO THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION, IT MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 REFLECTED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $44.7 MILLION AND $124.0 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH $35.9 MILLION AND $98.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, AND SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 26% TO $135.9 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $107.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INCREASED BY 34% TO $400.7 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $298.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PERSONNEL-RELATED EXPENSES, INTANGIBLE ASSET CHARGES, AND OTHER PROJECT COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT A BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES (INCLUDING ION AND SP PLATFORM INVESTMENTS, INFORMATICS, ADVANCED INSTRUMENTATION, ADVANCED IMAGING, AND FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ROBOTICS).  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCLUDED WITHIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $26.6 MILLION AND $74.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $20.2 MILLION AND $54.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, INTANGIBLE ASSET CHARGES WERE $0.5 MILLION AND $21.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED WITH $1.5 MILLION AND $12.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FLUCTUATE WITH PROJECT TIMING. BASED UPON OUR BROADER SET OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND THE STAGE OF THE UNDERLYING PROJECTS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND ANTICIPATE THAT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $33.3 MILLION AND $93.6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH $21.9 MILLION AND $53.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER INTEREST EARNED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES AND HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $0.3 MILLION, OR 0.1% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $43.4 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WAS $51.4 MILLION, OR 4.8% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, COMPARED WITH $87.0 MILLION, OR 9.4% OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS OF 2018, WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TAX BENEFIT FROM THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR SWISS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (DISCUSSED BELOW).  IN AUGUST 2019, SWISS TAX REFORM WAS ENACTED, WHICH RESULTS IN A HIGHER STATUTORY TAX RATE FOR OUR SWISS ENTITY FOR YEARS AFTER 2019. UNDER U.S. GAAP, CHANGES IN TAX RATES AND TAX LAW ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERIOD OF ENACTMENT, AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED AT THE ENACTED TAX RATE. THE IMPACT OF THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF OUR SWISS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS A BENEFIT OF $51.3 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 12.9 AND 4.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, ALSO INCLUDED EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE EQUITY PLANS OF $28.8 MILLION AND $112.8 MILLION, WHICH REDUCED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 7.2 AND 10.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY AS THE AMOUNT OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS OR DEFICIENCIES FLUCTUATES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE VOLUME OF SHARE-BASED INSTRUMENTS SETTLED OR VESTED, AND THE VALUE ASSIGNED TO EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS UNDER U.S. GAAP.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF OUR INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE OUTCOME OF THESE AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN OUR TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  IN JULY 2015, A U.S. TAX COURT OPINION (THE \u201c2015 OPINION\u201d) WAS ISSUED INVOLVING AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY RELATED TO INTERCOMPANY CHARGES FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THE U.S. TAX COURT, WE WERE REQUIRED TO, AND DID, REFUND TO OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ELEMENT OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY CHARGES MADE IN PRIOR PERIODS. STARTING FROM 2015, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM INTERCOMPANY CHARGES. IN JUNE 2019, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE 2015 OPINION (THE \u201cNINTH CIRCUIT OPINION\u201d). SINCE THE NINTH CIRCUIT OPINION POTENTIALLY IS SUBJECT TO FURTHER JUDICIAL REVIEW, WE CONTINUE TO TREAT OUR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 2015 OPINION AND CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE THE RELATED TAX BENEFITS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED UPON OUR EVALUATION OF THE POSITION IN LIGHT OF THE PRESENT FACTS. IN THE EVENT OF A FINAL OPINION WHICH REVERSES THE 2015 OPINION, THERE MAY BE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE  THE COMPANY\u2019S MAJORITY-OWNED JOINT VENTURE (THE \u201cJOINT VENTURE\u201d) WITH SHANGHAI FOSUN PHARMACEUTICAL (GROUP) CO., LTD. (\u201cFOSUN PHARMA\u201d), A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN INTERNATIONAL LIMITED, WAS ESTABLISHED TO RESEARCH, DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND SELL ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THE JOINT VENTURE IS OWNED 60% BY US AND 40% BY FOSUN PHARMA. THE CATHETER-BASED TECHNOLOGY WILL INITIALLY TARGET EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF LUNG CANCER, ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED FORMS OF CANCER IN THE WORLD. DISTRIBUTION OF CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES IN CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY THE JOINT VENTURE, WHILE DISTRIBUTION OUTSIDE OF CHINA WILL BE CONDUCTED BY US. THE JOINT VENTURE IS LOCATED IN CHINA. IN JANUARY 2019, THE JOINT VENTURE ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND CERTAIN PERSONNEL, FROM CHINDEX AND ITS AFFILIATES, A SUBSIDIARY OF FOSUN PHARMA, AND BEGAN DIRECT OPERATIONS FOR DA VINCI PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN CHINA. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANIES HAVE CONTRIBUTED $55 MILLION OF UP TO $100 MILLION REQUIRED BY THE JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  WE DO NOT EXPECT THE JOINT VENTURE TO GENERATE REVENUE IN 2019 RELATED TO THE SALE OF ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE CAN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ROBOTIC-ASSISTED, CATHETER-BASED MEDICAL DEVICES OR THAT WE AND THE JOINT VENTURE WILL SUCCESSFULLY COMMERCIALIZE SUCH PRODUCTS. THERE CAN ALSO BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND ITS BUSINESS, THAT THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BECOME PROFITABLE, OR THAT THE ACQUIRED CHINDEX ASSETS WILL BE SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED AND THE EXPECTED BENEFITS WILL BE REALIZED.  NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $1.9 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $(0.7) MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT GAIN RELATED TO THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, WHICH REDUCED COSTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN JOINT VENTURE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $2.5 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASED NET LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE AND HIGHER COSTS TO RAMP UP OPERATIONS IN CHINA DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY IS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS AND BY THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PROGRAM. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS PLUS SHORT- AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED FROM $4.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, TO $5.4 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRIMARILY FROM CASH PROVIDED BY OUR OPERATIONS. CASH GENERATION IS ONE OF OUR FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTHS AND PROVIDES US WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY IN MEETING OUR OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING NEEDS.  SEE \u201cITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d ON OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, FOR DISCUSSION ON THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK AND MARKET RISK ON OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW DATA (UNAUDITED)  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AND 2018 (IN MILLIONS).  NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN)  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $1,045.5  $831.5  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (748.2)  (563.3)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (219.2)  92.6  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  (2.9)  (0.7)  NET INCREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH  $75.2  $360.1  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $1,045.5 MILLION EXCEEDED OUR NET INCOME OF $1,019.1 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  1.  OUR NET INCOME INCLUDED NON-CASH CHARGES: SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION OF $246.6 MILLION; DEPRECIATION EXPENSE OF $108.0 MILLION; AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $31.2 MILLION; AND AMORTIZATION OF CONTRACT ACQUISITION ASSETS OF $9.2 MILLION.  2.  THE NON-CASH CHARGES OUTLINED ABOVE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT RESULTED IN $353.7 MILLION OF CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES. OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS, DEFERRED REVENUE, AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES. INVENTORY, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF EQUIPMENT FROM INVENTORY TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, INCREASED BY $293.4 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO MORE SYSTEMS UNDER OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS AND BUILD-UP TO ADDRESS THE GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS AS WELL AS TO MITIGATE RISKS OF DISRUPTION THAT COULD ARISE FROM TRADE, SUPPLY, OR OTHER MATTERS. PREPAID EXPENSES AND OTHER ASSETS INCREASED BY $95.1 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PREPAID TAXES, DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS. OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES DECREASED BY $39.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL MATTER. ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS DECREASED BY $6.8 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENTS OF 2018 INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF THESE ITEMS ON CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $50.6 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF BILLINGS AND COLLECTIONS AND A $24.7 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INVENTORY BUILD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS (NET OF PROCEEDS FROM SALES AND MATURITIES OF INVESTMENTS) OF $432.8 MILLION, THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT OF $283.6 MILLION, AND THE SCHO\u0308LLY ACQUISITION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, OF $32.9 MILLION. WE INVEST PREDOMINANTLY IN HIGH QUALITY, FIXED INCOME SECURITIES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY, AT ANY TIME, CONTAIN INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, TAXABLE AND TAX-EXEMPT MUNICIPAL NOTES, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CASH DEPOSITS, AND MONEY MARKET FUNDS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF CASH USED IN THE REPURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY 0.6 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET FOR $269.5 MILLION AND $152.9 MILLION IN TAXES PAID ON BEHALF OF EMPLOYEES RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF VESTED EMPLOYEE EQUITY AWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $205.7 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  OUR BUSINESS IS NOT CAPITAL EQUIPMENT INTENSIVE. HOWEVER, WITH THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY AND FACILITIES AND IN MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION, CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS HAVE INCREASED. WE EXPECT THESE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO EXCEED $300 MILLION IN BOTH 2019 AND 2020. WE INTEND TO FUND THESE NEEDS WITH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS DEPEND ON NUMEROUS FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS, THE RESOURCES WE DEVOTE TO DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING OUR PRODUCTS, AND OTHER FACTORS. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO EXPAND PROCEDURE ADOPTION AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. WE HAVE MADE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, FACILITIES, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BASED UPON OUR BUSINESS MODEL, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH THROUGH CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT CASH, CASH  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, TOGETHER WITH INCOME TO BE DERIVED FROM THE SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, AND EXPENSES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO NEW OR MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THAT ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE, OR POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE, TO THE COMPANY.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "INTUITIVE SURGICAL INC", "CIK": 1035267, "Date": "2019-10-18T00:00:00", "Ticker": "ISRG", "Name": "Intuitive Surgical Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 3842.0, "Business": "CA", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 770416458.0, "key": "20191018ISRG", "labelr1": -0.6269315673289102, "labelr2": -4.7894082104140825, "labelr3": 0.7652823145123699, "labelr4": 1.5004167824395709, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.5548148, "prof1": 0.44518518, "return1&2": 1.0544636608970233, "return1&2&3": 1.046394036987219, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0306937652458157, "return2": 1.047894082104141, "return1": 1.0062693156732891, "return3": 0.9923471768548764, "return4": 0.9849958321756044, "1_day_return": -0.6269315673289144, "cumulative_return1": 0.02096786952325579, "cumulative_return1&2": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3": -0.0, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.0, "indexx": 2479, "dailyaveragereturn": 1.0007823615098979, "cumreturn1b": 0.6688611541041457, "cumreturn1c": 1.0027955431527262, "cumreturndow": 1.0226069113170646, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0095811984995915}, {"Unnamed: 0": 2483, "level_0": 2550, "index": 63446, "text": "ITEM 2.

WE COMPETE IN THE GLOBAL PAYMENTS INDUSTRY WITH CHARGE, CREDIT AND DEBIT CARD NETWORKS, ISSUERS AND ACQUIRERS, PAPER-BASED TRANSACTIONS (E.G., CASH AND CHECKS), BANK TRANSFER MODELS (E.G., WIRE TRANSFERS AND AUTOMATED CLEARING HOUSE (ACH)), AS WELL AS EVOLVING AND GROWING ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT AND FINANCING PROVIDERS. AS THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, WE FACE INCREASING COMPETITION FROM NON-TRADITIONAL PLAYERS THAT LEVERAGE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, BUSINESS MODELS AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE PAYMENT OR FINANCING SOLUTIONS.

WE PREPARE OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP). HOWEVER, CERTAIN INFORMATION INCLUDED WITHIN THIS FORM 10-Q CONSTITUTES NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR CALCULATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM THE CALCULATIONS OF SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES BY OTHER COMPANIES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BANK HOLDING COMPANY  AMERICAN EXPRESS IS A BANK HOLDING COMPANY UNDER THE BANK HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1956 AND THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (THE FEDERAL RESERVE) IS OUR PRIMARY FEDERAL REGULATOR. AS SUCH, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE\u2019S REGULATIONS, POLICIES AND MINIMUM CAPITAL STANDARDS.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  OUR RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECT SOLID PERFORMANCE, DEMONSTRATING BROAD BASED GROWTH ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN NEW SERVICES AND CARD MEMBER BENEFITS, NEW CARD ACQUISITIONS AND EXPANDING OUR MERCHANT NETWORK, WHILE RETURNING $1.8 BILLION OF CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  OUR WORLDWIDE BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 5 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR AND WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLINGS, WHICH COMPRISES 86% OF OUR TOTAL BILLINGS, GREW 6 PERCENT, LED BY CONSUMERS. THE US DOLLAR REMAINED STRONG, RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AGAINST MOST MAJOR CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE, RESULTING IN A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BILLINGS AND REVENUE GROWTH. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE (FX) RATES, WORLDWIDE PROPRIETARY BILLED BUSINESS INCREASED 7 PERCENT OVER THE PRIOR YEAR, WITH INTERNATIONAL PROPRIETARY BILLINGS GROWING 13 PERCENT.  1  THIS SPENDING IS OCCURRING AGAINST THE BACKDROP OF AN ECONOMY THAT IS GROWING AT A MORE MODEST PACE RELATIVE TO 2018. GNS BILLED BUSINESS DECLINED 6 PERCENT (2 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS) AS WE CONTINUE TO EXIT THE NETWORK BUSINESS IN EUROPE AND AUSTRALIA DUE TO CERTAIN REGULATORY CHANGES; EXCLUDING THE BILLINGS FROM THOSE GEOGRAPHIES, GNS BILLED BUSINESS GREW 3 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS.  1  REVENUES NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 8 PERCENT (9 PERCENT ON AN FX-ADJUSTED BASIS), DRIVEN BY A WELL-BALANCED MIX OF GROWTH ACROSS CARD MEMBER SPENDING, NET INTEREST INCOME AND CARD FEES.  1  THIS WAS THE NINTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER WITH FX-ADJUSTED REVENUE GROWTH OF 8 PERCENT OR BETTER, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  1  THE INCREASE IN CARD FEES REFLECTS OUR  APPROACH OF ENHANCING THE VALUE OF OUR PREMIUM PRODUCTS BY ADDING NEW BENEFITS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGHER ENGAGEMENT WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS. OUR NET INTEREST YIELD INCREASED 30 BASIS POINTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR, REFLECTING CONTINUED POSITIVE IMPACTS FROM MIX AND PRICING INITIATIVES.  CARD MEMBER LOANS GREW 8 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR, AS WE CONTINUED TO EXPAND OUR LENDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ACQUIRED NEW CARD MEMBERS. PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES INCREASED 8 PERCENT, REFLECTING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN NET WRITE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES.  SPENDING ON CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT (THE AGGREGATE OF REWARDS, CARD MEMBER SERVICES, AND MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES) INCREASED 11 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR WITH GROWTH ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. INCREASES IN REWARDS AND CARD MEMBER SERVICES REFLECTED THE GROWTH IN PROPRIETARY BILLINGS AND CONTINUED INVESTMENT AND USAGE ACROSS MANY OF OUR PREMIUM TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT CARD MEMBER SERVICES TO BE OUR FASTEST GROWING EXPENSE CATEGORY, AS IT INCLUDES THE COSTS OF MANY COMPONENTS OF OUR DIFFERENTIATED VALUE PROPOSITIONS THAT SUPPORT STRONG CARD MEMBER ACQUISITION AND ENGAGEMENT. MARKETING AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN OUR COBRAND PARTNERSHIPS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE RENEWAL OF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH DELTA AIR LINES EARLIER IN 2019, AND HIGHER CORPORATE CLIENT INCENTIVES.  WE CONTINUE TO SEE ATTRACTIVE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AND PLAN TO INVEST TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM IN ORDER TO DRIVE REVENUE GROWTH OVER THE MODERATE TO LONG TERM. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME HEADWINDS IN THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING FROM ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, REGULATION IN COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND INTENSE COMPETITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON DELIVERING DIFFERENTIATED VALUE TO OUR MERCHANTS, CARD MEMBERS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS AND DELIVERING APPROPRIATE RETURNS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  SEE \u201cCERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\u201d FOR INFORMATION ON CERTAIN MATTERS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  1  THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTED INFORMATION ASSUMES A CONSTANT EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE PERIODS BEING COMPARED FOR PURPOSES OF CURRENCY TRANSLATION INTO U.S. DOLLARS (I.E., ASSUMES THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES USED TO DETERMINE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD APPLY TO THE CORRESPONDING PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AGAINST WHICH SUCH RESULTS ARE BEING COMPARED). FX-ADJUSTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES CONSTITUTE NON-GAAP MEASURES.

THE INCREASE IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS ALSO DUE TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET WRITE-OFFS.  CARD MEMBER LOANS PROVISION FOR LOSSES INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DUE TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER NET WRITE-OFFS AND DELINQUENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECELERATION IN LOAN GROWTH WITHIN THE CONSUMER PORTFOLIO.

THE MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ULTIMATE REDEMPTION RATE FOR CURRENT PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AT BOTH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS 96 PERCENT (ROUNDED UP).  CARD MEMBER SERVICES EXPENSE INCREASED FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER USAGE OF TRAVEL-RELATED BENEFITS.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PAYROLL COSTS.  THE INCREASE IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION.  OTHER EXPENSES WERE FLAT FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD AND INCREASED FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD.  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS, OFFSET BY HIGHER UNREALIZED GAINS ON CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND LOWER FOREIGN EXCHANGE LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A LITIGATION-RELATED CHARGE, HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND LOWER UNREALIZED GAINS ON CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A PRIOR-YEAR LOSS ON A TRANSACTION INVOLVING THE OPERATIONS OF OUR PREPAID RELOADABLE AND GIFT CARD BUSINESS.

CAPITAL  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIOS AND THOSE OF OUR SIGNIFICANT BANK SUBSIDIARY, AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK (AENB) AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

FAILURE TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM CAPITAL LEVELS AT AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB COULD AFFECT OUR STATUS AS A FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANY AND CAUSE THE REGULATORY AGENCIES WITH OVERSIGHT OF AMERICAN EXPRESS OR AENB TO TAKE ACTIONS THAT COULD LIMIT OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF EQUITY CAPITAL HAS BEEN THE GENERATION OF NET INCOME. CAPITAL GENERATED THROUGH NET INCOME AND OTHER SOURCES, SUCH AS THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS BY EMPLOYEES, IS USED TO MAINTAIN A STRONG BALANCE SHEET, SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH AND ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS, WITH EXCESS AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PORTION OF GENERATED CAPITAL WE ALLOCATE TO SUPPORT ASSET GROWTH WILL BE GREATER GOING FORWARD THAN IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY DUE TO PROJECTED ASSET GROWTH.  WE MAINTAIN CERTAIN FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT CAPITAL ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES AS APPROPRIATE. FOR EXAMPLE, WE MAY INFUSE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL INTO SUBSIDIARIES TO MAINTAIN CAPITAL AT TARGETED LEVELS IN CONSIDERATION OF DEBT RATINGS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THESE INFUSED AMOUNTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPITAL PROFILE AND LIQUIDITY LEVELS AT THE AMERICAN EXPRESS PARENT COMPANY LEVEL.  THE FOLLOWING ARE DEFINITIONS FOR OUR REGULATORY RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIOS AND LEVERAGE RATIO, WHICH ARE CALCULATED AS PER STANDARD REGULATORY GUIDANCE.  RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS  \u2014 ASSETS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK ACCORDING TO A FORMULA USED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO CONFORM TO CAPITAL ADEQUACY GUIDELINES. ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE WEIGHTED FOR RISK, WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ITEMS CONVERTED TO BALANCE SHEET EQUIVALENTS, USING RISK CONVERSION FACTORS, BEFORE BEING ALLOCATED A RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHT. OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES COMPRISE A MINIMAL PART OF THE TOTAL RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS.  COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS COMMON EQUITY TIER 1 CAPITAL (CET1), DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. CET1 IS THE SUM OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY, ADJUSTED FOR INELIGIBLE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS AS FOLLOWS: NET UNREALIZED GAINS/LOSSES ON SECURITIES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AND NET UNREALIZED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT/LOSSES, ALL NET OF TAX.  TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS TIER 1 CAPITAL DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 1 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF CET1, OUR PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK AND THIRD-PARTY NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES. THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENT FOR THE TIER 1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO IS 1.5 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE MINIMUM FOR THE CET1 RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO. WE HAVE $1.6 BILLION OF PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO HELP ADDRESS A PORTION OF THE TIER 1 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS IN EXCESS OF COMMON EQUITY REQUIREMENTS.  TOTAL RISK-BASED CAPITAL RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED AS THE SUM OF TIER 1 CAPITAL AND TIER 2 CAPITAL, DIVIDED BY RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS. TIER 2 CAPITAL IS THE SUM OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND RECEIVABLE LOSSES (LIMITED TO 1.25 PERCENT OF RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS), MINORITY INTEREST THAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN TIER 1 CAPITAL AND $600 MILLION OF SUBORDINATED NOTES, ADJUSTED FOR CAPITAL HELD BY INSURANCE SUBSIDIARIES.  TIER 1 LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY OUR AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO  \u2014 CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TIER 1 CAPITAL BY TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE UNDER BASEL III. TOTAL LEVERAGE EXPOSURE REFLECTS AVERAGE TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS WITH ADJUSTMENTS FOR TIER 1 CAPITAL DEDUCTIONS, AVERAGE OFF-BALANCE SHEET DERIVATIVE EXPOSURES, AVERAGE SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL, AND AVERAGE CREDIT EQUIVALENTS OF CONDITIONALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY CANCELLABLE UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS.  IN DECEMBER 2018, FEDERAL BANKING REGULATORS ISSUED A FINAL RULE THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL THREE-YEAR PHASE-IN PERIOD FOR THE DAY-ONE ADVERSE REGULATORY CAPITAL EFFECTS UPON ADOPTING THE CURRENT EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (CECL) MODEL PURSUANT TO NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CREDIT LOSSES ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2020. THE FEDERAL RESERVE ALSO RELEASED A STATEMENT INDICATING THAT IT PLANS TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK FOR CALCULATING CREDIT LOSS ALLOWANCES ON LOANS IN SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTS THROUGH THE 2021 STRESS TEST CYCLE. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT CECL.  54  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE RETURN CAPITAL TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. THE SHARE REPURCHASES REDUCE COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING AND MORE THAN OFFSET THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SHARES AS PART OF EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS.  DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE RETURNED $1.8 BILLION AND $4.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS IN THE FORM OF COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF $0.3 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND SHARE REPURCHASES OF $1.5 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. WE REPURCHASED 12 MILLION COMMON SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $124.21 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. THESE DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE AMOUNTS COLLECTIVELY REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 101 PERCENT AND 84 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL GENERATED DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS, RESPECTIVELY.  IN ADDITION, DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE PAID $21 MILLION AND $61 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN DIVIDENDS ON NON-CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED SHARES OUTSTANDING.  FUNDING STRATEGY  OUR PRINCIPAL FUNDING OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN BROAD AND WELL-DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES TO ALLOW US TO MEET OUR MATURING OBLIGATIONS, COST-EFFECTIVELY FINANCE CURRENT AND FUTURE ASSET GROWTH IN OUR GLOBAL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN A STRONG LIQUIDITY PROFILE.  WE MEET OUR FUNDING NEEDS THROUGH A VARIETY OF SOURCES, INCLUDING DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTED DEPOSITS AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS, BORROWINGS THROUGH SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES AND A LONG-TERM COMMITTED BANK BORROWING FACILITY. WHILE WE DIVERSIFY OUR FUNDING SOURCES BY MAINTAINING SCALE AND RELEVANCE IN UNSECURED DEBT, ASSET SECURITIZATIONS AND DEPOSITS, WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE PERSONAL SAVINGS HIGH YIELD SAVINGS ACCOUNT PROGRAM WILL BECOME A LARGER PROPORTION OF OUR FUNDING OVER TIME.  SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT  WE HAD THE FOLLOWING CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018.  TABLE 18: SUMMARY OF CONSOLIDATED DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  (BILLIONS)  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  DECEMBER 31, 2018  SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS  $2.8  $3.1  LONG-TERM DEBT  58.5  58.4  TOTAL DEBT  61.3  61.5  CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  73.3  70.0  TOTAL DEBT AND CUSTOMER DEPOSITS  $134.6  $131.5  WE MAY REDEEM FROM TIME TO TIME CERTAIN DEBT SECURITIES WITHIN 31 DAYS PRIOR TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPTIONAL REDEMPTION PROVISIONS OF THOSE DEBT SECURITIES.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ISSUED (I) $2.0 BILLION OF ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT ACCOUNT MASTER TRUST (THE LENDING TRUST) CONSISTING OF $1.2 BILLION OF THREE-YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.0 PERCENT AND $800 MILLION OF TWO-YEAR CLASS A CERTIFICATES AT A FLOATING RATE OF 1-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 24 BASIS POINTS, AND (II) $1.5 BILLION OF FIVE-YEAR SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES FROM AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY AT A FIXED RATE OF 2.5 PERCENT.  OUR EQUITY CAPITAL AND FUNDING STRATEGIES ARE DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE AND STABLE UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS FROM THE MAJOR CREDIT RATING AGENCIES: MOODY\u2019S INVESTOR SERVICES (MOODY\u2019S), STANDARD & POOR\u2019S (S&P) AND FITCH RATINGS (FITCH). SUCH RATINGS HELP SUPPORT OUR ACCESS TO COST-EFFECTIVE UNSECURED FUNDING AS PART OF OUR OVERALL FUNDING STRATEGY. OUR ASSET SECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES ARE RATED SEPARATELY.  55  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TABLE 19: UNSECURED DEBT RATINGS  CREDIT AGENCY  AMERICAN EXPRESS ENTITY  SHORT-TERM RATINGS  LONG-TERM RATINGS  OUTLOOK  FITCH  ALL RATED ENTITIES  F1  A  STABLE  MOODY\u2019S  TRS  (A)  PRIME-1  A2  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION  PRIME-1  A2  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK  PRIME-1  A3  STABLE  MOODY'S  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  PRIME-2  A3  STABLE  S&P  TRS  (A)  N/A  A-  STABLE  S&P  AMERICAN EXPRESS CREDIT CORPORATION AND AMERICAN EXPRESS NATIONAL BANK  A-2  A-  STABLE  S&P  AMERICAN EXPRESS COMPANY  A-2  BBB+  STABLE  (A)  AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVEL RELATED SERVICES COMPANY, INC.  DOWNGRADES IN THE RATINGS OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT OR ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAM SECURITIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER FUNDING COSTS, AS WELL AS HIGHER FEES RELATED TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNUSED LINES OF CREDIT. DECLINES IN CREDIT RATINGS COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR BORROWING CAPACITY IN THE UNSECURED DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION CAPITAL MARKETS. WE BELIEVE OUR FUNDING MIX, INCLUDING THE PROPORTION OF U.S. RETAIL DEPOSITS INSURED BY THE FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION (FDIC) TO TOTAL FUNDING, SHOULD REDUCE THE IMPACT THAT CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADES WOULD HAVE ON OUR FUNDING CAPACITY AND COSTS.  LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT  OUR LIQUIDITY OBJECTIVE IS TO MAINTAIN ACCESS TO A DIVERSE SET OF ON- AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES. WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY SOURCES IN AMOUNTS SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR EXPECTED FUTURE FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS AND BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS FOR LIQUIDITY FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE NEW FUNDS UNDER OUR REGULAR FUNDING PROGRAMS DURING A SUBSTANTIAL WEAKENING IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  OUR LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  MAINTAINING DIVERSIFIED FUNDING SOURCES (REFER TO THE \u201cFUNDING STRATEGY\u201d SECTION FOR MORE DETAILS);  \u2022  MAINTAINING UNENCUMBERED LIQUID ASSETS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET LIQUIDITY SOURCES;  \u2022  PROJECTING CASH INFLOWS AND OUTFLOWS UNDER A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC AND MARKET SCENARIOS;  \u2022  ESTABLISHING CLEAR OBJECTIVES FOR LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS; AND  \u2022  INCORPORATING LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT AS APPROPRIATE INTO OUR CAPITAL ADEQUACY FRAMEWORK.  THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN CAN VARY OVER TIME, BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER THE DODD-FRANK WALL STREET REFORM AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND OTHER VARIOUS REGULATORY LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS THE LIQUIDITY COVERAGE RATIO (LCR), AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STRESS SCENARIOS REQUIRED UNDER OUR LIQUIDITY RISK POLICY. SEE \u201cFINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\u201d UNDER \"CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS\" FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE LCR.  THE INVESTMENT INCOME WE RECEIVE ON LIQUIDITY RESOURCES IS LESS THAN THE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SOURCES OF FUNDING FOR THESE BALANCES. THE NET INTEREST COSTS TO MAINTAIN THESE RESOURCES HAVE BEEN SUBSTANTIAL. THE LEVEL OF FUTURE NET INTEREST COSTS DEPENDS ON THE AMOUNT OF LIQUIDITY RESOURCES WE MAINTAIN AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR COST OF FUNDING THESE AMOUNTS AND THEIR INVESTMENT YIELDS.  SECURITIZED BORROWING CAPACITY  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY, WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JULY 15, 2022, WHICH GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $3.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA NOTES FROM THE AMERICAN EXPRESS ISSUANCE TRUST II (THE CHARGE TRUST). WE ALSO MAINTAINED A COMMITTED, REVOLVING, SECURED BORROWING FACILITY THAT GIVES US THE RIGHT TO SELL UP TO $2.0 BILLION FACE AMOUNT OF ELIGIBLE AAA CERTIFICATES FROM THE LENDING TRUST. ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE LENDING TRUST'S $2.0 BILLION FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2022. BOTH FACILITIES ARE USED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO FUND SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, AS WELL AS TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR CONTINGENT FUNDING RESOURCES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON EITHER FACILITY.  FEDERAL RESERVE DISCOUNT WINDOW  56  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS AN INSURED DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION, AENB MAY BORROW FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO, SUBJECT TO THE AMOUNT OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL THAT IT MAY PLEDGE. THE FEDERAL RESERVE HAS INDICATED THAT BOTH CREDIT AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES ARE A FORM OF QUALIFYING COLLATERAL FOR SECURED BORROWINGS MADE THROUGH THE DISCOUNT WINDOW. WHETHER SPECIFIC ASSETS WILL BE CONSIDERED QUALIFYING COLLATERAL AND THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE BORROWED AGAINST THE COLLATERAL, REMAIN AT THE DISCRETION OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE.  WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $75.1 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IN U.S. CREDIT CARD LOANS AND CHARGE CARD RECEIVABLES THAT COULD BE SOLD OVER TIME THROUGH OUR SECURITIZATION TRUSTS OR PLEDGED IN RETURN FOR SECURED BORROWINGS TO PROVIDE FURTHER LIQUIDITY, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO APPLICABLE MARKET CONDITIONS AND ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.  COMMITTED BANK CREDIT FACILITY  IN ADDITION TO THE SECURED BORROWING FACILITIES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAINTAINED A COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OF $3.5 BILLION. ON OCTOBER 15, 2019, WE EXTENDED THE $3.5 BILLION COMMITTED SYNDICATED BANK CREDIT FACILITY BY TWO YEARS TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 15, 2022. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN ON THIS FACILITY.  UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $301 BILLION OF UNUSED CREDIT OUTSTANDING AS PART OF ESTABLISHED LENDING PRODUCT AGREEMENTS. TOTAL UNUSED CREDIT DOES NOT REPRESENT POTENTIAL FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS, AS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THIS UNUSED CREDIT WILL LIKELY NOT BE DRAWN. OUR CHARGE CARD PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE NO PRE-SET LIMIT, AND THEREFORE ARE NOT REFLECTED IN UNUSED CREDIT AVAILABLE TO CARD MEMBERS.  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOW ACTIVITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30.  TABLE 20: CASH FLOWS  (BILLIONS)  2019  2018  TOTAL CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $10.4  $10.2  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (11.3)  (14.2)  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (1.9)  1.9  EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  0.3  0.1  NET DECREASE IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH  $(2.5)  $(2.0)  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE NET INCOME ADJUSTED FOR (I) NON-CASH ITEMS INCLUDED IN NET INCOME, SUCH AS PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, DEFERRED TAXES AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND (II) CHANGES IN THE BALANCES OF OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS DUE TO THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS. THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENT SECURITIES PORTFOLIO.  THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER GROWTH IN CARD MEMBER RECEIVABLES AND LOANS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DEPOSITS, LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, AS WELL AS DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A HIGHER LEVEL OF SHARE REPURCHASES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  57  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER MATTERS  CERTAIN LEGISLATIVE, REGULATORY AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND SUPERVISION IN JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD, AND THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE ARE SUBSTANTIAL. IN RECENT YEARS, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO RIGOROUS SCRUTINY, HIGH REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS, AN INCREASING RANGE OF NEW REGULATIONS, AND A STRINGENT AND UNPREDICTABLE ENFORCEMENT ENVIRONMENT.  GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES HAVE FOCUSED, AND WE BELIEVE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS, CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION ON REVIEWING COMPLIANCE BY FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRMS WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS. REVIEWS TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, AS WELL AS OUR OWN INTERNAL REVIEWS, HAVE RESULTED IN, AND ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO RESULT IN, CHANGES TO OUR PRACTICES, PRODUCTS AND PROCEDURES, RESTITUTION TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO REGULATORY OVERSIGHT, SUPERVISION AND EXAMINATION. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY ACTIONS AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE THE SUBJECT OF SUCH ACTIONS, INCLUDING GOVERNMENTAL INQUIRIES, INVESTIGATIONS, ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND THE IMPOSITION OF FINES OR CIVIL MONEY PENALTIES, IN THE EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE OR ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANCE WITH LAWS OR REGULATIONS.  FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH CERTAIN GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM, OR SERVED SUBPOENAS ON, US, SEEKING INFORMATION RELATING TO A SMALL, SPECIALIZED PART OF OUR BUSINESS, KNOWN AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS (FXIP), WHICH OFFERS CROSS-BORDER PAYMENTS SERVICES PRIMARILY TO SMALL AND MIDDLE MARKET BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN FIVE COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. IN PARTICULAR, WE RECEIVED INVESTIGATIVE SUBPOENAS FROM BOTH THE CIVIL AND CRIMINAL DIVISIONS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AS WELL AS INQUIRIES FROM THE FEDERAL RESERVE, THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC), THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU (CFPB), THE FDIC AND OTHERS.  FXIP ACCOUNTS FOR LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS UNRELATED TO OUR CARD BUSINESSES. RELATEDLY, OUR REVIEW OF FXIP\u2019S PRICING PRACTICES CONDUCTED WITH AN OUTSIDE LAW FIRM HAS CONCLUDED AND AS A RESULT, WE VOLUNTARILY PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY $1.5 MILLION OF REMEDIATION TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS COVERING A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD AND TOOK DISCIPLINARY ACTION WHERE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THIS MATTER WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS OR RESULTS.  PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (THE 2018 FORM 10-K) FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FEDERAL RESERVE RELEASED TWO PROPOSALS, ONE JOINTLY WITH THE OCC AND THE FDIC AND ONE ON ITS OWN, THAT WOULD TAILOR THE APPLICABLE CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS AND PRUDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR LARGE U.S. BANKING ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING AMERICAN EXPRESS AND AENB. THE PROPOSALS WERE FINALIZED BY THE FEDERAL RESERVE ON OCTOBER 10, 2019, WITH THE NEW RULES SET TO TAKE EFFECT 60 DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER.  THE FINAL RULES ASSIGN EACH U.S. BANK HOLDING COMPANY WITH $100 BILLION OR MORE IN TOTAL CONSOLIDATED ASSETS, AS WELL AS ITS BANK SUBSIDIARIES, TO ONE OF FOUR CATEGORIES BASED ON ITS STATUS AS A U.S. GLOBAL SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT BANKING ORGANIZATION AND FIVE RISK-BASED INDICATORS: (I) SIZE, (II) CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL ACTIVITY, (III) NON-BANK ASSETS, (IV) OFF-BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURE, AND (V) WEIGHTED SHORT-TERM WHOLESALE FUNDING. THE FEDERAL RESERVE INDICATED WHICH FIRMS WOULD FALL INTO EACH OF THE FOUR CATEGORIES BASED ON DATA FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WITH OUR COMPANY IN \u201cCATEGORY IV.\u201d AS A RESULT, WE REMAIN SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS OF FIRMS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND COMPLEXITY TO US AND WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO REQUIREMENTS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER AND MORE COMPLEX BANKS, INCLUDING (I) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE ADVANCED APPROACHES CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, (II) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEVERAGE RATIO, (III) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER, (IV) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO COMPANY-RUN STRESS TESTING REQUIREMENTS, (V) BECOMING SUBJECT TO SUPERVISORY STRESS TESTING ON AN EVERY-OTHER-YEAR BASIS RATHER THAN AN ANNUAL BASIS, (VI) NO LONGER BEING SUBJECT TO THE LCR OR THE PROPOSED NET STABLE FUNDING RATIO MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS; AND (VII) NO LONGER BEING REQUIRED TO MONITOR AND REPORT CERTAIN RISK-BASED INDICATORS.  58  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PAYMENTS REGULATION  LEGISLATORS AND REGULATORS IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE HAVE FOCUSED ON THE OPERATION OF CARD NETWORKS, INCLUDING THROUGH ANTITRUST ACTIONS, LEGISLATION AND REGULATIONS TO CHANGE CERTAIN PRACTICES OR PRICING OF CARD ISSUERS, MERCHANT ACQUIRERS AND PAYMENT NETWORKS, AND, IN SOME CASES, TO ESTABLISH BROAD AND ONGOING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT REGIMES FOR PAYMENT SYSTEMS.  THE EUROPEAN UNION, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON INTERCHANGE FEES (THAT IS, THE FEE PAID BY THE BANKCARD MERCHANT ACQUIRER TO THE CARD ISSUER IN PAYMENT NETWORKS LIKE VISA AND MASTERCARD), AS WELL AS THE RULES, CONTRACT TERMS AND PRACTICES GOVERNING MERCHANT CARD ACCEPTANCE. REGULATION AND OTHER GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS RELATING TO PRICING OR PRACTICES COULD AFFECT ALL NETWORKS DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, AS WELL AS ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMERS AND MERCHANTS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, REGULATION OF BANKCARD FEES HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AND MAY CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DISCOUNT REVENUE WE EARN, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON OUR DISCOUNT RATE FROM DECREASES IN COMPETITOR PRICING IN CONNECTION WITH CAPS ON INTERCHANGE FEES. IN SOME CASES, REGULATIONS ALSO EXTEND TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS, SUCH AS NETWORK AND COBRAND ARRANGEMENTS OR THE TERMS OF CARD ACCEPTANCE FOR MERCHANTS.  BROAD REGULATORY OVERSIGHT OVER PAYMENT SYSTEMS CAN ALSO INCLUDE, IN SOME CASES, REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL CARD NETWORKS TO LOCALIZE ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS, SUCH AS PROCESSING INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA STORAGE, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS AND DIMINISH THE VALUE OF OUR CLOSED LOOP.  FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESERVE BANK OF INDIA ISSUED A MANDATE REQUIRING PAYMENT SYSTEMS OPERATORS IN INDIA TO STORE CERTAIN PAYMENTS DATA LOCALLY. THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF PAYMENT SYSTEM REGULATORY REGIMES GENERALLY CONTINUE TO GROW AND MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY AND MAINTAIN AND EXTEND OUR GLOBAL NETWORK.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PAYMENTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  SURCHARGING  IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES, SUCH AS CERTAIN MEMBER STATES IN THE EU AND AUSTRALIA, MERCHANTS ARE PERMITTED BY LAW TO SURCHARGE CARD PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE LAWS OF A NUMBER OF STATES IN THE UNITED STATES THAT PROHIBIT SURCHARGING HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED IN LITIGATION BROUGHT BY MERCHANT GROUPS AND SOME SUCH LAWS HAVE BEEN OVERTURNED. SURCHARGING IS AN ADVERSE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF IT BECOMES WIDESPREAD, PARTICULARLY WHERE IT ONLY OR DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, OTHER STEERING PRACTICES THAT ARE PERMITTED BY REGULATION IN SOME COUNTRIES COULD ALSO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US IF THEY BECOME WIDESPREAD.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF SURCHARGING AND OTHER ACTIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION  IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR MARKETING, SALE AND SERVICING OF CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FEDERAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL LAWS ARE SUPERVISED AND EXAMINED BY THE CFPB, WHICH HAS BROAD RULEMAKING AND ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY OVER PROVIDERS OF CREDIT, SAVINGS AND PAYMENT SERVICES AND PRODUCTS AND AUTHORITY TO PREVENT \u201cUNFAIR, DECEPTIVE OR ABUSIVE\u201d ACTS OR PRACTICES. IN ADDITION, A NUMBER OF U.S. STATES HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER CREDIT PROTECTION, DISCLOSURE AND OTHER LAWS (IN CERTAIN CASES MORE STRINGENT THAN U.S. FEDERAL LAWS). U.S. FEDERAL LAW ALSO REGULATES ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES, WHICH ALONG WITH BANKRUPTCY AND DEBTOR RELIEF LAWS, CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT AMOUNTS OWED TO US OR SUBJECT US TO REGULATORY SCRUTINY.  ON MAY 7, 2019, THE CFPB ISSUED PROPOSED RULES THAT WOULD SET FORTH ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTION AGENCIES, WHICH WE USE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THIS PROPOSAL IS NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN FINAL RULES, IF ANY, BECOMING EFFECTIVE BEFORE 2021.  FOR MORE INFORMATION ON CONSUMER FINANCIAL PRODUCTS REGULATION, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  59  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANTITRUST LITIGATION  THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND CERTAIN STATES\u2019 ATTORNEYS GENERAL BROUGHT AN ACTION AGAINST US IN 2010 ALLEGING THAT THE PROVISIONS IN OUR CARD ACCEPTANCE AGREEMENTS WITH MERCHANTS THAT PROHIBIT MERCHANTS FROM ENGAGING IN VARIOUS ACTIONS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OUR CARD PRODUCTS VIOLATE THE U.S. ANTITRUST LAWS. ON JUNE 25, 2018, THE SUPREME COURT FOUND IN FAVOR OF AMERICAN EXPRESS IN THAT CASE. WE CONTINUE TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND SIMILAR ANTITRUST CLAIMS INITIATED BY MERCHANTS. SEE NOTE 7 TO THE \"CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\" FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THE CASES. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ACTIONS IMPAIRING THE CARD MEMBER EXPERIENCE, OR THE RESOLUTION OF ONE OR ANY COMBINATION OF THESE MERCHANT CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF AN ADVERSE DECISION IN THE MERCHANT LITIGATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTION OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY  REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY IN THE AREAS OF PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE WORLDWIDE. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN POLICIES THAT PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND SUPPORT AND ENABLE BUSINESS INNOVATION AND GROWTH. GLOBAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE US HAVE EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY RISK IN RECENT YEARS AND WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO BE THE TARGET OF INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS, INCLUDING COMPUTER VIRUSES, MALICIOUS OR DESTRUCTIVE CODE, RANSOMWARE, SOCIAL ENGINEERING ATTACKS (INCLUDING PHISHING, IMPERSONATION AND IDENTITY TAKEOVER ATTEMPTS), HACKING, WEBSITE DEFACEMENT, DENIAL-OF-SERVICE ATTACKS AND OTHER ATTACKS AND SIMILAR DISRUPTIONS FROM THE MISCONFIGURATION OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OR ACCESS TO COMPUTER SYSTEMS. FOR MORE INFORMATION ON PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION AND INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY REGULATION AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF A MAJOR INFORMATION OR CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND BUSINESS, PLEASE SEE THE \u201cSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\u201d AND \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d SECTIONS OF THE 2018 FORM 10-K.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  REFER TO THE RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS SECTION OF NOTE 1 TO THE \u201cCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  GLOSSARY OF SELECTED TERMINOLOGY  ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME  \u2014 A NON-GAAP MEASURE THAT REPRESENTS NET INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS (WHICH INCLUDES, ON A GAAP BASIS, INTEREST THAT IS DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE), EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME NOT ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOANS. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED NET INTEREST INCOME IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT REPRESENTS THE INTEREST EXPENSE AND INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CARD MEMBER LOAN PORTFOLIO AND IT IS A COMPONENT OF NET INTEREST YIELD ON AVERAGE CARD MEMBER LOANS.  ASSET SECURITIZATIONS  \u2014 ASSET SECURITIZATION INVOLVES THE TRANSFER AND SALE OF LOANS OR RECEIVABLES TO A SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY CREATED FOR THE SECURITIZATION ACTIVITY, TYPICALLY A TRUST.

GRAINGER, INC. (GRAINGER OR THE COMPANY) IS A BROAD LINE, BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS DISTRIBUTOR OF MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OPERATING (MRO) PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH OPERATIONS PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA, EUROPE AND JAPAN. MORE THAN 3.5 MILLION CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE RELY ON GRAINGER FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS SAFETY, GLOVES, LADDERS, MOTORS AND JANITORIAL SUPPLIES, ALONG WITH SERVICES LIKE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT. THESE CUSTOMERS REPRESENT A BROAD COLLECTION OF INDUSTRIES (SEE NOTE 3 IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (FINANCIAL STATEMENTS)). THEY PLACE ORDERS ONLINE, ON MOBILE DEVICES, THROUGH SALES REPRESENTATIVES, OVER THE PHONE AND AT LOCAL BRANCHES. APPROXIMATELY 5,000 SUPPLIERS PROVIDE GRAINGER WITH APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION PRODUCTS STOCKED IN GRAINGER'S DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (DCS) AND BRANCHES WORLDWIDE.  GRAINGER'S  TWO  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE THE U.S. AND CANADA (ACKLANDS - GRAINGER INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES). THESE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS REFLECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S HIGH-TOUCH SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES IN THOSE GEOGRAPHIES. OTHER BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, (ZORO IN THE U.S. AND MONOTARO IN JAPAN), AND SMALLER HIGH-TOUCH SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES IN EUROPE, ASIA AND MEXICO.  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT  GIVEN GRAINGER'S LARGE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS AND THE DIVERSE INDUSTRIES IT SERVES, SEVERAL ECONOMIC FACTORS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS TEND TO SHAPE GRAINGER\u2019S BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND PROVIDE GENERAL INSIGHT INTO PROJECTING GRAINGER'S GROWTH. GRAINGER\u2019S SALES IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.) AND CANADA TEND TO POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH BUSINESS INVESTMENT, BUSINESS INVENTORY, EXPORTS, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP). SALES IN CANADA ALSO TEND TO POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH OIL PRICES. THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES THESE ESTIMATED INDICATORS FOR 2019.  U.S.  CANADA  ESTIMATED 2018  FORECASTED 2019  ESTIMATED 2018  FORECASTED 2019  BUSINESS INVESTMENT  6.8%  1.6%  1.2%  (2.0)%  BUSINESS INVENTORY  1.8%  2.8%  \u2014  \u2014  EXPORTS  3.0%  (0.2)%  3.2%  2.6%  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION  3.9%  0.9%  3.1%  0.8%  GDP  2.9%  2.3%  1.9%  1.4%  OIL PRICES  \u2014  \u2014  $65/BARREL  $59/BARREL  SOURCE: GLOBAL INSIGHT U.S. (OCTOBER 2019), GLOBAL INSIGHT CANADA (SEPTEMBER 2019)  IN THE U.S., BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND EXPORTS ARE TWO MAJOR INDICATORS OF MRO SPENDING. PER THE GLOBAL INSIGHT OCTOBER  2019  FORECAST, BUSINESS INVENTORY IS FORECAST TO IMPROVE WHILE BUSINESS INVESTMENT, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION, EXPORTS AND GDP ARE FORECAST TO SOFTEN, AS A RESULT OF THE TRADE TENSIONS AND ASSOCIATED UNCERTAINTY AROUND TARIFF POLICY, SLOWING GLOBAL GROWTH AND A STRONG U.S. DOLLAR, DIMINISHING SUPPORT FROM FISCAL STIMULUS AND A DECLINE IN THE PACE OF INVENTORY ACCUMULATION.  PER THE GLOBAL INSIGHT SEPTEMBER  2019  FORECAST, CANADA'S BUSINESS INVESTMENT, EXPORTS, INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AND GDP ARE EXPECTED TO SLOW DUE TO ELEVATED GLOBAL TRADE UNCERTAINTIES, A REDUCTION IN SPENDING, DELAYED INVESTMENTS AND SLOWING GLOBAL OIL DEMAND.  OUTLOOK  EACH BUSINESS IN GRAINGER\u2019S PORTFOLIO HAS A SPECIFIC SET OF STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES FOCUSED ON CREATING UNIQUE VALUE FOR CUSTOMERS.  IN THE U.S. BUSINESS, GRAINGER IS FOCUSED ON GROWING MARKET SHARE THROUGH THE THREE PILLARS OF ITS STRATEGY: (I) BUILDING ADVANTAGED MRO SOLUTIONS, WHICH MEANS BEING ABLE TO GET CUSTOMERS THE EXACT PRODUCT THEY NEED TO SOLVE A PROBLEM QUICKLY; (II) OFFERING DIFFERENTIATED SALES AND SERVICES; GRAINGER HAS AN ADVANTAGE IN SERVING COMPLEX BUSINESSES AT THEIR PLACE OF BUSINESS THROUGH ITS DIRECT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND ONSITE SERVICES AND (III) DELIVERING UNPARALLELED CUSTOMER SERVICE; GRAINGER IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THE ABSOLUTE BEST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IN THE INDUSTRY THROUGH ITS EFFORT TO DELIVER FLAWLESSLY ON EVERY CUSTOMER TRANSACTION.  18  W.W.

ON A DAILY BASIS, NET SALES INCREASED 2.5%. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VOLUME INCREASES IN THE U.S. BUSINESS AND THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE CANADA BUSINESS AND CROMWELL IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (U.K.), WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER BUSINESSES. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, PRICE INFLATION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE WERE FLAT. SEE THE  SEGMENT ANALYSIS  BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO SEGMENT REVENUE.  GROSS PROFIT OF $1,099 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  INCREASED  $20 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018. THE GROSS PROFIT MARGIN OF  37.3%  DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  DECREASED  0.8  PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2018. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PRICING ADJUSTMENTS DURING THE YEAR WHICH RESULTED IN NEGATIVE PRICE COST SPREAD IN THE U.S. BUSINESS AND INCREASED NET SALES IN THE ENDLESS ASSORTMENT BUSINESSES, WHICH HAVE A LOWER GROSS PROFIT. SEE THE  SEGMENT ANALYSIS  BELOW FOR FURTHER DETAILS RELATED TO SEGMENT GROSS PROFIT.

AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, WHICH ARE ALL CONSIDERED NON-GAAP MEASURES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION TO ASSIST SHAREHOLDERS IN UNDERSTANDING FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ASSESSING PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AS THEY PROVIDE A BETTER BASELINE FOR ANALYZING THE ONGOING PERFORMANCE OF ITS BUSINESSES BY EXCLUDING ITEMS THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF CORE OPERATING RESULTS. BECAUSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE THESE MEASURES WITH OTHER COMPANIES' NON-GAAP MEASURES HAVING THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES.

OTHER EXPENSE, NET WAS  $16 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  , A DECREASE OF $2 MILLION, OR  16%  COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LOSSES FROM THE  COMPANY'S CLEAN ENERGY INVESTMENTS WHICH WERE CONCLUDED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2018.  INCOME TAXES OF $78 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  INCREASED $22 MILLION, OR  39%  COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018  . GRAINGER'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 24.2% AND 32.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE HIGHER TAX RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY CROMWELL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WHICH LOWERED REPORTED OPERATING EARNINGS AND WERE NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN BOTH PERIODS AS NOTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 24.2% AND 20.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS  20  W.W. GRAINGER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER TAX BENEFIT FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPANY'S CLEAN ENERGY TAX BENEFITS IN 2019 AS THE COMPANY CONCLUDED ITS INVESTMENT IN 2018.  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO W.W. GRAINGER, INC. OF $233 MILLION  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  INCREASED  $129 MILLION  OR  123%  COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018  .

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF  $4.25  IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  WAS UP  134%  VERSUS THE  $1.82  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET EARNINGS AND LOWER AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER TAXES DUE TO LOWER TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. EXCLUDING RESTRUCTURING, NET AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FROM BOTH PERIODS IN THE TABLE ABOVE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $4.26 IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  INCREASED 2% FROM $4.19 FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.

GRAINGER'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE 25.1% AND 24.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER TAX BENEFIT FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE ABSENCE OF THE COMPANY'S CLEAN ENERGY TAX BENEFITS IN 2019 AS THE COMPANY CONCLUDED ITS INVESTMENTS IN 2018.  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO W.W. GRAINGER, INC.

THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER NET EARNINGS AND FAVORABLE CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND HIGHER NET PAYMENTS RELATED TO EMPLOYEE VARIABLE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PAID UNDER ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLANS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $145 MILLION  AND $105 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER PROCEEDS FROM THE SALES OF ASSETS WHEN COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $875 MILLION  AND $437 MILLION  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER TREASURY STOCK REPURCHASES IN 2019 COMPARED TO 2018.  WORKING CAPITAL  INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS ARE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF WORKING CAPITAL AND FUNDS USED FOR GROWTH INITIATIVES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. GRAINGER'S WORKING CAPITAL IS NOT IMPACTED BY SIGNIFICANT SEASONALITY TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.  WORKING CAPITAL CONSISTS OF CURRENT ASSETS (LESS NON-OPERATING CASH) AND CURRENT LIABILITIES (LESS SHORT-TERM DEBT, CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LEASE LIABILITIES). WORKING CAPITAL AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WAS $2,059 MILLION  ,  AN INCREASE  OF $161 MILLION  WHEN COMPARED TO $1,898 MILLION  AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A DECREASE IN ACCRUED CONTRIBUTIONS TO EMPLOYEES PROFIT-SHARING PLANS DUE TO THE ANNUAL CASH CONTRIBUTION.  AT THESE DATES, THE RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS  2.6  AND  2.4  , RESPECTIVELY.  DEBT  GRAINGER MAINTAINS A DEBT RATIO AND LIQUIDITY POSITION THAT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY IN FUNDING WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS.  IN ADDITION TO INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, GRAINGER HAS VARIOUS SOURCES OF FINANCING AVAILABLE, INCLUDING BANK BORROWINGS UNDER LINES OF CREDIT. TOTAL DEBT, WHICH IS DEFINED AS TOTAL INTEREST-BEARING DEBT (SHORT-TERM, CURRENT MATURITIES AND LONG-TERM) AND LEASE LIABILITIES AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITALIZATION WAS  53.7%  AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , AND  51.5%  AT  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  26  W.W.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  BACKGROUND AND GENERAL  WE ARE A PRODUCER AND DISTRIBUTOR OF PREMIUM SPECIALTY ALLOYS, INCLUDING TITANIUM ALLOYS, POWDER METALS, STAINLESS STEELS, ALLOY STEELS, AND TOOL STEELS AS WELL AS DRILLING TOOLS. WE ARE A RECOGNIZED LEADER IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE SPECIALTY ALLOY-BASED MATERIALS AND PROCESS SOLUTIONS FOR CRITICAL APPLICATIONS IN THE AEROSPACE, DEFENSE, MEDICAL, TRANSPORTATION, ENERGY, INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER MARKETS. WE HAVE EVOLVED TO BECOME A PIONEER IN PREMIUM SPECIALTY ALLOYS, INCLUDING TITANIUM, NICKEL, AND COBALT, AS WELL AS ALLOYS SPECIFICALLY ENGINEERED FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING (\"AM\") PROCESSES AND SOFT MAGNETICS APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR AM CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE A COMPLETE \u201cEND-TO-END\u201d SOLUTION TO ACCELERATE MATERIALS INNOVATION AND STREAMLINE PARTS PRODUCTION. WE PRIMARILY PROCESS BASIC RAW MATERIALS SUCH AS NICKEL, COBALT, TITANIUM, MANGANESE, CHROMIUM, MOLYBDENUM, IRON SCRAP AND OTHER METAL ALLOYING ELEMENTS THROUGH VARIOUS MELTING, HOT FORMING AND COLD WORKING FACILITIES TO PRODUCE FINISHED PRODUCTS IN THE FORM OF BILLET, BAR, ROD, WIRE AND NARROW STRIP IN MANY SIZES AND FINISHES. WE ALSO PRODUCE CERTAIN METAL POWDERS AND PARTS. OUR SALES ARE DISTRIBUTED DIRECTLY FROM OUR PRODUCTION PLANTS AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORK AS WELL AS THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS. UNLIKE MANY OTHER SPECIALTY STEEL PRODUCERS, WE OPERATE OUR OWN WORLDWIDE NETWORK OF SERVICE AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS. THESE SERVICE CENTERS, LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, MEXICO, EUROPE AND ASIA ALLOW US TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH CUSTOMERS AND TO OFFER VARIOUS JUST-IN-TIME STOCKING PROGRAMS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS PART OF OUR OVERALL BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE HAVE AND CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT AND EXECUTE OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT COLLABORATIONS AIMED AT BROADENING OUR OFFERINGS TO THE MARKETPLACE. WE HAVE PARTICIPATED WITH OTHER COMPANIES TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL TERMS AND STRUCTURES OF SUCH OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPECT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THESE OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR DISCUSSIONS BELOW IN THIS ITEM 2 ARE BASED UPON THE MORE DETAILED DISCUSSIONS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS, OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION INCLUDED IN ITEM 7 OF OUR  2019  FORM 10-K. OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE FOCUS ON OUR RESULTS DURING OR AS OF THE  THREE  -MONTH PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  , AND TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE, ON MATERIAL CHANGES FROM INFORMATION DISCUSSED IN THE  2019  FORM 10-K AND OTHER IMPORTANT INTERVENING DEVELOPMENTS OR INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE REPORTED ON FORM 8-K. THESE DISCUSSIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE  2019  FORM 10-K FOR DETAILED BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND WITH ANY SUCH INTERVENING FORM 8-K.  IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL PRICES AND PRODUCT MIX  WE VALUE MOST OF OUR INVENTORY UTILIZING THE LAST-IN, FIRST-OUT (\"LIFO\") INVENTORY COSTING METHOD. UNDER THE LIFO INVENTORY COSTING METHOD, CHANGES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD EVEN THOUGH THESE MATERIALS MAY POTENTIALLY HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED AT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT VALUES DUE TO THE LENGTH OF TIME FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE RAW MATERIALS TO THE SALE OF THE PROCESSED FINISHED GOODS TO THE CUSTOMERS. IN A PERIOD OF RISING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, THE LIFO INVENTORY VALUATION NORMALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER COST OF SALES. CONVERSELY, IN A PERIOD OF DECREASING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, THE LIFO INVENTORY VALUATION NORMALLY RESULTS IN LOWER COST OF SALES.  THE VOLATILITY OF THE COSTS OF RAW MATERIALS HAS IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. WE, AND OTHERS IN OUR INDUSTRY, GENERALLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS COST INCREASES ON MAJOR RAW MATERIALS THROUGH TO OUR CUSTOMERS USING SURCHARGES THAT ARE STRUCTURED TO RECOVER INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL COSTS. GENERALLY, THE FORMULA USED TO CALCULATE A SURCHARGE IS BASED ON PUBLISHED PRICES OF THE RESPECTIVE RAW MATERIALS FOR THE PREVIOUS MONTH WHICH CORRELATES TO THE PRICES WE PAY FOR OUR RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF OUR SURCHARGES TO CUSTOMERS MAY BE CALCULATED USING A DIFFERENT SURCHARGE FORMULA OR MAY BE BASED ON THE RAW MATERIAL PRICES AT THE TIME OF ORDER, WHICH CREATES A LAG BETWEEN SURCHARGE REVENUE AND CORRESPONDING RAW MATERIAL COSTS RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES. THE SURCHARGE MECHANISM PROTECTS OUR NET INCOME ON SUCH SALES EXCEPT FOR THE LAG EFFECT DISCUSSED ABOVE. HOWEVER, SURCHARGES HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES AS DESCRIBED LATER IN THIS REPORT.  APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF OUR NET SALES ARE SALES TO CUSTOMERS UNDER FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS. FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE A RISK OF PROFIT MARGIN FLUCTUATIONS, PARTICULARLY WHEN RAW MATERIAL PRICES ARE VOLATILE. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FLUCTUATING PROFIT MARGINS ON THESE SALES, WE ENTER INTO COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE CERTAIN CRITICAL RAW MATERIALS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THE RELATED PRODUCTS SOLD. FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY INCLUDE CERTAIN ANNUAL PURCHASING COMMITMENTS AND CONSUMPTION SCHEDULES AGREED TO BY THE CUSTOMERS AT SELLING PRICES BASED ON RAW MATERIAL PRICES AT THE TIME THE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ESTABLISHED. IF A CUSTOMER FAILS TO MEET THE VOLUME COMMITMENTS (OR THE CONSUMPTION SCHEDULE DEVIATES FROM THE AGREED-UPON TERMS OF THE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS), THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO ABSORB THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ON A TEMPORARY BASIS. GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS/LOSS WHEN EARNINGS ARE IMPACTED BY THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. BECAUSE WE VALUE MOST OF OUR INVENTORY UNDER THE LIFO COSTING METHODOLOGY, CHANGES IN THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN COST OF SALES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD ATTEMPTING TO MATCH THE MOST RECENTLY INCURRED COSTS WITH REVENUES. GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) TOGETHER WITH THE ACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES WHEN THE UNDERLYING COMMODITIES ARE PURCHASED AND RECORDED IN INVENTORY. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF THE COMMODITIES, INCLUSIVE OF THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS, ARE HIGHER OR LOWER RELATIVE TO THE BEGINNING OF YEAR COSTS, OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD REFLECTS SUCH AMOUNTS. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAINS AND/OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS MAY NOT IMPACT THE SAME PERIOD THAT THE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, AND COMPARISONS OF GROSS PROFIT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD MAY BE IMPACTED. THESE FIRM PRICE SALES ARRANGEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS WE LOOK TO STRENGTHEN OUR LONG-TERM CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS BY EXPANDING, RENEWING AND IN CERTAIN CASES EXTENDING TO A LONGER-TERM, OUR CUSTOMER LONG-TERM ARRANGEMENTS.  WE PRODUCE HUNDREDS OF GRADES OF MATERIALS WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PRICING AND PROFIT LEVELS DEPENDING ON THE GRADE. IN ADDITION, OUR PRODUCT MIX WITHIN A PERIOD IS SUBJECT TO THE FLUCTUATING ORDER PATTERNS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS DECISIONS WE MAY MAKE ON PARTICIPATION IN CERTAIN PRODUCTS BASED ON AVAILABLE CAPACITY, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF CAPACITY COMMITMENTS WE MAY HAVE UNDER EXISTING CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS. WHILE WE EXPECT TO SEE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION FROM A MORE FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX IN OUR MARGIN PERFORMANCE OVER TIME, THE IMPACT BY PERIOD MAY FLUCTUATE AND PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS MAY VARY.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET PENSION EXPENSE  NET PENSION EXPENSE, AS WE DEFINE IT BELOW, INCLUDES THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS RELATED TO BOTH OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS ARE DETERMINED ANNUALLY BASED ON BEGINNING OF YEAR BALANCES AND ARE RECORDED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE FISCAL YEAR, UNLESS A SIGNIFICANT RE-MEASUREMENT EVENT OCCURS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THE TOTAL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS FOR FISCAL YEAR  2020  WILL BE $15.0 MILLION AS COMPARED WITH $11.4 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR  2019  .

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW  OUR FIRST QUARTER RESULTS REFLECT THE ONGOING MOMENTUM WE ARE DRIVING ACROSS OUR CORE BUSINESS AS WE GENERATED STRONG OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND DELIVERED OUR ELEVENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR SALES AND EARNINGS GROWTH. BACKLOG LEVELS INCREASED 26 PERCENT YEAR-OVER-YEAR WITH THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE AND MEDICAL END-USE MARKETS INCREASING BY 40 PERCENT AND 15 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.  IN THE MEDICAL END-USE MARKET, WE DELIVERED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH DUE TO EXPANDED DIRECT CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN FACILITY EXPANSIONS FOR OUR PREMIUM TITANIUM BAR PRODUCTS.  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO PROGRESS WITH OBTAINING THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS FOR OUR ATHENS FACILITY AND RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION IN THE CURRENT QUARTER. CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT LEVELS RELATED TO ATHENS QUALIFICATIONS REMAIN HIGH AND WE ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH OUR PARTNERS TO SECURE ADDITIONAL APPROVALS AND PROVIDE CRITICAL INCREMENTAL CAPACITY FOR THE INDUSTRY.  WE CONTINUE TO DRIVE OUR CORE BUSINESS FORWARD WITH STRONG COMMERCIAL EXECUTION AND CONTINUING MANUFACTURING IMPROVEMENTS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING A BALANCE BETWEEN NEAR-TERM EARNINGS GROWTH AND INVESTING FOR THE LONG-TERM. WE CONTINUE TO TAKE INNOVATIVE ACTION IN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH AREAS INCLUDING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND SOFT MAGNETICS TO ACCELERATE PROFITABLE REVENUE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THESE INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUSTAIN OUR POSITION AS A LEADING SOLUTIONS PROVIDER AND CRITICAL SUPPLY CHAIN PARTNER FOR OUR CUSTOMERS IN THE YEARS AND DECADES TO COME.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \u2014 THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  VS. THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE REPORTED NET INCOME OF  $41.2 MILLION  , OR  $0.85  PER DILUTED SHARE. THIS COMPARES WITH NET INCOME FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR EARLIER OF  $31.5 MILLION  , OR  $0.65  PER DILUTED SHARE. THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS REFLECT STRENGTHENING PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS COMBINED WITH OUR SOLUTIONS-FOCUSED APPROACH DRIVING INCREASED SALES IN OUR AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE AND MEDICAL END-USE MARKETS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WERE  $585.4 MILLION  , WHICH WAS A  2  PERCENT  INCREASE  OVER THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  7  PERCENT ON A  5  PERCENT  DECREASE  IN SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE REFLECT A FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS.  GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 6 PERCENT FROM THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO TO $200.5 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONGER DEMAND IN THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE END-USE MARKET IN EUROPE AND ASIA PACIFIC AND THE ENERGY END-USE MARKET IN EUROPE. A PORTION OF OUR SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RESULTED IN A $1.3 MILLION DECREASE IN SALES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . NET SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTED 34 PERCENT AND 33 PERCENT OF TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  SALES BY END-USE MARKETS  WE SELL TO CUSTOMERS ACROSS DIVERSIFIED END-USE MARKETS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE INCLUDES COMPARATIVE INFORMATION FOR OUR NET SALES, WHICH INCLUDES SURCHARGE REVENUE BY PRINCIPAL END-USE MARKETS.

EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  19  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO ON A  10  PERCENT  INCREASE  IN SHIPMENT VOLUME. THE RESULTS REFLECT STRONGER DEMAND IN ALMOST ALL AEROSPACE SUB-MARKETS DEMONSTRATING THE CONTINUED BENEFITS FROM OUR BROAD SOLUTIONS PORTFOLIO ACROSS MULTIPLE ATTRACTIVE SUB-MARKETS.  IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE STRONG DEMAND FOR OUR DEFENSE RELATED APPLICATIONS DRIVEN BY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS.  MEDICAL END-USE MARKET SALES  INCREASED  4  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $48.9 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  11  PERCENT ON  9  PERCENT  HIGHER  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR HIGH-VALUE MATERIALS USED IN ORTHOPEDIC, CARDIOLOGY AND DENTAL APPLICATIONS.  TRANSPORTATION END-USE MARKET SALES  DECREASED  1  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $40.0 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  INCREASED  5  PERCENT ON  FLAT  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT INCREASED SALES IN LIGHT VEHICLES AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS DRIVEN BY RICHER PRODUCT MIX FOCUSED ON SOLUTIONS SPECIFICALLY ENGINEERED FOR HIGH-TEMPERATURE AND HIGH-WEAR APPLICATIONS OFFSET BY IMPACTS OF ONGOING TRADE ACTIONS AND TARIFFS WHICH HAVE IMPACTED CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS.  SALES TO THE ENERGY END-USE MARKET OF $39.3 MILLION  REFLECT AN  11  PERCENT  DECREASE  FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  DECREASED  12  PERCENT FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECT DECREASES IN THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET DUE TO DECLINING MARKET ACTIVITY AND GROWING PRICING PRESSURES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE INTERNATIONAL POWER GENERATION SUB-MARKET.  INDUSTRIAL AND CONSUMER END-USE MARKET SALES  DECREASED  24  PERCENT FROM THE  FIRST  QUARTER A YEAR AGO TO $73.3 MILLION  . EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, SALES  DECREASED  19 PERCENT ON  28  PERCENT LOWER SHIPMENT VOLUME. THE RESULTS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF REDUCED DEMAND FOR MATERIALS USED IN SELECT INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS AS WELL AS OUR ONGOING PORTFOLIO RATIONALIZATION PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  GROSS PROFIT  OUR GROSS PROFIT IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER  INCREASED  23  PERCENT TO  $112.6 MILLION  , OR  19.2  PERCENT OF NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH  $91.7 MILLION  , OR  16.0  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SURCHARGE REVENUE, OUR ADJUSTED GROSS MARGIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER WAS  23.1 PERCENT  AS COMPARED TO  20.1 PERCENT  IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE CURRENT PERIOD RESULTS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASING MARGINS IN THE SAO SEGMENT AND FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX IN ALL END-USE MARKETS.  WHILE THE SURCHARGE GENERALLY PROTECTS THE ABSOLUTE GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, IT DOES HAVE A DILUTIVE EFFECT ON GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENT OF SALES. THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS A SUMMARY OF THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE SURCHARGE ON GROSS MARGIN FOR THE COMPARATIVE THREE MONTH PERIODS.

THE SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES REFLECT ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING INCLUDING EXPENSES OF LPW WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER A YEAR AGO.  OPERATING INCOME  OUR OPERATING INCOME IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER WAS $59.8 MILLION  OR  10.2  PERCENT OF NET SALES AS COMPARED WITH $45.0 MILLION  OR  7.9  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN WAS  12.3  PERCENT FOR THE MOST RECENT QUARTER AS COMPARED WITH  9.9  PERCENT A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  PRIMARILY REFLECT STRONGER PRODUCT MIX ACROSS ALL END-USE MARKETS AND IMPROVED MARGINS IN THE SAO SEGMENT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO.  THE FOLLOWING PRESENTS OUR OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING MARGIN, IN EACH CASE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF SURCHARGE REVENUE ON NET SALES. WE PRESENT AND DISCUSS THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES BECAUSE MANAGEMENT BELIEVES REMOVING THIS ITEM PROVIDES A MORE CONSISTENT AND MEANINGFUL BASIS FOR COMPARING ONGOING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.

THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS REFLECT THE IMPACT OF EXPENSE FROM PENSION EARNINGS, INTEREST AND DEFERRALS WHILE THE PRIOR YEAR RESULTS REFLECTED FAVORABLE MARKET RETURNS ON INVESTMENTS USED TO FUND COMPANY-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND INVESTMENTS HELD IN RABBI TRUSTS.  INCOME TAXES  INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER WAS  $12.9 MILLION  , OR  23.8 PERCENT  OF PRE-TAX INCOME COMPARED WITH  $8.8 MILLION  , OR  21.8  PERCENT OF PRE-TAX INCOME IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IS HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD DUE TO LOSSES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH NO TAX BENEFIT CAN BE RECORDED AS WELL AS A LOWER TAX BENEFIT FOR EMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  WE HAVE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: SAO AND PEP.

EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, NET SALES  INCREASED  9  PERCENT ON  4  PERCENT  LOWER  SHIPMENT VOLUME FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS PRIMARILY REFLECT THE IMPACT OF INCREASED SALES AND STRONGER PRODUCT MIX IN ALL END-USE MARKETS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SAME QUARTER.

EXCLUDING SURCHARGE REVENUE, NET SALES OF $107.9 MILLION  WERE  FLAT  FROM A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS REFLECT LOWER SALES IN OUR ENERGY END-USE MARKET, PRIMARILY IN THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET.  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE PEP SEGMENT WAS $2.0 MILLION  OR NEGATIVE  1.8  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE RECENT  FIRST  QUARTER, COMPARED WITH OPERATING INCOME OF $7.3 MILLION  OR  6.5  PERCENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO. THE RESULTS WERE IMPACTED BY OUR CONTINUING STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND DECREASED ACTIVITY IN THE NORTH AMERICAN OIL AND GAS SUB-MARKET.  LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE GENERATED CASH FROM OPERATIONS OF $0.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO $9.4 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. OUR FREE CASH FLOW, WHICH WE DEFINE UNDER \u201cNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\u201d BELOW, WAS NEGATIVE  $56.4 MILLION  AS COMPARED TO NEGATIVE  $41.7 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WORKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME LEVELS. THE FREE CASH FLOW RESULTS REFLECT WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENTS AND HIGHER CAPITAL SPENDING LEVELS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS WE CONTINUED TO INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN STRATEGIC GROWTH AREAS INCLUDING ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING AND SOFT MAGNETICS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR SAME PERIOD.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE WERE $47.5 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO $41.6 MILLION  FOR THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2020, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $170 MILLION.  DIVIDENDS DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  2018  WERE $9.7 MILLION  AND  $9.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE PAID AT THE SAME QUARTERLY RATE OF $0.20  PER SHARE OF COMMON STOCK IN BOTH PERIODS.  WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO MEET OUR NEEDS THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT OF WORKING CAPITAL AND THE AVAILABILITY OF OUTSIDE SOURCES OF FINANCING TO SUPPLEMENT INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS. WE GENERALLY TARGET MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $150 MILLION, CONSISTING OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ADDED TO AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS A REVOLVING CREDIT COMMITMENT OF  $400 MILLION  , WHICH EXPIRES IN MARCH 2022. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $5.9 MILLION  OF ISSUED LETTERS OF CREDIT AND  $77.6 MILLION  OF SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE BALANCE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT,  $316.5 MILLION  , REMAINS AVAILABLE TO US. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD TOTAL LIQUIDITY OF $341.1 MILLION, INCLUDING  $24.6 MILLION  OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE BORROWED UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DAILY BORROWING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS APPROXIMATELY $36.2 MILLION WITH DAILY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGING FROM $0.0 MILLION TO $73.2 MILLION DURING THE PERIOD.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $24.6 MILLION  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND AVAILABLE BORROWING CAPACITY OF  $316.5 MILLION  UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS OVER THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE MADE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS OF  $2.4 MILLION  TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO MAKE  $3.8 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION HELD AT VARIOUS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. OUR GLOBAL CASH DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES\u2019 CASH BALANCES, THE LOCATIONS OF OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY NEEDS, AND THE COST TO ACCESS INTERNATIONAL CASH BALANCES, AS NECESSARY. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY MAKE SHORT-TERM INTERCOMPANY BORROWINGS AGAINST OUR CASH HELD OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE ANY REQUIRED BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRE THE MAINTENANCE OF A MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO (3.50 TO 1.00 AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  ). THE INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS, FOR ANY PERIOD, THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION AND NON-CASH NET PENSION EXPENSE (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) TO CONSOLIDATED INTEREST EXPENSE FOR SUCH PERIOD. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO OF LESS THAN 55%. THE DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO IS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED INDEBTEDNESS, AS DEFINED THEREIN, TO CONSOLIDATED CAPITALIZATION, AS DEFINED THEREIN. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE COVENANTS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR ACTUAL RATIO PERFORMANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  .  COVENANT  COVENANT REQUIREMENT  ACTUAL RATIO  CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE  3.50 TO 1.00 (MINIMUM)  16.24 TO 1.00  CONSOLIDATED DEBT TO CAPITAL  55% (MAXIMUM)  28.5%  WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL AND RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN FUTURE PERIODS. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DO NOT COMPLY WITH THE COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THIS COULD REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY AND FLEXIBILITY DUE TO POTENTIAL RESTRICTIONS ON BORROWINGS AVAILABLE TO US UNLESS WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN WAIVERS OR MODIFICATIONS OF THE COVENANTS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT WE USE IN THIS REPORT.

IT IS MANAGEMENT\u2019S CURRENT INTENTION TO USE EXCESS CASH TO FUND INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSISTENT DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A U.S. GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OF, OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, CASH FLOWS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.  CONTINGENCIES  ENVIRONMENTAL  WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO POLLUTION, PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES AND OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH. ALTHOUGH COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY AFFECT THE COSTS OF OUR OPERATIONS, COMPLIANCE COSTS TO DATE HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL. WE HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES AT SOME OF OUR OWNED OPERATING FACILITIES AND HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED AS A PRP WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN THIRD PARTY SUPERFUND WASTE-DISPOSAL SITES AND OTHER THIRD PARTY-OWNED SITES. WE ACCRUE AMOUNTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS THAT REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE FUTURE COSTS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY DECREASED THE LIABILITY FOR A COMPANY-OWNED FORMER OPERATING SITE BY $0.2 MILLION  . THE LIABILITIES RECORDED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AT SUPERFUND SITES, OTHER THIRD PARTY-OWNED SITES AND CARPENTER-OWNED CURRENT OR FORMER OPERATING FACILITIES REMAINING AT  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  WERE  $15.9 MILLION  AND  $16.1 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE BEEN NOTIFIED THAT WE MAY BE A PRP WITH RESPECT TO OTHER SUPERFUND SITES AS TO WHICH NO PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST US. NEITHER THE EXACT AMOUNT OF REMEDIATION COSTS NOR THE FINAL METHOD OF THEIR ALLOCATION AMONG ALL DESIGNATED PRPS AT THESE SUPERFUND SITES HAVE BEEN DETERMINED. ACCORDINGLY, AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE EXPECTED COSTS FOR SUCH MATTERS. THE LIABILITY FOR FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED IS EVALUATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.  ESTIMATES OF THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUTURE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS ARE INHERENTLY IMPRECISE BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUING EVOLUTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND APPLICATION OF TECHNOLOGY, THE IDENTIFICATION OF CURRENTLY UNKNOWN REMEDIATION SITES AND THE ALLOCATION OF COSTS AMONG THE PRPS. BASED UPON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, SUCH FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OVER THE LONG-TERM.  HOWEVER, SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN A PARTICULAR FUTURE QUARTER OR YEAR.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER  WE ARE DEFENDING VARIOUS ROUTINE CLAIMS AND LEGAL ACTIONS THAT ARE INCIDENTAL TO OUR BUSINESS, AND THAT ARE COMMON TO OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO PRODUCT CLAIMS, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, PATENT INFRINGEMENT, EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, COMPLIANCE WITH DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS, PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS AND TAX ISSUES. LIKE MANY OTHER MANUFACTURING COMPANIES IN RECENT YEARS WE, FROM TIME TO TIME, HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN LAWSUITS ALLEGING PERSONAL INJURY AS A RESULT OF EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES IN THE WORKPLACE SUCH AS ASBESTOS. WE PROVIDE FOR COSTS RELATING TO THESE MATTERS WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THE EFFECT OF THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS ON OUR FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND LIQUIDITY CANNOT BE PREDICTED BECAUSE ANY SUCH EFFECT DEPENDS ON FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE AMOUNT AND TIMING (BOTH AS TO RECORDING FUTURE CHARGES TO OPERATIONS AND CASH EXPENDITURES) OF THE RESOLUTION OF SUCH MATTERS. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO DETERMINE THE OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE TOTAL LIABILITY FROM THESE MATTERS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT AN INCREASE IN THE SCOPE OF PENDING MATTERS OR THAT ANY FUTURE LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN A PARTICULAR FUTURE QUARTER OR YEAR.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  A SUMMARY OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS DISCUSSED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K ITEM 7. \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d, AND IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, OF THE NOTES TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 8 THERETO.  GOODWILL  GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED BUT INSTEAD IS AT LEAST ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, OR MORE FREQUENTLY IF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF GOODWILL MAY BE IMPAIRED. POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IS IDENTIFIED BY COMPARING THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AND THE USE OF MARKET MULTIPLES VALUATION TECHNIQUES. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, ANY IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS MEASURED BY COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT\u2019S GOODWILL TO ITS IMPLIED FAIR VALUE. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT TESTED REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO CASH FLOW FORECASTS, DISCOUNT RATES, TERMINAL VALUES AND INCOME TAX RATES. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO REVENUE GROWTH RATES. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EACH REPORTING UNIT\u2019S MARKETS, PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PRICING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS COST PERFORMANCE. THE DISCOUNT RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ARE ESTIMATED BASED ON A MARKET PARTICIPANT\u2019S PERSPECTIVE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. THE TERMINAL VALUE, WHICH REPRESENTS THE VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REPORTING UNIT BEYOND THE FORECAST PERIOD, IS ESTIMATED USING A PERPETUITY GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION. THE INCOME TAX RATES USED IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS REPRESENT ESTIMATES OF THE LONG-TERM STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATES FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT BASED ON THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE REPORTING UNITS OPERATE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD FIVE REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL RECORDED. GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SAO REPORTING UNIT IS TESTED AT THE SAO SEGMENT LEVEL AND REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF OUR TOTAL GOODWILL. ALL OTHER GOODWILL IS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PEP SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES FOUR REPORTING UNITS WITH GOODWILL RECORDED.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SAO REPORTING UNIT EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 32 PERCENT.  THE GOODWILL RECORDED RELATED TO THE SAO REPORTING UNIT AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $195.5 MILLION. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS FOR THE SAO REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE VOLUME, IMPROVE MIX, EXPAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR SAO\u2019S FAIR VALUE, WE USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST CAPITAL OF 10 PERCENT AND A TERMINAL GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION OF 3 PERCENT.  AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, THE FAIR VALUE OF CARPENTER POWDER PRODUCTS (\u201cPOWDERS\u201d) EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY 8 PERCENT. THE GOODWILL RECORDED RELATED TO POWDERS AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 WAS $22.0 MILLION. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ANALYSIS FOR THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO OUR ABILITY TO INCREASE VOLUME, IMPROVE MIX, EXPAND PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND IMPLEMENT OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE COSTS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.  FOR PURPOSES OF THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT'S FAIR VALUE, WE USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST CAPITAL OF 14.5 PERCENT AND A TERMINAL GROWTH RATE ASSUMPTION OF 3 PERCENT.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON JULY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY REORGANIZED CERTAIN BUSINESS UNITS WITHIN OUR PEP SEGMENT. THE LPW, CALRAM AND POWDER BUSINESSES IN ALABAMA AND WEST VIRGINIA WERE COMBINED TO CREATE THE CARPENTER ADDITIVE REPORTING UNIT. THE POWDERS REPORTING UNIT REMAINS BUT NOW EXCLUDES THE ALABAMA AND WEST VIRGINIA SITES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY PERFORMED AN INTERIM GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF JULY 1, 2019 FOR THE REPORTING UNITS IMPACTED BY THE REORGANIZATION NOTING THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE IN ALL INSTANCES.  THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. WE BASED OUR FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE BUT THAT ARE UNPREDICTABLE AND INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF FUTURE GROWTH RATES AND OPERATING MARGINS AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE OVERALL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR BUSINESS UNITS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR PURPOSES OF OUR GOODWILL AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSET TESTING AS OF THE TIME OF TESTING WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE. IF OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING BUSINESS PROJECTIONS, COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENTS OR ANTICIPATED GROWTH RATES ARE NOT CORRECT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD GOODWILL AND/OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS, WHETHER IN CONNECTION WITH OUR NEXT ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING OR EARLIER, IF AN INDICATOR OF AN IMPAIRMENT IS PRESENT BEFORE OUR NEXT ANNUAL EVALUATION.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THOSE STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM  10-Q. THE DISCUSSION MAY CONTAIN CERTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE THOSE THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL IN NATURE. AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THOSE SET FORTH UNDER \u201cRISK  FACTORS\u201d IN OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A SPECIALTY FINANCE COMPANY THAT INVESTS IN RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (\u201cRMBS\u201d) WHICH ARE ISSUED AND GUARANTEED BY A FEDERALLY CHARTERED CORPORATION OR AGENCY (\u201cAGENCY RMBS\u201d). OUR  INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOCUSES ON, AND OUR PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF, TWO CATEGORIES OF AGENCY RMBS: (I) TRADITIONAL PASS-THROUGH AGENCY RMBS, SUCH AS MORTGAGE PASS-THROUGH CERTIFICATES ISSUED BY FANNIE MAE, FREDDIE MAC OR GINNIE MAE (THE \u201cGSES\u201d) AND  COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS (\u201cCMOS\u201d) ISSUED BY THE GSES (\u201cPT RMBS\u201d) AND (II) STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS, SUCH AS INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cIOS\u201d), INVERSE INTEREST-ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cIIOS\u201d) AND PRINCIPAL ONLY SECURITIES (\u201cPOS\u201d), AMONG OTHER TYPES  OF STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS. WE WERE FORMED BY BIMINI IN AUGUST 2010, COMMENCED OPERATIONS ON NOVEMBER 24, 2010 AND COMPLETED OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (\u201cIPO\u201d) ON FEBRUARY 20, 2013.  WE ARE EXTERNALLY MANAGED BY BIMINI ADVISORS, AN INVESTMENT ADVISER  REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d).  OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVE IS TO PROVIDE ATTRACTIVE RISK-ADJUSTED TOTAL RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM THROUGH A COMBINATION OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION AND THE PAYMENT OF REGULAR MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS. WE INTEND  TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE BY INVESTING IN AND STRATEGICALLY ALLOCATING CAPITAL BETWEEN THE TWO CATEGORIES OF AGENCY RMBS DESCRIBED ABOVE. WE SEEK TO GENERATE INCOME FROM (I) THE NET INTEREST MARGIN ON OUR LEVERAGED PT RMBS PORTFOLIO AND THE LEVERAGED  PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO, AND (II) THE INTEREST INCOME WE GENERATE FROM THE UNLEVERAGED PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS PORTFOLIO. WE INTEND TO FUND OUR PT RMBS AND CERTAIN OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS THROUGH SHORT-TERM  BORROWINGS STRUCTURED AS REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. PT RMBS AND STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS TYPICALLY EXHIBIT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES. DECLINES IN THE VALUE OF ONE PORTFOLIO MAY BE OFFSET BY APPRECIATION IN THE OTHER.  THE PERCENTAGE OF CAPITAL THAT WE ALLOCATE TO OUR TWO AGENCY RMBS ASSET CATEGORIES WILL VARY AND WILL BE ACTIVELY MANAGED IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE LEVEL OF INCOME GENERATED BY THE COMBINED PORTFOLIOS, THE STABILITY OF THAT INCOME STREAM AND THE  STABILITY OF THE VALUE OF THE COMBINED PORTFOLIOS. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS STRATEGY WILL ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY, EARNINGS, BOOK VALUE STABILITY AND ASSET SELECTION OPPORTUNITIES IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENTS.  WE OPERATE SO AS TO QUALIFY TO BE TAXED AS A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (\u201cREIT\u201d) UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE OF 1986, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cCODE\u201d).  WE GENERALLY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL  INCOME TAX TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CURRENTLY DISTRIBUTE ALL OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME (AS DEFINED IN THE CODE) TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS AND MAINTAIN OUR REIT QUALIFICATION.  THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK TRADES ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE UNDER THE SYMBOL \u201cORC\u201d.  CAPITAL RAISING ACTIVITIES  ON AUGUST 2, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TWO SALES AGENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER  AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $125,000,000 OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AND PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ISSUED A  TOTAL OF 15,123,178 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $125.0 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $123.1 MILLION, NET OF COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  22  ON JULY 30, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT (THE \u201cUNDERWRITING AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. AND J.P. MORGAN  SECURITIES LLC, AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNDERWRITERS NAMED THEREIN, RELATING TO THE OFFER AND SALE OF 7,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE TO THE PUBLIC OF $6.55 PER SHARE. THE UNDERWRITERS PURCHASED THE SHARES PURSUANT TO THE  UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT AT A PRICE OF $6.3535 PER SHARE. THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING OF 7,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OCCURRED ON AUGUST 2, 2019, WITH NET PROCEEDS TO US OF APPROXIMATELY $44.2 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND  COMMISSIONS AND OTHER ESTIMATED OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  STOCK REPURCHASE AGREEMENT  ON JULY 29, 2015, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 2,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE TIMING, MANNER, PRICE AND AMOUNT OF ANY  REPURCHASES IS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY IN ITS DISCRETION AND IS SUBJECT TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, STOCK PRICE, APPLICABLE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  THE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR  AMOUNT OF COMMON STOCK AND THE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT THE COMPANY\u2019S DISCRETION WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE.  ON FEBRUARY 8, 2018, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN THE STOCK REPURCHASE  PROGRAM FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 4,522,822 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  THIS STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAS NO TERMINATION DATE.  FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 5,665,620 SHARES AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $40.3 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND FEES, FOR A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $7.11 PER SHARE.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 469,975 SHARES AT AN AGGREGATE COST OF APPROXIMATELY $3.0 MILLION,  INCLUDING COMMISSIONS AND FEES, FOR A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $6.43 PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE REMAINING AUTHORIZATION UNDER THE  REPURCHASE PROGRAM AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS 857,202 SHARES.  FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.  \u00b7  INTEREST RATE TRENDS;  \u00b7  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AGENCY RMBS YIELDS AND OUR FUNDING AND HEDGING COSTS;  \u00b7  COMPETITION FOR, AND SUPPLY OF, INVESTMENTS IN AGENCY RMBS;  \u00b7  ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION, THE FEDERAL RESERVE (THE \u201cFED\u201d), THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE (THE \u201cFOMC\u201d), THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCING AGENCY (THE \u201cFHFA\u201d)  AND THE U.S. TREASURY;  \u00b7  PREPAYMENT RATES ON MORTGAGES UNDERLYING OUR AGENCY RMBS AND CREDIT TRENDS INSOFAR AS THEY AFFECT PREPAYMENT RATES; AND  \u00b7  OTHER MARKET DEVELOPMENTS.  IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE.  \u00b7  OUR DEGREE OF LEVERAGE;  \u00b7  OUR ACCESS TO FUNDING AND BORROWING CAPACITY;  \u00b7  OUR BORROWING COSTS;  \u00b7  OUR HEDGING ACTIVITIES;  \u00b7  THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS; AND  \u00b7  THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY AS A REIT AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO QUALIFY FOR A REGISTRATION EXEMPTION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT.  23  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  DESCRIBED BELOW ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  NET INCOME (LOSS) SUMMARY  NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $5.7 MILLION, OR $0.10 PER SHARE. NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $18.0 MILLION, OR $0.34 PER SHARE.  NET LOSS FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $8.5 MILLION, OR $0.14 PER SHARE. NET LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $3.0 MILLION, OR $0.06 PER SHARE.  THE COMPONENTS OF NET INCOME (LOSS) FOR THE NINE AND THREE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, ALONG WITH THE CHANGES IN THOSE COMPONENTS ARE PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

SECURITIES HELD UNDER THE FAIR VALUE OPTION ARE RECORDED AT ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE RECORDED AS  UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES THROUGH THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE NOT DESIGNATED OUR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN HEDGE ACCOUNTING RELATIONSHIPS, BUT RATHER HOLD THEM FOR ECONOMIC HEDGING PURPOSES. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS  ARE PRESENTED IN A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN THE COMPANY\u2019S STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND NOT INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.  AS SUCH, FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INTEREST EXPENSE AND COST OF FUNDS ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FLUCTUATION IN VALUE OF THE  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  24  PRESENTING NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS ALLOWS MANAGEMENT TO: (I) ISOLATE THE NET INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER EXPENSES OF THE COMPANY OVER TIME, FREE OF ALL MARK-TO-MARKET  ADJUSTMENTS AND (II) ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FUNDING AND HEDGING STRATEGIES ON OUR CAPITAL ALLOCATION DECISIONS AND OUR ASSET ALLOCATION PERFORMANCE. OUR FUNDING AND HEDGING STRATEGIES, CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND ASSET SELECTION ARE INTEGRAL TO  OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY, AND THEREFORE CRITICAL TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PRESENTATION OF OUR NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS IS USEFUL TO INVESTORS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MEANS OF COMPARING OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO THOSE OF OUR PEERS WHO HAVE NOT ELECTED THE SAME ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. OUR PRESENTATION OF NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY-TITLED MEASURES OF OTHER COMPANIES,  WHO MAY USE DIFFERENT CALCULATIONS. AS A RESULT, NET EARNINGS EXCLUDING REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR OUR GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) AS A MEASURE OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR ANY MEASURE OF OUR  LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP.

ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME  WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SPECIFICALLY EURODOLLAR, FED FUNDS AND TREASURY NOTE (\u201cT-NOTE\u201d) FUTURES CONTRACTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND SWAPTIONS, TO HEDGE A PORTION OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ON  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN A RISING RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE HAVE NOT ELECTED TO DESIGNATE OUR DERIVATIVE HOLDINGS FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS  AND NOT INCLUDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. AS SUCH, FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, INTEREST EXPENSE AND COST OF FUNDS ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FLUCTUATION IN VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  25  FOR THE PURPOSE OF COMPUTING ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME AND RATIOS RELATING TO COST OF FUNDS MEASURES, GAAP INTEREST EXPENSE HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE REALIZED AND UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON  CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THE COMPANY USES, SPECIFICALLY EURODOLLAR, FED FUNDS AND U.S. TREASURY FUTURES, AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND SWAPTIONS, THAT PERTAIN TO EACH PERIOD PRESENTED. WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTING OUR INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  PERIODS PRESENTED BY THE GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WOULD NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THESE PERIODS. THE REASON IS THAT THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS MAY COVER PERIODS THAT EXTEND INTO THE FUTURE, NOT  JUST THE CURRENT PERIOD. ANY REALIZED OR UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE INSTRUMENTS REFLECT THE CHANGE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT CAUSED BY CHANGES IN UNDERLYING INTEREST RATES APPLICABLE TO THE TERM COVERED BY THE INSTRUMENT, NOT JUST THE  CURRENT PERIOD. FOR EACH PERIOD PRESENTED, WE HAVE COMBINED THE EFFECTS OF THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS IN PLACE FOR THE RESPECTIVE PERIOD WITH THE ACTUAL INTEREST EXPENSE INCURRED ON BORROWINGS TO REFLECT TOTAL ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE FOR  THE APPLICABLE PERIOD. INTEREST EXPENSE, INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PERIOD, IS REFERRED TO AS ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE. NET INTEREST INCOME, WHEN CALCULATED TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR THE PERIOD,  IS REFERRED TO AS ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME. THIS PRESENTATION INCLUDES GAINS OR LOSSES ON ALL CONTRACTS IN EFFECT DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD, COVERING THE CURRENT PERIOD AS WELL AS PERIODS IN THE FUTURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INFORMATION TO CONSIDER, IN ADDITION TO THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE  NON-GAAP MEASURES HELP MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND GAAP ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR CURRENT INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OR OPERATIONS. THE  UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PRESENTED IN OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TOTAL INTEREST RATE EXPENSE THAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY REALIZE. THIS IS BECAUSE AS INTEREST RATES MOVE UP OR DOWN IN  THE FUTURE, THE GAINS OR LOSSES WE ULTIMATELY REALIZE, AND WHICH WILL AFFECT OUR TOTAL INTEREST RATE EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS, MAY DIFFER FROM THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED AS OF THE REPORTING DATE.  OUR PRESENTATION OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGY HAS IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS. FIRST, OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS MAY CALCULATE ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE AND ECONOMIC NET INTEREST INCOME  DIFFERENTLY THAN THE WAY WE CALCULATE THEM. SECOND, WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THE CALCULATION OF THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR HEDGING STRATEGY DESCRIBED ABOVE HELPS TO PRESENT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND PERFORMANCE, IT MAY BE OF LIMITED USEFULNESS AS AN  ANALYTICAL TOOL. THEREFORE, THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED IN ISOLATION AND IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR INTEREST EXPENSE AND NET INTEREST INCOME COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE TABLES BELOW PRESENT A RECONCILIATION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE SHOWN FOR EACH PERIOD RELATIVE TO OUR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, AND THE INCOME STATEMENT LINE ITEM, GAINS (LOSSES) ON  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP FOR EACH QUARTER OF 2019 TO DATE AND 2018.

FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE GENERATED $67.0 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $117.6 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME FROM RMBS ASSETS OFFSET BY $50.6 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON  BORROWINGS.   THE $12.8 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS DUE TO THE $343.8 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE RMBS, COMBINED WITH A 7 BASIS POINT (\"BPS\") DECREASE IN THE YIELD ON AVERAGE RMBS.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, WE GENERATED $20.2 MILLION OF NET INTEREST INCOME, CONSISTING OF $39.1 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME FROM RMBS ASSETS OFFSET BY $18.9 MILLION OF INTEREST EXPENSE ON BORROWINGS.  THE  $3.1 MILLION DECREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS DUE TO A 43 BPS DECREASE IN THE YIELD ON AVERAGE RMBS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $72.3 MILLION INCREASE IN AVERAGE RMBS. THE $3.4 MILLION INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS DUE TO A 27 BPS INCREASE IN THE  AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS, COMBINED WITH A $185.9 MILLION INCREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS.

OUR AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS WAS 2.65% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO 1.93% FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN 2018. CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS A 72 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $293.7 MILLION DECREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE HIGHER COST OF FUNDS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, REFLECTS THE HIGHER SHORT-TERM RATES AS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $58.5 MILLION AND $54.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 36 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS  TO 2.43% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 2.07% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  THE REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF OUR BORROWINGS NOTED ABOVE.  WE HAD AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF $3,571.8 MILLION AND $3,385.8 MILLION AND TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE OF $22.3 MILLION AND $18.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018,  RESPECTIVELY. OUR AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS WAS 2.50% AND 2.23% FOR THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 27 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS AND A $185.9 MILLION INCREASE IN AVERAGE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  AS IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE HIGHER COST OF FUNDS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME  PERIOD IN 2018, REFLECTS HIGHER SHORT-TERM RATES.  29  OUR ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $21.1 MILLION AND $18.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS A 16 BPS INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS  TO 2.36% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 2.20% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE INCREASE IN ECONOMIC INTEREST EXPENSE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES  CHARGED FOR THOSE BORROWINGS.  SINCE ALL OF OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ARE SHORT-TERM, CHANGES IN MARKET RATES DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR INTEREST EXPENSE. OUR AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS CALCULATED ON A GAAP BASIS WAS 28 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE  ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND 32 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE SIX-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR AVERAGE ECONOMIC COST OF FUNDS WAS 14 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE ONE-MONTH LIBOR AND 18 BPS ABOVE THE AVERAGE SIX-MONTH LIBOR FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.

OUR  PRINCIPAL IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY INCLUDE CASH BALANCES, UNENCUMBERED ASSETS AND BORROWINGS UNDER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  OUR BORROWING CAPACITY WILL VARY OVER TIME AS THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INTEREST EARNING ASSETS VARIES.  OUR BALANCE SHEET  ALSO GENERATES LIQUIDITY ON AN ON-GOING BASIS THROUGH PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST WE RECEIVE ON OUR RMBS PORTFOLIO.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR (A) THE ACQUISITION OF  ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE SIZE AND NATURE OF OUR EXISTING RMBS PORTFOLIO, (B) THE REPAYMENTS ON BORROWINGS AND (C) THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED FOR OUR CONTINUED QUALIFICATION AS A REIT.  WE MAY ALSO GENERATE  LIQUIDITY FROM TIME TO TIME BY SELLING OUR EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS OR PRIVATE PLACEMENTS.  BECAUSE OUR PT RMBS PORTFOLIO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE HAVING DIFFICULTY CONVERTING OUR ASSETS TO CASH SHOULD OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS EVER EXCEED OUR  IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE SOURCES OF CASH.  OUR STRUCTURED RMBS PORTFOLIO ALSO CONSISTS ENTIRELY OF GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY SECURITIES, ALTHOUGH THEY TYPICALLY DO NOT TRADE WITH COMPARABLE BID / ASK SPREADS AS PT RMBS.  HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WOULD  BE ABLE TO LIQUIDATE SUCH SECURITIES READILY, EVEN IN DISTRESSED MARKETS, ALTHOUGH WE WOULD LIKELY DO SO AT PRICES BELOW WHERE SUCH SECURITIES COULD BE SOLD IN A MORE STABLE MARKET.  TO ENHANCE OUR LIQUIDITY EVEN FURTHER, WE MAY PLEDGE A PORTION OF  OUR STRUCTURED RMBS AS PART OF A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FUNDING, BUT RETAIN THE CASH IN LIEU OF ACQUIRING ADDITIONAL ASSETS.  IN THIS WAY WE CAN, AT A MODEST COST, RETAIN HIGHER LEVELS OF CASH ON HAND AND DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD WE WILL HAVE TO SELL  ASSETS IN A DISTRESSED MARKET IN ORDER TO RAISE CASH.  OUR STRATEGY FOR HEDGING OUR FUNDING COSTS TYPICALLY INVOLVES TAKING SHORT POSITIONS IN INTEREST RATE FUTURES, TREASURY FUTURES, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS. WHEN  THE MARKET CAUSES THESE SHORT POSITIONS TO DECLINE IN VALUE WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET MARGIN CALLS WITH CASH.  THIS CAN REDUCE OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION TO THE EXTENT OTHER SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO MOVE IN PRICE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE DO NOT RECEIVE  ENOUGH CASH VIA MARGIN CALLS TO OFFSET THE DERIVATIVE RELATED MARGIN CALLS. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR IN SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE, THE LOSS OF LIQUIDITY MIGHT FORCE US TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE LEVERED PORTFOLIO, PLEDGE ADDITIONAL STRUCTURED SECURITIES TO  RAISE FUNDS OR RISK OPERATING THE PORTFOLIO WITH LESS LIQUIDITY.  OUR MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE NO STATED EXPIRATION, BUT CAN BE TERMINATED AT ANY TIME AT OUR OPTION OR AT THE OPTION OF THE COUNTERPARTY. HOWEVER, ONCE A DEFINITIVE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT UNDER A  MASTER REPURCHASE AGREEMENT HAS BEEN ENTERED INTO, IT GENERALLY MAY NOT BE TERMINATED BY EITHER PARTY.  A NEGOTIATED TERMINATION CAN OCCUR, BUT MAY INVOLVE A FEE TO BE PAID BY THE PARTY SEEKING TO TERMINATE THE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTION.  UNDER OUR REPURCHASE AGREEMENT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE REQUIRED TO POST MARGIN AT THE INITIATION OF THE BORROWING.  THE MARGIN POSTED REPRESENTS THE HAIRCUT, WHICH IS A PERCENTAGE OF THE MARKET  VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED. TO THE EXTENT THE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET COLLATERALIZING THE FINANCING TRANSACTION DECLINES, THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR POSTED MARGIN WILL BE INSUFFICIENT AND WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL.  CONVERSELY, IF THE MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSET PLEDGED INCREASES IN VALUE, WE WOULD BE OVER COLLATERALIZED AND WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO HAVE EXCESS MARGIN RETURNED TO US BY THE COUNTERPARTY.  OUR LENDERS TYPICALLY VALUE OUR PLEDGED SECURITIES DAILY TO  ENSURE THE ADEQUACY OF OUR MARGIN AND MAKE MARGIN CALLS AS NEEDED, AS DO WE.  TYPICALLY, BUT NOT ALWAYS, THE PARTIES AGREE TO A MINIMUM THRESHOLD AMOUNT FOR MARGIN CALLS SO AS TO AVOID THE NEED FOR NUISANCE MARGIN CALLS ON A DAILY BASIS. OUR MASTER  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFY THE HAIRCUT; RATHER HAIRCUTS ARE DETERMINED ON AN INDIVIDUAL REPURCHASE TRANSACTION BASIS. THROUGHOUT THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, HAIRCUTS ON OUR PLEDGED COLLATERAL REMAINED STABLE AND AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE HAIRCUT WAS APPROXIMATELY 5.3% OF THE VALUE OF OUR COLLATERAL.  AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, WE INVEST A PORTION OF OUR CAPITAL IN STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS.  WE GENERALLY DO NOT APPLY LEVERAGE TO THIS PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  THE LEVERAGE INHERENT IN STRUCTURED SECURITIES  REPLACES THE LEVERAGE OBTAINED BY ACQUIRING PT SECURITIES AND FUNDING THEM IN THE REPURCHASE MARKET.  THIS STRUCTURED RMBS STRATEGY HAS BEEN A CORE ELEMENT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY SINCE INCEPTION.  HOWEVER, WE HAVE AND MAY  CONTINUE TO PLEDGE A PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED RMBS IN ORDER TO RAISE OUR CASH LEVELS, BUT GENERALLY WILL NOT PLEDGE THESE SECURITIES IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL ASSETS.  36  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE EFFECT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS FROM CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND INTEREST EXPENSE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  (IN THOUSANDS)  OBLIGATIONS MATURING  WITHIN ONE YEAR  ONE TO THREE YEARS  THREE TO FIVE YEARS  MORE THAN FIVE YEARS  TOTAL  REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  $3,813,977  $-  $-  $-  $3,813,977  INTEREST EXPENSE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS  (1)  20,500  -  -  -  20,500  TOTALS  $3,834,477  $-  $-  $-  $3,834,477  (1)  INTEREST EXPENSE ON REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IS BASED ON CURRENT INTEREST RATES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THAT DATE.  IN FUTURE PERIODS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR ACTIVITIES IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR CURRENT OPERATIONS THROUGH REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $147.4 MILLION.  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS OF $489.8 MILLION FROM PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUR RMBS AND HAD AVERAGE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS OUTSTANDING OF $3,205.3 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY  ON AUGUST 2, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO AN EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cAUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH TWO SALES AGENTS PURSUANT TO WHICH WE MAY OFFER  AND SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, UP TO AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $125,000,000 OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE \u201cAT THE MARKET\u201d OFFERINGS AND PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ISSUED A  TOTAL OF 15,351,877 SHARES UNDER THE AUGUST 2017 EQUITY DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT FOR AGGREGATE GROSS PROCEEDS OF $125.0 MILLION, AND NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $123.1 MILLION, NET OF COMMISSIONS AND FEES.  ON JULY 30, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AN UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT (THE \u201cUNDERWRITING AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC, CITIGROUP GLOBAL MARKETS INC. AND J.P. MORGAN  SECURITIES LLC, AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNDERWRITERS NAMED THEREIN, RELATING TO THE OFFER AND SALE OF 7,000,000 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE TO THE PUBLIC OF $6.55 PER SHARE. THE UNDERWRITERS PURCHASED THE SHARES PURSUANT TO THE  UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT AT A PRICE OF $6.3535 PER SHARE. THE CLOSING OF THE OFFERING OF 7,000,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OCCURRED ON AUGUST 2, 2019, WITH NET PROCEEDS TO US OF APPROXIMATELY $44.2 MILLION AFTER DEDUCTION OF UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND  COMMISSIONS AND OTHER ESTIMATED OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  OUTLOOK  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS A VERY VOLATILE PERIOD. AS 2018 CAME TO A CLOSE, THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF THE U.S. WAS QUITE STRONG AND THE FED WAS STILL REMOVING ACCOMMODATION FROM THE ECONOMY, RAISING  THE FEDERAL FUNDS (THE \u201cFED FUNDS\u201d) TARGET RANGE 25 BPS AT THEIR DECEMBER 2018 MEETING.  THE TRAJECTORY OF THE ECONOMY AND FED MONETARY POLICY HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE.  THE FED LOWERED THE FED FUNDS TARGET RANGE 25 BPS AT BOTH THEIR JULY AND  SEPTEMBER 2019 MEETINGS, AND THE MARKET EXPECTS THE FED TO DO SO AGAIN BEFORE THE END OF 2019.  GLOBAL GROWTH HAS CONTINUED TO DECELERATE AND DOMESTIC GROWTH, AT LEAST THE MANUFACTURING SIDE OF THE ECONOMY, HAS CLEARLY SLOWED.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE  GLOBAL GROWTH SLOW DOWN HAS BEEN THE ESCALATING TRADE WAR, PARTICULARLY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.  THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE BOTH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF GOODS IMPORTED FROM CHINA THAT WILL BE SUBJECT TO TARIFFS AND THE  MAGNITUDE OF THE TARIFFS THAT WILL BE IMPOSED.  THE MOST RECENT INCREASE WAS ANNOUNCED ON AUGUST 1ST AND WAS THE LARGEST IN BOTH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF GOODS AFFECTED AND THE RATE OF THE TARIFFS.  THE MARKETS REACTED VIOLENTLY, AND RISK-TAKING  SENTIMENT PLUMMETED.  GLOBAL STOCK MARKETS DECLINED AND INTEREST RATES ACROSS THE GLOBE DECLINED.  37  AFTER A PERIOD OF RELATIVE CALM IN JULY 2019, THE ESCALATION IN THE TRADE WAR TRIGGERED BY THE NEW TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT IN AUGUST BROUGHT ABOUT SEVERAL MEANINGFUL DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE GLOBAL RATES  MARKETS.  IN GERMANY, THE 10-YEAR BUND YIELD HIT A NEW ALL-TIME LOW OF -0.716% ON AUGUST 28, 2019.  THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF GLOBAL DEBT TRADING AT NEGATIVE YIELDS HIT A NEW ALL-TIME HIGH OF $17.037 TRILLION ON AUGUST 29, 2019.  DOMESTICALLY,  THE  10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY TERM PREMIUM REACHED -1.3273 ON AUGUST 28, 2019, THE 30-YEAR GOVERNMENT BOND YIELD DECLINED BELOW 2% FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER DURING AUGUST AND THE SPREAD BETWEEN THE 3-MONTH U.S. TREASURY BILL AND THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY  REACHED -0.5044 ON AUGUST 27, 2019.  IN SHORT, IT WAS AN UNSETTLING MONTH.  HOWEVER, THE VOLATILITY CONTINUED THROUGH THE END OF THE QUARTER.  DOMESTIC ECONOMIC DATA RELEASED IN EARLY SEPTEMBER WAS NOT AS BAD AS FEARED AND THE RATES MARKETS REVERSED VIOLENTLY AGAIN, WITH THE YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY RISING FROM A LOW OF 1.458% ON  SEPTEMBER 3, 2019 \u2013 WITHIN 11 BPS OF THE ALL-TIME LOWEST YIELD FOR THE 10-YEAR, TO JUST UNDER 1.90% ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2019. THIS WAS A 44 BPS MOVE IN JUST 8 TRADING DAYS.  ON SEPTEMBER 14TH, THERE WAS A MISSILE ATTACK ON SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS OF SAUDI  ARABIAN OIL PRODUCTIONS FACILITIES WHICH TURNED THE MARKET AROUND YET AGAIN.  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PERIOD WERE NOT LIMITED TO THE EQUITY AND RATES MARKETS. DURING SEPTEMBER, THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES LAUNCHED AN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY INTO  PRESIDENT TRUMP\u2019S DEALING WITH THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE.  FINALLY, ON SEPTEMBER 16TH, DISRUPTIONS IN THE OVER-NIGHT FUNDING MARKETS CAUSED THE FED FUNDS RATE TO TRADE OUTSIDE OF THE 25 BPS BAND ESTABLISHED BY THE FED, AND OVER-NIGHT REPO RATES TO  SPIKE TOWARDS 7%.  THE SPIKE WAS CAUSED MORE BY A LACK OF AVAILABLE FUNDING VERSUS AN UNWILLINGNESS TO LEND, WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH CREDIT RELATED FEARS PRESENT IN THE MARKET.  THE FED INTERVENED RATHER QUICKLY BY INITIALLY PROVIDING  OVERNIGHT REPO FACILITIES AND EVENTUALLY TERM FUNDING OVER QUARTER END TO CALM MARKETS. THE FED TOOK ADDITIONAL STEPS IN OCTOBER TO ADDRESS PRESSURES IN THE OVER-NIGHT FUNDING MARKETS. THESE STEPS ARE DESCRIBED MORE FULLY BELOW UNDER RECENT  REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS.  IN SUMMARY, THE THIRD QUARTER WAS VERY VOLATILE AND AS WE HEAD INTO THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE MARKETS ARE ANXIOUS FOR CALM TO RETURN.  SO FAR IN OCTOBER, THERE HAVE BEEN POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS.  THE U.S. AND CHINA REACHED A  TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON OCTOBER 11, 2019 THAT WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVENT TARIFFS ON $300 BILLION OF GOODS FROM INCREASING ON OCTOBER 15, 2019 AS ORIGINALLY SCHEDULED. THERE ARE NOT MANY DETAILS OF THE TENTATIVE AGREEMENT AVAILABLE YET, BUT THE  MARKET SENSES THE TRADE WAR, WHILE NOT ABOUT TO END, WILL NOT CONTINUE TO ESCALATE EITHER, AND APPEARS TO BE THAWING SOMEWHAT. A POTENTIAL DEAL ON BREXIT HAS ALSO BEEN REACHED, WHICH MAY PREVENT THE UNITED KINGDOM FROM LEAVING THE EUROPEAN UNION  WITHOUT A DEAL.  IN RESPONSE TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THE MARKETS EXPECT CONTINUED ACCOMMODATION ON THE PART OF THE VARIOUS CENTRAL BANKS AND THIS APPEARS TO BE WHAT THE BANKS INTEND TO DELIVER.  THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK  WILL BE UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP BEGINNING NOVEMBER 1, 2019 AND BOTH THE OUTGOING PRESIDENT AND HIS REPLACEMENT HAVE MADE CLEAR THEIR INTENTIONS TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE POLICY ACCOMMODATION.  THIS IS THE CASE AS WELL IN CHINA AND JAPAN.  IN THE U.S., THE  PICTURE IS LESS CLEAR.  THERE APPEARS TO BE A DIVIDE WITHIN THE FED OVER BOTH THE OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY AND WHAT THE FOCUS OF THE FED SHOULD BE.  DOMESTIC DATA \u2013 OUTSIDE OF MANUFACTURING \u2013 HAS REMAINED FIRM.  DATA RELEASED IN EARLY OCTOBER  INDICATED THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE FOR MUCH LONGER.  HOWEVER, THE DATA IS FAR FROM WEAK.  OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. THE PICTURE IS FAR LESS CLOUDY.  THERE IS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A GLOBAL GROWTH SLOW DOWN.  THE QUESTION THAT THE FED IS GRAPPLING WITH RELATES  TO WHICH MATTERS MOST TO THE FED FOR SETTING MONETARY POLICY.  IS IT SOLELY THE STATE OF THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OR SHOULD THE FED RESPOND TO DEVELOPMENTS ABROAD, USUALLY MANIFESTING THEMSELVES IN THE RATES AND EQUITIES MARKETS.  THE LEVEL OF INFLATION  AND INFLATION EXPECTATIONS ALSO MATTER.  CURRENTLY, INFLATION IS RUNNING BELOW THE FED TARGET OF 2%, BUT HAS BEEN MOVING CLOSER TO TARGET OF LATE. INFLATION CONSISTENTLY BELOW THE FED\u2019S TARGET WOULD JUSTIFY ADDITIONAL ACCOMMODATION, BUT THIS MAY NOT  BE THE CASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE IF INFLATION CONTINUES TO MOVE HIGHER. PUBLIC COMMENTS BY THE FED CHAIRMAN AND POLICY DECISION VOTING REVEAL THE LACK OF CONSENSUS.  THE MARKETS AWAIT RESOLUTION OF THE MATTER.  THE AGENCY MBS MARKET TOTAL RETURN FOR THE QUARTER WAS 1.4%, ALTHOUGH THE RETURN WAS -0.2% VERSUS EQUIVALENT DURATION SWAPS AND LIBOR PER DATA BY BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH/ICE DATA INDICES.  WITH  INTEREST RATES DECLINING TO NEAR ALL-TIME LOW LEVELS, PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY ACCELERATED AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN HIGH.  THE SPREAD OF THE CURRENT-COUPON 30-YEAR MORTGAGE TO THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY REACHED 98.07 BPS ON AUGUST 27, 2019,  THE HIGHEST SPREAD SINCE 2012.  TOTAL RETURNS ACROSS THE AGENCY MBS SECTOR FOLLOWED DURATIONS TO SOME EXTENT, AS 30-YEAR RETURNS EXCEEDED RETURNS TO 15-YEAR MBS AND GINNIE MAE SECURITIES, ALTHOUGH WITHIN THE COUPON STACK, THIS TREND DID NOT HOLD.  AS  PREPAYMENT PERFORMANCE WAS WORST AMONG THE 3.5% AND 4.0% COUPONS, THESE SECURITIES GENERALLY TRAILED HIGHER WITH LOWER COUPONS ON A TOTAL RETURN BASIS.  WITH PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY ELEVATED AND THE CONTINUED POOR QUALITY OF GENERIC, TBA COLLATERAL,  SPECIFIED POOLS CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM.  38  IN JUNE 2019, THE UNIFORM MBS (\u201cUMBS\u201d) BEGAN TRADING.  UMBS  ARE PASSTHROUGH SECURITIES REPRESENTING AN INTEREST IN A POOL OF RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES THAT ARE ISSUED AND GUARANTEED BY EITHER FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC. THE UMBS WERE DESIGNED TO ELIMINATE DIFFERENCES IN UNDERWRITING, SERVICING AND TRADING LEVELS  BETWEEN FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC SECURITIES AND TO INCREASE LIQUIDITY IN THE TBA MARKET. TBA TRADES CAN NOW BE SETTLED THROUGH DELIVERY OF EITHER FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC UMBS.  ALSO, RESECURITIZATIONS OF FANNIE MAE OR FREDDIE MAC COLLATERAL CAN BE  COMMINGLED, AND COMMINGLED PASSTHROUGH SECURITIES CAN BE USED TO SETTLE UMBS TBA TRADES. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN HOW EFFECTIVE THE UMBS PROGRAM WILL BE AT ACCOMPLISHING THESE OBJECTIVES.  AS MENTIONED, THE DETERIORATION IN THE TBA MARKET CONTINUES TO BE  A SIGNIFICANT OBSTACLE FOR AGENCY MBS PERFORMANCE, BOTH ON AN OUTRIGHT RETURN BASIS AND COMPARED TO OTHER SECTORS OF THE FIXED INCOME UNIVERSE. REFINANCING ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED AND ALL AGENCY LOANS OUTSIDE OF THE SPECIFIED POOL MARKET CONTINUE TO  EXHIBIT VERY POOR PREPAYMENT BEHAVIOR.  THE COLLATERAL GENERALLY HAS HISTORICALLY HIGH GROSS WEIGHTED AVERAGE COUPONS FOR ANY GIVEN COUPON, HIGHER LOAN BALANCES AND HIGHER FICO SCORES \u2013 ALL CONSISTENT WITH HIGHER PREPAYMENT EXPECTATIONS.  THIS HAS LED  TO A MATERIAL INCREASE IN PREMIUMS CHARGED FOR POOLS WITH MORE DESIRABLE PREPAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS.  WHILE THESE PREMIUMS HAVE INCREASED, AND ARE VERY HIGH FOR THE CURRENT LEVEL OF RATES, THE ALL-IN PRICE FOR SPECIFIED SECURITIES IS HISTORICALLY LOW  FOR THE LEVEL OF RATES.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE DOLLAR PRICES FOR THE VARIOUS TBA SECURITIES IS VERY LOW FOR THE LEVEL OF RATES \u2013 REFLECTING THE VERY POOR PREPAYMENT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TBA COLLATERAL.  RECENT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS  IN SEPTEMBER 2017, THE FOMC ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD IMPLEMENT A BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION POLICY BY GRADUALLY DECREASING THE FED\u2019S REINVESTMENT OF U.S. TREASURIES AND AGENCY RMBS. MORE SPECIFICALLY,  PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS RECEIVED BY THE FED WILL BE REINVESTED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THEY EXCEED GRADUALLY RISING CAPS UNTIL THE FOMC DETERMINES THAT THE FED IS HOLDING NO MORE SECURITIES THAN NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT MONETARY POLICY EFFICIENTLY AND  EFFECTIVELY. IN OCTOBER 2017, THE FOMC COMMENCED THIS BALANCE SHEET NORMALIZATION PROGRAM. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARCH 2019 FOMC MEETING, THE FED SAID THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO SLOW THE PACE OF THE DECLINE IN ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURIES AND  AGENCY RMBS OVER COMING QUARTERS PROVIDED THAT THE ECONOMY AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS EVOLVE ABOUT AS EXPECTED. THE FED SPECIFIED THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO REDUCE THE RUN-OFF OF ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES BY REDUCING THE CAP ON MONTHLY  REDEMPTIONS FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF $30 BILLION TO $15 BILLION BEGINNING IN MAY 2019, AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ITS HOLDINGS OF AGENCY RMBS TO DECLINE, CONSISTENT WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING PRIMARILY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE LONG RUN. IN OCTOBER  2019, THE FED BEGAN REINVESTING PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY RMBS OR AGENCY DEBT IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $20 BILLION PER MONTH, WITH ANY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF THAT MAXIMUM REINVESTED IN AGENCY RMBS.  ON OCTOBER 11, 2019, THE FED COMMENCED PURCHASES OF UP TO $60 BILLION TREASURY BILLS PER MONTH THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020.  THE FED IS ALSO CONDUCTING OVERNIGHT REPO OPERATIONS OF $75 BILLION,  INITIALLY, AND 2-WEEK TERM REPO OPERATIONS OF AT LEAST $35 BILLION TWICE A WEEK THROUGH JANUARY OF 2020.  THEIR GOAL IS TO MAINTAIN RESERVE BALANCES OVER TIME AT OR ABOVE THE LEVELS THAT PREVAILED IN EARLY SEPTEMBER 2019.  IN 2017, POLICYMAKERS ANNOUNCED THAT LIBOR WILL BE REPLACED BY 2021. THE DIRECTIVE WAS SPURRED BY THE FACT THAT BANKS ARE UNCOMFORTABLE CONTRIBUTING TO THE LIBOR PANEL GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF UNDERLYING  TRANSACTIONS ON WHICH TO BASE LEVELS AND THE LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH SUBMITTING AN UNFOUNDED LEVEL. LIBOR WILL BE REPLACED WITH A NEW SOFR, A RATE BASED ON U.S. REPO TRADING. THE NEW BENCHMARK RATE WILL BE BASED ON OVERNIGHT TREASURY GENERAL  COLLATERAL REPO RATES. THE RATE-SETTING PROCESS WILL BE MANAGED AND PUBLISHED BY THE FED AND THE TREASURY\u2019S OFFICE OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH. MANY BANKS BELIEVE THAT IT MAY TAKE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS TO COMPLETE THE TRANSITION TO SOFR, DESPITE THE 2021  DEADLINE. WE WILL MONITOR THE EMERGENCE OF THIS NEW RATE CAREFULLY AS IT WILL LIKELY BECOME THE NEW BENCHMARK FOR HEDGES AND A RANGE OF INTEREST RATE INVESTMENTS.  IN JANUARY 2019, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MADE STATEMENTS OF ITS PLANS TO WORK WITH CONGRESS TO OVERHAUL FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC AND EXPECTATIONS TO ANNOUNCE A FRAMEWORK FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A  POLICY FOR COMPREHENSIVE HOUSING FINANCE REFORM SOON. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE FHFA ANNOUNCED FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WILL BE ALLOWED TO INCREASE THEIR CAPITAL BUFFERS TO $25 BILLION AND $20 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE CURRENT LIMIT OF $3  BILLION EACH. THIS STEP COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC BEING PRIVATIZED AND REPRESENTS THE FIRST CONCRETE STEP ON THE ROAD TO GSE REFORM.  AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER, NO DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE ON ANY ADDITIONAL STEPS TO BE TAKEN AS  PART OF THE GSE REFORM PLAN.  39  THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE ACTIONS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT OR THE FED WILL ULTIMATELY UNDERTAKE ARE UNKNOWN AND WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.  ALTHOUGH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE STATEMENTS OF ITS  INTENTIONS TO REFORM HOUSING FINANCE AND TAX POLICY, MANY OF THESE POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES WILL REQUIRE CONGRESSIONAL ACTION.  IN ADDITION, THE FED HAS MADE STATEMENTS REGARDING ADDITIONAL INCREASES TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE IN 2019 AND BEYOND.  EFFECT ON US  REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS, MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES AND PREPAYMENT RATES AFFECT US IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  EFFECTS ON OUR ASSETS  A CHANGE IN OR ELIMINATION OF THE GUARANTEE STRUCTURE OF AGENCY RMBS MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS (IF, FOR EXAMPLE, GUARANTEE FEES INCREASE) OR REQUIRE US TO CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY ALTOGETHER. FOR  EXAMPLE, THE ELIMINATION OF THE GUARANTEE STRUCTURE OF AGENCY RMBS MAY CAUSE US TO CHANGE OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY TO FOCUS ON NON-AGENCY RMBS, WHICH IN TURN WOULD REQUIRE US TO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR MONITORING OF THE CREDIT RISKS OF OUR  INVESTMENTS IN ADDITION TO INTEREST RATE AND PREPAYMENT RISKS.  LOWER LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES CAN AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. IF PREPAYMENT RATES ARE RELATIVELY LOW (DUE, IN PART, TO THE REFINANCING PROBLEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE), LOWER  LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES CAN INCREASE THE VALUE OF HIGHER-COUPON AGENCY RMBS. THIS IS BECAUSE INVESTORS TYPICALLY PLACE A PREMIUM ON ASSETS WITH YIELDS THAT ARE HIGHER THAN MARKET YIELDS. ALTHOUGH LOWER LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES MAY INCREASE ASSET  VALUES IN OUR PORTFOLIO, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO INVEST NEW FUNDS IN SIMILARLY-YIELDING ASSETS.  IF PREPAYMENT LEVELS INCREASE, THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS AFFECTED BY SUCH PREPAYMENTS MAY DECLINE. THIS IS BECAUSE A PRINCIPAL PREPAYMENT ACCELERATES THE EFFECTIVE TERM OF AN AGENCY RMBS, WHICH WOULD  SHORTEN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH AN INVESTOR WOULD RECEIVE ABOVE-MARKET RETURNS (ASSUMING THE YIELD ON THE PREPAID ASSET IS HIGHER THAN MARKET YIELDS). ALSO, PREPAYMENT PROCEEDS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BE REINVESTED IN SIMILAR-YIELDING ASSETS. AGENCY RMBS  BACKED BY MORTGAGES WITH HIGH INTEREST RATES ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PREPAYMENT RISK BECAUSE HOLDERS OF THOSE MORTGAGES ARE MOST LIKELY TO REFINANCE TO A LOWER RATE. IOS AND IIOS, HOWEVER, MAY BE THE TYPES OF AGENCY RMBS MOST SENSITIVE TO INCREASED  PREPAYMENT RATES. BECAUSE THE HOLDER OF AN IO OR IIO RECEIVES NO PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS, THE VALUES OF IOS AND IIOS ARE ENTIRELY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE OF A PRINCIPAL BALANCE ON THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES. IF THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE IS ELIMINATED DUE TO  PREPAYMENT, IOS AND IIOS ESSENTIALLY BECOME WORTHLESS. ALTHOUGH INCREASED PREPAYMENT RATES CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR IOS AND IIOS, THEY HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT ON POS. BECAUSE POS ACT LIKE ZERO-COUPON BONDS, MEANING THEY ARE PURCHASED  AT A DISCOUNT TO THEIR PAR VALUE AND HAVE AN EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE DISCOUNT AND THE TERM OF THE UNDERLYING LOAN, AN INCREASE IN PREPAYMENT RATES WOULD REDUCE THE EFFECTIVE TERM OF OUR POS AND ACCELERATE THE YIELDS EARNED ON THOSE  ASSETS, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR NET INCOME.  HIGHER LONG-TERM RATES CAN ALSO AFFECT THE VALUE OF OUR AGENCY RMBS.  AS LONG-TERM RATES RISE, RATES AVAILABLE TO BORROWERS ALSO RISE.  THIS TENDS TO CAUSE PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY TO SLOW AND EXTEND THE  EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF MORTGAGE CASH FLOWS.  AS THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THE MORTGAGE CASH FLOWS INCREASES, COUPLED WITH HIGHER DISCOUNT RATES, THE VALUE OF AGENCY RMBS DECLINES.  SOME OF THE INSTRUMENTS THE COMPANY USES TO HEDGE OUR AGENCY  RMBS ASSETS, SUCH AS INTEREST RATE FUTURES, SWAPS AND SWAPTIONS, ARE STABLE AVERAGE LIFE INSTRUMENTS.  THIS MEANS THAT TO THE EXTENT WE USE SUCH INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE OUR AGENCY RMBS ASSETS, OUR HEDGES MAY NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT US FROM PRICE  DECLINES, AND THEREFORE MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR BOOK VALUE.  IT IS FOR THIS REASON WE USE INTEREST ONLY SECURITIES IN OUR PORTFOLIO. AS INTEREST RATES RISE, THE EXPECTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THESE SECURITIES INCREASES, CAUSING GENERALLY POSITIVE PRICE  MOVEMENTS AS THE NUMBER AND SIZE OF THE CASH FLOWS INCREASE THE LONGER THE UNDERLYING MORTGAGES REMAIN OUTSTANDING. THIS MAKES INTEREST ONLY SECURITIES DESIRABLE HEDGE INSTRUMENTS FOR PASS-THROUGH AGENCY RMBS.  40  AS THE ECONOMY HAS REBOUNDED FROM THE FINANCIAL CRISIS, THE FED HAS TAKEN STEPS TO REMOVE THE CONSIDERABLE ACCOMMODATION THAT WAS EMPLOYED TO COMBAT THE CRISIS.  AT THE CONCLUSION OF ITS MEETING IN  SEPTEMBER 2017, THE FED ANNOUNCED IT WOULD IMPLEMENT CAPS ON THE AMOUNT OF AGENCY RMBS ASSETS IT WOULD ALLOW TO RUN OFF, OR NOT BE RE-INVESTED, STARTING IN OCTOBER 2017.  PREVIOUSLY THE FED WOULD RE-INVEST ALL OF THE PRINCIPAL REPAYMENTS IT RECEIVED  EACH MONTH ON THE AGENCY RMBS ASSETS IT HAD ACQUIRED DURING ITS QUANTITATIVE EASING PROGRAMS.  BY CAPPING THE AMOUNT THEY WOULD ALLOW TO RUN OFF EACH MONTH, THE FED WAS EFFECTIVELY LIMITING THE AMOUNT IT WOULD RE-INVEST.  PER THE FED\u2019S SEPTEMBER 2017  ANNOUNCEMENT, THE CAP REACHED $20 BILLION PER MONTH IN OCTOBER 2018.  AT THE TIME OF THE FED\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT IN SEPTEMBER 2017, ITS MONTHLY RE-INVESTMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $20 BILLION PER MONTH AS WELL, SO THIS IMPLIED THE FED WOULD STOP, OR NEARLY  STOP, RE-INVESTING ITS MONTHLY PAY-DOWNS BEYOND OCTOBER 2018.  THE PURCHASES EACH MONTH BY THE FED HAVE BEEN A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF DEMAND IN THE AGENCY RMBS MARKET AND AS IT WAS REDUCED SLOWLY OVER THE COURSE OF 2018 AND ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATED  BEYOND OCTOBER 2018, THE REMOVAL OF THIS SOURCE OF DEMAND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT AGENCY RMBS PRICES.  THE EXTENT THIS NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE AGENCY RMBS MARKET WILL BE A FUNCTION OF THE LEVEL OF SUPPLY EACH MONTH \u2013 AS THE SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE  AFFECTS THE PRICE OF ANY ASSET \u2013 AND WHETHER OR NOT ANOTHER SOURCE OF DEMAND EMERGES TO REPLACE THE FED. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MARCH 2019 FOMC MEETING, THE FED SAID THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO SLOW THE PACE OF THE DECLINE IN ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S.  TREASURIES AND AGENCY RMBS OVER COMING QUARTERS PROVIDED THAT THE ECONOMY AND MONEY MARKET CONDITIONS EVOLVE ABOUT AS EXPECTED. THE FED SPECIFIED THAT THE FOMC INTENDS TO REDUCE THE RUN-OFF OF ITS HOLDINGS OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES BY REDUCING THE  CAP ON MONTHLY REDEMPTIONS FROM THE CURRENT LEVEL OF $30 BILLION TO $15 BILLION BEGINNING IN MAY 2019, AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW ITS HOLDINGS OF AGENCY RMBS TO DECLINE, CONSISTENT WITH THE AIM OF HOLDING PRIMARILY U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES IN THE LONG  RUN. IN OCTOBER 2019, THE FED BEGAN REINVESTING PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FROM AGENCY RMBS OR AGENCY DEBT IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM OF $20 BILLION PER MONTH, WITH ANY PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF THAT MAXIMUM REINVESTED IN AGENCY  RMBS.  BECAUSE WE BASE OUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON RISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES RATHER THAN ANTICIPATED MOVEMENTS IN INTEREST RATES, IN A VOLATILE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT WE MAY ALLOCATE MORE CAPITAL TO  STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS WITH SHORTER DURATIONS. WE BELIEVE THESE SECURITIES HAVE A LOWER SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES THAN OTHER ASSET CLASSES. WE MAY ATTEMPT TO MITIGATE OUR EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES BY  INVESTING IN IOS AND IIOS, WHICH TYPICALLY HAVE DIFFERENT SENSITIVITIES TO CHANGES IN LONG-TERM INTEREST RATES THAN PT RMBS, PARTICULARLY PT RMBS BACKED BY FIXED-RATE MORTGAGES.  IF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC WERE TO MODIFY OR END THEIR REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  EFFECTS ON OUR BORROWING COSTS  WE LEVERAGE OUR PT RMBS PORTFOLIO AND A PORTION OF OUR STRUCTURED AGENCY RMBS WITH PRINCIPAL BALANCES THROUGH THE USE OF SHORT-TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE INTEREST RATES ON OUR DEBT ARE  DETERMINED BY THE SHORT TERM INTEREST RATE MARKETS. AN INCREASE IN THE FED FUNDS RATE OR LIBOR WOULD INCREASE OUR BORROWING COSTS, WHICH COULD AFFECT OUR INTEREST RATE SPREAD IF THERE IS NO CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE INTEREST WE EARN ON OUR  ASSETS. THIS WOULD BE MOST PREVALENT WITH RESPECT TO OUR AGENCY RMBS BACKED BY FIXED RATE MORTGAGE LOANS BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATE ON A FIXED-RATE MORTGAGE LOAN DOES NOT CHANGE EVEN THOUGH MARKET RATES MAY CHANGE.  IN ORDER TO PROTECT OUR NET INTEREST MARGIN AGAINST INCREASES IN SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES, WE MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ECONOMICALLY CONVERT OUR FLOATING-RATE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT DEBT  TO FIXED-RATE DEBT, OR UTILIZE OTHER HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS EURODOLLAR, FED FUNDS AND T-NOTE FUTURES CONTRACTS OR INTEREST RATE SWAPTIONS.  41  SUMMARY  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PROVED TO BE A VERY TURBULENT PERIOD FOR THE MARKETS.  AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY CONTINUED ITS SLOWDOWN THAT STARTED IN 2018 AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING SEGMENT CONTINUED TO  COOL, THE MARKETS EXPECTED THE FED WOULD NEED TO EASE MONETARY POLICY IN 2019.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE SLOWDOWN, BOTH GLOBALLY AND DOMESTICALLY, WAS THE TRADE WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.  THE TRADE WAR WAS MEANINGFULLY ESCALATED WHEN ON AUGUST 1,  2019, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES TO BOTH THE DOLLAR AMOUNT OF GOODS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO TARIFFS AND THE SIZE OF THE TARIFFS THEMSELVES.  THE MARKETS REACTED VIOLENTLY AND SEVERAL KEY MARKET INDICATORS REACHED NEW  EXTREME LEVELS \u2013 SUCH AS THE YIELD ON THE GERMAN 10-YEAR BUND, THE 30-YEAR U.S. TREASURY YIELD AND MANY OTHERS.  THESE EXTREME LEVELS WERE REACHED IN LATE AUGUST AND EARLY SEPTEMBER BEFORE THE MARKET ONCE AGAIN PIVOTED AND REVERSED COURSE, AS THE  YIELD ON THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY NOTE INCREASED 44 BPS IN A MERE 8 TRADING DAYS.  NOT SURPRISINGLY, THE MARKETS WOULD REVERSE A FEW MORE TIMES AS ONE DEVELOPMENT AFTER ANOTHER BUFFETED THE MARKET \u2013 INCLUDING A MAJOR ATTACK ON SAUDI OIL FIELDS, THE  POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP, A MAJOR DISRUPTION IN THE OVER-NIGHT FUNDING MARKETS AND FINALLY, IN OCTOBER, A POTENTIAL END TO THE BREXIT CRISIS AND A TENTATIVE TRADE DEAL BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.  IN BETWEEN ALL OF THE EVENTS,  VOLATILITY LEVELS WERE ELEVATED, RISK MARKETS GYRATED WILDLY AND AGENCY MBS ASSETS PERFORMED POORLY.  THE AGENCY MBS MARKET TOTAL RETURN FOR THE QUARTER WAS 1.4%, ALTHOUGH THE RETURN WAS -0.2% VERSUS EQUIVALENT DURATION SWAPS AND LIBOR (PER DATA BY BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH/ICE DATA INDICES).  WITH  RATES DECLINING TO NEAR ALL-TIME LOW LEVELS, PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY ACCELERATED AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO REMAIN HIGH.  THE SPREAD OF THE CURRENT-COUPON 30-YEAR MORTGAGE TO THE 10-YEAR U.S. TREASURY REACHED 98.07 BPS ON AUGUST 27, 2019, THE HIGHEST  SPREAD SINCE 2012.  TOTAL RETURNS ACROSS THE AGENCY MBS UNIVERSE FOLLOWED DURATIONS TO SOME EXTENT, AS 30-YEAR RETURNS EXCEEDED RETURNS TO 15-YEAR MBS AND GINNIE MAE SECURITIES, ALTHOUGH WITHIN THE COUPON STACK, THIS TREND DID NOT HOLD.  AS  PREPAYMENT PERFORMANCE WAS WORST AMONG THE 3.5% AND 4.0% COUPONS, THESE SECURITIES GENERALLY TRAILED HIGHER WITH LOWER COUPONS ON A TOTAL RETURN BASIS.  WITH PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY ELEVATED AND THE CONTINUED POOR QUALITY OF GENERIC, TBA COLLATERAL,  SPECIFIED POOLS CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM.  AGENCY MBS ASSET PERFORMANCE TRAILED THAT OF OTHER STRUCTURED PRODUCTS OUTSIDE OF RMBS AND INVESTMENT GRADE CORPORATES.  HIGH YIELD CORPORATES GENERATED RETURNS SIMILAR TO AGENCY MBS OF 1.2% AND -0.1% VERSUS  COMPARABLE DURATION SWAPS AND LIBOR.   AS WE ENTER THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, AGENCY MBS PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN VERY DIRECTIONAL \u2013 WITH POOR PERFORMANCE WHEN THE RATES MARKETS RALLY (YIELDS LOWER) AND POSITIVE PERFORMANCE WHEN RATES INCREASE.  EVEN  WITH THE INCREASE IN RATES SINCE THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER, AVAILABLE MORTGAGE RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW BY HISTORICAL STANDARDS AND PREPAYMENT ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ELEVATED.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. GAAP REQUIRES OUR MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SOME COMPLEX AND SUBJECTIVE DECISIONS AND ASSESSMENTS. OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES INVOLVE DECISIONS AND ASSESSMENTS WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REPORTED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE  YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  42  DIVIDENDS  IN ADDITION TO OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT MUST BE SATISFIED TO QUALIFY AS A REIT, WE MUST PAY ANNUAL DIVIDENDS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF AT LEAST 90% OF OUR REIT TAXABLE INCOME, DETERMINED WITHOUT REGARD TO  THE DEDUCTION FOR DIVIDENDS PAID AND EXCLUDING ANY NET CAPITAL GAINS. REIT TAXABLE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CODE, AND CAN BE GREATER THAN OR LESS THAN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENT NET INCOME (LOSS) COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THESE BOOK TO TAX DIFFERENCES PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE RECOGNITION OF INTEREST INCOME ON RMBS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON RMBS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE TREATED AS FUNDING HEDGES FOR TAX PURPOSES.

WE HAVE DEVELOPED AN ACCURATE, NON-INVASIVE, PATIENT-FRIENDLY SCREENING TEST CALLED COLOGUARD\u00ae FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL TESTS FOR OTHER TYPES OF CANCER, WITH THE GOAL OF BECOMING A LEADER IN CANCER SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTICS.  \u200b  ON JULY 28, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH GENOMIC HEALTH, INC. (\u201cGENOMIC HEALTH\u201d), UNDER WHICH WE AGREED TO ACQUIRE GENOMIC HEALTH IN A CASH AND STOCK TRANSACTION VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION. GENOMIC HEALTH IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF GENOMIC-BASED DIAGNOSTIC TESTS THAT HELP OPTIMIZE CANCER CARE. FOLLOWING THE MERGER WITH GENOMIC HEALTH, WE WOULD BE THE PROVIDER OF TWO OF THE STRONGEST BRANDS IN CANCER DIAGNOSTICS, COLOGUARD AND ONCOTYPE DX\u00ae, PROVIDING A ROBUST PLATFORM FOR CONTINUED GROWTH. REFER TO NOTE 12 IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  \u200b  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THE MERGER WILL BE COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2019, SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF GENOMIC HEALTH\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE AGGREGATE CASH PORTION OF THE MERGER CONSIDERATION. THE MERGER WILL BE FINANCED IN PART BY THE USE OF OUR CASH ON HAND AND IN PART BY THE USE OF GENOMIC HEALTH\u2019S CASH ON HAND.  \u200b  OUR COLOGUARD TEST  \u200b  COLORECTAL CANCER IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN THE U.S. AND THE LEADING CAUSE OF CANCER DEATHS IN THE U.S. AMONG NON-SMOKERS. EACH YEAR IN THE U.S. THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY.  \u200b  \u25cf  146,000 NEW CASES OF COLORECTAL CANCER  \u25cf  51,000 DEATHS FROM COLORECTAL CANCER  \u200b  IT IS WIDELY ACCEPTED THAT COLORECTAL CANCER IS AMONG THE MOST PREVENTABLE, YET LEAST PREVENTED CANCERS. COLORECTAL CANCER CAN TAKE UP TO 10-15 YEARS TO PROGRESS FROM A PRE-CANCEROUS LESION TO METASTATIC CANCER AND DEATH. PATIENTS WHO ARE DIAGNOSED EARLY IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE\u2014WITH PRE-CANCEROUS LESIONS OR POLYPS OR EARLY-STAGE CANCER\u2014ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A COMPLETE RECOVERY AND TO BE TREATED LESS EXPENSIVELY. OF THE 106 MILLION AMERICANS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 85 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE-RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER, AN ESTIMATED 40 PERCENT ARE NOT UP-TO-DATE WITH SCREENING ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY\u2019S (\u201cACS\u201d) COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING GUIDELINES. INTERNAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEARLY 50% OF SURVEYED COLOGUARD USERS WERE PREVIOUSLY UNSCREENED FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. POOR COMPLIANCE WITH SCREENING GUIDELINES HAS MEANT THAT NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF COLORECTAL CANCER DIAGNOSES ARE MADE IN THE DISEASE\u2019S LATE STAGES. THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATES FOR STAGES 3 AND 4 ARE 71 PERCENT AND 14 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO A 90 PERCENT SURVIVAL RATE IF THE DISEASE IS DIAGNOSED EARLIER IN STAGE 1. WE BELIEVE THE LARGE UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF UNSCREENED AND INADEQUATELY SCREENED PATIENTS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY FOR A PATIENT-FRIENDLY SCREENING TEST.  \u200b  OUR COLOGUARD TEST IS A NON-INVASIVE STOOL-BASED DNA (\u201cSDNA\u201d) SCREENING TEST THAT UTILIZES A MULTI-TARGET APPROACH TO DETECT DNA AND HEMOGLOBIN BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. ELEVEN BIOMARKERS ARE TARGETED THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. METHYLATION, MUTATION, AND HEMOGLOBIN RESULTS ARE COMBINED IN THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS THROUGH AN ALGORITHM TO PROVIDE A SINGLE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE REPORTABLE RESULT.  \u200b  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION, AND THE OCCURRENCE OF MUTATIONS, ALTER GENE EXPRESSION AND OTHER MECHANISMS FOR CELL CYCLE REGULATION AND DIFFERENTIATION. AS A RESULT, THE AFFECTED CELLS CONTINUE TO PROLIFERATE, OFTEN RESULTING IN MALIGNANCIES ASSOCIATED WITH COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCER. HEMOGLOBIN IS THE PROTEIN COMPLEX RESPONSIBLE FOR TRANSPORTING OXYGEN IN RED BLOOD CELLS. DURING THE PROGRESSION OF CANCER, THE PROBABILITY OF BLEEDING INTO THE COLON INCREASES. THE PRESENCE OF HEMOGLOBIN, RELEASED FROM RED BLOOD CELLS, CAN BE DETECTED IN THE STOOL. USING SDNA, COLOGUARD PURIFIES, AMPLIFIES AND DETECTS INCREASED LEVELS OF METHYLATION, AND PRESENCE OF MUTATIONS, IN SPECIFIC GENES. BY COMBINING THESE DNA INDICATORS WITH A TEST FOR HEMOGLOBIN, COLOGUARD PRODUCES A MULTI-MARKER RESULT EFFECTIVE FOR THE DETECTION OF COLORECTAL CANCER AND PRE-CANCEROUS ADENOMAS.  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2014, THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) GRANTED PREMARKET APPROVAL (\u201cPMA\u201d) TO COLOGUARD FOR USE AS A COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING TEST IN ADULTS 50 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER WHO ARE AT A TYPICAL AVERAGE-RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. UPON APPROVAL, COLOGUARD BECAME THE FIRST AND ONLY FDA-APPROVED SDNA NON-INVASIVE COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING TEST. IN SEPTEMBER 2019, THE FDA EXPANDED COLOGUARD\u2019S INDICATION TO INCLUDE AVERAGE-RISK INDIVIDUALS AGES 45-49. COLOGUARD IS NOW INDICATED FOR AVERAGE RISK ADULTS 45 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER.  \u200b  OUR ORIGINAL PMA SUBMISSION TO THE FDA FOR COLOGUARD INCLUDED THE RESULTS OF OUR PIVOTAL DEEP-C CLINICAL TRIAL THAT HAD OVER 10,000 PATIENTS ENROLLED AT 90 SITES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE RESULTS OF OUR DEEP-C CLINICAL TRIAL FOR COLOGUARD WERE PUBLISHED IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE IN APRIL 2014. THE PEER-REVIEWED STUDY, \u201cMULTI-TARGET STOOL DNA TESTING FOR COLORECTAL-CANCER SCREENING,\u201d HIGHLIGHTED THE PERFORMANCE OF COLOGUARD IN THE TRIAL POPULATION.  \u200b  \u25cf  CANCER SENSITIVITY: 92%  \u25cf  STAGE I AND II CANCER SENSITIVITY: 94%  \u25cf  HIGH-GRADE DYSPLASIA SENSITIVITY: 69%  \u25cf  SPECIFICITY: 87%  \u200b  WE BELIEVE THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES OF SDNA SCREENING PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITY. THERE ARE 106 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 85 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. AT A THREE-YEAR SCREENING INTERVAL AND AN AVERAGE REVENUE PER TEST OF $500 THIS REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL $18 BILLION MARKET FOR COLOGUARD, OF WHICH OUR CURRENT SHARE IS APPROXIMATELY 5.2 PERCENT.  \u200b  OUR CLINICAL LABORATORY AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES  \u200b  AS PART OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION STRATEGY, WE ESTABLISHED A STATE-OF-THE-ART, HIGHLY AUTOMATED LAB FACILITY THAT IS CERTIFIED PURSUANT TO FEDERAL CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS REQUIREMENTS TO PROCESS COLOGUARD TESTS AND PROVIDE PATIENT RESULTS. OUR INITIAL CLINICAL LAB OPERATION IS HOUSED IN A 55,000 SQUARE FOOT FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. AT THIS LAB, WE CURRENTLY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PROCESS APPROXIMATELY THREE MILLION TESTS PER YEAR.  \u200b  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN OPERATIONS AT A SECOND CLINICAL LAB FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. OUR TOTAL LAB CAPACITY AT BOTH FACILITIES IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION TESTS PER YEAR, WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO OUR NEW FACILITY, IF NEEDED.  \u200b  WE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURE OUR COLOGUARD TEST KIT IN A FACILITY IN MADISON, WISCONSIN. AS WE EXPAND THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF COLOGUARD, WE BELIEVE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXPAND OUR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING AN ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING FACILITY FOR WHICH WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE FDA APPROVAL FOR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTION IN 2020. WE ARE COMMITTED TO MANUFACTURING AND PROVIDING MEDICAL DEVICES AND RELATED PRODUCTS THAT MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS AND APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. WE ADHERE TO MANUFACTURING AND SAFETY STANDARDS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS AND OPERATE OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITIES UNDER A QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE PURCHASE CERTAIN COMPONENTS FOR OUR COLOGUARD TEST FROM THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURERS.  \u200b  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HOW WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE  \u200b  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON THE DELIVERY OF A TEST RESULT TO AN ORDERING PHYSICIAN FOR TESTS PERFORMED. THE AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IS BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE WILL ULTIMATELY COLLECT AT THE TIME DELIVERY IS COMPLETE. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE WE RECOGNIZE IS BASED ON THE ESTABLISHED BILLING RATES LESS CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS, WHICH YIELDS THE CONSTRAINED AMOUNT THAT WE EXPECT TO ULTIMATELY COLLECT. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO ULTIMATELY COLLECT ON A PER-PAYER OR PER-AGREEMENT BASIS, USING HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS, ESTABLISHED REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE AGREED ON A REIMBURSEMENT AMOUNT WITH A PAYER, THE EXPECTED AMOUNT IS TYPICALLY LOWER, DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF ANY PATIENT CO-PAYMENTS, THE EXISTENCE OF SECONDARY PAYERS AND CLAIM DENIALS. UPON ULTIMATE COLLECTION, THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT RECEIVED FROM PAYERS AND PATIENTS WHERE REIMBURSEMENT WAS ESTIMATED IS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS COLLECTION ESTIMATES AND, IF NECESSARY, THE CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCE IS ADJUSTED.  FINALLY, SHOULD WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM CLAIMS ON AN ACCRUAL BASIS AND LATER DETERMINE THE JUDGMENTS UNDERLYING ESTIMATED COLLECTIONS CHANGE, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN FUTURE QUARTERS. HISTORICALLY, A PORTION OF OUR REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED UPON CASH RECEIPT, BECAUSE WE WERE UNABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED FROM CERTAIN PAYERS. EFFECTIVE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE DETERMINED THAT WE HAD THE ABILITY TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE COLLECTED FROM ALL PAYERS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF PATIENT COST-SHARE COLLECTIONS. ACCORDINGLY, AS NOTED ABOVE, WE NOW RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR ALL BILLED CLAIMS AT THE TIME THE TEST RESULTS ARE DELIVERED TO THE ORDERING PROVIDER.  \u200b  OUR AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT PER COLOGUARD TEST, AS FURTHER DEFINED BELOW, WAS APPROXIMATELY $481 AND $470 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS CUMULATIVE AVERAGE COLOGUARD REIMBURSEMENT RATE WILL CHANGE OVER TIME DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, SUCH AS MEDICAL COVERAGE DECISIONS BY PAYERS, CHANGES IN THE PAYER MIX, THE EFFECTS OF CONTRACTS SIGNED WITH PAYERS, NON-RENEWAL OR TERMINATION OF PAYER CONTRACTS, CHANGES IN ALLOWED AMOUNTS BY PAYERS, OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY WIN APPEALS FOR PAYMENT, SETTLEMENTS REACHED WITH PAYERS REGARDING PREVIOUSLY DENIED CLAIMS AND OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT CASH PAYMENTS FROM PAYERS AND INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS. HISTORICAL AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT.  \u200b  WE CALCULATE THE AVERAGE COLOGUARD REIMBURSEMENT PER TEST ON A TRAILING TWELVE-MONTH BASIS FOR ALL TESTS THAT ARE AT LEAST SIX MONTHS OLD, SINCE IT CAN TAKE THAT LONG, OR IN SOME CASES LONGER, TO COLLECT FROM SOME PAYERS AND PATIENTS. THUS, THE AVERAGE REIMBURSEMENT PER TEST AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS THE TOTAL CASH COLLECTED THROUGH SUCH DATES FOR TESTS PERFORMED DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND MARCH 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF TESTS PERFORMED DURING THOSE SAME PERIODS.  \u200b  2019 PRIORITIES  \u200b  OUR TOP PRIORITIES FOR 2019 ARE TO (1) POWER OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH PFIZER, (2) ENHANCE COLOGUARD THROUGH LABEL EXPANSION AND PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS, AND (3) ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY.  \u200b  POWER THE PARTNERSHIP  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A PROMOTION AGREEMENT WITH PFIZER. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PROMOTION AGREEMENT, PFIZER AGREED TO PROMOTE COLOGUARD AND PROVIDE CERTAIN OTHER SALES AND MARKETING SERVICES. WE AND PFIZER COMMITTED IN THE PROMOTION AGREEMENT TO INVEST SPECIFIED AMOUNTS IN THE ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION OF COLOGUARD. PFIZER HAS A LARGE PRIMARY CARE SALES TEAM THAT HAS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE WITH LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM ORGANIZATIONS AND ENHANCES OUR PHYSICIAN AND CONSUMER MARKETING CAPABILITIES. A PRIORITY FOR 2019 IS EXECUTING ON THE PFIZER PARTNERSHIP IN ORDER TO GROW THE COLOGUARD BRAND AND GET MORE PATIENTS SCREENED.  \u200b  ENHANCE COLOGUARD  \u200b  IN MAY 2018, THE ACS UPDATED ITS GUIDELINES TO RECOMMEND COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING BEGIN AT AGE 45, RATHER THAN 50, FOR PEOPLE AT AVERAGE RISK OF THE DISEASE, DUE TO THE RISING INCIDENCE RATE WITHIN THE 45-49 YEAR-OLD POPULATION.  THERE ARE NEARLY 21 MILLION PEOPLE WHO ARE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45-49, AND WE ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY 19 MILLION OF THEM ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER AND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SCREENING UNDER THE ACS GUIDELINES. IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE OBTAINED FDA APPROVAL TO EXPAND COLOGUARD\u2019S INDICATION TO INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 45 AND 49 WHO ARE AT AVERAGE RISK FOR COLORECTAL CANCER.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  IN ADDITION, WE ARE SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE UPON COLOGUARD\u2019S PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE EVALUATING WHETHER NEW BIOMARKERS AND IMPROVED LABORATORY PROCESSES WOULD INCREASE SPECIFICITY WHILE MAINTAINING SENSITIVITY. IF WE COULD INCREASE THE SPECIFICITY OF COLOGUARD, WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD ENHANCE ITS ADOPTION AS A FRONT-LINE SCREENING TEST. WE ARE ALSO EVALUATING WAYS THAT WE MIGHT MAKE COLOGUARD EVEN EASIER FOR PATIENTS TO USE AND POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES TO LOWER THE COST OF GOODS SOLD FOR COLOGUARD.  \u200b  THE TIMING OF ANY SUCH ENHANCEMENTS TO COLOGUARD IS UNKNOWN AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO FDA APPROVAL.  \u200b  ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY  \u200b  WE ARE ALSO FOCUSING OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON BUILDING A PIPELINE OF POTENTIAL FUTURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH A FOCUS ON BLOOD OR OTHER FLUID-BASED (\u201cLIQUID BIOPSY\u201d) TESTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE LIQUID BIOPSY THROUGH BIOMARKER DISCOVERY AND VALIDATION IN TISSUE, BLOOD, OR OTHER FLUIDS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED PROPRIETARY BIOMARKERS FOR SEVERAL CANCERS, INCLUDING LIVER CANCER AND PANCREATIC CANCER. THROUGH OUR COLLABORATION WITH MAYO FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PERFORMED VALIDATION STUDIES ON TISSUE SAMPLES FOR THIRTEEN CANCERS AND ON BLOOD OR OTHER FLUID SAMPLES FOR NINE CANCERS.  \u200b  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u200b  WE HAVE GENERATED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION AND, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION. WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR LOSSES FOR THE NEAR FUTURE, AND IT IS POSSIBLE WE MAY NEVER ACHIEVE PROFITABILITY.  \u200b  REVENUE.  OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUE IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY PERFORMING SCREENING SERVICES USING OUR COLOGUARD TEST. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE COMPLETED APPROXIMATELY 456,000 AND 241,000 COLOGUARD TESTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND GENERATED REVENUE OF $218.8 MILLION AND $118.3 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN COMPLETED COLOGUARD TESTS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SELLING AND MARKETING EFFORTS.  \u200b  OUR COST STRUCTURE.  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF NON-RESEARCH PERSONNEL SALARIES, OFFICE EXPENSES, PROFESSIONAL FEES, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCURRED IN SUPPORT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS AND NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  \u200b  COST OF SALES INCLUDES COSTS RELATED TO INVENTORY PRODUCTION AND USAGE, SHIPMENT OF TEST COLLECTION KITS, ROYALTIES AND THE COST OF SERVICES TO PROCESS TESTS AND PROVIDE RESULTS TO PHYSICIANS. WE INCUR EXPENSES FOR TESTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE ACTIVITIES OCCUR, THEREFORE, GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE MAY VARY DUE TO COSTS BEING INCURRED IN ONE PERIOD THAT RELATE TO REVENUES RECOGNIZED IN A LATER PERIOD.  \u200b  WE EXPECT THAT GROSS MARGIN FOR OUR SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE AND BE AFFECTED BY COLOGUARD TEST VOLUME, OUR OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, PATIENT COMPLIANCE RATES, PAYER MIX, THE LEVELS OF REIMBURSEMENT, AND PAYMENT PATTERNS OF PAYERS AND PATIENTS.  \u200b  COST OF SALES.

THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS WELL AS THE REPORTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, TAX POSITIONS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u200b  WHILE OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR 2018 FORM 10-K, WE BELIEVE THAT THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND JUDGMENTS ARE MOST CRITICAL TO AID IN FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND EVALUATING OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u200b  REVENUE RECOGNITION  \u200b  REVENUE.  OUR REVENUE IS PRIMARILY GENERATED BY PERFORMING SCREENING SERVICES USING OUR COLOGUARD TEST, AND THE SERVICE IS COMPLETED UPON DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN. WE ACCOUNT FOR REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u201d), WHICH WE ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2018, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH WE ELECTED TO APPLY TO ALL CONTRACTS.  APPLICATION OF THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD DID NOT IMPACT AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY US, NOR DID IT REQUIRE A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT UPON ADOPTION, AS OUR METHOD OF RECOGNIZING REVENUE UNDER ASC 606 WAS ANALOGOUS TO THE METHOD UTILIZED IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO ADOPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT BY WHICH EACH FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE ITEM WAS AFFECTED AS A RESULT OF APPLYING THE NEW STANDARD AND AN EXPLANATION OF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.  THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FROM OUR COLOGUARD TEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT CORE PRINCIPLE, AND KEY ASPECTS CONSIDERED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u200b  CONTRACTS  \u200b  OUR CUSTOMER IS THE PATIENT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ENTER INTO A FORMAL REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT, AS FORMAL REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING A NATIONAL COVERAGE DETERMINATION FOR COLOGUARD BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (\u201cCMS\u201d), ARE ESTABLISHED WITH PAYERS.  ACCORDINGLY, WE ESTABLISH A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH OTHER CUSTOMARY BUSINESS PRACTICES.  \u200b  \u25cf  APPROVAL OF A CONTRACT IS ESTABLISHED VIA THE ORDER SUBMITTED BY THE PATIENT\u2019S PHYSICIAN AND THE RETURN OF A SAMPLE BY THE PATIENT.  \u25cf  WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM OUR LABORATORY SERVICES UPON RECEIPT OF A SAMPLE FROM A PATIENT, AND THE PATIENT AND/OR APPLICABLE PAYER ARE OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US FOR SERVICES RENDERED BASED ON THE PATIENT\u2019S INSURANCE BENEFITS.  \u25cf  PAYMENT TERMS ARE A FUNCTION OF A PATIENT\u2019S EXISTING INSURANCE BENEFITS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF COVERAGE DECISIONS WITH CMS AND APPLICABLE REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS ESTABLISHED BETWEEN US AND PAYERS, UNLESS THE PATIENT IS A SELF-PAY PATIENT, WHEREBY WE REQUIRE PAYMENT FROM THE PATIENT PRIOR TO US SHIPPING A COLLECTION KIT TO THE PATIENT.  \u25cf  ONCE WE DELIVER A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, WE ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO COLLECT PAYMENT AND BILL AN INSURER AND/OR PATIENT AND DEPENDING ON PAYER CONTRACT STATUS OR PATIENT INSURANCE BENEFIT STATUS.  \u25cf  OUR CONSIDERATION IS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE, AND WE CONSIDER COLLECTION OF SUCH CONSIDERATION TO BE PROBABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS UNCONSTRAINED.  \u200b  PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS  \u200b  A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE (OR A BUNDLE OF GOODS OR SERVICES) TO THE CUSTOMER. OUR CONTRACTS HAVE A SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, WHICH IS SATISFIED UPON RENDERING OF SERVICES, WHICH CULMINATES IN THE DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S COLOGUARD TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN.  THE DURATION OF TIME BETWEEN SAMPLE RECEIPT AND DELIVERY OF A VALID TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN TWO WEEKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ELECT THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AND THEREFORE, WE DO NOT DISCLOSE THE VALUE OF UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  \u200b  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTION PRICE  \u200b  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO COLLECT IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER, EXCLUDING AMOUNTS COLLECTED ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES (FOR EXAMPLE, SOME SALES TAXES). THE CONSIDERATION EXPECTED FROM A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER MAY INCLUDE FIXED AMOUNTS, VARIABLE AMOUNTS, OR BOTH.  \u200b  THE CONSIDERATION DERIVED FROM OUR CONTRACTS IS DEEMED TO BE VARIABLE, THOUGH THE VARIABILITY IS NOT EXPLICITLY STATED IN ANY CONTRACT. RATHER, THE IMPLIED VARIABILITY IS DUE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, ANY PATIENT CO-PAYMENTS, DEDUCTIBLES OR ADHERENCE INCENTIVES, THE EXISTENCE OF SECONDARY PAYERS AND CLAIM DENIALS.  \u200b  WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION USING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD, WHICH REPRESENTS THE SUM OF PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED AMOUNTS IN A RANGE OF POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION AMOUNTS. WHEN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS, SUCH AS HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS EXPERIENCE, PATIENT INSURANCE ELIGIBILITY AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS.  \u200b  WE LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE UNCONSTRAINED PORTION OF SUCH CONSIDERATION.  IN OTHER WORDS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE UP TO THE AMOUNT OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL UNTIL ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED OR THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS OR REFUNDS IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORIGINAL ESTIMATES AND SUBSEQUENT REVISIONS, INCLUDING FINAL SETTLEMENTS, REPRESENT CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH REVISIONS ARE MADE. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICES WAS $1.2 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FROM CHANGES IN TRANSACTION PRICES WAS $4.6 MILLION AND $14.2 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  WE MONITOR OUR ESTIMATES OF TRANSACTION PRICE TO DEPICT CONDITIONS THAT EXIST AT EACH REPORTING DATE. IF WE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINE THAT WE WILL COLLECT MORE CONSIDERATION THAN WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED FOR A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT, WE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE AS AN INCREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (I.E., AN UPWARD REVENUE ADJUSTMENT) IN THE PERIOD IDENTIFIED. SIMILARLY, IF WE SUBSEQUENTLY DETERMINE THAT THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO COLLECT FROM A PATIENT IS LESS THAN WE ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED, WE WILL GENERALLY ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE AS A DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (I.E., A DOWNWARD REVENUE ADJUSTMENT), PROVIDED THAT SUCH DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT DOES NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED.  \u200b  WHEN WE DO NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR THAT EXPERIENCE HAS LIMITED PREDICTIVE VALUE, THE CONSTRAINT OVER ESTIMATES OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION MAY RESULT IN NO REVENUE BEING RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S COLOGUARD TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, WITH RECOGNITION GENERALLY OCCURRING AT THE DATE OF CASH RECEIPT.  \u200b  ALLOCATE TRANSACTION PRICE  \u200b  THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO THE SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONTAINED IN A CONTRACT WITH A PATIENT.  \u200b  POINT IN TIME RECOGNITION  \u200b  OUR SINGLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME, AND THAT POINT IN TIME IS DEFINED AS THE DATE A PATIENT\u2019S SUCCESSFUL TEST RESULT IS DELIVERED TO THE PATIENT\u2019S ORDERING PHYSICIAN. WE CONSIDER THIS DATE TO BE THE TIME AT WHICH THE PATIENT OBTAINS CONTROL OF THE PROMISED COLOGUARD TEST SERVICE.  \u200b  48  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE  \u200b  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR REVENUES DISAGGREGATED BY REVENUE SOURCE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  MEDICARE PARTS B & C  \u200b  $108,617  \u200b  $65,870  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  \u200b  99,352  \u200b  \u200b  48,624  OTHER  \u200b  \u200b  10,836  \u200b  \u200b  3,797  TOTAL  \u200b  $218,805  \u200b  $118,291  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  \u200b  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  MEDICARE PARTS B & C  \u200b  $295,103  \u200b  $178,052  COMMERCIAL  \u200b  \u200b  261,521  \u200b  \u200b  123,045  OTHER  \u200b  \u200b  24,094  \u200b  \u200b  10,384  TOTAL  \u200b  $580,718  \u200b  $311,481  \u200b  CONTRACT BALANCES  \u200b  THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION, BILLINGS AND CASH COLLECTIONS RESULTS IN BILLED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. GENERALLY, BILLING OCCURS SUBSEQUENT TO DELIVERY OF A PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN, RESULTING IN AN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE. HOWEVER, WE SOMETIMES RECEIVE ADVANCE PAYMENT FROM A PATIENT, PARTICULARLY A SELF-PAY PATIENT, BEFORE A COLOGUARD TEST RESULT IS COMPLETED, RESULTING IN DEFERRED REVENUE. THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE IS RELIEVED UPON DELIVERY OF THE APPLICABLE PATIENT\u2019S TEST RESULT TO THE ORDERING PHYSICIAN.  CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND DEFERRED REVENUE WERE NOT MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY ANY OTHER FACTORS.  \u200b  DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCES ARE REPORTED IN OTHER SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND WERE $0.7 MILLION AND $0.5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PERIOD WAS $0.2 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE DEFERRED REVENUE BALANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH PERIOD, WAS $0.5 MILLION AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  \u200b  PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS  \u200b  WE DO NOT ADJUST THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE EFFECTS OF A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT, AS AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WE EXPECT THE COLLECTION CYCLE TO BE ONE YEAR OR LESS.  \u200b  WE EXPENSE SALES COMMISSIONS WHEN INCURRED BECAUSE THE AMORTIZATION PERIOD WOULD HAVE BEEN ONE YEAR OR LESS.  THESE COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  WE INCUR CERTAIN OTHER COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER A CONTRACT IS OBTAINED. SUCH COSTS ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO LEGAL SERVICES AND PATIENT COMMUNICATIONS (E.G. COMPLIANCE REMINDER LETTERS).  THESE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND RECORDED WITHIN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  49  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY IS STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET VALUE (NET REALIZABLE VALUE). WE DETERMINE THE COST OF INVENTORY USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST OUT METHOD (\u201cFIFO\u201d). WE ESTIMATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INVENTORY BY REFERENCE TO INTERNAL ESTIMATES OF FUTURE DEMANDS AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, INCLUDING EXPIRATION. WE PERIODICALLY ANALYZE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO IDENTIFY INVENTORY THAT MAY EXPIRE PRIOR TO EXPECTED SALE OR HAS A COST BASIS IN EXCESS OF ITS ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE AND RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES FOR SUCH INVENTORY, AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, OUR PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO STRICT QUALITY CONTROL AND MONITORING WHICH WE PERFORM THROUGHOUT THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS. IF CERTAIN BATCHES OR UNITS OF PRODUCT NO LONGER MEET QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS OR BECOME OBSOLETE DUE TO EXPIRATION, WE RECORD A CHARGE TO COST OF SALES TO WRITE DOWN SUCH UNMARKETABLE INVENTORY TO ITS ESTIMATED REALIZABLE VALUE.  \u200b  DIRECT AND INDIRECT MANUFACTURING COSTS INCURRED DURING PROCESS VALIDATION AND FOR OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE NOT PERMITTED TO BE SOLD, HAVE BEEN EXPENSED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u200b  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, ALL STOCK-BASED PAYMENTS, INCLUDING GRANTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARDS AND SHARES PURCHASED UNDER AN EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (\u201cESPP\u201d) (IF CERTAIN PARAMETERS ARE NOT MET), ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF MARKET MEASURE-BASED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS ARE CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE FOR STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND ESPP SHARES.  \u200b  \u25cf  VALUATION AND RECOGNITION  \u2014 THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF SERVICE-BASED AWARDS FOR EACH RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THAT DAY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED TO EXPENSE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. FOR AWARDS ISSUED TO NON-EMPLOYEES, THE MEASUREMENT DATE IS THE DATE WHEN THE PERFORMANCE IS COMPLETE OR WHEN THE AWARD VESTS, WHICHEVER IS THE EARLIEST. ACCORDINGLY, NON-EMPLOYEE AWARDS ARE RE-MEASURED AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD UNTIL THE FINAL MEASUREMENT DATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD IS RECOGNIZED AS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD, GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD. THE BLACK-SCHOLES AND MONTE CARLO PRICING MODELS UTILIZE THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.  \u200b  \u25cf  EXPECTED TERM  - EXPECTED TERM IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL LIFE DATA AND IS DETERMINED USING THE AVERAGE OF THE VESTING PERIOD AND THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED. EXPECTED LIFE OF A MARKET MEASURE-BASED AWARD IS BASED ON THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.  \u200b  \u25cf  EXPECTED VOLATILITY  - EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL STOCK VOLATILITY DATA OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE AWARDS.  \u200b  \u25cf  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE  - WE BASE THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE USED IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES AND MONTE CARLO VALUATION MODELS ON THE IMPLIED YIELD CURRENTLY AVAILABLE ON U.S. TREASURY ZERO-COUPON ISSUES WITH AN EQUIVALENT EXPECTED TERM.  \u200b  \u25cf  FORFEITURES  - WE RECORD THE EFFECTS OF ACTUAL FORFEITURES AT THE TIME THEY OCCUR.  \u200b  THE FAIR VALUE OF SERVICE-BASED AWARDS FOR EACH RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT IS DETERMINED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THAT DAY. THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKET MEASURE-BASED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS ARE CALCULATED USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PRICING MODEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH OPTION AWARD IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE BLACK SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL BASED ON THE ASSUMPTIONS NOTED ABOVE AND AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5 IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  WE ACCOUNT FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH OR EQUITY UPON CONVERSION BY SEPARATING THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE INSTRUMENTS IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE. IN JANUARY 2018 AND JUNE 2018, WE ISSUED THE 2025 NOTES OF $690.0 MILLION AND $218.5 MILLION, IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.0% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A MATURITY DATE OF JANUARY 15, 2025. IN MARCH 2019 WE ISSUED THE 2027 NOTES OF $747.5 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 0.375% CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A MATURITY DATE OF MARCH 15, 2027. IN MARCH 2019, WE SETTLED APPROXIMATELY $493.4 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING 2025  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NOTES. WE DETERMINED THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES BY USING ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING A DEBT INSTRUMENT, INCLUDING MARKET INTEREST RATES, CREDIT STANDING, YIELD CURVES AND VOLATILITIES. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE DEBT COMPONENT REQUIRES THE USE OF ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE JUDGMENTAL IN NATURE AND COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE DEBT COMPONENT, AND THE ASSOCIATED NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE.  \u200b  FOR THE JANUARY 2018 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $194.9 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE SEVEN-YEAR TERM OF THE 2025 NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. FOR THE JUNE 2018 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $73.0 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT, LESS THE $14.2 MILLION PREMIUM, IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE 2025 NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING SIX-AND-A-HALF-YEAR TERM OF THE NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. FOR THE MARCH 2019 OFFERING, WE ALLOCATED $275.0 MILLION TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT. THAT EQUITY COMPONENT IS TREATED AS A DISCOUNT ON THE LIABILITY COMPONENT OF THE NOTES, WHICH IS AMORTIZED OVER THE EIGHT-YEAR TERM OF THE 2027 NOTES USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE METHOD. IN ADDITION, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE NOTES WERE $18.8 MILLION, $7.4 MILLION, AND $18.0 MILLION FOR THE JANUARY 2018, JUNE 2018, AND MARCH 2019 OFFERINGS, RESPECTIVELY. WE ALLOCATED THE COSTS TO THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE VALUES. THE DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ALLOCATED TO THE LIABILITY COMPONENT ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES AS ADDITIONAL NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE. THE TRANSACTION COSTS ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY COMPONENT ARE NETTED WITH THE EQUITY COMPONENT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENT IN STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY.  \u200b  GOODWILL.  IN 2018, WE RECOGNIZED GOODWILL OF $15.3 MILLION FROM THE ACQUISITION OF BIOMATRICA. WE EVALUATE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS OR MORE FREQUENTLY SHOULD AN EVENT OR CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCE OCCUR THAT INDICATES THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT IS IN EXCESS OF THE FAIR VALUE. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 OR 2018. REFER TO NOTE 2 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE GOODWILL RECORDED.  \u200b  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  \u200b  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  \u200b  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  AND SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS TO THE INITIAL GUIDANCE: ASU 2017-13, ASU 2018-10, ASU 2018-11, ASU 2018-20 AND ASU 2019-01  ,  (COLLECTIVELY, \u201cUPDATE 2016-02\u201d). UPDATE 2016-02 REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET, INCLUDING THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS GAAP. UPDATE 2016-02 PROVIDES AN OPTION OF RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. WE ADOPTED UPDATE 2016-02 ON JANUARY 1, 2019 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD OF ADOPTION. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, WE RECORDED AN OPENING RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET BALANCE OF $20.6 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE ALSO RECORDED AN OPENING LEASE LIABILITY OF $20.1 MILLION, OF WHICH $3.0 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES AND $17.1 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED IN LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 9 FOR MORE DETAIL.  \u200b  IN JUNE 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07 (TOPIC 718),  IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING,  (\u201cUPDATE 2018-07\u201d). UPDATE 2018-07 EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS TO TOPIC 718 TO NONEMPLOYEE AWARDS EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS SPECIFIED IN THE AMENDMENT. WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2019, AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  IN JULY 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2018-09,  CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS  , (\"UPDATE 2018-09\"). UPDATE 2018-09 PROVIDED VARIOUS MINOR CODIFICATION UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS TO ADDRESS COMMENTS THAT THE FASB HAD RECEIVED REGARDING UNCLEAR OR VAGUE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JANUARY 1, 2019, AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JULY 2019, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU NO. 2019-07,  AMENDMENTS TO SEC PARAGRAPHS PURSUANT TO SEC FINAL RULE RELEASES NO. 33-10532, DISCLOSURE UPDATE AND SIMPLIFICATION, AND NOS. 33-10231 AND 33-10442, INVESTMENT COMPANY REPORTING MODERNIZATION, AND MISCELLANEOUS UPDATES  (\u201cUPDATE 2019-07\u201d). UPDATE 2019-07 SIMPLIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN CERTAIN AREAS TO AVOID REDUNDANT DISCLOSURES. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE WERE EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE. WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON JULY 1, 2019, AND IT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2018-13,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820); DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK - CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  , (\"UPDATE 2018-13\"). UPDATE 2018-13 PROVIDED AN UPDATE TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS UNDER THE SCOPE OF ASC 820. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE GUIDANCE ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2018-15,  INTANGIBLES \u2013 GOODWILL AND OTHER \u2013 INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE  , (\u201cUPDATE 2018-15\u201d). UPDATE 2018-15 PROVIDED GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING THE ACCOUNTING FOR FEES PAID BY A CUSTOMER IN A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT THAT IS A SERVICE CONTRACT. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE GUIDANCE ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  IN NOVEMBER 2018, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2018-18,  COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS (TOPIC 808)  , (\u201cUPDATE 2018-18\u201d). UPDATE 2018-18 PROVIDED ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE REGARDING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TOPIC 808 ON COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND TOPIC 606 ON REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE GUIDANCE ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  \u200b  IN APRIL 2019, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ASU 2019-04,  CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 326, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \u2013 CREDIT LOSSES, TOPIC 815, DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, AND TOPIC 825, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,  (\u201cUPDATE 2019-04\u201d). UPDATE 2019-04 PROVIDES CLARITY REGARDING MEASUREMENT OF SECURITIES WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES TO THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS APPEARING ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO AND MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MARCH 1, 2019, OR OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. AS A RESULT OF MANY FACTORS, SUCH AS THOSE SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 1A. (RISK FACTORS) OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q AND PART I, ITEM 1A. (RISK FACTORS) OF OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT, AND  OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OUR COMPANY  WE ARE A SCIENCE-LED GLOBAL BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY FOCUSED ON THE DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF CLINICALLY-DIFFERENTIATED MEDICINES THAT PROVIDE BENEFITS TO PATIENTS WITH RARE DISORDERS. OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE PRODUCTS IS THE FOUNDATION THAT DRIVES OUR CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN A ROBUST PIPELINE OF TRANSFORMATIVE MEDICINES AND OUR MISSION TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO BEST-IN-CLASS TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE AN UNMET MEDICAL NEED. OUR STRATEGY IS TO BRING BEST-IN-CLASS THERAPIES WITH DIFFERENTIATED CLINICAL BENEFIT TO PATIENTS AFFECTED BY RARE DISORDERS AND TO LEVERAGE OUR GLOBAL COMMERCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAXIMIZE VALUE FOR OUR PATIENTS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS.  CORPORATE UPDATES  DMD FRANCHISE  WE HAVE TWO PRODUCTS, TRANSLARNATM (ATALUREN) AND EMFLAZATM (DEFLAZACORT), FOR THE TREATMENT OF DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, OR DMD, A RARE, LIFE THREATENING DISORDER.  TRANSLARNA RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IN AUGUST 2014 FOR THE TREATMENT OF NONSENSE MUTATION DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY, OR NMDMD, IN AMBULATORY PATIENTS AGED FIVE YEARS AND OLDER IN THE 31 MEMBER STATES OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA, OR EEA. IN JULY 2018, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION APPROVED A LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST TO OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA TO INCLUDE PATIENTS FROM TWO TO UP TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED  $48.3 MILLION  IN NET SALES FROM TRANSLARNA.  TRANSLARNA IS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN OVER  40  COUNTRIES ON A COMMERCIAL BASIS OR THROUGH A REIMBURSED EARLY ACCESS PROGRAM, OR EAP PROGRAM. WE HOLD WORLDWIDE COMMERCIALIZATION RIGHTS TO TRANSLARNA FOR ALL INDICATIONS IN ALL TERRITORIES. EMFLAZA IS APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN PATIENTS TWO YEARS AND OLDER. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , EMFLAZA ACHIEVED NET SALES OF  $22.9 MILLION.  OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA IS SUBJECT TO ANNUAL REVIEW AND RENEWAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOLLOWING REASSESSMENT BY THE EUROPEAN MEDICINES AGENCY, OR EMA, OF THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE OF THE AUTHORIZATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE ANNUAL EMA REASSESSMENT. IN JULY 2019, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION RENEWED OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION, MAKING  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IT EFFECTIVE, UNLESS EXTENDED, THROUGH AUGUST 5, 2020. THIS MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IS FURTHER SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT AND SUBMIT THE RESULTS OF AN 18-MONTH, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL, FOLLOWED BY AN 18-MONTH OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION, WHICH WE REFER TO TOGETHER AS STUDY 041. THE FINAL REPORT ON THE TRIAL AND OPEN-LABEL EXTENSION IS TO BE SUBMITTED BY US TO THE EMA BY THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2022.  IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SUBMITTED TO THE EMA A LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST TO OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA TO INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO ARE NON-AMBULATORY. IN JUNE 2019, THE COMMITTEE FOR MEDICINAL PRODUCTS FOR HUMAN USE, OR CHMP, OF THE EMA INFORMED US THAT IT HAD ADOPTED A NEGATIVE OPINION OF OUR LABEL-EXTENSION REQUEST. WE REQUESTED A RE-EXAMINATION OF THE PROCEDURE AND IN OCTOBER 2019 THE NEGATIVE OPINION WAS AFFIRMED.  IN APRIL 2019 WE RECEIVED APPROVAL FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA IN BRAZIL FROM ANVISA, THE BRAZILIAN HEALTH REGULATORY AUTHORITY, FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN AMBULATORY PATIENTS AGED FIVE YEARS AND OLDER.  EACH COUNTRY, INCLUDING EACH MEMBER STATE OF THE EEA, HAS ITS OWN PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT REGULATIONS. IN ORDER TO COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SALE OF PRODUCT PURSUANT TO OUR TRANSLARNA MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY IN THE EEA, WE MUST FINALIZE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE APPLICABLE GOVERNMENT BODY IN SUCH COUNTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON A COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY BASIS. WE ALSO HAVE MADE, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO MAKE, PRODUCT AVAILABLE UNDER EAP PROGRAMS, BOTH IN COUNTRIES IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES. OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN REIMBURSEMENT FOR PRODUCT UNDER COMMERCIAL AND EAP PROGRAMS CAN BE SUBJECT TO CHALLENGE IN ANY PARTICULAR COUNTRY AND CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED BY POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN SUCH COUNTRY.  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW OUR EEA MARKETING AUTHORIZATION DURING ANY ANNUAL RENEWAL CYCLE, OR IF OUR PRODUCT LABEL IS MATERIALLY RESTRICTED, OR IF STUDY 041 DOES NOT PROVIDE THE DATA NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION, WE WOULD LOSE ALL, OR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES.  TRANSLARNA IS AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG IN THE UNITED STATES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE FILED A NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR NDA, FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OVER PROTEST WITH THE UNITED STATES FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, OR FDA. IN OCTOBER 2017, THE OFFICE OF DRUG EVALUATION I OF THE FDA ISSUED A COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER FOR THE NDA, STATING THAT IT WAS UNABLE TO APPROVE THE APPLICATION IN ITS CURRENT FORM. IN RESPONSE, WE FILED A FORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION REQUEST WITH THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS OF THE FDA. IN FEBRUARY 2018, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS OF THE FDA DENIED OUR APPEAL OF THE COMPLETE RESPONSE LETTER. IN ITS RESPONSE, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS RECOMMENDED A POSSIBLE PATH FORWARD FOR THE ATALUREN NDA SUBMISSION BASED ON THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL PATHWAY. THIS WOULD INVOLVE A RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA CONTAINING THE CURRENT DATA ON EFFECTIVENESS OF ATALUREN WITH NEW DATA TO BE GENERATED ON DYSTROPHIN PRODUCTION IN NMDMD PATIENTS\u2019 MUSCLES. WE INTEND TO FOLLOW THE FDA\u2019S RECOMMENDATION AND WILL COLLECT, USING NEWER TECHNOLOGIES VIA PROCEDURES AND METHODS THAT WE DESIGNED, SUCH DYSTROPHIN DATA IN A NEW STUDY, STUDY 045, WHICH WE INITIATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018. WE EXPECT THAT A POTENTIAL RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA COULD OCCUR IN 2020. ADDITIONALLY, SHOULD A RE-SUBMISSION OF AN NDA RECEIVE ACCELERATED APPROVAL, THE OFFICE OF NEW DRUGS STATED THAT STUDY 041, WHICH IS CURRENTLY ENROLLING, COULD SERVE AS THE CONFIRMATORY POST-APPROVAL TRIAL REQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACCELERATED APPROVAL FRAMEWORK.  THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT STUDY 045, OR ANY OTHER STUDIES WE MAY USE TO COLLECT THE DYSTROPHIN DATA, WILL NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DATA TO SUPPORT A MARKETING APPROVAL FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE U.S.  EMFLAZA WAS INITIALLY APPROVED IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN PATIENTS FIVE YEARS AND OLDER. IN JUNE 2019, THE FDA APPROVED OUR LABEL EXPANSION REQUEST FOR EMFLAZA FOR PATIENTS TWO TO FIVE YEARS OF AGE.  GENE THERAPY PLATFORM  WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF GENE THERAPY PRODUCT CANDIDATES FOR RARE MONOGENIC DISEASES THAT AFFECT THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, OR CNS, INCLUDING PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AROMATIC L-AMINO ACID DECARBOXYLASE, OR AADC, DEFICIENCY, OR AADC DEFICIENCY, A RARE CNS DISORDER ARISING FROM REDUCTIONS IN THE ENZYME AADC THAT RESULT FROM MUTATIONS IN THE DOPA DECARBOXYLASE GENE. WE ARE PREPARING A BIOLOGICS LICENSE APPLICATION, OR BLA, FOR PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AADC DEFICIENCY IN THE UNITED STATES, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE SUBMITTING TO THE FDA IN LATE 2019, WITH AN ANTICIPATED COMMERCIAL LAUNCH IN 2020. WE ARE ALSO PREPARING A MARKETING AUTHORIZATION APPLICATION, OR MAA, FOR PTC-AADC FOR THE TREATMENT OF AADC DEFICIENCY IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, OR EU, FOR SUBMISSION TO THE EMA, WHICH WILL FOLLOW OUR BLA SUBMISSION TO THE FDA.  OUR GENE THERAPY PLATFORM ALSO INCLUDES A GENE THERAPY ASSET TARGETING FRIEDREICH ATAXIA, A RARE AND LIFE-SHORTENING NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE CAUSED BY A SINGLE DEFECT IN THE FXN GENE WHICH CAUSES REDUCED PRODUCTION OF THE FRATAXIN PROTEIN. WE EXPECT TO SUBMIT AN INVESTIGATIONAL NEW DRUG APPLICATION, OR IND, TO THE FDA FOR THIS PROGRAM MID-YEAR 2020.  AKCEA PARTNERSHIP  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE HOLD THE RIGHTS FOR THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF TEGSEDITM (INOTERSEN) AND WAYLIVRATM (VOLANESORSEN) FOR THE TREATMENT OF RARE DISEASES IN COUNTRIES IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN, OR THE PTC TERRITORY, PURSUANT TO OUR COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH AKCEA THERAPEUTICS, INC, OR THE AKCEA AGREEMENT.  TEGSEDI HAS RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE U.S., EU AND CANADA FOR THE TREATMENT OF STAGE 1 OR STAGE 2 POLYNEUROPATHY IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH HATTR AMYLOIDOSIS. TEGSEDI ALSO RECEIVED MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FROM ANVISA IN OCTOBER 2019 FOR THE TREATMENT OF STAGE 1 OR STAGE 2 POLYNEUROPATHY IN ADULT PATIENTS WITH HATTR AMYLOIDOSIS IN BRAZIL.  WAYLIVRA HAS RECEIVED CONDITIONAL MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EU FOR THE TREATMENT OF FAMILIAL CHYLOMICRONEMIA SYNDROME, OR FCS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONDITIONAL MARKETING APPROVAL FOR WAYLIVRA IN THE EU, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IS REQUIRING AKCEA TO PROVIDE RESULTS OF A STUDY BASED ON A REGISTRY OF PATIENTS TO INVESTIGATE HOW BLOOD CHECKS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO FREQUENCY OF INJECTIONS ARE CARRIED OUT IN PRACTICE AND HOW WELL THEY WORK TO PREVENT THROMBOCYTOPENIA AND BLEEDING IN FCS PATIENTS TAKING WAYLIVRA. WAYLIVRA IS NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED FOR MARKETING IN THE PTC TERRITORY.  SPLICING PLATFORM  WE ALSO HAVE A SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY, OR SMA, COLLABORATION WITH F. HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE LTD. AND HOFFMAN-LA ROCHE INC., WHICH WE REFER TO COLLECTIVELY AS ROCHE, AND THE SPINAL MUSCULAR ATROPHY FOUNDATION, OR SMA FOUNDATION. CURRENTLY, OUR COLLABORATION HAS TWO PIVOTAL CLINICAL TRIALS ONGOING TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF RISDIPLAM (RG7916, RO7034067), THE LEAD COMPOUND IN THE SMA PROGRAM. ROCHE IS PREPARING AN NDA AND AN MAA FOR RISDIPLAM FOR THE TREATMENT OF SMA IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE EU, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ROCHE ANTICIPATES SUBMITTING TO THE FDA IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019 AND THE EMA IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2020.  IN COLLABORATION WITH MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL AND NEW YORK UNIVERSITY, WE HAD IDENTIFIED THE SPLICING COMPOUND PTC258, WHICH IS A SPLICING MODIFIER THAT RESTORES IKAP LEVELS, TARGETING FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA. BASED ON INITIAL FEEDBACK FROM THE FDA ON THE DIFFICULTY FOR A CLINICAL PATHWAY FOR THE SMALL POPULATION OF PATIENTS, THE FAMILIAL DYSAUTONOMIA ORAL SPLICING PROGRAM HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED.  PRE-CLINICAL AND OTHER PROGRAMS  IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A PIPELINE OF PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND DISCOVERY PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN EARLY CLINICAL, PRE-CLINICAL AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT STAGES FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TREATMENTS FOR MULTIPLE THERAPEUTIC AREAS, INCLUDING RARE DISEASES AND ONCOLOGY.  FUNDING  THE SUCCESS OF OUR PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES WE MAY DEVELOP, DEPENDS LARGELY ON OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING REIMBURSEMENT FROM GOVERNMENTS AND THIRD-PARTY INSURERS. OUR REVENUES ARE PRIMARILY GENERATED FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES WHERE WE ARE PERMITTED TO DISTRIBUTE TRANSLARNA UNDER OUR EAP PROGRAMS AND IN COUNTRIES IN THE EEA WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE COMMERCIAL PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS, AND FROM SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  TO DATE, WE HAVE FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OFFERING OF 3.0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE AUGUST 15, 2022, OR THE 2022 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, OUR OFFERING OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE SEPTEMBER 15, 2026, OR THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AND TOGETHER WITH THE 2022 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, OUR PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMMON STOCK IN FEBRUARY 2014, OCTOBER 2014, APRIL 2018, JANUARY 2019, AND SEPTEMBER 2019, \"AT THE MARKET OFFERINGS\" OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF COMMON STOCK IN JUNE 2013, PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK, COLLABORATIONS, BANK DEBT, A CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, OR THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WITH MIDCAP FINANCIAL TRUST, OR MIDCAP FINANCIAL, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT AND MIDCAP FINANCIAL AND OTHER CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS AS LENDERS THERETO, AND GRANTS AND CLINICAL TRIAL SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE DISEASE AREAS ADDRESSED BY OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. SINCE 2014, WE HAVE ALSO RELIED ON REVENUE GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND IN MAY 2017, WE BEGAN TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR A SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY OF $60 MILLION, OF WHICH $40 MILLION WAS DRAWN BY US ON MAY 5, 2017. OUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON THE REMAINING $20 MILLION UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS MAY 1, 2021, UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE MADE LOAN REPAYMENTS OF $6.7 MILLION  ON THE CREDIT FACILITY.

WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $2.6 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING UNDERWRITING DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND OTHER OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  IN SEPTEMBER 2019, WE CLOSED AN UNDERWRITTEN PUBLIC OFFERING OF OUR COMMON STOCK PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. WE ISSUED AND SOLD AN AGGREGATE OF  2,475,248  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT AT A PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE OF  $40.40  PER SHARE.

THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES BEAR CASH INTEREST AT A RATE OF 1.5% PER YEAR, PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON MARCH 15 AND SEPTEMBER 15 OF EACH YEAR, BEGINNING ON MARCH 15, 2020. THE 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES WILL MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2026, UNLESS EARLIER REPURCHASED OR CONVERTED. WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF  $279.3 MILLION  AFTER DEDUCTING THE INITIAL PURCHASERS\u2019 DISCOUNTS AND COMMISSIONS AND THE OFFERING EXPENSES PAYABLE BY US.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF  $1,112.8 MILLION  . WE HAD A NET LOSS OF  $173.9 MILLION  AND  $79.8 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EEA, LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER TERRITORIES, INCLUDING THE EXPANSION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CORRESPONDING SALES AND MARKETING, LEGAL AND REGULATORY, DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND EMPLOYEE-BASED EXPENSES. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH STUDY 041 AND STUDY 045 AND OUR OPEN LABEL EXTENSION TRIALS OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AS WELL AS OUR STUDIES FOR NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA AND NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5 AND OUR FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES AND STUDIES FOR LIMB-GIRDLE 2I. WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCUR ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE OUR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS. WE HAVE BEGUN SEEKING AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE EEA AND WE MAY ALSO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR OTHER INDICATIONS. IN LATE  2019, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE FDA, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE EMA. THESE EFFORTS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EXPENSES.  WE MAY SEEK TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH OPPORTUNISTICALLY IN-LICENSING OR ACQUIRING THE RIGHTS TO PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR TECHNOLOGIES AND WE MAY INCUR EXPENSES, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO TRANSACTION COSTS, SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT COSTS OR ANY UPFRONT, MILESTONE OR OTHER PAYMENTS OR OTHER FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SUCH TRANSACTION, WHICH WOULD INCREASE OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUTSTANDING 2022 AND 2026 CONVERTIBLE NOTES, CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS IN ARREARS, WHICH REQUIRE TOTAL FUNDING OF $8.8 MILLION ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CASH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY IN ARREARS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2013, WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, INVESTOR RELATIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES.  WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PROFITABLE AND WE WILL NEED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY, AND WE MAY NEVER DO SO. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE CAPITAL WHEN NEEDED OR ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, WE COULD BE FORCED TO DELAY, REDUCE OR ELIMINATE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OR OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  FINANCIAL OPERATIONS OVERVIEW  TO DATE, OUR NET PRODUCT SALES HAVE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.

IN NOVEMBER 2011, WE ENTERED INTO A LICENSE AND COLLABORATION AGREEMENT, OR LICENSING AGREEMENT, WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION PURSUANT TO WHICH WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND COMMERCIALIZE COMPOUNDS IDENTIFIED UNDER OUR SMA PROGRAM WITH THE SMA FOUNDATION. THE RESEARCH COMPONENT OF THIS AGREEMENT TERMINATED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2014. THE LICENSING AGREEMENT INCLUDED A $30 MILLION UPFRONT PAYMENT MADE IN 2011 WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED ON A DEFERRED BASIS OVER THE RESEARCH TERM, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UP TO $460 MILLION IN MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES ON NET SALES.  IN AUGUST 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THE SELECTION OF A DEVELOPMENT CANDIDATE. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $10.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE, WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013.  IN JANUARY 2014, WE INITIATED A PHASE 1 CLINICAL PROGRAM, WHICH TRIGGERED A $7.5 MILLION MILESTONE PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  IN NOVEMBER 2014, WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN SMA WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION HAD STARTED A PHASE 2 STUDY IN ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $10.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014.  IN OCTOBER 2017, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE JOINT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN SMA WITH ROCHE AND SMA FOUNDATION HAD TRANSITIONED INTO THE PIVOTAL SECOND PART OF ITS STUDY EVALUATING THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF RG7916 IN PEDIATRIC AND ADULT TYPE 2/3 SMA PATIENTS. THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THIS MILESTONE TRIGGERED A $20.0 MILLION PAYMENT TO US FROM ROCHE WHICH WE RECORDED AS COLLABORATION REVENUE AT TIME OF ACHIEVEMENT.  GRANT REVENUE.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE GRANT FUNDING FROM VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. THE GRANTS ARE TYPICALLY FOR EARLY DISCOVERY RESEARCH, AND GENERALLY SUCH GRANT PROGRAMS LAST FROM TWO TO FIVE YEARS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES, AS WELL AS THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR DRUG DISCOVERY EFFORTS, CONDUCTING PRECLINICAL STUDIES AND CLINICAL TRIALS, MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO REGULATORY FILINGS. OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES CONSIST OF.  \u00b7    EXTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED UNDER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS AND INVESTIGATIVE SITES, THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSULTANTS;  \u00b7    EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, FOR THE PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN OUR DRUG DISCOVERY AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; AND  \u00b7    FACILITIES, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER ALLOCATED EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE DIRECT AND ALLOCATED EXPENSES FOR RENT AND MAINTENANCE OF FACILITIES, IT, HUMAN RESOURCES AND OTHER SUPPORT FUNCTIONS, DEPRECIATION OF LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS AND EQUIPMENT, AND LABORATORY AND OTHER SUPPLIES.  WE USE OUR EMPLOYEE AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESOURCES ACROSS MULTIPLE RESEARCH PROJECTS, INCLUDING OUR DRUG DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WE TRACK EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR CLINICAL PROGRAMS AND CERTAIN PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS ON A PER PROJECT BASIS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR ONGOING ACTIVITIES, PARTICULARLY IN CONNECTION WITH STUDY 041 AND OTHER STUDIES FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, OUR STUDIES OF TRANSLARNA IN NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA AND NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5, OUR STUDIES OF EMFLAZA IN LIMB-GIRDLE 2I, ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE EXPENSES WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF OUR ONGOING CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PLANNED CLINICAL TRIALS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE EXPENSES WILL ALSO DEPEND ON THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH POTENTIAL FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND THE RELATED EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, ADVANCEMENT OF OUR PRECLINICAL PROGRAMS, AND PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATE MANUFACTURING COSTS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FOR OUR MOST ADVANCED PRINCIPAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  TRANSLARNA (NMDMD, ANIRIDIA AND DRAVET)  $25,239  $33,878  GENE THERAPY  17,016  1,928  ONCOLOGY  3,944  3,495  EMFLAZA  4,760  4,670  OTHER RESEARCH AND PRECLINICAL  12,117  10,397  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $63,076  $54,368  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  TRANSLARNA (NMDMD, ANIRIDIA AND DRAVET)  $53,354  $68,552  GENE THERAPY  44,418  1,928  ONCOLOGY  17,769  8,467  EMFLAZA  19,253  10,676  OTHER RESEARCH AND PRECLINICAL  40,827  28,714  TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $175,621  $118,337  THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. THIS IS DUE TO THE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPING DRUGS, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY OF.  \u00b7  THE SCOPE, RATE OF PROGRESS AND EXPENSE OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS AND OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES;  \u00b7  THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES OVER OTHER THERAPIES;  \u00b7  OUR ABILITY TO MARKET, COMMERCIALIZE AND ACHIEVE MARKET ACCEPTANCE FOR ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT WE ARE DEVELOPING OR MAY DEVELOP IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US AND TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS WE CURRENTLY HAVE OR MAY RECEIVE IN THE FUTURE FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u00b7  CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS;  \u00b7  THE TERMS AND TIMING OF REGULATORY APPROVALS; AND  \u00b7  THE EXPENSE OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.  A CHANGE IN THE OUTCOME OF ANY OF THESE VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES COULD MEAN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE COSTS AND TIMING ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PRODUCT OR PRODUCT CANDIDATE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE EMA OR FDA OR OTHER REGULATORY AUTHORITY WERE TO REQUIRE US TO CONDUCT CLINICAL TRIALS BEYOND THOSE WHICH WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE WILL BE REQUIRED FOR THE COMPLETION OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLARNA OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATE OR IF WE EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN ENROLLMENT IN ANY OF OUR CLINICAL TRIALS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO EXPEND SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND TIME ON THE COMPLETION OF CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SALARIES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS FOR PERSONNEL, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSES, IN OUR EXECUTIVE, LEGAL, BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT, COMMERCIAL, FINANCE, ACCOUNTING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RESOURCE FUNCTIONS. OTHER SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDE FACILITY-RELATED COSTS NOT OTHERWISE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE; ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRY AND TRADE SHOWS; AND PROFESSIONAL FEES FOR LEGAL SERVICES, INCLUDING PATENT-RELATED EXPENSES, ACCOUNTING SERVICES AND MISCELLANEOUS SELLING COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, OUR EFFORTS TO COMMERCIALIZE WAYLIVRA AND TEGSEDI IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN AND TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING INCREASED PAYROLL, EXPANDED INFRASTRUCTURE, COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, INCREASED CONSULTING, LEGAL, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTOR RELATIONS EXPENSES.  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET CONSISTS OF INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING AND INTEREST EXPENSE FROM THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES  OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH WE HAVE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE REPORTED REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS.  DURING THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS REPORTED IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, OTHER THAN THOSE DISCLOSED BELOW.  RESTRICTED CASH  RESTRICTED CASH INCLUDED IN DEPOSITS AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET RELATES TO AN UNCONDITIONAL, IRREVOCABLE AND TRANSFERABLE LETTER OF CREDIT THAT WAS ENTERED INTO DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH OBLIGATIONS UNDER A FACILITY LEASE FOR OUR LEASED BIOLOGICS FACILITY IN HOPEWELL TOWNSHIP, NEW JERSEY. THE AMOUNT OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT IS  $7.5 MILLION  , IS TO BE MAINTAINED FOR A TERM OF NOT LESS THAN  FIVE YEARS  AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE REDUCED TO  $3.8 MILLION  IF AFTER  FIVE YEARS  THE COMPANY IS NOT IN DEFAULT OF ITS LEASE. THE AMOUNT IS CLASSIFIED WITHIN DEPOSITS AND OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DUE TO THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF THE LETTER OF CREDIT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  NET PRODUCT REVENUE  OUR NET PRODUCT REVENUE PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF SALES OF TRANSLARNA IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AND SALES OF EMFLAZA IN THE U.S. FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS WITH CUSTOMERS HAVE BEEN SATISFIED.  OUR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE TO PROVIDE TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA BASED ON CUSTOMER ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS, HOSPITALS, SPECIALTY PHARMACIES OR RETAIL PHARMACIES.  THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN OUR CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF EITHER TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA, WHICH IS TYPICALLY UPON DELIVERY. WE INVOICE CUSTOMERS AFTER THE PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN DELIVERED AND INVOICE PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY DUE WITHIN 30 TO 90 DAYS OF INVOICE DATE.  WE DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE BASED ON FIXED CONSIDERATION IN ITS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS. CONTRACT LIABILITIES ARISE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN CONSIDERATION IS DUE FOR GOODS NOT YET PROVIDED. AS WE HAVE IDENTIFIED ONLY ONE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED ENTIRELY TO EITHER PRODUCT SALES OF TRANSLARNA OR EMFLAZA.  IN DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE, A SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT DOES NOT EXIST SINCE THE TIMING FROM WHEN WE DELIVER PRODUCT TO WHEN THE CUSTOMERS PAY FOR THE PRODUCT IS TYPICALLY LESS THAN ONE YEAR. CUSTOMERS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PAY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT DELIVERY. IN THOSE INSTANCES, PAYMENT AND DELIVERY TYPICALLY OCCUR IN THE SAME MONTH.  WE RECORD PRODUCT SALES NET OF ANY VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, WHICH INCLUDES DISCOUNTS, ALLOWANCES, REBATES AND DISTRIBUTION FEES. WE USE THE EXPECTED VALUE OR MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD WHEN ESTIMATING VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, UNLESS DISCOUNT OR REBATE TERMS ARE SPECIFIED WITHIN CONTRACTS. THE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION IS RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUE AT THE TIME REVENUES FROM PRODUCT SALES ARE RECOGNIZED. THESE ESTIMATES FOR VARIABLE CONSIDERATION ARE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT KNOWN CHANGES IN FACTORS AND MAY IMPACT SUCH ESTIMATES IN THE QUARTER THOSE CHANGES ARE KNOWN. REVENUE RECOGNIZED DOES NOT INCLUDE AMOUNTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT ARE CONSTRAINED.  IN RELATION TO CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, WE INCUR COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT BUT DO NOT INCUR COSTS TO OBTAIN A CONTRACT.  THESE COSTS TO FULFILL A CONTRACT DO NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITALIZATION AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  UPON ADOPTION OF ASC TOPIC 606 ON JANUARY 1, 2018, WE HAVE ELECTED THE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS.  \u2022  PORTFOLIO APPROACH - WE APPLIED THE PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO CONTRACT REVIEWS WITHIN IDENTIFIED REVENUE STREAMS THAT HAVE SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS AND WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH WOULD NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY THAN IF APPLYING ASC TOPIC 606 TO EACH INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT.  \u2022  SIGNIFICANT FINANCING COMPONENT - WE EXPECT THE PERIOD BETWEEN WHEN WE TRANSFER A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND WHEN THE CUSTOMER PAYS FOR THE GOOD OR SERVICE TO BE ONE YEAR OR LESS.  \u2022  IMMATERIAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS - WE DISREGARD PROMISES DEEMED TO BE IMMATERIAL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTRACT.  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  SHIPPING AND HANDLING ACTIVITIES - WE CONSIDER ANY SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED AFTER THE CUSTOMER HAS OBTAINED CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT AS A COST TO FULFILL A PROMISE.  SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FINISHED GOODS DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS ARE RECORDED AS A SELLING EXPENSE.  COLLABORATION REVENUE  THE TERMS OF THESE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE PAYMENTS TO US OF ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING: NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES; MILESTONE PAYMENTS; RESEARCH FUNDING AND ROYALTIES ON FUTURE PRODUCT SALES. IN ADDITION, WE GENERATE SERVICE REVENUE THROUGH AGREEMENTS THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR FEES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SERVICES AND MAY INCLUDE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF SPECIFIED EVENTS.  AT THE INCEPTION OF A COLLABORATION ARRANGEMENT, WE NEED TO FIRST EVALUATE IF THE ARRANGEMENT MEETS THE CRITERIA IN ASC TOPIC 808 \u201cCOLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS\u201d TO THEN DETERMINE IF ASC TOPIC 606 IS APPLICABLE BY CONSIDERING WHETHER THE COLLABORATOR MEETS THE DEFINITION OF A CUSTOMER.  IF THE CRITERIA ARE MET, WE ASSESS THE PROMISES IN THE ARRANGEMENT TO IDENTIFY DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  FOR LICENSES OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE ASSESS, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WHETHER THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DISTINCT FROM OTHER PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE ARRANGEMENT.  IF THE LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DETERMINED TO BE DISTINCT, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED FOR NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES WHEN THE LICENSE IS TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE CUSTOMER CAN USE AND BENEFIT FROM THE LICENSE.  IF THE LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DETERMINED NOT TO BE DISTINCT, THEN THE LICENSE WILL BE BUNDLED WITH OTHER PROMISES IN THE ARRANGEMENT INTO ONE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE DETERMINE IF THE BUNDLED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED OVER TIME OR AT A POINT IN TIME.  IF WE CONCLUDE THAT THE NONREFUNDABLE, UPFRONT LICENSE FEES WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME, WE ASSESS THE APPROPRIATE METHOD OF MEASURING PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE.  FOR MILESTONE PAYMENTS, WE ASSESS, AT CONTRACT INCEPTION, WHETHER THE DEVELOPMENT OR SALES-BASED MILESTONES ARE CONSIDERED PROBABLE OF BEING ACHIEVED.  IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE REVERSAL WILL OCCUR, WE WILL NOT RECORD REVENUE UNTIL THE UNCERTAINTY HAS BEEN RESOLVED.  MILESTONE PAYMENTS THAT ARE CONTINGENT UPON REGULATORY APPROVAL ARE NOT CONSIDERED PROBABLE OF BEING ACHIEVED UNTIL THE APPLICABLE REGULATORY APPROVALS OR OTHER EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ARE OBTAINED AS SUCH CONDITIONS ARE NOT WITHIN OUR CONTROL.  IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE REVERSAL WILL NOT OCCUR, WE WILL ESTIMATE THE MILESTONE PAYMENTS USING THE MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD.  WE WILL RE-ASSESS THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALES-BASED MILESTONES EACH REPORTING PERIOD TO DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF ACHIEVEMENT.  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS UNDER COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS AS THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED. WE RECORD THESE REIMBURSEMENTS AS REVENUE AND NOT AS A REDUCTION OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES AS WE HAVE THE RISKS AND REWARDS AS THE PRINCIPAL IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-2, \u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\u201d ALONG WITH OTHER AMENDMENTS ISSUED IN 2017 AND 2018. TOPIC 842 SUPERSEDES THE LEASE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS IN  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION TOPIC 840, LEASES  (TOPIC 840). TOPIC 842 REQUIRES ORGANIZATIONS TO RECOGNIZE LEASED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES DISCLOSURES TO HELP INVESTORS AND OTHER FINANCIAL STATEMENT USERS BETTER UNDERSTAND THE AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM LEASES.  WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. THIS DETERMINATION GENERALLY DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE ARRANGEMENT CONVEYS TO US THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE USE OF AN EXPLICITLY OR IMPLICITLY IDENTIFIED FIXED ASSET FOR A PERIOD OF TIME IN EXCHANGE FOR CONSIDERATION. CONTROL OF AN UNDERLYING ASSET IS CONVEYED TO US IF WE OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO DIRECT THE USE OF AND TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM USING THE UNDERLYING ASSET. WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WHICH INCLUDE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH WE ACCOUNT FOR AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL LEASES.  UNDER THE STANDARD, OPERATING LEASES ARE CLASSIFIED AS RIGHT OF USE (\"ROU\") ASSETS, SHORT TERM LEASE LIABILITIES, AND LONG TERM LEASE LIABILITIES. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. ROU ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED AND LEASE LIABILITIES ACCRETE TO YIELD STRAIGHT-LINE EXPENSE OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. LEASE PAYMENTS INCLUDED IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY ARE COMPRISED OF FIXED PAYMENTS.  VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE EVENT, ACTIVITY, OR CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT ON WHICH THOSE PAYMENTS ARE ASSESSED OCCURS. VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM AS EXPENSE ARISING FROM FIXED LEASE PAYMENTS FOR OPERATING LEASES.  LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND WE RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE FOR THESE LEASES ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. WE APPLY THIS POLICY TO ALL UNDERLYING ASSET CATEGORIES.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TOPIC 842 REQUIRES A LESSEE TO DISCOUNT ITS UNPAID LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE INTEREST RATE IMPLICIT IN THE LEASE OR, IF THAT RATE CANNOT BE READILY DETERMINED, ITS INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE. AS MOST OF OUR LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. WE GIVE CONSIDERATION TO OUR RECENT DEBT ISSUANCES AS WELL AS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA FOR INSTRUMENTS WITH SIMILAR CHARACTERISTICS WHEN CALCULATING OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES.  THE LEASE TERM FOR ALL OF OUR LEASES INCLUDES THE NON-CANCELLABLE PERIOD OF THE LEASE PLUS ANY ADDITIONAL PERIODS COVERED BY EITHER OUR OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE THAT WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO EXERCISE, OR AN OPTION TO EXTEND (OR NOT TO TERMINATE) THE LEASE CONTROLLED BY THE LESSOR.

WE INCURRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND OUR FOREIGN TAX LIABILITIES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE DISTRIBUTION OF PRE-TAX EARNINGS AMONG THESE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. WE ARE PAYING MINIMUM INCOME TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF INCURRED LOSSES IN THE VARIOUS STATE JURISDICTIONS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES.  AS A GROWING COMMERCIAL-STAGE BIOPHARMACEUTICAL COMPANY, WE ARE ENGAGING IN SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS FOR TRANSLARNA FOR NMDMD AND EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD WHILE ALSO DEVOTING A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR EFFORTS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND OTHER PROGRAMS. TO DATE, ALMOST ALL OF OUR PRODUCT REVENUE HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES AND FROM EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES.  OUR ONGOING ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA AND SECURE MARKET ACCESS THROUGH COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS AT SUSTAINABLE LEVELS IN THE MEMBER STATES OF THE EEA OR THROUGH EAP PROGRAMS IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES. THE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION REQUIRES ANNUAL REVIEW AND RENEWAL BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FOLLOWING REASSESSMENT BY THE EMA OF THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE OF THE AUTHORIZATION AND IS SUBJECT TO THE SPECIFIC OBLIGATION TO CONDUCT STUDY 041. OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE PRODUCT REVENUE FROM EMFLAZA WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT LEVELS SET BY GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, PRIVATE HEALTH INSURERS AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FINANCED OUR OPERATIONS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN PUBLIC OFFERINGS AND \u201cAT THE MARKET OFFERINGS\u201d OF OUR COMMON STOCK, THE PRIVATE PLACEMENTS OF OUR PREFERRED STOCK, COLLABORATIONS, BANK DEBT, CONVERTIBLE  50  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEBT FINANCINGS, THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND GRANTS AND CLINICAL TRIAL SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE DISEASE AREAS ADDRESSED BY OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES. SINCE 2014, WE HAVE ALSO RELIED ON REVENUES GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, AND SINCE MAY 2017, WE HAVE RECOGNIZED REVENUE GENERATED FROM NET SALES OF EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT COMMERCIAL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLANS, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WHICH WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE SALE OF BOTH TRANSLARNA AND EMFLAZA, AS WELL AS WAYLIVRA AND TEGSEDI ONCE OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS FOR THEM COMMENCE.  AS A RESULT, WHILE WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE OPERATING LOSSES IN 2019, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OPERATING LOSSES GENERATED IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD DECLINE VERSUS PRIOR PERIODS.  THE NET LOSSES WE INCUR MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.  IN AUGUST 2015, WE CLOSED A PRIVATE OFFERING OF $150 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.0% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2022 INCLUDING THE EXERCISE BY THE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF AN OPTION TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL $25 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE 2022 CONVERTIBLE NOTES.

ON MAY 5, 2017, WE ENTERED INTO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH MIDCAP FINANCIAL, WHICH PROVIDES FOR A SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY OF $60 MILLION, OF WHICH $40 MILLION WAS DRAWN BY US ON MAY 5, 2017. OUR ABILITY TO DRAW ON THE REMAINING $20 MILLION UNDER THE SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT IS MAY 1, 2021, UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER. THE FACILITY IS STRUCTURED TO REQUIRE ONLY MONTHLY INTEREST PAYMENTS FOR THE INITIAL TWO YEARS WITH PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION BEGINNING IN YEARS THREE AND FOUR.

CASH FLOWS  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $708.6  MILLION.  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CASH FLOWS AND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

THE NET CASH  USED IN  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATES TO SUPPORTING CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $158.2 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  . CASH  USED IN  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS  $18.0 MILLION  AND WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF AGILIS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES.  NET CASH  PROVIDED BY  FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $610.9 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  AND  $127.8 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  . CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR EQUITY OFFERINGS IN JANUARY 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 2019, OUR AT THE MARKET EQUITY OFFERING IN AUGUST 2019, OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT OFFERING IN SEPTEMBER 2019, AND THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR EQUITY OFFERING IN APRIL 2018 AND THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS.  FUNDING REQUIREMENTS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR EXPENSES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE EEA, LATIN AMERICA AND OTHER TERRITORIES, INCLUDING THE EXPANSION OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CORRESPONDING SALES AND MARKETING, LEGAL AND REGULATORY, DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND EMPLOYEE-BASED EXPENSES. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH STUDY 041 AND STUDY 045 AND OUR OPEN LABEL EXTENSION TRIALS OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AS WELL AS OUR STUDIES FOR NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA AND NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5 AND OUR FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES AND OUR STUDIES FOR LIMB-GIRDLE 2I. WE ALSO EXPECT TO INCUR ONGOING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE OUR REGULATORY SUBMISSIONS. WE HAVE BEGUN SEEKING AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE EEA AND WE MAY ALSO SEEK MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR TRANSLARNA FOR OTHER INDICATIONS. IN LATE 2019, WE PLAN TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE FDA, FOLLOWED BY A REQUEST FOR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION FOR PTC-AADC WITH THE EMA. THESE EFFORTS MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EXPENSES.  IN ADDITION, OUR EXPENSES WILL INCREASE IF AND AS WE.  \u2022  SEEK TO SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS WE ASSUMED IN CONNECTION WITH THE AGILIS ACQUISITION;  \u2022  SEEK TO SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AKCEA AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL COMMERCIALIZATION OF TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA IN THE PTC TERRITORY;  \u2022  EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY FOR EMFLAZA IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING COMMERCIALIZATION AND INTEGRATION EFFORTS;  \u2022  SATISFY CONTRACTUAL AND REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ASSUMED THROUGH THE EMFLAZA ACQUISITION;  \u2022  ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE ANY ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, NON-CLINICAL STUDIES OR CMC ASSESSMENTS OR ANALYSES IN ORDER TO ADVANCE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES OR ELSEWHERE;  \u2022  ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE OTHER STEPS, IN ADDITION TO STUDY 041, TO MAINTAIN OUR CURRENT MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OR TO OBTAIN FURTHER MARKETING AUTHORIZATIONS FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD OR OTHER INDICATIONS;  \u2022  INITIATE OR CONTINUE THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSLARNA AND EMFLAZA FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AND OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  52  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  SEEK TO DISCOVER AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u2022  SEEK TO EXPAND AND DIVERSIFY OUR PRODUCT PIPELINE THROUGH STRATEGIC TRANSACTIONS;  \u2022  MAINTAIN, EXPAND AND PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO; AND  \u2022  ADD OPERATIONAL, FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PERSONNEL, INCLUDING PERSONNEL TO SUPPORT OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH FLOWS FROM THE SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES,  WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE HAVE BASED THIS ESTIMATE ON ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY PROVE TO BE WRONG, AND WE COULD USE OUR CAPITAL RESOURCES SOONER THAN WE CURRENTLY EXPECT.  OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE AND MARKET EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO NEGOTIATE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN ADEQUATE PRICING, COVERAGE AND REIMBURSEMENT TERMS, ON A TIMELY BASIS, WITH THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FOR EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE EEA AND OTHER TERRITORIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN ORPHAN EXCLUSIVITY FOR, AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE ALL FDA POST-MARKETING REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, EMFLAZA;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, INCLUDING WHETHER THE EMA DETERMINES ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT THE BENEFIT-RISK BALANCE OF TRANSLARNA SUPPORTS RENEWAL OF OUR MARKETING AUTHORIZATION IN THE EEA, ON THE CURRENT APPROVED LABEL;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF STUDY 041;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF OUR EFFORTS TO ADVANCE TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING, WHETHER WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS, NON-CLINICAL STUDIES OR CMC ASSESSMENTS OR ANALYSES AT SIGNIFICANT COST WHICH, IF SUCCESSFUL, MAY ENABLE FDA REVIEW OF AN NDA SUBMISSION BY US AND, ULTIMATELY, MAY SUPPORT APPROVAL OF TRANSLARNA FOR NMDMD IN THE UNITED STATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO COMMERCIALIZE AND MARKET TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA IN THE PTC TERRITORY;  \u2022  THE PROGRESS AND RESULTS OF OUR OPEN LABEL EXTENSION CLINICAL TRIALS OF TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD AS WELL AS OUR STUDIES FOR NONSENSE MUTATION ANIRIDIA, NONSENSE MUTATION DRAVET SYNDROME/CDKL5 AND LIMB-GIRDLE 2I AND ACTIVITIES UNDER OUR GENE THERAPY, SPLICING AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS;  \u2022  THE SCOPE, COSTS AND TIMING OF OUR COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING PRODUCT SALES, MARKETING, LEGAL, REGULATORY, DISTRIBUTION AND MANUFACTURING, FOR BOTH EMFLAZA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DMD AND TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD, FOR TEGSEDI, FOR WAYLIVRA AND FOR ANY OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT MAY RECEIVE MARKETING AUTHORIZATION OR ANY ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS OR TERRITORIES IN WHICH WE RECEIVE AUTHORIZATION TO MARKET TRANSLARNA;  \u2022  THE COSTS, TIMING AND OUTCOME OF REGULATORY REVIEW OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR GENE THERAPY AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS, AND TRANSLARNA IN OTHER TERRITORIES OR FOR INDICATIONS OTHER THAN NMDMD;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT FOR OUR LEASED BIOLOGICS FACILITY;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH MIDCAP FINANCIAL;  \u2022  THE TIMING AND SCOPE OF GROWTH IN OUR EMPLOYEE BASE;  \u2022  THE SCOPE, PROGRESS, RESULTS AND COSTS OF PRECLINICAL DEVELOPMENT, LABORATORY TESTING AND CLINICAL TRIALS FOR TRANSLARNA AND EMFLAZA FOR ADDITIONAL INDICATIONS AND FOR OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES, INCLUDING THOSE IN OUR GENE THERAPY AND ONCOLOGY PROGRAMS;  \u2022  REVENUE RECEIVED FROM COMMERCIAL SALES OF TRANSLARNA, EMFLAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, OR ANY OF OUR OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL AND MAINTAIN EXISTING REIMBURSED NAMED PATIENT AND COHORT EAP PROGRAMS FOR TRANSLARNA FOR THE TREATMENT OF NMDMD ON ADEQUATE TERMS, OR AT ALL;  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  THE ABILITY AND WILLINGNESS OF PATIENTS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO ACCESS TRANSLARNA THROUGH ALTERNATIVE MEANS IF PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT NEGOTIATIONS IN THE APPLICABLE TERRITORY DO NOT HAVE A POSITIVE OUTCOME;  \u2022  THE COSTS OF PREPARING, FILING AND PROSECUTING PATENT APPLICATIONS, MAINTAINING, AND PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND DEFENDING AGAINST INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY-RELATED CLAIMS;  \u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ACQUIRE OR INVEST IN OTHER BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS, PRODUCT CANDIDATES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF ANY ACQUISITION, IN-LICENSING OR OTHER STRATEGIC TRANSACTION WE MAY PURSUE, AND THE COSTS OF SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO OUR ACQUISITION OF EMFLAZA, OUR ACQUISITION OF AGILIS, AND OUR LICENSING OF TEGSEDI AND WAYLIVRA; AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN COLLABORATIONS, INCLUDING OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH ROCHE AND THE SMA FOUNDATION, AND OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN RESEARCH FUNDING AND ACHIEVE MILESTONES UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS.  WITH RESPECT TO OUR OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTES, CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE ON A SEMI-ANNUAL BASIS IN ARREARS, WHICH REQUIRE TOTAL FUNDING OF $8.8 MILLION ANNUALLY. ADDITIONALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT CASH INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ARE PAYABLE MONTHLY IN ARREARS. FURTHERMORE, AS A RESULT OF OUR INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING IN JUNE 2013, WE HAVE INCURRED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING AS A PUBLIC COMPANY. THESE COSTS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, INVESTOR RELATIONS AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT WE DID NOT INCUR AS A PRIVATE COMPANY.  WE HAVE NEVER BEEN PROFITABLE AND WE WILL NEED TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO ACHIEVE AND SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY, AND WE MAY NEVER DO SO. WE MAY NEED TO OBTAIN SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN CONNECTION WITH OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. UNTIL SUCH TIME, IF EVER, AS WE CAN GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL PRODUCT REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO FINANCE OUR CASH NEEDS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF EQUITY OFFERINGS, DEBT FINANCINGS, COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, GRANTS AND CLINICAL TRIAL SUPPORT FROM GOVERNMENTAL AND PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATIONS AND PATIENT ADVOCACY GROUPS IN THE DISEASE AREAS ADDRESSED BY OUR PRODUCT AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES AND MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS. ADEQUATE ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE SALE OF EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, OUR SHAREHOLDERS OWNERSHIP INTEREST WILL BE DILUTED, AND THE TERMS OF THESE SECURITIES MAY INCLUDE LIQUIDATION OR OTHER PREFERENCES THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RIGHTS OF OUR COMMON STOCKHOLDERS. DEBT FINANCING, IF AVAILABLE, MAY INVOLVE AGREEMENTS THAT INCLUDE COVENANTS LIMITING OR RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO TAKE SPECIFIC ACTIONS, SUCH AS INCURRING ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR DECLARING DIVIDENDS. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH COLLABORATIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES, WE MAY HAVE TO RELINQUISH VALUABLE RIGHTS TO OUR TECHNOLOGIES, FUTURE REVENUE STREAMS, RESEARCH PROGRAMS OR PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR TO GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT MAY NOT BE FAVORABLE TO US.  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCINGS WHEN NEEDED OR ON ATTRACTIVE TERMS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO DELAY, LIMIT, REDUCE OR TERMINATE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT OR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS OR GRANT RIGHTS TO DEVELOP AND MARKET PRODUCT CANDIDATES THAT WE WOULD OTHERWISE PREFER TO DEVELOP AND MARKET OURSELVES.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DID NOT HAVE DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED, AND WE DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE, ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED UNDER SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED  SEPTEMBER 30, 2019  , THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS OUTSIDE THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS FROM THOSE DISCLOSED UNDER THE HEADING \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\u201d IN OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT, OTHER THAN AS DISCLOSED BELOW.

OVERVIEW  IROBOT IS A LEADING CONSUMER ROBOT COMPANY THAT DESIGNS AND BUILDS ROBOTS THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE TO DO MORE BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE HOME. OUR CONSUMER ROBOTS HELP PEOPLE FIND SMARTER WAYS TO CLEAN AND ACCOMPLISH MORE IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. OUR PORTFOLIO OF SOLUTIONS FEATURES PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE CONNECTED HOME AND ADVANCED CONCEPTS IN CLEANING, MAPPING AND NAVIGATION, HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION AND PHYSICAL SOLUTIONS.  LEVERAGING THIS PORTFOLIO, OUR ENGINEERS ARE BUILDING AN ECOSYSTEM OF ROBOTS TO EMPOWER THE SMART HOME. FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN A PIONEER IN THE ROBOTICS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS INDUSTRIES.  WE SELL OUR ROBOTS THROUGH A VARIETY OF DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INCLUDING CHAIN STORES AND OTHER NATIONAL RETAILERS, THROUGH OUR ON-LINE STORE, AND THROUGH VALUE-ADDED DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS WORLDWIDE.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD 1,132 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN THE DISCIPLINES NECESSARY TO BUILD DURABLE, HIGH-PERFORMANCE AND COST-EFFECTIVE ROBOTS THROUGH THE CLOSE INTEGRATION OF SOFTWARE, ELECTRONICS AND HARDWARE. OUR CORE TECHNOLOGIES SERVE AS REUSABLE BUILDING BLOCKS THAT WE ADAPT AND EXPAND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, DEVELOP NEXT-GENERATION VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND DESIGN AND LAUNCH NEW PRODUCTS, REDUCING THE TIME, COST AND RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. OUR SIGNIFICANT EXPERTISE IN CONSUMER NEEDS, ROBOT DESIGN, ENGINEERING AND SMART HOME TECHNOLOGIES AND TRENDS POSITIONS US TO CAPITALIZE ON THE GROWTH WE EXPECT IN THE MARKET FOR ROBOT-BASED CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  OUR CONTINUED SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON OUR ABILITY TO RESPOND TO A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THE CONSUMER ROBOTS MARKET. WE BELIEVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE INCLUDE INCREASING COMPETITION AND OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP AND INTRODUCE PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS INTO BOTH NEW AND EXISTING MARKETS. FURTHERMORE, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EFFORTS TO COST-OPTIMIZE OUR PRODUCTS AND DIVERSIFY OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURING AND BROADER SUPPLY CHAIN WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MAINTAINING COMPETITIVE PRODUCT PRICING, REDUCING SUPPLY-CHAIN RISK AND LIMITING CHINA-RELATED TARIFF EXPOSURE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS THAT IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, WE INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA I7 AND I7+ IN THE U.S., WHICH ARE ROBOT VACUUMS THAT REMEMBER A HOME'S FLOOR PLAN AND CLEAN SPECIFIC ROOMS BY NAME. USING IMPRINTTM SMART MAPPING, THE ROOMBA I7+ LEARNS THE HOME'S FLOOR PLAN, GIVING CUSTOMERS TOTAL CONTROL OVER WHICH ROOMS TO CLEAN AND WHEN. WHEN THE ROOMBA I7+ ROBOT VACUUM IS FINISHED CLEANING, IT EMPTIES ITS OWN DUST BIN INTO THE CLEAN BASETM, WHICH HOLDS 30 BINS OF DIRT. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, THE COMPANY ALSO INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA E5, A HIGHLY-FEATURED PRODUCT AT A MORE ACCESSIBLE PRICE, TO OUR LINEUP IN THE U.S. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE INTRODUCED THE ROOMBA E5 IN MARKETS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE LAUNCHED ROOMBA I7 AND I7+ IN EMEA, JAPAN AND CHINA. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED TWO NEW CLEANING ROBOTS IN THE U.S., THE ROOMBA S9 AND S9+, WHICH, ALONG WITH THE FEATURES OF THE ROOMBA I7 AND I7+, ARE ROBOT VACUUMS THAT CAN CLEAN DEEP INTO CORNERS AND ALONG EDGES, AND THE BRAAVA JET M6 ROBOT MOP, WHICH CAN TACKLE MULTIPLE ROOMS AND LARGE SPACES WITH ADVANCED NAVIGATION AND MAPPING CAPABILITIES. TOGETHER, THESE TWO ROBOTS CAN USE IMPRINT LINK TECHNOLOGY TO TALK TO EACH OTHER, AUTOMATICALLY VACUUMING AND THEN MOPPING WITHOUT ADDITIONAL ACTION BY THE USER. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, THE S9 AND S9+ WERE LAUNCHED IN EMEA, WHILE THE M6 WAS LAUNCHED IN BOTH EMEA AND JAPAN. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE S9, S9+ AND M6 WILL LAUNCH IN ALL OTHER TARGET MARKETS IN EARLY 2020.  19  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, REVENUE RECOGNITION INCLUDING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, VARIABLE CONSIDERATION AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS PRODUCT RETURNS AND INCENTIVES; WARRANTY COSTS, VALUATION OF GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS; EVALUATING LOSS CONTINGENCIES; ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION INCLUDING PERFORMANCE-BASED ASSESSMENTS; AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES AND RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCES. WE BASE THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MARKET PARTICIPANT FAIR VALUE CONSIDERATIONS, PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES MAY BE FOUND IN THE \"MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\" SECTION INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018.  EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 30, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE NEW LEASING STANDARD UNDER ASC 842 USING THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD. THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN A MATERIAL INCREASE IN THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHILE THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  . WE HAVE UPDATED OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY AS IT RELATES TO LEASE ACCOUNTING. REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS PROVIDERS. WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH GIVES US THE ADVANTAGES OF RELATIVELY LOW CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY IN SCHEDULING PRODUCTION AND MANAGING INVENTORY LEVELS. BY LEASING OUR OFFICE FACILITIES, WE ALSO MINIMIZE THE CASH NEEDED FOR EXPANSION. ACCORDINGLY, OUR CAPITAL SPENDING IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, COMPUTERS, OFFICE FURNITURE, PRODUCT-SPECIFIC PRODUCTION TOOLING, INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE AND TEST EQUIPMENT.  IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  AND  SEPTEMBER 29, 2018  , WE SPENT  $27.1 MILLION  AND  $25.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

ACCORDINGLY, OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT INVENTORY CONSISTS OF GOODS SHIPPED TO OUR THIRD-PARTY LOGISTICS PROVIDERS FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF DISTRIBUTOR, RETAIL AND DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER SALES. OUR CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASING AND STOCKING COMPONENTS REQUIRED FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, AND THEY TYPICALLY INVOICE US WHEN THE FINISHED GOODS ARE SHIPPED.

WORKING CAPITAL FACILITIES  CREDIT FACILITY  IN JUNE 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF OUR UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FROM $75.0 MILLION TO $150.0 MILLION AND EXTENDING THE TERM OF THE CREDIT FACILITY TO JUNE 2023. AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT IS AVAILABLE TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. THE INTEREST ON LOANS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ACCRUES, AT OUR ELECTION, AT EITHER (1) LIBOR PLUS A MARGIN, CURRENTLY EQUAL TO 1.0%, BASED ON OUR RATIO OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (THE \"EURODOLLAR RATE\"), OR (2) THE LENDER\u2019S BASE RATE. THE LENDER\u2019S BASE RATE IS EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (1) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE  24  PLUS 0.5%, (2) THE LENDER\u2019S PRIME RATE AND (3) THE EURODOLLAR RATE PLUS 1.0%. IN THE EVENT THAT LIBOR IS DISCONTINUED AS EXPECTED IN 2021, WE EXPECT THE INTEREST RATES FOR OUR DEBT FOLLOWING SUCH EVENT WILL BE BASED ON EITHER ALTERNATE BASE RATES OR AGREED UPON REPLACEMENT RATES. WHILE WE DO NOT EXPECT A LIBOR DISCONTINUATION WOULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO BORROW OR MAINTAIN ALREADY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, IT COULD RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR CREDIT FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE, INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR OR GUARANTEE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, CREATE LIENS, ENTER INTO TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, MAKE LOANS OR INVESTMENTS, SELL ASSETS, PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS ON, OR REPURCHASE, OUR STOCK, AND CONSOLIDATE OR MERGE WITH OTHER ENTITIES. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS CUSTOMARY WITH THIS TYPE OF AGREEMENT, INCLUDING MAINTAINING A MAXIMUM RATIO OF INDEBTEDNESS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA AND A MINIMUM SPECIFIED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO.  THE CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY EVENTS OF DEFAULT, INCLUDING FOR PAYMENT DEFAULTS, BREACHES OF REPRESENTATIONS, BREACHES OF AFFIRMATIVE OR NEGATIVE COVENANTS, CROSS DEFAULTS TO OTHER MATERIAL INDEBTEDNESS, BANKRUPTCY AND FAILURE TO DISCHARGE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS. IF A DEFAULT OCCURS AND IS NOT CURED WITHIN ANY APPLICABLE CURE PERIOD OR IS NOT WAIVED, OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY MAY BE ACCELERATED.  AS OF  SEPTEMBER 28, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS  WE CURRENTLY HAVE NO MATERIAL CASH COMMITMENTS, EXCEPT FOR NORMAL RECURRING TRADE PAYABLES, EXPENSE ACCRUALS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING LEASES, ALL OF WHICH WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING THROUGH WORKING CAPITAL, FUNDS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND OUR EXISTING REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT. WE BELIEVE OUR OUTSOURCED APPROACH TO MANUFACTURING PROVIDES US WITH FLEXIBILITY IN BOTH MANAGING INVENTORY LEVELS AND FINANCING OUR INVENTORY. WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE NEEDS OVER AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IN THE EVENT OUR REVENUE PLAN DOES NOT MEET OUR EXPECTATIONS, WE MAY ELIMINATE OR CURTAIL EXPENDITURES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL. OUR FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR RATE OF REVENUE GROWTH, THE EXPANSION OF OUR MARKETING AND SALES ACTIVITIES, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF SPENDING TO SUPPORT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, THE TIMING OF INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS, THE ACQUISITION OF NEW CAPABILITIES OR TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE CONTINUING MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MOREOVER, TO THE EXTENT EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND CASH FROM SHORT-TERM BORROWING ARE INSUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FUTURE ACTIVITIES, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH PUBLIC OR PRIVATE EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES, TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ALSO REQUIRE US TO SEEK ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. ADDITIONAL FUNDS MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON TERMS FAVORABLE TO US OR AT ALL.
