CONCURRENTLY WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, AND IN ORDER TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE ISSUED NEW  $500.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  6.50%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2027 AND ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED SENIOR SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT.  SEE \u201cBORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - SENIOR NOTES\u201d AND \u201c- 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA, ALSO A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT IS RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE OF THE FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE.  IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SOURCE OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND IS INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE.  THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FIRST  QUARTER RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  SELLING PRICES, PRODUCT MIX, CUSTOMER DEMAND AND SALES VOLUMES;  \u2022  RAW MATERIAL COSTS, PRIMARILY RESIN;  \u2022  ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS;  \u2022  BENEFITS FROM EXECUTING THE GREIF BUSINESS SYSTEM;  \u2022  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES;  \u2022  DIVESTITURE OF BUSINESSES AND FACILITIES; AND  \u2022  IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  NET SALES  DECREASED  $4.9 MILLION  TO  $75.1 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH  $80.0 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MARKET SOFTNESS IN PARTS OF EUROPE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT.  GROSS PROFIT WAS  $17.4 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH  $15.2 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED NET SALES, WHICH ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN GROSS PROFIT MARGIN TO  23.2  PERCENT FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  FROM 19.0 PERCENT FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  OPERATING PROFIT WAS  $6.0 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH $3.2 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS  $7.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH  $5.1 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  . THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SAME FACTORS THAT IMPACTED GROSS PROFIT AND THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  243,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS.  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE.  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTY IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER \u201cGAIN ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET\u201d AND REPORT THE SALE OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \u201cNET SALES\u201d AND \u201cCOST OF PRODUCTS SOLD.\u201d ALL HBU, DEVELOPMENT AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IS USED BY US TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL SOLD. TIMBERLAND GAINS ARE RECORDED AS GAINS ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO WATER, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  17,600  ACRES OF SPECIAL USE PROPERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET SALES INCREASED TO  $6.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH  $6.5 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $20.0 MILLION  ON  $55.7 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 WAS  $15.6 MILLION  ON  $44.5 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. IN ADDITION TO THE TIMING OF THE ANNUAL TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR THE QUARTERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270, WE ALSO RECORDED TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFITS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cTAX REFORM ACT\u201d), WHICH WENT INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 REFLECTED AN INCREMENTAL  $2.3 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE THAT WAS RECORDED RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY, OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES OF  $1.7 MILLION  RECOGNIZED DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE PERMANENT REINVESTMENT ASSERTION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER UNDER ASC 740-30. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF AN INDEMNIFICATION ON THE DIVESTURE OF ONE OF GREIF\u2019S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, GREIF RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY OF  $2.3 MILLION  . OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN TAX BENEFIT OF  $0.7 MILLION  . FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, THE NET TAX BENEFIT RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT WAS  $29.4 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDED THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY. OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN A NET TAX BENEFIT OF  $1.0 MILLION.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  THE ESTIMATED NET DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RANGES FROM  ZERO  TO  $5.0 MILLION  . ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES THAT WAS SUBTRACTED FROM NET INCOME TO ARRIVE AT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  WAS  $6.1 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET OPERATING PROFIT OF THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT JOINT VENTURE THAT WAS FORMED IN 2010 BY GREIF, INC. AND ONE OF ITS INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFLEXIBLE PACKAGING JV\u201d OR \u201cFPS VIE\u201d).  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC.  BASED ON THE ABOVE, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC. WAS  $29.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $56.5 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) CHANGES  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 830, \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS,\u201d THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY ARE TRANSLATED INTO UNITED STATES DOLLARS AT THE RATE OF EXCHANGE EXISTING AT THE END OF THE CURRENT PERIOD, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE MONTH IN WHICH THEY ARE INCURRED.

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET  CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET WAS  $0.8 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  BALANCE SHEET CHANGES  WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES  THE  $104.7 MILLION  INCREASE  IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO  $561.4 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $456.7 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES CREDIT FACILITIES AS PART OF A LARGER CAPITAL ALIGNMENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE CHANGES, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES\".  THE  $37.1 MILLION  INCREASE  IN INVENTORIES TO  $326.6 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $289.5 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES, LOWER SALES, AND A $2.5 MILLION IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  THE  $26.8 MILLION  DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO  $377.0 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $403.8 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND DECREASED SALES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER AND A $3.0 MILLION IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OFFSET BY INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES.  OTHER BALANCE SHEET CHANGES  THE  $11.5 MILLION  INCREASE  IN PREPAID EXPENSES TO  $51.3 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM $39.8 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  THE  $10.3 MILLION  DECREASE  IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS TO  $81.8 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM $92.1 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE QUARTERLY TAX PROVISION AND TRUE UPS FOR RETURN FILINGS, OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, THE SENIOR NOTES WE HAVE ISSUED, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE USE THESE SOURCES TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FUND THESE ITEMS IN A LIKE MANNER. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS. MOREOVER, AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT, IF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE NEEDED TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, OR ACQUISITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL U.S. TAXES ON SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, WE INVESTED  $26.0 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $0.9 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES) AND  $28.0 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $2.6 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES), RESPECTIVELY, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES, TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $170.0  TO  $190.0 MILLION  IN  2019  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES WILL REPLACE AND IMPROVE EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND FUND NEW FACILITIES.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NONCONTROLLING INTEREST  WE HAVE CONDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REDEEM THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTEREST OF CERTAIN NONCONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS IN OUR JOINT VENTURES AT WHICH TIME WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CASH OUTFLOWS.  ON NOVEMBER 15, 2018, ONE OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNERS RELATED TO ONE OF OUR PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES JOINT VENTURES EXERCISED ITS PUT OPTION TO REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OF ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST. WE MADE A PAYMENT FOR  $10.1 MILLION  TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNER IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019. ALSO IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNER RELATED TO THE SAME PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE OWNER RECEIVED A  $1.8 MILLION  PAYMENT FOR ALL OF ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THIS JOINT VENTURE.

THESE SENIOR NOTES ARE FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED ON A SENIOR BASIS BY GREIF, INC.  THESE SENIOR NOTES CONTAIN CERTAIN COVENANTS. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS.  SEE NOTE 8 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE SENIOR NOTES DISCUSSED ABOVE.  UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITY  ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2018, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR EXISTING RECEIVABLES FACILITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO ESTABLISH A  $150.0 MILLION  UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY\") WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY MATURES ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. THE  $150.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING BALANCE UNDER THE U.S. RECEIVABLE FACILITY AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  IS REPORTED IN LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATION ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENT OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT. THE FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY WERE  $0.1 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AND ARE RECORDED AS A DIRECT DEDUCTION FROM THE LONG-TERM DEBT LIABILITY.  WE CAN TERMINATE THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY AT ANY TIME UPON FIVE DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE. THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY IS SECURED BY CERTAIN OF OUR UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES AND BEARS INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) OR AN APPLICABLE BASE RATE, PLUS A MARGIN, OR A COMMERCIAL PAPER RATE PLUS A MARGIN. INTEREST IS PAYABLE ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE IS PAYABLE UPON TERMINATION OF THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY. THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT, WHICH ARE MATERIALLY SIMILAR TO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS. AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS. PROCEEDS OF THE US RECEIVABLES FACILITY ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  SEE NOTE 8 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE RECEIVABLES FACILITY.  INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AS PART OF A LARGER CAPITAL STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE WAS ADDED TO THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA. A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE NULLIFIES LEGAL ISOLATION AND TRUE-SALE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BECAUSE A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE IS A FORM OF CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT REMOVE FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, AND THE EUROPEAN RPA AND SINGAPORE RPA ARE NOW PRESENTED AS LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENTS OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT.  IN 2012, COOPERAGE RECEIVABLES FINANCE B.V. AND GREIF COORDINATION CENTER BVBA, OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY ENTERED INTO THE NIEUW AMSTERDAM RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cEUROPEAN RPA\u201d) WITH AFFILIATES OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN RPA, WE AGREED TO SELL TRADE RECEIVABLES MEETING CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, BASED ON A FORMULA, APPROXIMATING  75  TO  90  PERCENT OF THE ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN OCTOBER 2007, GREIF SINGAPORE PTE. LTD., OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ENTERED INTO THE SINGAPORE RECEIVABLE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSINGAPORE RPA\u201d) WITH A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SINGAPORE RPA, WE AGREED TO SELL TRADE RECEIVABLES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, BASED ON A FORMULA, OF APPROXIMATELY  90  PERCENT OF THE ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.  THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES TO BE SOLD AND OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME UNDER THE EUROPEAN RPA IS  \u20ac100.0 MILLION  (  $114.3 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ). THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES TO BE FINANCED UNDER THE SINGAPORE RPA IS  15.0 MILLION  SINGAPORE DOLLARS (  $11.1 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ).  PRIOR TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE STRUCTURE OF THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED FOR A LEGAL TRUE SALE, ON A REVOLVING BASIS, OF THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED FROM OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES TO THE RESPECTIVE PURCHASERS. THE REMAINING (DEFERRED) PURCHASE PRICE WAS SETTLED UPON COLLECTION OF THE RECEIVABLES. THEREFORE, WE REMOVED FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE SINCE THEY MET THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA OF ASC 860, \u201cTRANSFERS AND SERVICING,\u201d AND WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE RECEIVABLES WERE SOLD ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS WITH THE TOTAL FUNDS IN THE SERVICING COLLECTION ACCOUNTS PLEDGED TO THE BANKS BETWEEN SETTLEMENT DATES. THE CASH INITIALLY RECEIVED, ALONG WITH THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE, RELATED TO THE SALE OR ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES AND WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OTHER RISKS GIVEN THEIR SHORT TERM NATURE. THEREFORE, WE REFLECTED ALL CASH FLOWS UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAMS AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON THE OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE VARIOUS RPAS.  INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE VARIOUS BORROWING FACILITIES WHICH CHARGE INTEREST BASED ON THE ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR RATE PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ENTERED INTO  FOUR  FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO THE DEBT TO BE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE QUARTER. SEE \"BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT\".  THESE FOUR FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAPS HAVE A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $866.7 MILLION  AND ARE EFFECTIVE MARCH 11, 2019. WE WILL BEGIN TO RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON 1 MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND IN RETURN ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  2.50%.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  . AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2017, WE BEGAN TO RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND IN RETURN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF  1.19%  PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD.  THESE DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND IN THE SAME PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS.  SEE NOTE 9 AND NOTE14 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $185.8 MILLION  (  $194.4 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  ).  SEE NOTE 9 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES.  CROSS CURRENCY SWAP  WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. ON MARCH 6, 2018 WE ENTERED INTO A CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT SYNTHETICALLY SWAPS  $100.0 MILLION  OF FIXED RATE DEBT TO EURO DENOMINATED FIXED RATE DEBT AT A RATE OF  2.35%  . THE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND WILL MATURE ON MARCH 6, 2023. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THIS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE NET INVESTMENT IS SOLD, DILUTED,  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIQUIDATED. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED FOR THE CROSS CURRENCY SWAP ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT AND ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ON THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  OVERVIEW.  A DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS MD&A.  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  AN ANALYSIS OF OUR OPERATIONS FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPARING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. A DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS FOLLOWED BY A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  AN ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN OUR CASH FLOWS AND A DISCUSSION OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  AN OVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS, COST-SAVING PLANS, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  THE DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST THE READER IN UNDERSTANDING OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR THOSE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF PERSONAL COMPUTING AND OTHER ACCESS DEVICES, IMAGING AND PRINTING PRODUCTS, AND           RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, SOLUTIONS, AND SERVICES. WE SELL TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMBS AND LARGE ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS IN THE GOVERNMENT, HEALTH, AND EDUCATION SECTORS. WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: PERSONAL SYSTEMS, PRINTING AND CORPORATE INVESTMENTS. THE PERSONAL SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DESKTOP AND NOTEBOOK PCS, WORKSTATIONS, THIN CLIENTS, COMMERCIAL MOBILITY DEVICES, RETAIL POS SYSTEMS, DISPLAYS AND OTHER RELATED ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE, SUPPORT, AND SERVICES. THE PRINTING SEGMENT PROVIDES CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PRINTER HARDWARE, SUPPLIES, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS SCANNING DEVICES. CORPORATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE HP LABS AND CERTAIN BUSINESS INCUBATION PROJECTS.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH HYPER MARKET SEGMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO ENHANCED INNOVATION IN MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEMS, MULTI-ARCHITECTURE, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND OTHER KEY ATTRIBUTES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE INVESTING IN PREMIUM FORM FACTORS SUCH AS CONVERTIBLE NOTEBOOKS TO MEET CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR MOBILE, THINNER AND LIGHTER DEVICES. WE HAVE  INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON DEVICE AS A SERVICE AS THE MARKET BEGINS TO SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED DUE TO OUR COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LINEUP.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH FOCUS IS ON SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS AND GRAPHICS, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR FOOTPRINT IN THE 3D PRINTING MARKETPLACE. THE SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDES AN INCREASED FOCUS ON MPS AND INSTANT INK, SUPPORTING OUR STRATEGY OF PLACING HIGHER VALUE PRINTER UNITS (INCLUDING OUR A3 PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS) WHICH OFFER STRONG ANNUITY OF TONER AND INK. IN THE GRAPHICS SPACE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATIONS SUCH AS OUR INDIGO AND LATEX PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH SUPPORT ACCELERATED GROWTH IN OUR GRAPHIC SOLUTIONS. WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR KEY INITIATIVES OF FOCUSING ON HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS TARGETED AT HIGH USAGE CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW REVENUE DELIVERY MODELS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ONE SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO DYNAMIC MARKET TRENDS, SUCH AS FORECASTED DECLINING PC CLIENT MARKETS AND HOME PRINTING MARKETS. A SECOND SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS ARE EXERTING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE IN TARGETED AREAS AND ARE ENTERING NEW MARKETS, OUR EMERGING COMPETITORS ARE INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, AND OUR ALLIANCE PARTNERS IN SOME BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING OUR COMPETITORS IN OTHERS. A THIRD SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO BUSINESS MODEL CHANGES AND OUR GO-TO-MARKET EXECUTION IN AN EVOLVING DISTRIBUTION AND RESELLER LANDSCAPE, WITH INCREASING OMNICHANNEL PRESENCE.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS,  WE FACE CHALLENGES WITH INDUSTRY COMPONENT AVAILABILITY.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  \u2022  IN PRINTING,  WE  OBTAIN MANY COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE SOURCES DUE TO TECHNOLOGY, AVAILABILITY, PRICE, QUALITY OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE SOURCE THE  MAJORITY OF OUR A4 AND A PORTION OF OUR A3 PORTFOLIO OF  LASER PRINTER ENGINES AND LASER TONER CARTRIDGES FROM CANON. ANY DECISION BY EITHER PARTY TO NOT RENEW OUR AGREEMENT WITH CANON OR TO LIMIT OR REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE FROM LASERJET PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH CANON AND ANTICIPATE RENEWAL OF THIS AGREEMENT. WE ARE ALSO SEEING INCREASES IN COMMODITY COSTS IMPACTING OUR BILL OF MATERIALS.  OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ALSO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES, TARIFF-DRIVEN HEADWINDS,  UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS, VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES, WEAKER MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND EVOLVING DYNAMICS IN THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT.  THE IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON OUR BUSINESS CANNOT BE KNOWN AT THIS TIME.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE INNOVATION WITH A VIEW TOWARDS DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALIGNED WITH GENERATING MARKET DEMAND AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR END-TO-END PROCESSES, ANALYTICS AND EFFICIENCIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OPTIMIZING OUR SALES COVERAGE MODELS, ALIGN OUR SALES INCENTIVES WITH OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, IMPROVE CHANNEL EXECUTION, STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITIES IN OUR AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS, AND DEVELOP AND CAPITALIZE ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL HOLIDAY DEMAND. HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRENDS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MD&A IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN MD&A IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31,  2018  , EXCEPT AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN \u201cNOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d, WE HAVE ADOPTED THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICY IS UPDATED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE DEPICTING THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE ARE EXPECTED TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE EVALUATE CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO PAY BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS LIKE HISTORICAL PAYMENT EXPERIENCE, FINANCIAL METRICS AND CUSTOMER CREDIT SCORES.  WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND WHILE MANY OF OUR SALES CONTRACTS CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CONTRACTS WHICH CONTAIN NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FURTHER, MANY OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT INTERPRETATION MAY BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS CONSIDERED TO BE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, THE ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE TIMING OF TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR EACH OF THOSE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  WE EVALUATE EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN AN ARRANGEMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT REPRESENTS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSTITUTES A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WHEN THE CUSTOMER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE GOODS OR SERVICES EITHER ON ITS OWN OR TOGETHER WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS DISTINCT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTRACT.  TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER. IF THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES A VARIABLE AMOUNT, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT USING EITHER THE EXPECTED VALUE OR MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD. WE REDUCE THE TRANSACTION PRICE AT THE TIME OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVE OFFERINGS, REBATES, PROMOTIONS, OTHER VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES AND EXPECTED RETURNS. WE USE ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH PROGRAMS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, EXPECTED CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  WHEN A SALES ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS HARDWARE AND/OR SERVICES, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SELLING PRICE. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS BASED ON ITS STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (\u201cSSP\u201d). WE ESTABLISH SSP USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION WHEN SOLD  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  SEPARATELY (\u201cOBSERVABLE PRICE\u201d) AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, USING THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY. WHEN OBSERVABLE PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE ESTABLISH SSP BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT CONSIDERING INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS MARGIN OBJECTIVES, PRICING PRACTICES AND CONTROLS, CUSTOMER SEGMENT PRICING STRATEGIES AND THE PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO MARKET CONDITIONS SUCH AS COMPETITOR PRICING STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY LIFE CYCLES. WE MAY MODIFY OR DEVELOP NEW GO-TO-MARKET PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, IMPACTING STANDALONE SELLING PRICE DETERMINATION. IN MOST ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICE. HOWEVER, THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS MAY RESULT IN A DIFFERENT SSP DETERMINATION APPLYING MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THIS MAY CHANGE THE PATTERN AND TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR IDENTICAL ARRANGEMENTS EXECUTED IN FUTURE PERIODS BUT WILL NOT CHANGE THE TOTAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR ANY GIVEN ARRANGEMENT.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN, OR AS, A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER. WE GENERALLY INVOICE THE CUSTOMER UPON DELIVERY OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES AND THE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AS PER CONTRACT TERMS. FOR FIXED PRICE SUPPORT OR MAINTENANCE AND OTHER SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN THE NATURE OF STAND-READY OBLIGATIONS, PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY RECEIVED IN ADVANCE FROM CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER TIME FOR THE DURATION OF THE CONTRACT. IN INSTANCES WHEN REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM SALES OF THIRD-PARTY VENDOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, WE RECORD REVENUE ON A GROSS BASIS WHEN WE ARE A PRINCIPAL IN THE TRANSACTION AND ON A NET BASIS WHEN WE ARE ACTING AS AN AGENT BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE VENDOR. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL OR AN AGENT, MOST NOTABLY WHETHER WE ARE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER, HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR OWN PRICING AND HAVE INVENTORY AND CREDIT RISKS.  TAXES ON EARNINGS  THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW. THE TCJA LOWERED OUR U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, WHILE ALSO IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED SAB NO. 118, WHICH ALLOWS REGISTRANTS TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A ONE YEAR \u201cMEASUREMENT PERIOD\u201d.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TCJA WITH NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  IN JANUARY 2018, THE FASB RELEASED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR TAX ON THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX PROVISIONS OF TCJA. THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX PROVISIONS IMPOSE A TAX ON FOREIGN INCOME IN EXCESS OF A DEEMED RETURN ON TANGIBLE ASSETS OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. THE GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT EITHER ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSIONS OR TO TREAT ANY TAXES ON GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSIONS AS PERIOD COST ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE METHODS SUBJECT TO AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION. WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSION AS PERIOD COSTS.  PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE WE HAD PLANNED TO REINVEST SUCH EARNINGS INDEFINITELY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS OF FOREIGN EARNINGS BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW NEEDS AS WELL AS THE WORKING CAPITAL AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO INDEFINITELY INVEST OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMOUNTS WE EXPECT TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE THE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES DUE ON AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES AND, IN SOME CASES, IS WHOLLY EXEMPT FROM TAXES FOR FISCAL YEARS THROUGH 2027.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FOR A SUMMARY OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEE NOTE 1, \u201cBASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d, TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT, A MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR NET REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE SUPPLEMENT THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE WITH THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD REVENUES USING MONTHLY AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD AND DOES NOT ADJUST FOR ANY REPRICING OR DEMAND IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SO THAT NET REVENUE CAN BE VIEWED WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES OUR NET REVENUE RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY MEASURES ARE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A GAAP BASIS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE AND DEFINE SIMILARLY LABELED ITEMS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF THIS MEASURE FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES.

U.S. NET REVENUE DECREASED 2% TO $4.9 BILLION, WHILE NET REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCREASED 3% TO $9.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS AND PRINTING HARDWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINE IN SUPPLIES AND DESKTOPS, AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET EXPENSE INCREASED BY  $18 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKET-RELATED RETIREMENT CREDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO REDUCTION OF DEBT IN MARCH 2018.  (PROVISION FOR) BENEFIT FROM TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  10.8%  AND (114.1%) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE GENERALLY DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 23% DUE TO THE IMPACT OF U.S. TAX REFORM, AND FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. TAXES FOR ALL FOREIGN EARNINGS BECAUSE WE PLAN TO REINVEST SOME OF THOSE EARNINGS INDEFINITELY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED  $9 MILLION  OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. AS DISCUSSED IN THE NOTE 5, WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FULL IMPACT OF TCJA. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE RECORDED TAX BENEFIT OF $21 MILLION RELATED TO FINAL TAX REFORM ADJUSTMENTS AND A TAX BENEFIT OF $12 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $20 MILLION AND OTHER TAX CHARGES OF $4 MILLION.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED $1.1 BILLION OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2018, WE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FULL IMPACT OF TCJA HOWEVER WE RECORDED A PROVISIONAL TAX BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION RELATED TO $5.5 BILLION NET BENEFIT FOR THE DECREASE IN OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.2 BILLION NET EXPENSE FOR THE REPATRIATION TAX PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS AND $1.2 BILLION NET EXPENSE FOR REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE REVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW US RATE OF 21%. THIS AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, ACQUISITION CHARGES AND OTHER TAX BENEFITS OF $32 MILLION, $18 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $43 MILLION.

FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE SEGMENTS DISCLOSED.  REALIGNMENT  EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE IMPLEMENTED AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE TO ALIGN OUR BUSINESS UNIT FINANCIAL REPORTING MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRUCTURE. THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN SAMSUNG-BRANDED PRODUCT CATEGORIES FROM COMMERCIAL TO CONSUMER WITHIN THE PRINTING SEGMENT. WE REFLECTED THIS CHANGE TO OUR BUSINESS UNIT INFORMATION IN PRIOR REPORTING PERIODS ON AN AS-IF BASIS. THE REPORTING CHANGE HAD NO IMPACT TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SEGMENT NET REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS, NET EARNINGS OR NET EPS.

THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS AND WORKSTATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS AND A DECLINE IN DESKTOPS DUE TO COMPONENT AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS. THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A 5.5% INCREASE IN ASPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3.0% DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN ASPS WAS DUE TO POSITIVE MIX SHIFTS AND HIGHER PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS. THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINE IN DESKTOPS.  CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL REVENUE INCREASED 1.3% AND 2.8%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER ASPS.  NET REVENUE DECREASED 3.3% IN DESKTOPS AND INCREASED 5.8% IN NOTEBOOKS AND 3.5% IN WORKSTATIONS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  PERSONAL SYSTEMS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AND A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COMMODITY AND LOGISTICS COSTS. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.

THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HARDWARE, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS REVENUE, AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. NET REVENUE FOR SUPPLIES DECREASED 2.5% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEMAND WEAKNESS. PRINTER UNIT VOLUME INCREASED 2.6% WHILE ASPS DECREASED 2.7% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY UNIT INCREASES IN CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL HARDWARE. PRINTER ASPS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DISCOUNTING.  NET REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL HARDWARE INCREASED BY 5.1% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE APOGEE GROUP INCLUDING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS.  NET REVENUE FOR CONSUMER HARDWARE INCREASED 1.6% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2.4% INCREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 1.2% DECREASE IN ASPS. THE UNIT VOLUME INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE LASERJET HOME BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN ASPS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MIX SHIFT TO LOW-END PRINTERS.  PRINTING EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN. THE GROSS MARGIN DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SUPPLIES MIX. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.  CORPORATE INVESTMENTS  THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE INVESTMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INCUBATION PROJECTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS ARE GENERALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, MATURING DEBT, INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND THE PAYMENT OF STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS, IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THIS SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, IF NECESSARY, WITH BROAD ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND CREDIT FACILITIES MADE AVAILABLE BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WHILE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND OUR COST OF BORROWING MAY INCREASE UNDER CERTAIN BUSINESS, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESOURCES UNDER ALL SUCH CONDITIONS. OUR LIQUIDITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS INCLUDING THE RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 AND THE MARKET RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d IN ITEM 3 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  OUR CASH BALANCES ARE HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. OUR CASH POSITION REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH BALANCES, ANTICIPATED CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR EXPECTED NEAR-TERM CASH OUTLAYS.  AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NON-U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX WILL BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS BEGINNING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON A SUBSEQUENT REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THIS CASH MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN INCOME TAX OR WITHHOLDING TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON REPATRIATION. AS WE EVALUATE THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REVISE THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND HOW TO UTILIZE SUCH FUNDS, INCLUDING REDUCING OUR GROSS DEBT LEVEL, OR OTHER USES.

DSO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR RECEIVABLES ARE OUTSTANDING. DSO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE NET REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN DSO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE REVENUE LINEARITY.  DOS MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM PROCUREMENT TO SALE OF OUR PRODUCT. DOS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DOS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTION IN INVENTORY DRIVEN BY RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN BALANCES TO OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, PURSUANT TO ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  DPO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES ARE OUTSTANDING. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN DPO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY PURCHASING VOLUME AND NEGOTIATED VENDOR PAYMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $1.4 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $0.6 BILLION, A DECREASE IN COLLATERAL RELATED TO OUR DERIVATIVES OF $0.5 BILLION AND INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS BY $0.4 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $1.5 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $0.9 BILLION, PAYMENT OF DEBT OF $0.4 BILLION AND A HIGHER SHARE REPURCHASE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT OF $0.3 BILLION.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  DEBT LEVELS  51  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC.

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS DECREASED TO  $5.0 BILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO  $6.0 BILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31,  2018  , BEARING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES OF  4.7%  AND  4.3%  FOR  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  OCTOBER 31,  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  OUR WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE REFLECTS THE AVERAGE EFFECTIVE RATE ON OUR BORROWINGS PREVAILING DURING THE PERIOD AND REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

CREDIT RATINGS  OUR CREDIT RISK IS EVALUATED BY MAJOR INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES BASED UPON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION AS WELL AS INFORMATION OBTAINED IN OUR ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM. WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RATING DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT, PREVIOUS DOWNGRADES HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, HAVE REDUCED MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HAVE REQUIRED THE POSTING OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL UNDER SOME OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, ANY FURTHER DOWNGRADE TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS BY ANY RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER IMPACT US IN A SIMILAR MANNER, AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF ANY SUCH DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. WE CAN ACCESS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING DRAWDOWNS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, IF NECESSARY, TO OFFSET POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER.  CONTRACTUAL AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS  RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE ANTICIPATE MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  OF APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION TO OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, $26 MILLION TO COVER BENEFIT PAYMENTS TO U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND $4 MILLION TO COVER BENEFIT CLAIMS FOR OUR POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS.

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION OF RECORDED LIABILITIES AND RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES PERTAINING TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. WE ARE UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE AS TO WHEN CASH SETTLEMENT WITH THE TAX AUTHORITIES MIGHT OCCUR DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO THESE TAX MATTERS. PAYMENTS OF THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD RESULT FROM SETTLEMENTS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

PAYMENT OF ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAXES UNDER THE TCJA  THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO U.S. TAX LAW RESULTING IN A ONE-TIME GROSS TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS OF $3.3 BILLION. WE EXPECT THE ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR THE TAX TO BE MUCH LOWER AS WE EXPECT TO REDUCE THE OVERALL LIABILITY BY MORE THAN HALF ONCE EXISTING AND FUTURE CREDITS AND OTHER BALANCE SHEET ATTRIBUTES ARE USED. THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX WILL BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS BEGINNING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE SET FORTH HEREIN; OPERATIONS DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION; OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND SERVICE TECHNICIANS WHO RELATE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS; THE REDUCTION, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR DELAY OF PURCHASES OF INNOVATIVE, HIGH-MARGIN EQUIPMENT; MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS; CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTAINED AND IDENTIFIED IN PATTERSON\u2019S PREVIOUS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ANY OF WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  IS SUMMARIZED IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND IS PROVIDED TO READERS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE PRESENT THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: DENTAL, ANIMAL HEALTH AND CORPORATE. DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH ARE STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS THAT OFFER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASES. DENTAL PROVIDES A VIRTUALLY COMPLETE RANGE OF CONSUMABLE DENTAL PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE, TURNKEY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO DENTISTS AND DENTAL LABORATORIES THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. ANIMAL HEALTH IS A LEADING, FULL-LINE DISTRIBUTOR IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE U.K. OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BOTH THE PRODUCTION-ANIMAL AND COMPANION-PET MARKETS. OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING HOME OFFICE SUPPORT COSTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, FINANCE, LEGAL, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMER FINANCING AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN CORPORATE RESULTS.  OPERATING MARGINS OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE DENTAL BUSINESS. WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES RUN AT A LOWER RATE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS WHEN COMPARED TO THE DENTAL BUSINESS, GROSS MARGINS IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER DUE GENERALLY TO THE LOW MARGINS EXPERIENCED ON THE SALE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE OPERATE WITH A 52-53 WEEK ACCOUNTING CONVENTION WITH OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL. THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND 2018 REPRESENTS THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  AND THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  AND  JANUARY 27, 2018  EACH INCLUDED 39 WEEKS. FISCAL 2019 WILL INCLUDE 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 52 WEEKS.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT ARE USEFUL IN ANALYZING IT, INCLUDING: (1) GROWTH IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; (2) INTERNAL GROWTH; (3) GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION; AND (4) CONTINUED FOCUS ON CONTROLLING COSTS AND ENHANCING EFFICIENCY. MANAGEMENT DEFINES INTERNAL GROWTH AS THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBER OF WEEKS IN FISCAL YEARS, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND EXCLUDING THE NET SALES, FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION DATE, OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  U.S. TAX REFORM  . ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d). THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY REVISES THE FUTURE ONGOING U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATES AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE TAX ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%.  RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM.  ON JULY 24, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH MUFG BANK, LTD. (\"MUFG\"). UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, MUFG ACTS AS AN AGENT TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN PATTERSON RECEIVABLES (THE \u201cRECEIVABLES\u201d) TO CERTAIN UNAFFILIATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (THE \u201cPURCHASERS\u201d).  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE RECEIVABLES COMPRISE A COMBINATION OF CASH AND A DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\u201cDPP\u201d) RECEIVABLE. THE INITIAL TRANSACTION WAS A SALE OF $237.6 MILLION OF NET RECEIVABLES.  FROM THIS SALE, WE RECEIVED $171.0 MILLION OF CASH AND A DPP RECEIVABLE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $65.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.7 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL SALE WERE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE DEBT.  THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY PATTERSON FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO THE PURCHASERS. THE COLLECTION OF THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  LEGAL RESERVE  . IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION ENTITLED  IN RE DENTAL SUPPLIES ANTITRUST LITIGATION  . UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE PAID $28.3 MILLION INTO ESCROW UPON PRELIMINARY COURT APPROVAL.  SUCH FUNDS WILL BE RELEASED UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT.  WE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED A PRE-TAX RESERVE OF $28.3 MILLION (\"LEGAL RESERVE\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER.

DENTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $51.1 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $7.3 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AS WELL AS LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $15.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $3.0 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW  ABM IS A LEADING PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED FACILITY SERVICES, CUSTOMIZED BY INDUSTRY, WITH A MISSION TO  MAKE A DIFFERENCE, EVERY PERSON, EVERY DAY.  2020  VISION  DEVELOPMENTS IN 2019  IN SEPTEMBER 2015, WE ANNOUNCED A COMPREHENSIVE TRANSFORMATION INITIATIVE (\u201c  2020  VISION  \u201d) INTENDED TO DRIVE LONG-TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH AN INDUSTRY-BASED GO-TO-MARKET APPROACH. WE CONTINUE FOCUSING ON SEVERAL KEY INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION TO SUSTAIN OUR  2020  VISION  STRATEGY AND PROFITABLY DELIVER LEADING INDUSTRY-BASED FACILITY SOLUTIONS. WE ARE TARGETING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE TO HELP SIMPLIFY OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, DRIVE PRODUCTIVITY, AND CREATE CONSISTENCY AND EFFICIENCY ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION. WE CONTINUE UPGRADING SEVERAL KEY PLATFORMS, INCLUDING OUR HUMAN RESOURCES INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM, AND LABOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE ARE ALSO UTILIZING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP IMPROVE PROCESSES COMPANY-WIDE, INCLUDING ACCOUNT PLANNING, LABOR MANAGEMENT, PAYROLL, AND PROCUREMENT. WE CONTINUE TO CENTRALIZE MANY OF OUR BACK-OFFICE FUNCTIONS THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE SERVICES CENTER IN SUGAR LAND, TEXAS TO HELP DRIVE CONSISTENCY IN PRACTICE AND SUPPORT OPERATING EFFICIENCY. IN ADDITION, BY CONSOLIDATING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR SCALE, INCREASE OUR PURCHASING POWER, AND IDENTIFY PREFERRED SUPPLIERS, WHICH HAS ENABLED COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES IN SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS PROCUREMENT.  DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS  ECONOMIC LABOR OUTLOOK  THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE POSITIVE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS, WITH EXPANDING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH AND IMPROVING EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS, WHICH HAVE LED TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS OF BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED LABOR FOR OUR BUSINESS AND HIGHER TURNOVER IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AS OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OUR INDUSTRY. THIS IN TURN HAS CAUSED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO CAUSE, HIGHER LABOR AND RELATED PERSONNEL COSTS.  28  RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF GCA SERVICES GROUP (\u201cGCA\u201d). WE INCURRED THE MAJORITY OF OUR ANTICIPATED SEVERANCE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER PROJECT FEES AS WE CONTINUE TO FURTHER INTEGRATE AND CONSOLIDATE OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PROCESSES TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR SHARED SERVICES AND OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE STANDARDIZING OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND STREAMLINING OUR OPERATIONS BY MIGRATING AND UPGRADING SEVERAL KEY MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS, INCLUDING OUR HUMAN RESOURCES INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM, AND LABOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. WE ALSO CONTINUE CONSOLIDATING OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES.

EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE HAVE MODIFIED THE PRESENTATION OF INTER-SEGMENT REVENUES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AT COST WITH NO ASSOCIATED INTERCOMPANY PROFIT OR LOSS AND ARE ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. OUR PRIOR PERIOD SEGMENT DATA HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH OUR FISCAL 2019 PRESENTATION. THESE CHANGES HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR PREVIOUSLY REPORTED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, OR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW INDICATED THE CHANGES WE HAVE MADE TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAVE REDUCED THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS; HOWEVER, WE ARE EXPERIENCING ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS THAT IMPACT CLAIM COSTS RELATING TO PRIOR PERIODS. CLAIM MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES INCLUDE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY THOSE CLAIMS EARLIER IN THE CLAIMS CYCLE THAT MAY POTENTIALLY DEVELOP ADVERSELY AND ENSURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACT PATTERNS. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW SHOWED UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, AND AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS, WE INCREASED OUR TOTAL RESERVES FOR KNOWN CLAIMS AS WELL AS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED CLAIMS BY  $5.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS  $3.0 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN THE TOTAL ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS OF  $2.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES.  KEY FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS  \u2022  REVENUES  INCREASED  BY  $19.6 MILLION  , OR  1.2%  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018.  \u2022  OPERATING PROFIT  INCREASED  BY  $10.8 MILLION  , OR  55.4%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER GROSS MARGIN, PARTICULARLY WITHIN B&I, AND LOWER CORPORATE EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED EXPENSES.  \u2022  OUR INCOME TAXES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  INCREASED BY  $0.7 MILLION DUE TO CERTAIN RESERVES AND DECREASED BY  $0.5 MILLION  OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS. COMPARATIVELY, THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  , BENEFITED FROM A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF  $21.7 MILLION  RELATED TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED UNDER THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \u201c  TAX ACT  \u201d) AND $1.5 MILLION OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS.  \u2022  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $39.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  TYPICALLY, OUR TOTAL OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ARE LOWER THAN IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. WE EXPECT OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FOR 2019.  \u2022  DIVIDENDS OF  $11.9 MILLION  WERE PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $0.180  PER COMMON SHARE WERE DECLARED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  \u2022  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , TOTAL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WERE  $997.0 MILLION  , AND WE HAD UP TO  $410.2 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY; HOWEVER, COVENANT RESTRICTIONS LIMITED OUR ACTUAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO  $352.5 MILLION.  30  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2018  CONSOLIDATED  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  ($ IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  REVENUES  $1,607.9  $1,588.3  $19.6  1.2%  OPERATING EXPENSES  1,446.0  1,429.3  16.7  1.2%  GROSS MARGIN  10.1%  10.0%  6 BPS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  112.7  109.0  3.7  3.4%  RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED EXPENSES  3.8  14.3  (10.5  )  (73.6)%  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  15.2  16.2  (1.0  )  (6.2)%  OPERATING PROFIT  30.3  19.5  10.8  55.4%  INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET  0.9  0.5  0.4  71.1%  INTEREST EXPENSE  (13.5  )  (14.3  )  0.8  (5.7)%  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  17.8  5.8  12.0  NM*  INCOME TAX (PROVISION) BENEFIT  (4.7  )  22.2  (26.9  )  NM*  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  13.0  28.0  (15.0  )  (53.4)%  LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES  (0.1  )  (0.1  )  \u2014  (55.8)%  NET INCOME  13.0  27.8  (14.8  )  (53.4)%  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  INTEREST RATE SWAPS  (8.7  )  18.6  (27.3  )  NM*  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  3.1  9.4  (6.3  )  (67.4)%  INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION)  2.4  (5.0  )  7.4  NM*  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  $9.7  $50.9  $(41.2  )  (80.9)%  *NOT MEANINGFUL  REVENUES  REVENUES  INCREASED  BY  $19.6 MILLION  , OR  1.2%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ORGANIC GROWTH IN B&I, IN OUR U.S. TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, AND IN T&M. THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A RECLASSIFICATION OF  $11.3 MILLION  OF RENT EXPENSE RELATED TO SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS, PRIMARILY WITHIN AVIATION. THIS EXPENSE WAS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE BUT IS NOW RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUES, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 853.

THE  INCREASE  IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MARGINS ON CERTAIN B&I AND T&M ACCOUNTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER SELF-INSURANCE ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS.  31  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $3.7 MILLION  , OR  3.4%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO.  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF A $4.0 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED LEGAL SETTLEMENT COSTS;  \u2022  A  $3.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED SUPPORT; AND  \u2022  A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CLIENT RECEIVABLES.  THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A $5.4 MILLION DECREASE IN COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF $1.4 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

OUR INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  INCREASED BY  $0.7 MILLION DUE TO CERTAIN RESERVES AND DECREASED BY  $0.5 MILLION  OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS. COMPARATIVELY, OUR INCOME TAXES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A NET DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT OF  $21.7 MILLION  RELATED TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED UNDER THE  TAX ACT  AND  $1.5 MILLION  OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS.  INTEREST RATE SWAPS  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF OUR COMPREHENSIVE INCOME A LOSS OF  $8.7 MILLION  RELATED TO OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COMPARED WITH A GAIN OF  $18.6 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  , DUE TO UNDERLYING CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN OUR U.S. BUSINESS, A DECREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES IN CERTAIN STATES, AND LOWER LEGAL SETTLEMENT COSTS. THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN OUR U.K. BUSINESS AND A PROVISION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF A UNION HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS AUDIT.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS AND THE LOSS OF A LOW MARGIN ACCOUNT IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CLIENT RECEIVABLES AND  AN INCREASE IN WAGES AND RELATED PERSONNEL COSTS.  34  EDUCATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  ($ IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  REVENUES  $204.7  $206.9  $(2.2  )  (1.1)%  OPERATING PROFIT  10.3  9.2  1.1  11.8%  OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN  5.0%  4.4%  58 BPS  EDUCATION REVENUES  DECREASED  BY  $2.2 MILLION  , OR  1.1%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  .

THIS  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN OUR U.S. BUSINESS RELATED TO POWER PROJECTS AND BUNDLED ENERGY SOLUTIONS PROJECTS DUE TO THE TIMING OF BOOKINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTRACTION OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN OUR U.K. BUSINESS.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN SALES COMMISSIONS EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED WHEN INCURRED, BUT ARE NOW CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP PERIOD. THE  INCREASE  WAS ALSO DUE TO LOWER AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. THE  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS ON CERTAIN POWER PROJECTS AND ON ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS IN OUR U.S. BUSINESS, THE LOSS OF CERTAIN HIGHER MARGIN CONTRACTS IN OUR U.K. BUSINESS, AND SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CERTAIN CLIENT RECEIVABLES.

THE  DECREASE  IN CORPORATE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO.  \u2022  A  $10.5 MILLION  DECREASE IN RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF  RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, MAINLY SEVERANCE, INCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF GCA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED INTEGRATION EXPENSES IN THE CURRENT YEAR  ;  \u2022  $1.7 MILLION LOWER COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSE; AND  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF $1.4 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THIS  DECREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF A $4.0 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED LEGAL SETTLEMENT COSTS;  \u2022  A  $3.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED SUPPORT; AND  \u2022  A  $3.0 MILLION  HIGHER ADJUSTMENT TO SELF-INSURANCE RESERVES RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS AS A RESULT OF AN ACTUARIAL REVIEW COMPLETED IN THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  36  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. WE ASSESS OUR LIQUIDITY IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO FUND OUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS. AS SUCH, WE PROJECT OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS.  IN ADDITION TO NORMAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL INCLUDE FUNDING LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, INSURANCE CLAIMS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND INTEGRATION COSTS RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION. WE ANTICIPATE LONG-TERM CASH USES WILL ALSO INCLUDE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IN THE EVENT THAT OUR PLANS CHANGE OR OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GREATER THAN WE ANTICIPATE, WE MAY NEED TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FINANCE FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US SHOULD WE NEED IT OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE TERMS WILL BE SATISFACTORY TO US AND NOT DILUTIVE TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS.  ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY FOR ANY LONG-TERM FUNDING NOT PROVIDED BY OPERATING CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT FUTURE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE AUGMENTED BY WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS DRIVEN BY OUR  2020  VISION  , SUCH AS THE MANAGEMENT OF COSTS THROUGH CONSOLIDATED PROCUREMENT.  IFM ASSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cIFM\u201d) IS A WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WE FORMED IN 2015. IFM IS PART OF OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE, MULTI-YEAR INSURANCE STRATEGY THAT IS INTENDED TO BETTER POSITION OUR RISK AND SAFETY PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE US WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN THE END-TO-END MANAGEMENT OF OUR INSURANCE PROGRAMS. IFM BEGAN PROVIDING COVERAGE TO US AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015. IN  2019  , WE EXPECT ACCELERATED CASH TAX SAVINGS RELATED TO COVERAGE PROVIDED BY IFM TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $5 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2017, WE REFINANCED AND REPLACED OUR THEN-EXISTING  $800.0 MILLION  CREDIT FACILITY WITH A NEW SENIOR, SECURED FIVE-YEAR SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d), CONSISTING OF A  $900.0 MILLION  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND AN  $800.0 MILLION  AMORTIZING TERM LOAN, SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2022. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE LINE OF CREDIT WAS REDUCED TO  $800.0 MILLION  ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. INITIAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WERE USED TO FINANCE, IN PART, THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION, TO REFINANCE CERTAIN EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS OF ABM, AND TO PAY TRANSACTION COSTS.  OUR ABILITY TO DRAW DOWN AVAILABLE CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED, IS SUBJECT TO, AND LIMITED BY, COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WHICH INCLUDE A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4.50 TO 1.0, WHICH STEPS DOWN TO 3.50 TO 1.0 BY JULY 2021, AND A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.50 TO 1.0. OTHER COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON LIENS, DISPOSITIONS, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES, INVESTMENTS, AND CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND PAYMENTS. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , WE MADE  $10.0 MILLION  OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY IN THE FORM OF CASH BORROWINGS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE  $997.0 MILLION  AND  $152.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD UP TO  $410.2 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY; HOWEVER, COVENANT RESTRICTIONS LIMITED OUR ACTUAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO  $352.5 MILLION.  REINVESTMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS  WE PLAN TO REINVEST OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS TO FUND FUTURE NON-U.S. GROWTH AND EXPANSION, AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE REMITTING SUCH EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES. WHILE U.S. FEDERAL TAX EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, NO DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED.  37  SHARE REPURCHASES  ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $200.0 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PURCHASES MAY TAKE PLACE ON THE OPEN MARKET OR OTHERWISE, AND ALL OR PART OF THE REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING OF REPURCHASES IS AT OUR DISCRETION AND WILL DEPEND UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS, SHARE PRICE, AND SHARE AVAILABILITY. REPURCHASED SHARES ARE RETIRED AND RETURNED TO AN AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED STATUS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  . AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AUTHORIZATION FOR  $134.1 MILLION  OF REPURCHASES REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  CASH FLOWS  IN ADDITION TO REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT, OUR MANAGEMENT VIEWS OPERATING CASH FLOWS AS A GOOD INDICATOR OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, BECAUSE STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $39.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  TYPICALLY, OUR TOTAL OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ARE LOWER THAN IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. WE EXPECT OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FOR 2019.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS PRIMARILY DEPEND ON: REVENUE LEVELS; THE QUALITY AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS AND OTHER VENDORS; THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS ON INSURANCE CLAIMS AND LEGAL SETTLEMENTS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  (IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  NET CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(39.3  )  $33.7  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (11.4  )  (15.3  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  42.0  (14.3  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $39.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $33.7 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED  TO THE TIMING OF CLIENT RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  BY  $3.9 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A WORKING CAPITAL SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE GCA ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $42.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $14.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER NET BORROWINGS OF  $46.7 MILLION.  38  CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, AND PROCEEDINGS INCIDENT TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, CONTRACTS, PERSONAL INJURY, AND OTHER MATTERS, SOME OF WHICH ALLEGE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT AS CLASS ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR PURPORTED CLASS OF EMPLOYEES.  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  ,  THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACCRUED FOR ALL PROBABLE LITIGATION LOSSES WHERE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS COULD BE MADE WAS  $12.1 MILLION.  LITIGATION OUTCOMES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND THE ESTIMATION OF PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES. IF ONE OR MORE MATTERS ARE RESOLVED IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF, OR IN A MANNER DIFFERENT THAN, WHAT WE ANTICIPATED, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.  WE DO NOT ACCRUE FOR CONTINGENT LOSSES THAT, IN OUR JUDGMENT, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE REASONABLY POSSIBLE BUT NOT PROBABLE. THE ESTIMATION OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES ALSO REQUIRES THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES.  OUR MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THE RANGE OF LOSS FOR ALL REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES FOR WHICH A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS CAN BE MADE IS BETWEEN  ZERO  AND  $6 MILLION.  FACTORS UNDERLYING THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF LOSS MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  IN SOME CASES, ALTHOUGH A LOSS IS PROBABLE OR REASONABLY POSSIBLE, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR PROBABLE MATTERS OR THE RANGE OF LOSSES FOR REASONABLY POSSIBLE MATTERS. THEREFORE, OUR ACCRUAL FOR PROBABLE LOSSES AND OUR ESTIMATED RANGE OF LOSS FOR REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES DO NOT REPRESENT OUR MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE.

IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-17  , CONSOLIDATION (TOPIC 810): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO RELATED PARTY GUIDANCE FOR VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.  THIS ASU PROVIDES THAT INDIRECT INTEREST HELD THROUGH RELATED PARTIES IN COMMON CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ON A PROPORTIONAL BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER FEES PAID TO DECISION MAKERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE VARIABLE INTEREST.  NOVEMBER 1, 2020  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTING THIS GUIDANCE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN OCTOBER 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-16  , DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING (TOPIC 815): INCLUSION OF THE SECURED OVERNIGHT FINANCING RATE (\u201cSOFR\u201d) OVERNIGHT INDEX SWAP (\u201cOIS\u201d) RATE AS A BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.  THIS ASU ADDS THE OIS RATE BASED ON SOFR (A SWAP RATE BASED ON THE UNDERLYING OVERNIGHT SOFR RATE) AS AN ELIGIBLE BENCHMARK INTEREST RATE FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING HEDGE ACCOUNTING. SOFR IS A VOLUME-WEIGHTED MEDIAN INTEREST RATE THAT IS CALCULATED DAILY BASED ON OVERNIGHT TRANSACTIONS FROM THE PRIOR DAY\u2019S TRADING ACTIVITY IN SPECIFIED SEGMENTS OF THE U.S. TREASURY REPO MARKET. SOFR WAS SELECTED BY THE ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATES COMMITTEE AS ITS PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE REFERENCE RATE TO LIBOR.

THIS ASU REPLACES THE EXISTING INCURRED LOSS IMPAIRMENT MODEL WITH A METHODOLOGY THAT INCORPORATES ALL EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS ESTIMATES, RESULTING IN MORE TIMELY RECOGNITION OF LOSSES.  NOVEMBER 1, 2020  THIS STANDARD WILL BE APPLIED USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION APPROACH WITH A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.  WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTING THIS GUIDANCE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  .

OVERVIEW  EATON VANCE CORP. PROVIDES ADVANCED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND  WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO FORWARD-THINKING INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS MANAGING INVESTMENT FUNDS  AND PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. OUR CORE STRATEGY IS  TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES AND TO OFFER LEADING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES  AND SERVICES THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IN EXECUTING OUR CORE STRATEGY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED BROADLY DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION.  WE  MEASURE OUR SUCCESS AS A COMPANY BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DELIVERED, CLIENT SATISFACTION, REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE,  PROGRESS ACHIEVING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND SATISFACTION, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND SHAREHOLDER  VALUE CREATED.  WE CONDUCT OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY BUSINESS  THROUGH WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT AFFILIATES, WHICH INCLUDE: EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, PARAMETRIC PORTFOLIO ASSOCIATES  LLC (PARAMETRIC), ATLANTA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC (ATLANTA CAPITAL) AND CALVERT RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT (CALVERT). WE ALSO  OFFER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES THROUGH MINORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE HEXAVEST INC. (HEXAVEST).  THROUGH EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, ATLANTA CAPITAL, CALVERT AND  OUR OTHER AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE ACTIVE EQUITY, INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT STYLES AND ASSET  CLASSES, INCLUDING U.S. AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, FLOATING-RATE BANK LOANS, MUNICIPAL BONDS, GLOBAL INCOME, HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT  GRADE BONDS. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE MANAGE A RANGE OF SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING SYSTEMATIC EQUITY, SYSTEMATIC  ALTERNATIVES AND MANAGED OPTIONS STRATEGIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE ALSO PROVIDE CUSTOM  46  PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERLAY SERVICES, INCLUDING TAX-MANAGED  AND NON-TAX-MANAGED CUSTOM CORE EQUITY STRATEGIES, CENTRALIZED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OF MULTI-MANAGER PORTFOLIOS AND EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT  SERVICES. WE ALSO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND DISTRIBUTE, INVESTMENT FUNDS SUB-ADVISED BY UNAFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS,  INCLUDING GLOBAL, EMERGING MARKET AND REGIONAL EQUITY AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES.  OUR BREADTH OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES SUPPORTS  A WIDE RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND SERVICES OFFERED TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS, RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNT INVESTORS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS  AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS.  OUR EQUITY STRATEGIES ENCOMPASS A DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES,  RISK PROFILES, INCOME LEVELS AND GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION. OUR INCOME INVESTMENT STRATEGIES COVER A BROAD DURATION, GEOGRAPHIC  REPRESENTATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RANGE AND ENCOMPASS BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-FREE INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO OFFER A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING COMMODITY- AND CURRENCY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGIES. ALTHOUGH WE MANAGE AND  DISTRIBUTE A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, WE OPERATE IN ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, NAMELY AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER  TO FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD $444.7 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDS AND RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNTS PRINCIPALLY  THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. WE HAVE BROAD MARKET REACH, WITH DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS INCLUDING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BROKER-DEALERS,  INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS, BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE SUPPORT THESE DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS  WITH A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 130 SALES PROFESSIONALS COVERING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  WE ALSO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO SERVING INSTITUTIONAL  AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS WHO ACCESS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ON A DIRECT BASIS AND THROUGH INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS. THROUGH  OUR WHOLLY AND MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, WE MANAGE INVESTMENTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CLIENTS IN THE  INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKETPLACE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS, SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, ENDOWMENTS,  FOUNDATIONS, FAMILY OFFICES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS.  OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION  AND SERVICE FEES RECEIVED FROM EATON VANCE-, PARAMETRIC- AND CALVERT-BRANDED FUNDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED FROM SEPARATE ACCOUNTS.  OUR FEES ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE AND FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THE TOTAL VALUE  AND MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A MATTER OF COURSE, INVESTORS IN OUR SPONSORED OPEN-END FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS HAVE  THE ABILITY TO REDEEM THEIR INVESTMENTS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AND THERE ARE NO MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT  THEM FROM DOING SO. OUR MAJOR EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, DISTRIBUTION-RELATED EXPENSES, SERVICE FEE EXPENSE, FUND-RELATED  EXPENSES, FACILITIES EXPENSE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES  US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE  ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, INVESTMENTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS  THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE  CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE  ESTIMATES.  47  CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE PURSUING FIVE PRIMARY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES TO SUPPORT  BUSINESS GROWTH: (1) BUILDING UPON AND DEFENDING OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN SPECIALTY STRATEGIES AND SERVICES FOR HIGH-NET-WORTH  AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; (2) CAPITALIZING ON THE CURRENT INTEREST ENVIRONMENT TO GROW OUR MARKET POSITION IN FLOATING-RATE  AND SHORT-DURATION FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES; (3) EXPANDING OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING; (4) INCREASING OUR  GLOBAL INVESTMENT CAPABILITIES AND DISTRIBUTION REACH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; AND (5) POSITIONING EATON VANCE TO PROFIT FROM  A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE  STRONG GROWTH IN OUR CUSTOM BETA STRATEGIES, WHICH INCLUDE PARAMETRIC\u2019S CUSTOM CORE EQUITY AND EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT\u2019S  LADDERED MUNICIPAL AND CORPORATE BOND SEPARATE ACCOUNT STRATEGIES. THESE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS COMBINE THE BENEFITS OF PASSIVE  INVESTING WITH THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PORTFOLIOS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. COMPARED TO INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS AND  EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, CUSTOM CORE SEPARATE ACCOUNTS CAN PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO TAILOR THEIR MARKET EXPOSURES TO ACHIEVE  BETTER TAX OUTCOMES AND TO REFLECT CLIENT-SPECIFIED RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CRITERIA AND OTHER DESIRED PORTFOLIO TILTS AND EXCLUSIONS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NET INFLOWS INTO OUR CUSTOM BETA STRATEGIES OFFERED AS INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS TOTALED  $3.9 BILLION, WHICH EQUATES TO ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 19 PERCENT.  IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT FOR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN INVESTMENT  STRATEGIES, WE SAW NET OUTFLOWS OF $2.9 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS INVESTORS REDUCED THEIR EXPOSURE TO BELOW  INVESTMENT GRADE CREDITS. OUR LINEUP OF FIXED INCOME MUTUAL FUNDS POSITIONED AS SHORT- OR ULTRA-SHORT DURATION, SHORT-TERM OR ADJUSTABLE-RATE,  WHICH INVEST PRIMARILY IN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE STRONG APPEAL TO INVESTORS IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AMONG OUR LEADING FUNDS IN THIS CATEGORY ARE THE HIGHLY RATED EATON VANCE SHORT-DURATION GOVERNMENT INCOME  AND EATON VANCE SHORT-DURATION MUNICIPAL OPPORTUNITIES FUNDS, WHICH HAD COMBINED NET INFLOWS OF $1.8 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CONTINUES  TO EXPAND. THE CALVERT FUNDS ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED FAMILIES OF RESPONSIBLY INVESTED MUTUAL FUNDS, ENCOMPASSING  ACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY MANAGED EQUITY, FIXED AND FLOATING-RATE INCOME, AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE CALVERT PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OR OTHER RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. SINCE CALVERT BECAME PART OF EATON  VANCE, WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS GROWING MANAGED ASSETS IN CALVERT-BRANDED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POSITIONING CALVERT  AS A CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) RESEARCH AND ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING THE ATLANTA CAPITAL-SUBADVISED  CALVERT EQUITY FUND, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN CALVERT STRATEGIES GREW TO $15.4 BILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2019 FROM $14.7 BILLION  AT OCTOBER 31, 2018, REFLECTING NET INFLOWS OF $0.6 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $0.1 BILLION. CALVERT\u2019S $0.6  BILLION OF NET INFLOWS FOR THE QUARTER EQUATES TO 17 PERCENT ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH RATE IN MANAGED ASSETS, RANKING AS THE  BEST GROWTH QUARTER SINCE WE ACQUIRED THE CALVERT BUSINESS JUST OVER TWO YEARS AGO.  WHILE CALVERT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT  STRATEGY, OUR COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTING DOES NOT END THERE. EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO INTEGRATE CONSIDERATION  OF RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CRITERIA INTO THE FIRM\u2019S FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROCESSES, CAPITALIZING ON CALVERT\u2019S PROPRIETARY  ESG RESEARCH. ATLANTA CAPITAL ALSO MAINTAINS A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, AND PARAMETRIC MANAGES OVER $20 BILLION  OF CLIENT ASSETS BASED ON CLIENT-DIRECTED RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. ON AN OVERALL BASIS, EATON VANCE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST  PARTICIPANTS IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, A POSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO GROWING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RISING DEMAND FOR INVESTMENT  STRATEGIES THAT INCORPORATE ESG-INTEGRATED INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND/OR ARE MANAGED WITH A DUAL OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE FAVORABLE INVESTMENT  RETURNS AND POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT.  48  WHILE CHANGE IS A CONSTANT IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY,  THE PACE OF CHANGE APPEARS TO BE ACCELERATING. WE SEE THIS IN CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, SHIFTS IN INVESTOR  SENTIMENT AND OUTLOOK, ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS STRATEGIES OF KEY INTERMEDIARIES AND GATEKEEPERS,  AND NEW TAX AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES. THROUGH CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE STRIVE TO ANTICIPATE THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF INVESTORS  AND TO DEVELOP TIMELY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. POSITIONING THE COMPANY FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS AMID ACCELERATING CHANGE  IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  TOGETHER WITH EATON VANCE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND TRUST, FILED AN EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION TO PERMIT THE OFFERING OF EXCHANGE-TRADED  FUNDS (ETFS) THAT WOULD EMPLOY A NOVEL METHOD OF SUPPORTING EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF FUND SHARES, WHICH WE CALL THE  CLEARHEDGE METHOD. BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF CURRENT HOLDINGS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY UNDER THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD, AN ETF\u2019S PORTFOLIO  TRADING ACTIVITY COULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. IN CONJUNCTION WITH FILING THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION, EATON VANCE  FORMED A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS, TO MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ETFS UTILIZING  THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD AND OTHER FUND-RELATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THROUGH LICENSING AND SERVICES AGREEMENTS, EATON VANCE AND  ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS SEEK TO MAKE THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD BROADLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE ETF INDUSTRY, INCLUDING ACTIVELY MANAGED  AND INDEX-BASED ETFS. WE BELIEVE THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD COULD BENEFIT ETF INVESTORS BY LOWERING THE COSTS THEY PAY TO BUY AND SELL  SHARES, MITIGATING THE PERFORMANCE IMPACT OF FRONT-RUNNING AND FREE-RIDING, AND FACILITATING THE INTRODUCTION OF PROPRIETARY ACTIVE  STRATEGIES NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AS ETFS.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, 68 OF OUR U.S. MUTUAL FUNDS WERE RATED  4 OR 5 STARS BY MORNINGSTAR  TM  FOR AT LEAST ONE CLASS OF SHARES, INCLUDING 30 FIVE-STAR RATED FUNDS. A GOOD SOURCE OF  PERFORMANCE-RELATED INFORMATION FOR OUR FUNDS IS OUR WEBSITE, WWW.EATONVANCE.COM. ON OUR WEBSITE, INVESTORS CAN ALSO OBTAIN OTHER  CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FUNDS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT POLICIES, PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,  EXPENSES AND MORNINGSTAR RATINGS.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  PREVAILING EQUITY AND INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR  SENTIMENT AFFECT THE SALES AND REDEMPTIONS OF OUR INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, MANAGED ASSET LEVELS, OPERATING RESULTS AND THE RECOVERABILITY  OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE S&P 500 INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE,  HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF -0.8 PERCENT AND THE MSCI EMERGING MARKET INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF EMERGING MARKET EQUITY PERFORMANCE, HAD  TOTAL RETURNS OF 8.5 PERCENT. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE BARCLAYS U.S. AGGREGATE BOND INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. BOND MARKET  PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 3.4 PERCENT.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OF $444.7 BILLION ON JANUARY  31, 2019 DECREASED $4.6 BILLION, OR 1 PERCENT, FROM $449.2 BILLION OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON JANUARY 31, 2018.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REFLECTS NET INFLOWS OF $11.7 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE DECLINES  IN MANAGED ASSETS OF $16.3 BILLION.  49  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE OUR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER  MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT MANDATE, INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND INVESTMENT AFFILIATE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018.

ON THIS BASIS, OUR ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  25.9 PERCENT AND 26.7 PERCENT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

WE MAINTAIN A $300 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  WITH SEVERAL BANKS THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 11, 2023. THE FACILITY, WHICH WE ENTERED INTO ON DECEMBER 11, 2018, PROVIDES THAT WE  MAY BORROW AT LIBOR-BASED RATES OF INTEREST THAT VARY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF USAGE OF THE FACILITY AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE  AGREEMENT CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE AND REQUIRES US TO PAY AN ANNUAL COMMITMENT  FEE ON ANY UNUSED PORTION. WE HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT JANUARY 31, 2019 OR AT ANY POINT DURING  THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY DAILY. WE REMAIN COMMITTED  TO GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR MAIN USES OF CASH WILL BE PAYING DIVIDENDS, ACQUIRING  SHARES OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK, MAKING SEED INVESTMENTS IN NEW INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS,  ENHANCING OUR TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND PAYING THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING LIQUID  ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT AND FORECASTED  OPERATING CASH NEEDS. THE RISK EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT IF WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT IN THE FUTURE,  RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. OUR ABILITY TO ENTER THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN  A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT  SPREADS AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO ISSUE NEW DEBT, REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR SELL SHARES  OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK AS NEEDED, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD  BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE TEST OUR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST FOR IMPAIRMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS USING QUALITATIVE FACTORS.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 THERE WERE NO INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT ON OUR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST.  WE TEST OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES, GOODWILL  AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS IS WARRANTED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2019.  69  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS AND AMORTIZING  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AS EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WITH OPERATIONS  PRIMARILY IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENT INDUSTRIES. WE HAVE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES  AND NET2PHONE (FORMERLY NET2PHONE-UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AS A SERVICE, OR UCAAS). OUR TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES  RETAIL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENT OFFERINGS AS WELL AS WHOLESALE INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE TRAFFIC TERMINATION. OUR NET2PHONE  SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF (1) CLOUD-BASED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OFFERED TO ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS MAINLY THROUGH VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS,  SERVICE PROVIDERS, TELECOM AGENTS AND MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS, (2) SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL, OR SIP, TRUNKING, WHICH SUPPORTS  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CALLING FROM AN IP PBX, AND (3) CABLE TELEPHONY. OPERATING SEGMENTS NOT REPORTABLE  INDIVIDUALLY ARE INCLUDED IN ALL OTHER.  IN FISCAL 2019, WE MODIFIED THE WAY WE  REPORT OUR BUSINESS VERTICALS WITHIN OUR TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES AND NET2PHONE SEGMENTS TO ALIGN MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR BUSINESS  STRATEGY AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE. THE MODIFICATION TO THE BUSINESS VERTICALS DID NOT CHANGE THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ON MARCH 26, 2018, WE COMPLETED A PRO  RATA DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMON STOCK OF OUR FORMER SUBSIDIARY, RAFAEL HOLDINGS, INC., OR RAFAEL, TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD  AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 13, 2018, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF. THE DISPOSITION OF RAFAEL DID NOT MEET  THE CRITERIA TO BE REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AND ACCORDINGLY, RAFAEL\u2019S ASSETS, LIABILITIES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AND CASH FLOWS HAVE NOT BEEN RECLASSIFIED. AT THE TIME OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, RAFAEL OWNED THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND  INTERESTS IN TWO CLINICAL STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY HELD. THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS CONSISTED  OF OUR HEADQUARTERS BUILDING AND ITS ASSOCIATED PUBLIC GARAGE IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, AN OFFICE/DATA CENTER BUILDING IN PISCATAWAY,  NEW JERSEY AND A PORTION OF A BUILDING IN ISRAEL THAT HOSTS OFFICES FOR US AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES. THE PHARMACEUTICAL HOLDINGS  INCLUDED DEBT INTERESTS AND WARRANTS IN RAFAEL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., WHICH IS A CLINICAL STAGE, ONCOLOGY-FOCUSED PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THERAPIES THAT EXPLOIT THE METABOLIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORMAL CELLS  AND CANCER CELLS, AND A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST IN LIPOMEDIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD., A PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY BASED  IN ISRAEL. IN ADDITION, PRIOR TO THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, WE TRANSFERRED ASSETS TO RAFAEL SUCH THAT, AT THE TIME OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF,  RAFAEL HAD $42.3 MILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, PLUS APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION IN HEDGE FUND AND  OTHER INVESTMENTS.  WE LEASE OFFICE SPACE AND PARKING IN RAFAEL\u2019S  BUILDING AND PARKING GARAGE LOCATED AT 520 BROAD ST, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. WE ALSO LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN ISRAEL FROM RAFAEL. THE  LEASES EXPIRE IN APRIL 2025. IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WE INCURRED RENT EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION AND $0.9  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE RAFAEL LEASES.  24  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  OR U.S. GAAP. OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN  OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL 2018. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST SUBJECTIVE OR  COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. OUR CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, GOODWILL, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME  TAXES AND REGULATORY AGENCY FEES, AND DIRECT COST OF REVENUES\u2014DISPUTED AMOUNTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER  FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,  SEE OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL 2018.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD NOT YET ADOPTED  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , AND HAS SINCE ISSUED  AMENDMENTS THERETO, RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cASC 842\u201d). ASC 842ESTABLISHES  A RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) MODEL THAT REQUIRES A LESSEE TO RECORD A ROU ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET  FOR ALL LEASES WITH TERMS LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. LEASES WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING, WITH CLASSIFICATION  AFFECTING THE PATTERN OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. WE WILL ADOPT ASC 842ON AUGUST 1, 2019. A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE  TRANSITION APPROACH IS REQUIRED FOR LESSEES FOR CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES EXISTING AT, OR ENTERED INTO AFTER, THE BEGINNING  OF THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WITH CERTAIN PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AVAILABLE. ENTITIES  HAVE THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TO APPLY HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING UNDER TOPIC 840, INCLUDING ITS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, IN COMPARATIVE  PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. AN ENTITY THAT ELECTS THIS OPTION WILL RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE  OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION INSTEAD OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED. WE EXPECT TO ELECT TO  APPLY THE ASC 842 TRANSITION PROVISIONS BEGINNING ON AUGUST 1, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TOPIC 840 PRIOR TO  AUGUST 1, 2019, INCLUDING TOPIC 840 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, IN THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS PRESENTED. WE EXPECT TO ELECT THE PACKAGE  OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS FOR ALL OUR LEASES THAT COMMENCED BEFORE AUGUST 1, 2019. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING OUR REAL ESTATE  LEASES, OUR CONNECTIVITY AND FACILITY AGREEMENTS FOR OUR SERVERS AND ROUTING EQUIPMENT, AND OUR NET2PHONE-UCAAS TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT  CONTRACTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 WILL MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU THAT  CHANGES THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER INSTRUMENTS. FOR RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS,  ENTITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A NEW FORWARD-LOOKING \u201cEXPECTED LOSS\u201d MODEL THAT GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN THE EARLIER  RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. FOR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES, ENTITIES WILL MEASURE CREDIT  LOSSES IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO CURRENT PRACTICE, EXCEPT THE LOSSES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS ALLOWANCES INSTEAD OF REDUCTIONS IN THE  AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, AN ENTITY WILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ALLOWANCES,  CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS AND PAST DUE SECURITIES. THE NEW PROVISIONS WILL BE APPLIED AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED  EARNINGS. WE WILL ADOPT THE NEW STANDARD ON AUGUST 1, 2020. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THE NEW STANDARD WILL HAVE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU  INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER PORTRAY THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF AN ENTITY\u2019S  RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE ASU INCLUDES CERTAIN TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO SIMPLIFY  THE APPLICATION OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN U.S. GAAP. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON AUGUST 1, 2019. EARLY  APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE AMENDMENTS TO CASH FLOW AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT EXIST ON  THE DATE OF ADOPTION USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.  WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU TO  SIMPLIFY SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BY EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION  , TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM  NONEMPLOYEES. AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF TOPIC 718 TO NONEMPLOYEE AWARDS EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON INPUTS  TO AN OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ATTRIBUTION OF COST (THAT IS, THE PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS VEST  AND THE PATTERN OF COST RECOGNITION OVER THAT PERIOD). THE AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT TOPIC 718 APPLIES TO ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT  TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A GRANTOR ACQUIRES GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED OR CONSUMED IN A GRANTOR\u2019S OWN OPERATIONS BY ISSUING  SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO CLARIFY THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY  PROVIDE (1) FINANCING TO THE ISSUER OR (2) AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF  A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  . THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE  FOR US ON AUGUST 1, 2019. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  25  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018  WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING  BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED PRIMARILY ON INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCOME AND EXPENSE LINE ITEMS BELOW INCOME  (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS ARE ONLY INCLUDED IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  , AND HAS SINCE ISSUED AMENDMENTS THERETO (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS  \"ASC 606\"). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED  GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE  FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES, AND THE GUIDANCE DEFINES A FIVE-STEP PROCESS TO ACHIEVE THIS CORE PRINCIPLE. THE FIVE-STEP PROCESS  TO ACHIEVE THIS PRINCIPLE IS AS FOLLOWS: (I) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT(S) WITH A CUSTOMER, (II) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT(S), (III) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE, (IV) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT(S), AND (V) RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. ASC  606 ALSO MANDATES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUES AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM  CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS AND ASSETS RECOGNIZED FROM COSTS INCURRED TO OBTAIN  OR FULFILL A CONTRACT.  WE APPLIED ASC 606 TO THOSE CONTRACTS  THAT WERE NOT COMPLETED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018. FOR INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS THAT WERE MODIFIED BEFORE AUGUST 1, 2018, WE ELECTED TO  USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AVAILABLE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH ALLOWS US TO AGGREGATE THE EFFECT OF ALL MODIFICATIONS  WHEN IDENTIFYING SATISFIED AND UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE AND ALLOCATING TRANSACTION  PRICE TO THE SATISFIED AND UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE MODIFIED CONTRACT AT TRANSITION. RESULTS FOR THE REPORTING  PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER AUGUST 1, 2018 ARE PRESENTED UNDER ASC 606, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO  BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 605.  WE ADOPTED ASC 606 AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018,  USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. AS THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING ASC 606 BE RECOGNIZED  AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION, AT AUGUST 1, 2018, WE RECORDED AN $8.6 MILLION REDUCTION TO \u201cDEFERRED REVENUE\u201d, WITH AN OFFSETTING  REDUCTION TO \u201cACCUMULATED DEFICIT\u201d, FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION. THIS ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE CHANGE  IN ACCOUNTING FOR BREAKAGE PRIMARILY FROM OUR BOSS REVOLUTION INTERNATIONAL CALLING SERVICE, TRADITIONAL CALLING CARDS, AND INTERNATIONAL  AND DOMESTIC MOBILE TOP-UP. A CUSTOMER\u2019S NONREFUNDABLE PREPAYMENT GIVES THE CUSTOMER A RIGHT TO RECEIVE A GOOD OR SERVICE  IN THE FUTURE (AND OBLIGES US TO STAND READY TO TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE). HOWEVER, CUSTOMERS MAY NOT EXERCISE ALL OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL  RIGHTS. THOSE UNEXERCISED RIGHTS ARE REFERRED TO AS BREAKAGE. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE RECORDED BREAKAGE REVENUE WHEN  THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISING ITS REMAINING RIGHTS BECAME REMOTE. WE GENERALLY DEEMED THE LIKELIHOOD REMOTE AFTER 12  OR 24 MONTHS OF NO ACTIVITY. PER ASC 606, IF AN ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO A BREAKAGE AMOUNT, THE ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE  THE EXPECTED BREAKAGE AMOUNT AS REVENUE IN PROPORTION TO THE PATTERN OF RIGHTS EXERCISED BY THE CUSTOMER, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT  THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY  ASSOCIATED WITH THE BREAKAGE IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. WE DETERMINED THAT $8.6 MILLION INCLUDED IN OUR OPENING BALANCE OF \u201cDEFERRED  REVENUE\u201d WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS BREAKAGE REVENUE UNDER ASC 606 IN PRIOR PERIODS, AND ACCORDINGLY, RECORDED THE CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018.  IN ADDITION, ASC 606 CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING  FOR COSTS TO OBTAIN AND FULFILL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS SUCH THAT INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING AND DIRECT COSTS OF FULFILLING  CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE TRANSFER OF THE RELATED GOOD OR SERVICE. IN THE SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE DETERMINED THAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING ASC 606 TO DEFER THESE COSTS RELATED TO  OUR NET2PHONE-UCAAS BUSINESS WAS $1.3 MILLION. ACCORDINGLY, WE CORRECTED OUR CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018  AND RECORDED AN INCREASE IN \u201cOTHER CURRENT ASSETS\u201d OF $0.6 MILLION AND AN INCREASE IN \u201cOTHER ASSETS\u201d OF  $0.7 MILLION, WITH AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO \u201cACCUMULATED DEFICIT\u201d, OF $1.3 MILLION.  TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES SEGMENT  TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES, WHICH  REPRESENTED 96.9% AND 97.8% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, MARKETS AND  DISTRIBUTES THE FOLLOWING COMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENT SERVICES.  \u25cf  CORE INCLUDES OUR THREE LARGEST COMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENTS OFFERINGS BY REVENUE: BOSS REVOLUTION CALLING, AN INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE CALLING SERVICE MARKETED PRIMARILY TO IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN THE U.S., CARRIER SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDES INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE TERMINATION AND OUTSOURCED TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO TELECOMS WORLDWIDE, AND MOBILE TOP-UP, WHICH ENABLES CUSTOMERS TO TRANSFER AIRTIME AND BUNDLES OF AIRTIME, AS WELL AS MESSAGING AND DATA CREDITS TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY OVERSEAS AND DOMESTICALLY.

REVENUES AND MINUTES OF USE FROM CARRIER  SERVICES DECREASED IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018. OVER THE  LONG-TERM, WE EXPECT THAT CARRIER SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED AS COMMUNICATIONS GLOBALLY TRANSITION AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL  INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE VOICE OPERATORS. HOWEVER, CARRIER SERVICES\u2019 MINUTES OF USE AND REVENUES WILL LIKELY CONTINUE  TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER-TO-QUARTER, AS WE SEEK TO MAXIMIZE ECONOMICS RATHER THAN NECESSARILY SUSTAIN MINUTES OF  USE OR REVENUES.  REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC MOBILE TOP-UP SERVICE INCREASED IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS  ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO GROWTH FROM NEW MOBILE PARTNERS AND DIVERSIFICATION  OF OUR MOBILE TOP-UP OFFERINGS.  27  REVENUES FROM OUR GROWTH INITIATIVES INCREASED IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED  TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018. REVENUES FROM THE BOSS REVOLUTION MONEY TRANSFER SERVICE THROUGH DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER CHANNELS  INCREASED 145% AND 152% IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018 DUE TO EXPANSION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL DISBURSEMENT NETWORK, ENHANCED TRANSACTION FULFILLMENT TECHNOLOGY, AND INTENSIFIED MARKETING.  DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER CHANNELS NOW CONTRIBUTE THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR MONEY TRANSFER REVENUE.

THE CHANGE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR  PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT THAT WE RECORDED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED A NONCURRENT RECEIVABLE AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE  ANTICIPATED REFUND OF AN AMT CREDIT CARRY-OVER BECAUSE OF \u201cTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.\u201d EXCLUDING THIS INCOME TAX BENEFIT,  THE CHANGES RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED IN THE VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  ENACTED \u201cAN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR RECONCILIATION PURSUANT TO TITLES II AND V OF THE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR  FISCAL YEAR 2018\u201d, WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,\u201d OR THE TAX ACT. THE TAX ACT  REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY  A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION TAX, OR TRANSITION TAX, ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED,  AND MAKES OTHER CHANGES TO THE U.S. INCOME TAX CODE. DUE TO OUR JULY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS  PHASED IN, RESULTING IN A BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 26.9% FOR OUR FISCAL 2018, AND 21.0% FOR OUR  FISCAL YEARS THEREAFTER.  31  WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE  INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT. THE TRANSITION TAX IS BASED ON TOTAL POST-1986 EARNINGS AND PROFITS WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED  FROM U.S. INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL 2018, WE ESTIMATED THAT WE WILL UTILIZE $12 MILLION OF FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  TO OFFSET THE TRANSITION TAX THAT WE EXPECT WE WILL INCUR. IN FISCAL 2019, WE ADJUSTED THIS AMOUNT TO $11 MILLION OF FEDERAL NET  OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS USAGE. THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS HAVE A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND AS SUCH THERE IS  NO IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME  (\u201cGILTI\u201d) AND BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (\u201cBEAT\u201d) BECAME EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST 1, 2018. WE REVIEWED THE  PROPOSED GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN SEPTEMBER 2018. AS A RESULT OF OUR FULLY RESERVED NET OPERATING  LOSSES IN THE UNITED STATES, WE CONCLUDED THERE WILL BE NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR TAX PROVISION AS A RESULT OF GILTI. WE CURRENTLY  BELIEVE THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT FROM THE BEAT.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR ASSUMPTIONS MAY  CHANGE AS A RESULT OF FUTURE GUIDANCE AND INTERPRETATION FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, THE SEC, THE FASB, AND VARIOUS OTHER  TAXING JURISDICTIONS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE AT THAT TIME.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS  . THE CHANGE IN THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018 WAS DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS IN RAFAEL AS A RESULT OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS IN CERTAIN IDT TELECOM SUBSIDIARIES DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NET INCOME OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.

AT JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH  EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES OF $75.5 MILLION AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT (CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS)  OF $20.4 MILLION.

DEFERRED REVENUE ARISES FROM SALES OF  PREPAID PRODUCTS AND VARIES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE MIX AND THE TIMING OF REVENUES. DEFERRED REVENUE DECREASED TO  $41.4 MILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2019 FROM $55.0 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $8.6 MILLION NON-CASH REDUCTION TO DEFERRED  REVENUE, WITH AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606 AS OF AUGUST  1, 2018. THE REMAINING DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN THE BOSS REVOLUTION INTERNATIONAL CALLING SERVICE AND TRADITIONAL  CALLING CARDS BALANCES.  32  THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT  RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF OF STRAIGHT PATH PROVIDES FOR US AND STRAIGHT PATH TO INDEMNIFY EACH OTHER FOR CERTAIN LIABILITIES.

IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS IN  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, $10 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PAYMENT TO STRAIGHT PATH WAS INCLUDED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  AND $6 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PAYMENT WAS INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  IN AUGUST 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A RECIPROCAL  SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH A TELECOM OPERATOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA FOR A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TERMINATION  OF INBOUND AND OUTBOUND INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE VOICE CALLS. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PAY SUCH TELECOM OPERATOR MONTHLY COMMITTED  AMOUNTS DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES MAY RENEGOTIATE THE AMOUNT  OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS. IN THE EVENT THE PARTIES DO NOT AGREE ON RE-PRICING TERMS AFTER GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS, THEN EITHER PARTY  HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, IN SEPTEMBER 2017, WE DEPOSITED $11.75 MILLION INTO AN ESCROW  ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TELECOM OPERATOR, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  TOROTEL, INC. (\"TOROTEL\") CONDUCTS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, TOROTEL PRODUCTS, INC. (\"TOROTEL PRODUCTS\"). THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d AND THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d AS USED HEREIN INCLUDE TOROTEL AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING TOROTEL PRODUCTS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. TOROTEL SPECIALIZES IN THE CUSTOM DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRECISION MAGNETIC COMPONENTS CONSISTING OF TRANSFORMERS, INDUCTORS, REACTORS, CHOKES, TOROIDAL COILS, HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSFORMERS, DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMERS AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES FOR USE IN MILITARY, COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO MODIFY AND CONTROL ELECTRICAL VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES. TOROTEL SELLS THESE PRODUCTS TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, WHICH USE THEM IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS.  \u00b7  AIRCRAFT NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT;  \u00b7  DIGITAL CONTROL DEVICES;  \u00b7  AIRPORT RUNWAY LIGHTING DEVICES;  \u00b7  MEDICAL EQUIPMENT;  \u00b7  AVIONICS SYSTEMS;  \u00b7  RADAR SYSTEMS;  \u00b7  DOWN-HOLE DRILLING;  \u00b7  CONVENTIONAL MISSILE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS; AND  \u00b7  OTHER AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE APPLICATIONS.  TOROTEL MARKETS ITS COMPONENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN INTERNAL SALES FORCE AND INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS\u2019 REPRESENTATIVES PAID ON A COMMISSION BASIS.  THESE COMMISSIONS ARE EARNED WHEN A PRODUCT IS SOLD AND/OR SHIPPED TO A CUSTOMER WITHIN THE REPRESENTATIVE\u2019S ASSIGNED TERRITORY.  TOROTEL ALSO UTILIZES ITS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IN ITS DIRECT SALES EFFORTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPANDING ITS REACH INTO NEW MARKETS AND/OR CUSTOMERS.  THE INDUSTRY MIX OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR TOROTEL\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING APRIL 30, 2019 (\u201cFISCAL YEAR 2019\u201d) WAS 47%  DEFENSE, 48% COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE, AND 5% INDUSTRIAL COMPARED TO 51% DEFENSE, 44% COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE, AND 5% INDUSTRIAL FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING APRIL 30, 2018 (\u201cFISCAL YEAR 2018\u201d).  APPROXIMATELY 91% OF TOROTEL\u2019S SALES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS.  TOROTEL IS AN APPROVED SOURCE FOR MAGNETIC COMPONENTS USED IN NUMEROUS MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE SYSTEMS, WHICH MEANS TOROTEL IS AUTOMATICALLY SOLICITED FOR ANY PROCUREMENT NEEDS FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS.  THE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED BY TOROTEL ARE SOLD PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST SALES ARE AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BID BASIS.  THE MARKETS IN WHICH TOROTEL COMPETES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES SELL COMPONENTS OF THE TYPE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD BY TOROTEL.  IN ADDITION, TOROTEL SELLS TO A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MANUFACTURING THEIR OWN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS.  THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETS SERVED BY TOROTEL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PRICE, ON-TIME DELIVERY PERFORMANCE, LEAD TIMES, CUSTOMIZED PRODUCT ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, MARKETING CAPABILITIES, QUALITY ASSURANCE, MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, AND EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS\u2019 ENGINEERS.  WHILE WE BELIEVE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, TOROTEL\u2019S SALES, WHICH DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MARKET, ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DECLINE GIVEN THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE MARKET.  BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS  DEFENSE MARKETS  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018 THE AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DERIVED FROM CONTRACTS WITH PRIME CONTRACTORS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (\u201cDOD\u201d) WAS APPROXIMATELY  47%  AND 51%  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE IMPACTED SUBSTANTIALLY BY SPENDING CUTS OR INCREASES IN THE DOD BUDGET AND THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR CERTAIN MILITARY PROGRAMS.  DESPITE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOD BUDGET, WE BELIEVE OUR OVERALL DEFENSE BUSINESS OUTLOOK REMAINS FAVORABLE DUE TO THE PRESENT DEMAND FOR THE POTTED COIL ASSEMBLY AND OTHER EXISTING ORDERS FROM MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. AS OF JANUARY 31,  2019, OUR CONSOLIDATED ORDER BACKLOG FOR THE DEFENSE MARKET WAS NEARLY $12.2 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $5.9 MILLION FOR THE POTTED COIL ASSEMBLY.  COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS  WE PROVIDE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES FOR A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. THE PRIMARY DEMAND DRIVERS FOR THESE MARKETS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ORDERS, OIL AND GAS DRILLING EXPLORATION ACTIVITY, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. WHILE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH REMAINS POSITIVE, THE ABOVE DEMAND DRIVERS COULD BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY SUCH AS SPIKES OR DECLINES IN THE PRICE OF OIL, WAR, TERRORISM, OR CHANGES IN REGULATION. OTHER THREATS TO OUR ANTICIPATED POSITIVE NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET OUTLOOK INCLUDE DELAYS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COMPETITION FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS. AS OF JANUARY 31,  2019, OUR CONSOLIDATED ORDER BACKLOG FOR THE AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS WAS $4.3 MILLION. HOWEVER, A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  OUR BACKLOG AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2018 INCREASED FROM $10.1 MILLION TO $16.5 MILLION, A 63% INCREASE. THIS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN MAGNETICS AND ASSEMBLY ORDERS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL IMPROVE FROM NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF NEWER PROGRAM REVENUE THAT IS PROJECTED TO SHIP IN FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT 34% AND 62% OF OUR $16.5 MILLION BACKLOG AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO SHIP AND BE CONVERTED TO SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AND IN THE ENSUING TWELVE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, RESPECTIVELY.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT COMMENTS REGARDING TOROTEL\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE OPERATIONS OF TOROTEL AND ITS SUBSIDIARY TOROTEL PRODUCTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES INCREASED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF  INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES COMBINED WITH INCREASED DEMAND IN LARGE TRANSFORMERS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS AND THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MONTH PERIOD AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE IMPACTED FAVORABLY BY THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER  ASC 606  IN THE AMOUNTS OF $536,000 AND $1,003,000, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APPROXIMATE $487,000 INCREASE IN COSTS OF GOODS SOLD DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER MATERIAL CONTENT AND INCREASED DIRECT LABOR COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT INCREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES ARISING FROM INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES COMBINED WITH INCREASED DEMAND IN LARGE TRANSFORMERS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANAURY 31, 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019 WAS IMPACTED FAVORABLY BY THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER  ASC 606  IN THE AMOUNTS OF $233,000 AND $496,000, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED 4%, OR $51,000 AND 5%, OR $193,000 IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(108,000)  $(52,000)  THE INCREASE OF $56,000 IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF DESIGN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPENDING TO RISE MODERATELY DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ANTICIPATED NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $163,000  $625,000  THE CHANGE OF $462,000 FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCEEDS FROM THE LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO SUPPLEMENT OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, BASED ON HISTORICAL LEVELS. OUR ASSET-BASED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND GUIDANCE LINE OF CREDIT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 19, 2019.  WE EXPECT TO RENEW EACH OF THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS, IF DEEMED NECESSARY.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019,  WE HAD $1,028,000 DRAWN ON THE $1,250,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND $54,000 DRAWN ON THE $250,000 GUIDANCE LINE OF CREDIT, PRIMARILY UTILIZED TO FINANCE EQUIPMENT.   AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019  OUR TOTAL BORROWING CAPACITY IS APPROXIMATELY $1,500,000, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $1,082,000 HAS BEEN DRAWN, UNDER OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, PLUS $40,000 OF CASH ON HAND.  WE BELIEVE THAT INFLATION WILL HAVE ONLY A MINIMAL EFFECT ON FUTURE OPERATIONS SINCE SUCH EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY SALES PRICE INCREASES, WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT UPON DEMAND.

THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES ARE BASED, IN PART, ON ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF BUSINESS. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE FOREGOING INVOLVE JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND FUTURE BUSINESS DECISIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY AND MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE INACCURATE AND, THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE.

THESE RISKS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (  \u201c  COMMISSION  \u201d  ) ON JULY 30, 2018. MORE BROADLY, THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u25cf  WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES;  \u25cf  OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMMEDIATE NEED FOR CAPITAL;  \u25cf  POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT DILUTION RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SECURITIES FOR ANY FUNDING, DEBT CONVERSION  OR ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION; AND  \u25cf  WE ARE A  \u201c  PENNY STOCK  \u201d  COMPANY.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM (  \u201c  WE,  \u201d  \u201c  US,  \u201d  \u201c  OUR,  \u201d  OR THE  \u201c  COMPANY  \u201d  ) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON MAY 7, 1975, UNDER THE NAME VITA PLUS, INC. THE NAME WAS LATER CHANGED TO VITA PLUS INDUSTRIES, INC. AND IN 2000 THE COMPANY  \u2019  S NAME WAS CHANGED TO ITS CURRENT NAME PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE  \u201c  EXCHANGE ACT  \u201d  ). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW.  DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)       FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)      INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF  JANUARY 31  , 201  9  , THE COMPANY HAS $0 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED.  CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE.  OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE  AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  JANUARY 31  , 201  9  ,  THE COMPANY HAD ASSETS OF $7  ,000  IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES. THIS COMPARES WITH CURRENT ASSETS OF $3,333 IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES AS OF APRIL 30, 2018.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE COMPANY NEITHER GENERATED NOR USED FUNDS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY  31, 201  9  AND 201  8.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY  31,  201  9  , THE COMPANY RECEIVED $80,912  BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM A RELATED PARTY ENTITY. BY COMPARISON, DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31  , 201  8  , THE COMPANY RECEIVED $87,723  BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM TWO RELATED PARTY ENTITIES.  THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE RECEIPT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLAN OF SEEKING A COMBINATION WITH A PRIVATE OPERATING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN RELATED PARTIES TO PROVIDE CONTINUED FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY OR THAT THE RELATED PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO FUND THE COMPANY  \u2019  S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE.  IT IS MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $8,607, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $19,203 LOWER IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 LARGELY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN LEGAL AND AUDIT FEES BETWEEN THE TWO PERIODS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $16,896 LOWER IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018. THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THIS VARIANCE A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SEC FILING FEES.

IF WE DO UPDATE ONE OR MORE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, NO INFERENCE SHOULD BE DRAWN THAT WE WILL MAKE ADDITIONAL UPDATES WITH RESPECT TO THOSE OR OTHER FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS.  UTILIZING OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, WE PROVIDE SELECT SERVICES TO PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING PERSONALIZED APPROACHES TO DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY PERFORMING STUDIES TO PREDICT THE EFFICACY OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS, OUR PLATFORM FACILITATES DRUG DISCOVERY WITH LOWER COSTS AND INCREASED SPEED OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS INCREASED ADOPTION OF EXISTING DRUGS.  OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES A NOVEL APPROACH TO SIMULATING THE RESULTS OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS USED IN DEVELOPING ONCOLOGY DRUGS. ACCORDING TO A 2013 STUDY CONDUCTED BY CUTTING EDGE INFORMATION, IT CAN COST UP TO $100,000 PER PATIENT IN ONCOLOGY CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE TYPICAL COST FOR EACH PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR INCREASES FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION IN THE PRE-CLINICAL SETTING TO APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN PHASE III. SIMULATING TRIALS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND PATIENTS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CAN LOWER THE RISK OF SPENDING RESOURCES ON DRUGS THAT DO NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PATH THEY PURSUE WILL BE FOCUSED ON AN APPROPRIATE PATIENT POPULATION AND A SUCCESSFUL COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR TOS PROGRAM. OUR POS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE THE FOCUS OF OUR GROWTH MOVING FORWARD.  21  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS HAVE TYPICALLY ARISEN FROM THE FUNDING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE MET THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CASH, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF OUR SECURITIES AND SALES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY  $381,000  AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF  $1.6 MILLION  .  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $70.4 MILLION  , NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF  $177,000  AND CASH OF  $3.3 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH ON HAND, TOGETHER WITH CONTINUED IMPROVED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST  MARCH 2020  . SHOULD THE COMPANY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUCH CAPITAL ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.

ONCOLOGY SERVICES REVENUE WAS  $19.3 MILLION  AND  $15.3 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $4.0 MILLION  OR  26.3%  .  THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTH AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO INCREASED SALES, BOTH IN NUMBER AND SIZE OF STUDIES, EXPANDING OUR CUSTOMER BASE, AND GROWTH OF THE PLATFORM.  22  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $3.4 MILLION  AND  $2.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $956,000  OR  38.7%  .  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  46.7%  AND  51.3%  , RESPECTIVELY.  COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $10.0 MILLION  AND  $7.7 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $2.2 MILLION  OR  28.8%  .  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , GROSS MARGINS WERE  48.5%  AND  49.5%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN COST OF ONCOLOGY SERVICES FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN  SALARY AND MICE COSTS RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN STUDY VOLUME.  GROSS MARGIN VARIES BASED ON TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN EXPENSE AND REVENUE RECOGNITION AND WAS IMPACTED BY THE INCREASE IN COST AHEAD OF REVENUE RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN NUMBER OF STUDIES PERFORMED.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $1.3 MILLION  AND  $1.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $224,000  OR  21.4%  . RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $3.6 MILLION  AND  $3.3 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $242,000  OR  7.3%  .  THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO LAB COSTS AND SALARIES RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  SALES AND MARKETING  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $879,000  AND  $627,000  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $252,000  , OR  40.2%  . SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $1.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $276,000  OR  14.8%  .  THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS MAINLY DUE TO COMMISSIONS PAID TO THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM ON BOOKINGS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $1.2 MILLION  AND  $1.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $219,000  , OR  21.8%  .  THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND SALARY EXPENSES.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $3.3 MILLION  AND  $3.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $144,000  OR  4.5%  .  THE INCREASE FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN RECRUITING AND SALARY EXPENSES.  INFLATION  INFLATION DOES NOT HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT ON THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  23  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION RELATES TO THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.6 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $1.2 MILLION  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPROVEMENT IN CASH FLOW IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD FROM PRIOR YEAR, ALONG WITH THE TIMING OF ORDINARY BUSINESS FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENT OPERATING ACCOUNTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $693,000  AND  $1.0 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE CURRENT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IS THE RESULT OF CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. THE PRIOR YEAR CASH OUTFLOWS WAS DUE TO THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S NEW LAB FACILITY IN ROCKVILLE, MARYLAND.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.4 MILLION  AND  $19,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO APPLY METHODOLOGIES AND MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE REALIZATION, REVENUE RECOGNITION (REPLACEMENT OF LICENSED TUMORS), VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, VALUATION OF GOODWILL, AND STOCK COMPENSATION AND WARRANT ASSUMPTIONS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, FILED WITH THE SEC ON JULY 30, 2018.

THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING QUARTERLY UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2018 (\u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d). OUR ANNUAL REPORT INCLUDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, PRACTICES AND THE TRANSACTIONS THAT UNDERLIE OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS, AS WELL AS A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.  WE PROVIDE A BROAD PORTFOLIO OF TRANSPORTATION, E-COMMERCE AND BUSINESS SERVICES THROUGH COMPANIES COMPETING COLLECTIVELY, OPERATING INDEPENDENTLY AND MANAGED COLLABORATIVELY, UNDER THE RESPECTED FEDEX BRAND. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING COMPANIES ARE FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION (\u201cFEDEX EXPRESS\u201d), INCLUDING TNT EXPRESS B.V. (\u201cTNT EXPRESS\u201d), THE WORLD\u2019S LARGEST EXPRESS TRANSPORTATION COMPANY; FEDEX GROUND PACKAGE SYSTEM, INC. (\u201cFEDEX GROUND\u201d), A LEADING NORTH AMERICAN PROVIDER OF SMALL-PACKAGE GROUND DELIVERY SERVICES; AND FEDEX FREIGHT CORPORATION (\u201cFEDEX FREIGHT\u201d), A LEADING U.S. PROVIDER OF LESS-THAN-TRUCKLOAD (\u201cLTL\u201d) FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THESE COMPANIES REPRESENT OUR MAJOR SERVICE LINES AND, ALONG WITH FEDEX CORPORATE SERVICES, INC. (\u201cFEDEX SERVICES\u201d), CONSTITUTE OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.  OUR FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES SALES, MARKETING, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, COMMUNICATIONS, CUSTOMER SERVICE, TECHNICAL SUPPORT, BILLING AND COLLECTION SERVICES, AND CERTAIN BACK-OFFICE FUNCTIONS THAT SUPPORT OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS. THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT ALSO PROVIDES CUSTOMERS WITH RETAIL ACCESS TO FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND SHIPPING SERVICES THROUGH FEDEX OFFICE AND PRINT SERVICES, INC. (\u201cFEDEX OFFICE\u201d). SEE \u201cREPORTABLE SEGMENTS\u201d FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR BUSINESSES CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  AS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, THE FEDEX LOGISTICS, INC. (\u201cFEDEX LOGISTICS\u201d (FORMERLY FEDEX TRADE NETWORKS, INC.)) OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN \u201cCORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS\u201d IN OUR SEGMENT REPORTING. PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE KEY INDICATORS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE OVERALL CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR VARIOUS SERVICES BASED ON MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY;  \u2022  THE VOLUMES OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OUR NETWORKS, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME AND SHIPMENT WEIGHT AND SIZE;  \u2022  THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS;  \u2022  THE PRICES WE OBTAIN FOR OUR SERVICES, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY YIELD (REVENUE PER PACKAGE OR POUND OR REVENUE PER SHIPMENT OR HUNDREDWEIGHT FOR LTL FREIGHT SHIPMENTS);  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE (CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES) TO MATCH SHIFTING VOLUME LEVELS; AND  \u2022  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER INCREMENTAL FUEL COSTS THROUGH OUR FUEL SURCHARGES.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY REVENUE AND VOLUME LEVELS, AND WE EXPECT THESE OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF OPERATING EXPENSE CAPTIONS FOCUSES ON THE KEY DRIVERS AND TRENDS IMPACTING EXPENSES OTHER THAN THOSE FACTORS STRICTLY RELATED TO CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THE LINE ITEM \u201cOTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\u201d INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS (SUCH AS FACILITY SERVICES AND CARGO HANDLING, TEMPORARY LABOR AND SECURITY), PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE, UNIFORMS AND TAXES AND LICENSES.

THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES US TO REPORT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT IN THE SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS LINE ITEM. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST ARE REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT IN OTHER INCOME, OUTSIDE OF INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE IMPACTS OPERATING INCOME AND MARGIN BUT HAS NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE. WE HAVE APPLIED THESE CHANGES RETROSPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IMPROVED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, VOLUME GROWTH, THE FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF FUEL AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND. LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED OUR RESULTS BY APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019, SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUMES AT FEDEX EXPRESS. LOWER WEIGHTS IN U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE SHIPMENTS AT FEDEX EXPRESS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS. COMPOUNDING THESE FACTORS, WE ALSO EXPERIENCED A PRODUCT MIX SHIFT TO LOWER YIELDING SERVICES DUE IN PART TO AN INCREASE IN E-COMMERCE TRAFFIC AT FEDEX EXPRESS. IN ADDITION, HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, RESULTING FROM INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AT FEDEX GROUND AND EXPANDING THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SIX DAYS YEAR-ROUND, STARTING IN JANUARY 2019, NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR RESULTS. COMPARABLES FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 ARE AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, WHICH REDUCED EARNINGS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION ($1.14 PER DILUTED SHARE). WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS IN 2019 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON COMPARISONS TO 2018 FOR EITHER THE THIRD-QUARTER OR NINE-MONTH PERIODS.  - 32  -  THE COMPARISON OF NET INCOME BETWEEN 2019 AND 2018 IS SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECTED BY A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.15 BILLION ($4.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d) RECOGNIZED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED  TAX LIABILITY.  N  ET INCOME FOR THE T  HIRD QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES  TAX BENEFIT  S  OF $90 MILLION ($0.  34 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM THE REDUCTION  OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  AND  $60 MILLION ($0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE) PRIMARILY RELATE  D TO A LOWER STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TCJA. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  TAX EXPENSE OF $50 MILLION ($0.19 PER DILUTED SHARE)  RELATED TO  A  RECENTLY ENACTED  LOWER TAX RATE  IN THE NETHERLANDS APPLIED TO  OUR DEFERRED TAX  BALANCES.  ADDITIONA  LLY, W  E RECOGNIZED AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $2  30  MILLION ($0.86  PER DILUTED SHARE)  IN THE  NINE MONTHS  OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LOWER STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE  UNDER  THE TCJA. O  UR RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 INCLUDED TAX BENEF  IT  S  OF $204 MILLION ($0.75 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM A $1.5 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO OUR TAX-QUALIFIED U.S. DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS (\u201cU.S. PENSION PLANS\u201d) IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND $165 MILLION ($0.60 PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO THE PHASE-IN OF A REDUCED STATUTOR  Y TAX RATE ON 2018 YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION  ($0.44 PER DILUTED SHARE)  WAS  RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND  ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018  EARNINGS.  SEE THE \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WE INCURRED TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES TOTALING $69 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, A $37 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES WERE $304 MILLION ($243 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.92 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, A $37 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE NINE MONTHS OF 2018. THE INTEGRATION EXPENSES ARE PREDOMINANTLY INCREMENTAL COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF TNT EXPRESS, INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES, SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, TRAVEL AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES, AND INCLUDE ANY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS. INTERNAL SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ASSIGNED FULL-TIME TO INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES. THESE COSTS WERE INCURRED AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX CORPORATE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE COSTS AS INTEGRATION-RELATED EXPENDITURES IS SUBJECT TO OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  - 33  -  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS FOR FEDEX  EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT SHOW SELECTED VOLUME TRENDS (IN THOUSANDS) OVER THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  (1)  INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC AVERAGE DAILY PACKAGE VOLUME RELATES TO OUR INTERNATIONAL INTRA-COUNTRY OPERATIONS.  - 34  -  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS FOR  FEDEX EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT SHOW SELECTED YIELD TRENDS OVER THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  (1)  INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC REVENUE PER PACKAGE RELATES TO OUR INTERNATIONAL INTRA-COUNTRY OPERATIONS.  REVENUE  REVENUES INCREASED 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 8% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT. AT FEDEX GROUND, REVENUES INCREASED 9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 12% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO VOLUME GROWTH AND INCREASED YIELDS. FEDEX FREIGHT REVENUES INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 14% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE PER SHIPMENT AND AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTERNATIONAL PRIORITY AND INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC PACKAGE REVENUE. AT FEDEX EXPRESS, UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES, LOWER BASE RATES AND DECREASED WEIGHTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS BUT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS INCREASED 5% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE VOLUME GROWTH AND INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE AND FREIGHT VOLUME RECOVERY FROM THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PACKAGE YIELD DECLINES. FEDEX EXPRESS REVENUE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUME GROWTH RESULTING FROM WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  - 35  -  OPERATING EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLES COMPARE OPERATING EXPENSES EXPRESSED AS DOLLAR AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) AND AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE FOR THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28.

OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER RATES AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SIX DAYS YEAR-ROUND, STARTING IN JANUARY 2019. IN ADDITION, LOWER YIELDS AT FEDEX EXPRESS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OPERATING MARGIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. OPERATING MARGIN REMAINED FLAT IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE AND LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS. AN OVERALL PRODUCT MIX SHIFT AT FEDEX EXPRESS FROM INTERNATIONAL PRIORITY VOLUME TO INTERNATIONAL DEFERRED VOLUME, AS WELL AS CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL VOLUMES AT FEDEX EXPRESS RESULTING FROM WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING MARGIN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 12% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED RATES, INCLUDING FUEL COSTS, AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT, REFLECTING THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE TIGHT LABOR MARKET ON OUR RATES. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH AND ANNUAL MERIT INCREASES. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER STAFFING AND MERIT INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AT FEDEX EXPRESS. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 9% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED AIRCRAFT ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FEDEX EXPRESS.  - 36  -  FUEL  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS SHOWS OUR AVERAGE COST OF JET AND VEHICLE FUEL PER GALLON FOR THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FUEL PRICES AT FEDEX EXPRESS, OFFSET BY HIGHER MILEAGE AT FEDEX FREIGHT. FUEL EXPENSE INCREASED 21% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, FUEL PRICES REPRESENT ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE FACTORS WE CONSIDER MEANINGFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. CONSIDERATION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE WE COLLECT. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS, WHICH IS A COMPARISON OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THESE TWO FACTORS, IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FUEL SURCHARGES ON THE TREND IN REVENUE AND YIELD GROWTH, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE COMPARATIVE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES IN EFFECT FOR THE THIRD QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018 IN THE ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF EACH OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS.  MOST OF OUR FUEL SURCHARGES ARE ADJUSTED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BASED ON A WEEKLY FUEL PRICE FROM TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE WEEK IN WHICH IT IS ASSESSED. SOME FEDEX EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL FUEL SURCHARGES INCORPORATE A TIMING LAG OF APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.  THE MANNER IN WHICH WE PURCHASE FUEL ALSO INFLUENCES THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CONTRACTS FOR JET FUEL PURCHASES AT FEDEX EXPRESS ARE TIED TO VARIOUS INDICES, INCLUDING THE U.S. GULF COAST INDEX. WHILE MANY OF THESE INDICES ARE ALIGNED, EACH INDEX MAY FLUCTUATE AT A DIFFERENT PACE, DRIVING VARIABILITY IN THE PRICES PAID FOR JET FUEL. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR JET FUEL IS PURCHASED BASED ON THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING WEEK, WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR PURCHASES TIED TO THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING MONTH, RATHER THAN BASED ON DAILY SPOT RATES. THESE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF RAPIDLY CHANGING DAILY SPOT RATES ON OUR JET FUEL PURCHASES.  BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED SHOULD THE MARKET PRICE OF FUEL SUDDENLY CHANGE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OR CHANGE BY AMOUNTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT IN OUR FUEL SURCHARGES, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IN THE SHORT-TERM.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW OUR FUEL SURCHARGES. ON MARCH 18, 2019, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES FOR FEDEX EXPRESS U.S. DOMESTIC SERVICES AND AT FEDEX GROUND. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AS HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASED FUEL PRICES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS THAT FUEL SURCHARGE LEVELS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMAND AND SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE MAY BE IMPACTED BY FUEL COSTS. WHILE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, FUEL SURCHARGES REPRESENT ONE OF THE MANY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF OUR PRICING STRUCTURE THAT IMPACT OUR OVERALL REVENUE AND YIELD. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS INCLUDE THE MIX OF SERVICES SOLD, THE BASE PRICE AND EXTRA SERVICE CHARGES WE OBTAIN FOR THESE SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED.  - 37  -  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 20.6% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND 21.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED WITH (137.3)% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND (15.0)% FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2018. THE 2019 TAX RATES INCLUDE A BENEFIT OF $90 MILLION FROM THE REDUCTION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND AN EXPENSE OF $50 MILLION FROM THE IMPACT ON OUR DEFERRED TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RECENTLY ENACTED LOWER TAX RATE IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE 2019 TAX RATES WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE TCJA, WHICH RESULTED IN BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND $230 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, PRIMARILY FROM THE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATE ON FISCAL 2019 EARNINGS. THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 ALSO BENEFITED BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION FROM ACCELERATED DEDUCTIONS CLAIMED ON OUR 2018 U.S. INCOME TAX RETURN. THE 2018 TAX RATES WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.15 BILLION FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $36 MILLION FROM FOREIGN TAX CREDITS EXCEEDING THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS, WE RECOGNIZED A $204 MILLION BENEFIT FROM A $1.5 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND $165 MILLION RELATED TO THE PHASE-IN OF A REDUCED STATUTORY TAX RATE ON 2018 YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018 EARNINGS.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS COVERING THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNREPATRIATED FOREIGN EARNINGS, WHICH WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE TCJA. CERTAIN GUIDANCE INCLUDED IN THESE FINAL REGULATIONS IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERPRETATION THAT LED TO THE RECOGNITION OF A $225 MILLION ($0.94 PER DILUTED SHARE) BENEFIT IN 2018 (THE \u201c2018 BENEFIT\u201d). NOTWITHSTANDING THIS INCONSISTENCY, WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE TCJA AND INTEND TO DEFEND THIS POSITION THROUGH LITIGATION, IF NECESSARY. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OUR POSITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVERSE THE 2018 BENEFIT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TCJA. NO ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE DURING THE QUARTER. AS A RESULT, THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT TO THE AMOUNTS INITIALLY RECORDED ON A PROVISIONAL BASIS IN 2018 WAS A TAX EXPENSE OF $4 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS A REVISION OF THE PROVISIONAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. SEE NOTE 1 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  THE TCJA, ENACTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%. DUE TO OUR MAY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE LOWER RATE WAS PHASED IN, RESULTING IN A U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL RATE OF 29.2% FOR 2018 AND A STATUTORY FEDERAL RATE OF 21% FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2018 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES TO THE 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, FOR THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28.

(B)  THE BENEFIT IS FROM THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTED ON OUR 2017 TAX RETURN AT A TAX RATE OF 35%.  (C)  DUE TO OUR MAY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE TCJA\u2019S LOWER U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 WAS PHASED IN RESULTING IN A RATE OF 29.2% FOR 2018 AND A RATE OF 21% FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  (D)  THE 2018 TAX RATES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECT OF THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS OF FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS, CHANGES IN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RATE IMPACTS ON CHANGES IN DEFERRED TAX ITEMS AFTER THE TCJA ENACTMENT, AND WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED FROM TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.  - 38  -  WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS U.S. STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURIS  DICTIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (  \u201c  IRS  \u201d  ) FOR THE 2016 AND 2017 TAX YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INITIATED APPEALS PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS\u2019  S  PROPOSED  AUDIT  ADJUSTMENT  FOR THE 2014 AND 2015 TAX YEARS. IT  IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INCOME TAX RETURN PROCEEDINGS WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOG  NIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE  IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES  IS NOT EXPECTED TO  BE MATERIAL TO OUR CON  SOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2018.  BUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED COST-REDUCTION PROGRAMS PRIMARILY THROUGH INITIATIVES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES;  \u2022  LIMITED HIRING IN STAFF FUNCTIONS; AND  \u2022  REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN OFFERING VOLUNTARY CASH BUYOUTS TO ELIGIBLE U.S.-BASED EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN STAFF FUNCTIONS. THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM INCLUDES VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND FUNDING TO HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS, WITH THE VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PAYMENT CALCULATED BASED ON FOUR WEEKS OF GROSS BASE SALARY FOR EVERY YEAR OF CONTINUOUS FEDEX SERVICE UP TO A MAXIMUM PAYMENT OF TWO YEARS OF PAY. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WILL BE SCHEDULED TO VACATE POSITIONS IN PHASES TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION IN THE IMPACTED FUNCTIONS SO THAT WE MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. EMPLOYEES IN THE FIRST PHASE WILL VACATE THEIR POSITIONS ON MAY 31, 2019, AND WE EXPECT ALL EMPLOYEES WHO ACCEPT THE BUYOUT TO VACATE THEIR POSITIONS BY THE END OF 2020. COSTS OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS IN THE PERIOD EMPLOYEES ACCEPT THEIR OFFERS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  WE INCURRED COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION ($3 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE) DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES. THESE COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL COSTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL FEES. WE EXPECT THE 2019 PRE-TAX COST OF OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM, TO RANGE FROM $450 MILLION TO $575 MILLION IN PRE-TAX CASH EXPENDITURES, BUT ACTUAL COSTS WILL DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE RATES. SEVERANCE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE AT THE TIME OF DEPARTURE. ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BEYOND 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL FEES. WE EXPECT SAVINGS FROM OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE BETWEEN $225 MILLION TO $275 MILLION IN 2020.  OUTLOOK  WE EXPECT CONTINUED REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH AT FEDEX FREIGHT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 TO BE DRIVEN BY VOLUME AND YIELD GROWTH. WHILE FEDEX GROUND REVENUE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS, AS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GROWING VOLUMES TO FILL THE CAPACITY OF OUR NEW SIX-DAY NETWORK. WHILE THE LAUNCH OF SIX-DAY OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MODEST HEADWIND, WE BELIEVE IT WILL ALLOW FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR EXISTING ASSETS, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL DRIVE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE ON OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY, ENHANCE SERVICE OFFERINGS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE. WE EXPECT EARNINGS TO DECREASE AT FEDEX EXPRESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO LOWER YIELDS AND CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUMES RESULTING FROM SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA AND EUROPE. AS A RESPONSE TO THESE NEGATIVE BUSINESS TRENDS, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING REVENUE-QUALITY ENHANCEMENT AND COST-REDUCTION ACTIONS; HOWEVER, THE FULL BENEFITS OF THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY.  OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING FUEL PRICES, MODERATE U.S. DOMESTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NO FURTHER WEAKENING IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FROM OUR CURRENT FORECAST.  WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION PLANS. THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IS COMPLEX AS IT SPANS OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND INVOLVES COMBINING OUR PICKUP-AND-DELIVERY OPERATIONS AT A LOCAL LEVEL, OUR GLOBAL AND REGIONAL AIR AND GROUND NETWORKS, AND OUR EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS, CUSTOMS CLEARANCE, SALES AND BACK-OFFICE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. WE HAVE COMPLETED THE OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MIDDLE EAST, AND EXPECT TO HAVE THE SALES FORCES SUBSTANTIALLY INTEGRATED BY THE END OF 2019. THE SALES FORCE INTEGRATION WILL ALLOW BOTH THE FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS SALES TEAMS TO SELL OUR FULL SUITE OF SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.  - 39  -  A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE IN THE INTEGRATION INCLUDES KEY PROJECTS  THAT ENABLE  THE  INJECTION OF  FEDEX EXPRESS SHIPMENTS INTO THE TNT  EXPRESS EUROPEAN ROAD NETWORK.  THIS INTEGRATION MILESTONE WILL ALLOW FEDEX EXPRESS CUSTOMERS TO  BENEFIT FROM  TRANSIT TIME IMPROVEMENTS  FOR THEIR INTRA-EUROPEAN SHIPMENTS.  WE BEGAN ROLLING OUT THIS SERVICE IN EUROPE IN  FEBRUARY 2019 AND  EXPECT TO  HAVE THIS SERVICE IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED  IN JUNE  2019.  IN ADDITION  , BY THE END OF 2020, WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE PROJECTS  ACROSS  OUR EUROPEAN  HUB AND  STATION  LOCATIONS THAT  WILL  ALLOW  INTEROPERABILITY  BETWEEN NETWORKS  FOR BOTH FEDEX  EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS PACKAGES  , WHICH  WILL  FURTHER  LOWER COSTS  AS THE RELATED  FEDEX  EXPRESS  LINEHAUL  OPERATIONS ARE OPTIMIZED.  IN 2019, WE HAVE BEGUN THE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INTEGRATION PROCESS FOR THE KEY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHICH REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE, WORKFORCES AND FACILITIES. INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE ARE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE CONSULTATIONS WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2020, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, INTEGRATION WORK WILL CONTINUE INTO 2021.  WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE INTEGRATION PROGRAM EXPENSES TO EXCEED $1.5 BILLION THROUGH 2021 AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER TRANSFORM AND OPTIMIZE THE COMBINED BUSINESS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD MAY CHANGE AS WE REVISE AND IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $435 MILLION OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES IN 2019, DOWN FROM OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE OF $450 MILLION.  OTHER OUTLOOK MATTERS.  FOR DETAILS ON KEY 2019 CAPITAL PROJECTS, REFER TO THE \u201cLIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A.  FEDEX GROUND PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THE INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER (\u201cISP\u201d) MODEL THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRE U.S. PICKUP-AND-DELIVERY NETWORK. THE TRANSITION TO THE ISP MODEL IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED ON A DISTRICT-BY-DISTRICT BASIS AND WE ARE NOW TARGETING THE TRANSITION TO BE COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, OVER TWO-THIRDS OF FEDEX GROUND VOLUME WAS BEING DELIVERED BY SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATING UNDER THE ISP MODEL. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRANSITIONS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS INCURRED AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO ANY FUTURE QUARTER.  SEE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND PART II, ITEM 1A \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.

FOR THE FEDEX SERVICES SE  GMENT, PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE IMPACT OF ITS TOTAL ALLOCATED NET OPERATING COSTS ON OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE ALLOCATIONS APPROXIMATE THE NET COST OF PROVIDING THESE FUNCTIONS. OUR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES ARE REFINED PERI  ODICALLY, AS NECESSARY, TO REFLECT CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  CORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS  CORPORATE AND OTHER INCLUDES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS COSTS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS AND CREDITS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO OUR CORE BUSINESS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IS THE FEDEX LOGISTICS OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES CUSTOMS BROKERAGE AND GLOBAL OCEAN AND AIR FREIGHT FORWARDING THROUGH FEDEX TRADE NETWORKS TRANSPORT & BROKERAGE, INC.; CROSS-BORDER ENABLEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND E-COMMERCE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS THROUGH FEDEX CROSS BORDER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.; INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THROUGH FEDEX SUPPLY CHAIN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, INC. (\u201cFEDEX SUPPLY CHAIN\u201d); TIME-CRITICAL SHIPMENT SERVICES THROUGH FEDEX CUSTOM CRITICAL, INC.; AND, EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, CRITICAL INVENTORY AND SERVICE PARTS LOGISTICS, 3-D PRINTING AND TECHNOLOGY REPAIR THROUGH FEDEX FORWARD DEPOTS, INC. (\u201cFEDEX FORWARD DEPOTS\u201d). IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019, THE OPERATING LOSS INCREASE IN \u201cCORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS\u201d WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FEDEX LOGISTICS RESULTING FROM OPERATING LOSSES, THE INCLUSION OF FEDEX FORWARD DEPOTS FOLLOWING THE REALIGNMENT OF FEDEX LOGISTICS AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION VOLUMES DUE TO WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL MATTER INVOLVING FEDEX GROUND, INCLUDING CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL FEES, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  CERTAIN FEDEX OPERATING COMPANIES PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED SERVICES FOR OTHER FEDEX COMPANIES OUTSIDE THEIR REPORTABLE SEGMENT. BILLINGS FOR SUCH SERVICES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, AND ARE REFLECTED AS REVENUES OF THE BILLING SEGMENT. THESE RATES ARE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. SUCH INTERSEGMENT REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE ELIMINATED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND ARE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.  - 41  -  FEDEX EXPRESS SEGMENT  FEDEX EXPRESS OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF U.S. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SERVICES FOR DELIVERY OF PACKAGES AND FREIGHT INCLUDING PRIORITY, DEFERRED AND ECONOMY SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE DELIVERY ON A TIME-DEFINITE OR DAY-DEFINITE BASIS.

AVERAGE DAILY FREIGHT POUNDS INCREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 8% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME IN INTERNATIONAL FREIGHT SERVICES, REFLECTING RECOVERY FROM THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK AND AN OVERALL PRODUCT MIX SHIFT FROM PACKAGE TO FREIGHT. FREIGHT YIELDS DECREASED 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES.

REVENUE PER SHIPMENT INCREASED 4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 6% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BASE RATES DRIVEN BY OUR ONGOING YIELD MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES. AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS INCREASED 6% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 8% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICE OFFERINGS.  THE WEEKLY INDEXED FUEL SURCHARGE IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE OF THE U.S. ON-HIGHWAY PRICES FOR A GALLON OF DIESEL FUEL, AS PUBLISHED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY. THE INDEXED FEDEX FREIGHT FUEL SURCHARGE RANGED AS FOLLOWS FOR THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28.

ON JANUARY 1, 2018, FEDEX FREIGHT IMPLEMENTED A 4.9% AVERAGE INCREASE IN CERTAIN U.S. AND OTHER SHIPPING RATES.  FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 98% AND OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVED 250 BASIS POINTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. ADDITIONALLY, FEDEX FREIGHT SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 31% AND OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVED 100 BASIS POINTS IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019. THESE POSITIVE RESULTS WERE ACHIEVED PRIMARILY BY HIGHER REVENUE PER SHIPMENT. IN ADDITION, LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED 6% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 12% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 REFLECTING HIGHER STAFFING LEVELS TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH AND MERIT INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES. PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE INCREASED 4% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 18% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO INCREASED RATES AND HIGHER VOLUMES. HIGHER FUEL COSTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  FUEL EXPENSE INCREASED 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MILEAGE. FUEL EXPENSE INCREASED 24% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FUEL PRICES. THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A MODERATE BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AND A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AS HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASED FUEL PRICES. SEE THE \u201cFUEL\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A FOR A DESCRIPTION AND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.  - 49  -  FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $2.9 BILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019, COMPARED TO $3.3 BILLION AT MAY 31, 2018.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED SLIGHTLY DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SPENDING RELATED TO FACILITIES, EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES AT FEDEX GROUND, AS WELL AS LOWER SPENDING ON AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AT FEDEX EXPRESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SPENDING RELATED TO FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT AT FEDEX EXPRESS. SEE \u201cCAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2019 AND 2018.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ISSUED $1.2 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT UNDER OUR CURRENT SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, COMPRISED OF \u20ac640 MILLION OF 0.7% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN MAY 2022 AND $500 MILLION OF 3.4% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN JANUARY 2022. WE WILL USE THE NET PROCEEDS TO PAY THE \u20ac500 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE AT MATURITY ON APRIL 11, 2019, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT UNDER OUR CURRENT SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, COMPRISED OF $400 MILLION OF 4.20% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN OCTOBER 2028 AND $850 MILLION OF 4.95% FIXED-RATE NOTES DUE IN OCTOBER 2048. INTEREST ON THESE NOTES IS PAID SEMI-ANNUALLY. WE USED THE NET PROCEEDS TO REDEEM THE $750 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 8.00% NOTES DUE JANUARY 15, 2019, AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE ISSUED COMMERCIAL PAPER TO PROVIDE US WITH ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE HAD $225 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. SEE NOTE 3 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  - 50  -  IN JANUARY 2016, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO  25 MILLION SHARES. DURING THE THIRD  Q  UARTER OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED  0.6  MILLION SHARES OF FEDEX COMMON STOC  K AT A  N AVERAGE PRICE OF $168.43  PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL OF $93  MILLION. DURING THE  NINE MONTHS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED  6.0  MILLION SHARES OF FEDEX COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $227.42  PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL OF $1.4  BILLION. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ,  5.7  MILL  ION SHARES REMAINED UNDER THE CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  SHARES UNDER THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE REPURCHASED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING AND VOLUME OF REPURCHASES ARE AT THE DISC  RETION OF MANAGEMENT, BASED ON THE CAPITAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, THE MARKET PRICE OF FEDEX COMMON STOCK AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. NO TIME LIMIT WAS SET FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM, AND THE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR OPERATIONS ARE CAPITAL INTENSIVE, CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN AIRCRAFT, VEHICLES, TECHNOLOGY, FACILITIES, AND PACKAGE- HANDLING AND SORT EQUIPMENT. THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL ADDITIONS DEPEND ON VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING PRE-EXISTING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, ANTICIPATED VOLUME GROWTH, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NEW OR ENHANCED SERVICES, GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF SERVICES, AVAILABILITY OF SATISFACTORY FINANCING AND ACTIONS OF REGULATORY AUTHORITIES.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM). OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCLUDES $1.0 BILLION OF CASH IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT STRATEGY. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MAJORITY OF THIS CASH WITHOUT A MATERIAL TAX COST, AS THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COST OF REPATRIATING FOREIGN EARNINGS FROM A U.S. TAX PERSPECTIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THESE FUNDS IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR U.S. DOMESTIC DEBT OR WORKING CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION IN 2019, AND INCLUDE SPENDING FOR AIRCRAFT MODERNIZATION AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND SPENDING ON FACILITIES AND SORT EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. WE INVESTED $1.5 BILLION IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND EXPECT TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL $0.6 BILLION FOR AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019. IN ADDITION, OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WE WILL BE INVESTING A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE FEDEX EXPRESS INDIANAPOLIS HUB AND A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION TO MODERNIZE THE FEDEX EXPRESS MEMPHIS WORLD HUB. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING UNSECURED FINANCING, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THE MARKETPLACE FOR SUCH INVESTMENT CAPITAL CAN BECOME RESTRICTED DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC FACTORS.  - 51  -  WE HAVE A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) THAT ALLOWS US TO SELL, IN ONE OR MORE FUTURE OFFERINGS, ANY COMBINATION OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT SECURITIES AND COMMON STOCK.  WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR $2.0 BILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN NOVEMBER 2020. SEE NOTE 3 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE TERMS AND SIGNIFICANT COVENANTS OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $1.0 BILLION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO MEET EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

IF OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER RATINGS DROP BELOW CURRENT LEVELS, WE MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY UTILIZING THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. IF OUR SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT CREDIT RATINGS DROP BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, OUR ACCESS TO FINANCING MAY BECOME LIMITED.

CERTAIN OF THESE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE REFLECTED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET, WHILE OTHERS ARE DISCLOSED AS FUTURE OBLIGATIONS UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES. EXCEPT FOR THE CURRENT PORTION OF INTEREST ON LONG-TERM DEBT, THIS TABLE DOES NOT INCLUDE AMOUNTS ALREADY RECORDED IN OUR BALANCE SHEET AS CURRENT LIABILITIES AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES  THE AMOUNTS REFLECTED IN THE TABLE ABOVE FOR LONG-TERM DEBT REPRESENT FUTURE SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON AMOUNTS INCLUDED WITHIN THE OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES CAPTIONS IN THE TABLE ABOVE CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES TO DEVELOP AMOUNTS REFLECTED AND DISCLOSED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES OR ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES THAT COULD BE USED. WE MAINTAIN A THOROUGH PROCESS TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MANY ESTIMATES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A COMPLEX, GLOBAL CORPORATION. HOWEVER, EVEN UNDER OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ESTIMATES ROUTINELY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEW OR BETTER INFORMATION.  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ANY OTHER CHANGE OF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A REEVALUATION OF THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS REQUIRED AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, NOR DO WE BELIEVE THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS AT RISK OF FAILING IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.  INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES CAN BE FOUND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THEREIN.

SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 7% AND 8% HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL COSTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  R&D EXPENSES VARY PRIMARILY WITH THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENT WAFERS PROCESSED, THE COST OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT DEDICATED TO NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONNEL COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE LEAD TIMES NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, WE TYPICALLY BEGIN TO PROCESS WAFERS BEFORE COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TESTING. DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT IS DEEMED COMPLETE WHEN IT IS QUALIFIED THROUGH REVIEWS AND TESTS FOR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. R&D EXPENSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF PRODUCT QUALIFICATION.  R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 15% AND 25% HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN VOLUMES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-QUALIFICATION WAFERS, DECREASES IN REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR R&D COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW, INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN CAPITAL SPENDING, AND, FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS.  WE SHARE THE COST OF CERTAIN PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PARTNERS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS TO JOINTLY DEVELOP NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES WITH INTEL.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY EXPERIENCES A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS THE COMPANY'S  EDUCATION  SEGMENT BEGINS  TO SELL ITS CORE CURRICULUM OFFERING, SCHOLASTIC LITERACY, THESE REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, WHEN SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR.  36  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $60.5 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $64.9 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $4.4 MILLION  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED TRADE CHANNEL REVENUES.  IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AND LONGER LEAD TIMES WITH STRATEGIC PRINTERS AND SUPPLIERS, THE COMPANY IS UTILIZING ITS BALANCE SHEET TO IMPROVE VENDOR RELATIONS AND OPTIMIZE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WILL RESULT IN HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORY AND QUICKER PAYMENT TERMS WHICH WILL HAVE A NEAR-TERM IMPACT ON WORKING CAPITAL UTILIZATION AND RESULT IN FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $103.8 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $116.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING LOWER CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $13.0 MILLION  . THIS DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS BUILDING MODERNIZATION PROJECT AS IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PREPUBLICATION SPENDING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PERIOD FOR NEW PRINT AND DIGITAL CORE INSTRUCTION PRODUCTS WITHIN THE  EDUCATION  SEGMENT.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $9.9 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $30.2 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $20.3 MILLION  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY, WHICH WERE  $23.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD COMPARED TO  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS PURSUANT TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  CASH POSITION  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED  $338.1 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ,  $391.9 MILLION  AT MAY 31, 2018 AND  $362.6 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY\u2019S U.S. OPERATIONS TOTALED $317.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , $371.1 MILLION  AT MAY 31, 2018 AND $342.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS AS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cSEASONALITY\u201d ABOVE, THE COMPANY USUALLY EXPERIENCES NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS IN THE JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER TIME PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS CYCLE, BORROWINGS HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED DURING JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, HAVE GENERALLY PEAKED IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER, AND HAVE BEEN AT THEIR LOWEST POINT IN MAY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PHILOSOPHY IS TO USE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO CREATE VALUE BY PAYING DOWN DEBT, REINVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT ITS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES OR ACQUIRING OTHER STRATEGIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN SHAREHOLDER ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO USE ITS CASH POSITION, COMBINED WITH IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN DATA, TO REDUCE PROCUREMENT COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES.  THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED, AND EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, DIVIDENDS, CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, DEBT SERVICE, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $338.1 MILLION  , CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDING AVAILABLE UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $375.0 MILLION  . THE COMPANY MAY AT ANY TIME, BUT IN ANY EVENT NOT MORE THAN ONCE IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR, REQUEST THAT THE AGGREGATE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT OF $10.0 MILLION OR AN INTEGRAL MULTIPLE OF $10.0 MILLION (BUT NOT TO EXCEED $150.0 MILLION). ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $49.1 MILLION, LESS CURRENT BORROWINGS OF  $11.0 MILLION  AND COMMITMENTS OF  $4.9 MILLION  , RESULTING IN $33.2 MILLION OF CURRENT AVAILABILITY AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE ITS ONGOING OPERATING NEEDS, AS WELL AS ITS FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  37  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2.

WE OWN THE WORLDWIDE INTELLECTUAL AND MARKETING RIGHTS TO THE RADMAX\u00ae TECHNOLOGY.  OUR VISION IS TO DEVELOP ADVANCED DEVICES THAT REDUCE CARBON FOOTPRINT, REDUCE DEVICE SIZE, WEIGHT AND PARTS COUNT, AND INCREASE  FUEL AND MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES. WE INTEND TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THESE DEVICES IN COOPERATION WITH INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT  PARTNERS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON CREATING NEW, DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE MORE EFFICIENT, COMPACT AND COST-EFFECTIVE THAN THOSE  CURRENTLY AVAILABLE.

REG TECH THEN DISTRIBUTED ALL THESE SHARES TO ITS SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD  AS DIVIDENDS. THIS CONSOLIDATION OF OWNERSHIP TO THE TECHNOLOGY BETTER ENABLES OUR FOCUSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

(\u201cMINEWEST\u201d), A BRITISH COLUMBIA COMPANY, IN EXCHANGE FOR SETTLEMENT OF ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT  OF $7,217 TO MINEWEST.

SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN OUR AMERICAS MILLS SEGMENT INCREASED IN FISCAL 2019 ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, AS TRADE MEASURES IN THE U.S. AIMED AT UNFAIRLY PRICED REBAR IMPORTS HAVE LEVELED THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT FOR  29  DOMESTIC REBAR PRODUCERS. DEMAND DRIVEN BY U.S. NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STRONG; HOWEVER, EXCLUDING INCREMENTAL SHIPMENTS BY OUR NEW MICRO MILL IN DURANT, OKLAHOMA, SHIPMENTS FROM OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS DECREASED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY SLOWED DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER IN SEVERAL OF OUR KEY MARKETS. SECOND QUARTER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WERE DOWN IN FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE FISCAL 2018, IN OUR AMERICAS RECYCLING AND INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENTS, LEADING TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN NET SALES IN THESE SEGMENTS ON BOTH A QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS; HOWEVER, MARGINS REMAINED STABLE. CONTRACTS IN OUR AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO REFLECT AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT HAVE LAGGED INCREASED INPUT AND PRODUCTION COSTS.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF THE  2026 NOTES  AND A DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  (BOTH DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), WHICH DROVE INCREASES OF $7.2 MILLION AND $12.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WERE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST OF $3.0 MILLION AND $6.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  54.9%  AND  40.9%  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH  15.0%  AND  19.6%  , FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD WAS GREATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF TAX EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE TCJA COMPARED TO BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES WERE REDUCTIONS IN THE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP PRICING ENVIRONMENT, RESULTING IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN AVERAGE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SELLING PRICES OF  7%  AND  15%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO A DECLINE IN NONFERROUS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, RESULTING FROM A GENERAL DECLINE IN PRICING ACROSS NONFERROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING COPPER AND ALUMINUM.

THE INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY METAL MARGIN EXPANSION OF  32%  AND  29%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS DEMAND DRIVEN BY U.S. NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STRONG. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED METAL MARGIN ARE THE HIGHER VOLUMES PROVIDED BY THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING MARGIN EXPANSION, ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  REFLECTED INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND INFLATIONARY COST PRESSURE ON CERTAIN SUPPLIES, INCLUDING ELECTRODES AND ALLOYS.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE, SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE SHIPMENTS BY OUR EXISTING FABRICATION FACILITIES WERE DOWN 16% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, AS INCLEMENT WEATHER ACROSS THE U.S. SLOWED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WERE INCREASES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  $46  AND  $68  PER TON, RESPECTIVELY, AS SELLING PRICES HAVE INCREASED IN RESPONSE TO RISING INPUT COSTS.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE REDUCTION IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN SHIPMENTS OF  12%  AND  7%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018.   THIS REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DELAYED CUSTOMER ORDERS IN ANTICIPATION OF EUROPEAN UNION TARIFF RATE QUOT  A  SAFEGUARD MEASURES, WHICH OCCURRED DURING FEBRUARY 2019.  THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ALSO REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $18.2 MILLION AND $26.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED  36%  AND  15%  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  , DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE SECOND QUARTER VOLUME DECREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE.  ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTING ADJUSTED EBITDA WAS A 12% INCREASE IN CONVERSION COSTS ON A PER TON BASIS DURING FISCAL 2019 RESULTING FROM DECREASED VOLUMES COUPLED WITH INCREASED ALLOY AND SUPPLY COSTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $0.2 MILLION  AND  $0.3 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $0.5 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A $22.5 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  AND OTHER LEGAL EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN A COST EFFICIENT MANNER. OUR FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING CAPITAL MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATING MADE BY ANY RATING AGENCY.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE  $350.0 MILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SALE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS, AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  33  OUR BUSINESS REGULARLY GENERATES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL CONDITION, WE RECORD ALLOWANCES AS SOON AS WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTS ARE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AS WE MAKE OUR ASSESSMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE CREDIT INSURANCE INTERNATIONALLY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INSURED RECEIVABLES (AND THOSE COVERED BY EXPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT) WAS APPROXIMATELY  12%  OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF NONFERROUS METAL PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A DIVERSE AND GENERALLY STABLE CUSTOMER BASE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE FUTURES OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN METAL COMMODITY PRICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NATURAL GAS PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. SEE  NOTE 10, DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WITH THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, CASH RECEIPTS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\"DPP\") FROM OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND (THE \"PROGRAMS\"), PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WERE RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, COUPLED WITH AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE PROGRAMS, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 6, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS  , CASH COLLECTIONS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  RELATED TO OUR  $367.5 MILLION  OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT  AUGUST 31, 2018  WERE REFLECTED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING COLLECTIONS RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT  AUGUST 31, 2018  , FUTURE CASH COLLECTIONS OF TRADE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND CASH ADVANCES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF SUCH ADVANCES, ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN FISCAL  2019.  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $352.9 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $183.6 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE, IN PART, TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (\"WORKING CAPITAL\") FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WHICH REFLECT A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.7 MILLION  .  THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO AN OVERALL WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTION IN FISCAL 2018 RESULTING FROM THE WIND DOWN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2018. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RESULTED IN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF  $367.5 MILLION  AND  $322.4 MILLION  RELATED TO CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING WERE FLAT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, WHILE DAYS SALES IN INVENTORY INCREASED BY  TEN  DAYS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  34  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $550.6 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 RESULTED IN A TOTAL YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  OF  $135.1 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $45.1 MILLION  RELATED TO THE CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS, AND $90.0 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS DURING FISCAL 2018 RELATED TO CASH ADVANCES TAKEN UNDER THE PROGRAM.  WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL BUDGET WILL RANGE BETWEEN  $175 MILLION TO $225 MILLION  . WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR CAPITAL SPENDING BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED RESULTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  BY  $227.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $180.0 MILLION DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  DURING FISCAL  2019  AS WELL AS NET SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF  $47.4 MILLION  UNDER THE PROGRAMS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE USE OF OUR CASH IN EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  WE ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PRUDENT USES OF OUR CAPITAL, SUCH AS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $380 MILLION  FROM  AUGUST 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  . THE INCREASE INCLUDES FINANCING AND RELATED INTEREST OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  RELATED TO ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS PURCHASING ACTIVITIES. OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDING  FEBRUARY 28  , 2020 ARE APPROXIMATELY  $570 MILLION  AND PRIMARILY CONSIST OF EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITIES.  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS REQUEST. AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD COMMITTED  $28.2 MILLION  UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH  $3.3 MILLION  REDUCED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER, AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , WE HAVE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND POLAND.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, THE PROGRAMS WERE AMENDED SUCH THAT THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACCOUNTED FOR TRANSFERS OF THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS SALES: TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TRANSFERRED WERE REMOVED FROM THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND CASH ADVANCES RECEIVED WERE REFLECTED AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  CONTINGENCIES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS, WE BECOME INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL  INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE MAY INCUR SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE MATTERS. LIABILITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES REQUIRE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EACH MATTER AND THE ADVICE OF OUR LEGAL COUNSEL. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION-RELATED LOSSES WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS. WE EVALUATE THE MEASUREMENT OF RECORDED LIABILITIES EACH REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIC TO EACH MATTER. THE ULTIMATE LOSSES INCURRED UPON FINAL RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY RECORDED AT A PARTICULAR BALANCE SHEET DATE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

(\u201cCROWN EQUITY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN AUGUST 1995 IN NEVADA. THE COMPANY IS OFFERING ITS SERVICES TO COMPANIES SEEKING TO BECOME PUBLIC ENTITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS LAUNCHED A WEBSITE, WWW.CROWNEQUITYHOLDINGS.COM, WHICH OFFERS ITS SERVICES IN A WIDE RANGE OF FIELDS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES VARIOUS CONSULTING SERVICES TO COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS DEALING WITH CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS GLOBALLY. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES PUBLIC RELATIONS AND NEWS DISSEMINATION FOR PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES.  IN DECEMBER, 2010, THE COMPANY FORMED TWO WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES CROWN TELE SERVICES, INC. AND CROWN DIRECT, INC. CROWN TELE SERVICES, INC. WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE VOICE OVER INTERNET (\u201cVOIP\u201d) SERVICES TO CLIENTS AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE AND CROWN DIRECT, INC. WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE DIRECT SALES TO CUSTOMERS. BOTH ENTITIES HAD MINIMUM SALES DURING THE QUARTER.  IN MARCH, 2011, THE COMPANY FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY CRWE REAL ESTATE, INC. AS A SUBSIDIARY TO ENGAGE IN POTENTIAL REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS. THE ENTITY HAD MINIMAL ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER.  THE COMPANY HAS FOCUSED ITS PRIMARY VISION TO USING ITS NETWORK OF WEBSITES TO PROVIDE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING SERVICES, AS A WORLDWIDE ONLINE MEDIA ADVERTISING PUBLISHER, DEDICATED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF QUALITY BRANDING INFORMATION. THE COMPANY OFFERS INTERNET MEDIA-DRIVEN ADVERTISING SERVICES, WHICH COVER AND CONNECT A WIDE RANGE OF MARKETING SPECIALTIES, AS WELL AS SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION FOR CLIENTS INTERESTED IN ONLINE MEDIA AWARENESS. AS PART OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TECHNICIANS IN DEVELOPING ITS WEBSITES AND ADDING ADDITIONAL WEBSITES. THIS ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DISSEMINATE NEWS AND PRESS RELEASES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS GENERAL NEWS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE THAN IT DID PREVIOUSLY. THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS SERVICES TO COMPANIES SEEKING MARKET AWARENESS OF THEM AND THE SERVICES OR GOODS THAT THEY OFFER. THE COMPANY THEN PUBLISHES INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE COMPANIES ON ITS MANY WEBSITES  CROWN EQUITY\u2019S OFFICE IS LOCATED AT 11226 PENTLAND DOWN STREET, LAS VEGAS, NV 89141.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, CROWN EQUITY HAD NO PAID EMPLOYEES AND WAS UTILIZING THE SERVICES OF ONE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND CONSULTANT.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, REVENUES WERE $5,796 AND $654 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SERVICES AND 24/7 SUPPORT (INCLUDING DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, TESTING, MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY, INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING, MANAGING, AND HOSTING) TO A RELATED PARTY.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $35,230 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND $58,743 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO STOCK ISSUED FOR SERVICES BEING $33,000 LESS IN THE 2018 PERIOD VERSUS 2017 OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION OF APPROXIMATELY $7,000. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WERE OTHER EXPENSES OF $5,823 AND OTHER EXPENSES OF $519 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN 2017. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE BEING $2,104 HIGHER AND THE $3,200 OF AMORTIZATION OF THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE RELATED FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED FOR WHICH THERE WAS ZERO IN 2017.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $2,623 AND $519, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, CROWN EQUITY HAD CURRENT ASSETS OF $1,241 AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $272,840 RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $271,599. NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $5,464 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $10,314 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOW RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM POSITIVE FACTORS OF A DECREASE IN OUR NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $23,000, AN INCREASE IN THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YEAR OVER YEAR OF $4,000, AN INCREASE IN OUR AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION OF 10,000 AS WELL AS OFFSETTING THESE AMOUNTS WAS A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT FOR STOCK ISSUED FOR SERVICES OF APPROXIMATELY $33,000.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS ZERO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $4,843 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $0 IN 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE BORROWED $5,235 ON CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND REPAID $392 ON NOTES PAYABLE. THERE WAS NO SIMILAR ACTIVITY FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  OUR EXISTING CAPITAL MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET CROWN EQUITY\u2019S CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONTINUING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. THIS CONDITION RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO CROWN EQUITY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF CROWN EQUITY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Crown Equity Holdings, Inc.", "CIK": 1103833, "Date": "2019-03-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CRWE", "Name": "Crown Equity Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 5734.0, "Business": "NV", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 330677140.0, "key": "20190327CRWE", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6082588000000001, "prof1": 0.39174116, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.6769349919839205, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.8163127201478085, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.2261522137369059, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.14340965784831236, "indexx": 220, "cumreturn1b": 1.1251254116574467, "cumreturndow": 1.0041909056447975, "cumreturnsp500": 0.9881328066631948}, {"Unnamed: 0": 221, "level_0": 228, "index": 49493, "text": "ITEM 2.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE EVENTS THAT MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. ACTUAL OUTCOMES AND RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM WHAT IS EXPRESSED OR FORECAST IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VOLATILE, NEGATIVE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONDITIONS ON OUR CLIENTS\u2019 BUSINESSES AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON GENERATING AND MAINTAINING ONGOING, PROFITABLE CLIENT DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADAPTATION AND EXPANSION OF OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ONGOING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SUCH DEMAND OR AN INABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CLIENT DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONALS WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS, OUR BUSINESS, THE UTILIZATION RATE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  WE COULD FACE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT CLIENT AND/OR ACCENTURE DATA FROM SECURITY BREACHES OR CYBERATTACKS.  \u2022  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR LEVEL OF TAXES, AS WELL AS AUDITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND TAX PROCEEDINGS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  OUR PROFITABILITY COULD MATERIALLY SUFFER IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, IF OUR COST-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR IF WE EXPERIENCE DELIVERY INEFFICIENCIES.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS AND OUR GROWTH STRATEGY TO CONTINUE GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, WE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN RISKS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE INCUR LEGAL LIABILITY.  \u2022  OUR WORK WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SIZE, WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  \u2022  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIANCE PARTNERS OR IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE AND ESTABLISH NEW ALLIANCES IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEES MAY DEPEND ON OUR REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  WE MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AT ACQUIRING, INVESTING IN OR INTEGRATING BUSINESSES, ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES OR DIVESTING BUSINESSES.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR IF OUR SERVICES OR SOLUTIONS INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR IN THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS THAT LINK SOME OF OUR FEES TO THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS TARGETS AND/OR REQUIRE US TO MEET SPECIFIC SERVICE LEVELS. THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHARE PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL, IT MAY DILUTE OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN US.  \u2022  WE ARE INCORPORATED IN IRELAND AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO ENFORCE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY RELATED TO OUR INCORPORATION IN IRELAND.  \u2022  IRISH LAW DIFFERS FROM THE LAWS IN EFFECT IN THE UNITED STATES AND MIGHT AFFORD LESS PROTECTION TO SHAREHOLDERS.  FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS, SEE THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2018  . OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT OR AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OVERVIEW  REVENUES ARE DRIVEN BY THE ABILITY OF OUR EXECUTIVES TO SECURE NEW CONTRACTS AND TO DELIVER SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS THAT ADD VALUE RELEVANT TO OUR CLIENTS\u2019 CURRENT NEEDS AND CHALLENGES. THE LEVEL OF REVENUES WE ACHIEVE IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MARKET-LEADING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS AND TO DEPLOY SKILLED TEAMS OF PROFESSIONALS QUICKLY AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THIS VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY AND SEEK TO MANAGE OUR COSTS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, U.K. POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  4%  AND  3%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY WITHIN RECENT RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2019  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2019  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  3%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH  THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE CONTINUE TO HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HEADCOUNT, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH SERVE OUR CLIENTS, TO APPROXIMATELY  477,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED  TO APPROXIMATELY  442,000  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  15%  , UP FROM  13%  IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN SKILL SETS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, COMPENSATION INCREASES  BECOME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1ST OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  WE STRIVE TO ADJUST PRICING AND/OR THE MIX OF RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF COMPENSATION INCREASES ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO: KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR AMOUNTS OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING; RECOVER INCREASES IN COMPENSATION; DEPLOY OUR EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY ON A TIMELY BASIS; MANAGE ATTRITION; AND/OR EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE AND UTILIZE NEW EMPLOYEES.

GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  30.2%  COMPARED WITH  29.9%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LABOR COSTS, COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NON-PAYROLL COSTS, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.

CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF PENSION SERVICE COSTS WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM OPERATING EXPENSES TO NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON OUR OPERATING INCOME DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS SIMILAR TO THAT DISCLOSED FOR REVENUE. IN ADDITION, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, WE EXPERIENCED HIGHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AS DISCUSSED IN THE OVERVIEW. THE COMMENTARY BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING GROUP PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  \u2022  COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.  \u2022  FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATING INCOME DECREASED AS HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY AND REVENUE GROWTH WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE OPERATING INCOME DECREASED AS REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER OUTSOURCING CONTRACT PROFITABILITY WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  PRODUCTS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  RESOURCES OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONSULTING CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  18.6%  , COMPARED WITH  23.0%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  , WE RECORDED A  $137 MILLION  TAX CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT. ABSENT THIS CHARGE, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  WOULD HAVE BEEN  18.0%  . THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND HIGHER EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF FASB ASU NO. 2016-16, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BENEFITS FROM FINAL DETERMINATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR TAXES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS AND SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY YEAR TO YEAR. WE EXPECT THE  FISCAL 2019  ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE IN THE RANGE OF  22.5%  TO  23.5%  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR INTERIM PERIODS CAN VARY BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE YEAR.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED  $88 MILLION  , OR  73%  , FROM THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE FROM  4%  HELD BY ACCENTURE HOLDINGS PLC AND ACCENTURE CANADA HOLDINGS INC. TO LESS THAN  1%  HELD BY ONLY ACCENTURE CANADA HOLDINGS INC. DRIVEN BY THE ACCENTURE HOLDINGS PLC MERGER WITH AND INTO ACCENTURE PLC.

THE  $0.53  INCREASE IN OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE  $137 MILLION  TAX CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX ACT, WHICH DECREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  BY  $0.21  . EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THIS CHARGE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED  $0.32  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE OF  $0.28  FROM HIGHER REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,  $0.03  FROM LOWER NON-OPERATING EXPENSES  AND  $0.03  FROM LOWER WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF  $0.02  FROM A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  .FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS, SEE NOTE 3 (EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS  $4.5 BILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $5.1 BILLION  AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2018.

DESCRIPTION  OF BUSINESS  BACKGROUND  WELLNESS  CENTER USA, INC. (\u201cWCUI\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN JUNE 2010 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  NEVADA. THE COMPANY INITIALLY ENGAGED IN ONLINE SPORTS AND NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY  EXPANDED INTO ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL SECTORS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING PSORIA-SHIELD INC.  (\u201cPSI\u201d), NATIONAL PAIN CENTERS, INC. (\u201cNPC\u201d) AND STEALTHCO INC. (\u201cSCI\u201d), D/B/A STEALTH MARK,  INC. ON AUGUST 11, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NPC, WHICH  HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2016. SEE NOTE 3 FOR DETAILS RELATING TO THE SALE.  THE  COMPANY CURRENTLY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (I) DISTRIBUTION OF TARGETED ULTRA VIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY  DEVICES FOR DERMATOLOGY; AND (II) AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE SEGMENTS ARE OPERATED, RESPECTIVELY,  THROUGH PSI AND SCI.  PSI  PSI WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF  THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JUNE 17, 2009. ON AUGUST 24, 2012, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF STOCK IN PSI.  PSI IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND DURING A PORTION OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT WAS OPERATED  BY PSORIA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LLC, AN ILLINOIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\u201cPDC\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN WCUI/PSI  AND THE MEDICAL ALLIANCE, INC., A FLORIDA CORPORATION (\u201cTMA\u201d).  17  ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2018, PSI AND TMA ENTERED INTO A WITHDRAW AND MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THEIR JOINT VENTURE  AGREEMENT. ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES OF THE JOINT  VENTURE TOTALED TO $405,383. UPON TERMINATION, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY FORGAVE THE  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES AND RECORDED A LOSS FROM DECONSOLIDATION OF  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST OF $405,383.  IN  DECEMBER 2018, PSI ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH GEN2 TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, LICENSING AND/OR SALE OF  PSI TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH NEO. PSI AND GEN2 WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF NEO, OWNING  50.5% AND 36.0%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE UNITS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF NEO. AN ADDITIONAL 13.5% OF SUCH UNITS  WILL BE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE AS INCENTIVES FOR KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS. UNTIL SUCH SHARES ARE DISTRIBUTED, THE COMPANY  CONTROLS 68% OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND GEN2 THE REMAINING 32%. PSI AND GEN2 WILL MANAGE NEO\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. PSI  WILL CONTRIBUTE PSI TECHNOLOGY TO NEO AND GEN2 WILL CONTRIBUTE $700,000. REPAYMENT OF THE $700,000 INVESTMENT BY GEN2 WILL BEGIN  THROUGH AND UPON THE DATE WHICH NEO HAS REALIZED AND RETAINED CUMULATIVE NET INCOME/DISTRIBUTABLE CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $300,000.  DISTRIBUTIONS THEREAFTER WILL BE MADE TO PSI, GEN2 AND OTHER MEMBERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE UNIT OWNERSHIP, AT THE  TIMES AND IN THE MANNER DETERMINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE MANAGERS, IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. GEN2 CONSISTS OF ACCREDITED INVESTORS,  AND INVESTMENT PARTICIPATION FROM SEVERAL WCUI OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, INCLUDING CALVIN R. O\u2019HARROW AND ROY M. HARSCH.  AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, GEN2 HAD RECEIVED $375,000 OF INVESTMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEO AND THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS PROPORTIONATE  SHARE OF $255,000 TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND $120,000 TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018, NEO DID NOT RECORD ANY INCOME OR EXPENSES RELATING TO ITS OPERATIONS.  PSI  DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS A TARGETED ULTRAVIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE CALLED THE PSORIA-LIGHT. THE PSORIA-LIGHT  IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN TARGETED PUVA PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND UVB PHOTOTHERAPY AND IS DESIGNED TO TREAT CERTAIN SKIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING  PSORIASIS, VITILIGO, ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA), SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS, AND LEUKODERMA.  PSORIASIS,  ECZEMA, AND VITILIGO, ARE COMMON SKIN CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO TREAT, AND OFTEN CAUSE THE CLIENT SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOSOCIAL  STRESS. CLIENTS MAY UNDERGO A VARIETY OF TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE SKIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ROUTINE CONSUMPTION OF SYSTEMIC  AND BIOLOGIC DRUG THERAPIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY TOXIC, REDUCE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION, AND COME WITH A HOST OF CHEMOTHERAPY-LIKE  SIDE EFFECTS. ULTRAVIOLET (UV) PHOTOTHERAPY IS A CLINICALLY VALIDATED ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR THESE DISORDERS.  TRADITIONALLY,  \u201cNON-TARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED BY LAMPS THAT EMITTED EITHER UVA OR UVB LIGHT TO BOTH DISEASED AND  HEALTHY SKIN. WHILE SUNBLOCKS OR OTHER UV BARRIERS MAY BE USED TO PROTECT HEALTHY SKIN, THE UV ADMINISTERED IN THIS MANNER MUST  BE LOW DOSAGE TO AVOID EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE OF HEALTHY TISSUE. TODAY, \u201cTARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES ADMINISTER  MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES OF LIGHT ONLY TO AFFECTED TISSUE, RESULTING IN \u201cCLEARANCE\u201d IN THE CASE OF PSORIASIS AND ECZEMA,  AND \u201cREPIGMENTATION\u201d IN THE CASE OF VITILIGO, AT MUCH FASTER RATES THAN NON-TARGETED (LOW DOSAGE) UV TREATMENTS.  TARGETED  UV TREATMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED TO SMALLER TOTAL BODY SURFACE AREAS, AND ARE THEREFORE USED TO TREAT THE MOST INTENSE  PARTS OF A CLIENT\u2019S DISEASE. NON-TARGETED UV TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY USED AS A FOLLOW-UP AND FOR MAINTENANCE, CAPABLE OF  TREATING LARGE SURFACES OF THE BODY. EXCIMER LASER DEVICES (UVB AT 308NM) ARE EXPENSIVE AND CONSUME DANGEROUS CHEMICALS (XENON  AND CHLORINE). MERCURY LAMP DEVICES (UVB AND/OR UVA) REQUIRE EXPENSIVE LAMP REPLACEMENTS REGULARLY AND REQUIRE SPECIAL DISPOSAL  (DUE TO MERCURY CONTENT). ADDITIONALLY, MERCURY LAMP DEVICES TYPICALLY DELIVER WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT BELOW 300NM. WHILE WITHIN  THE UVB SPECTRUM, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT WAVELENGTHS BELOW 300NM PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE \u201cSUNBURN\u201d TYPE SIDE EFFECTS  THAN DO WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 300 AND 320NM WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT IN THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT.  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT IS A TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE THAT PRODUCES UVB LIGHT BETWEEN 300 AND 320 NM AS WELL AS UVA LIGHT BETWEEN  350 AND 395NM. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSUMPTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR REQUIRE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL, AND IS COST EFFECTIVE  FOR CLINICIANS, WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PATIENT ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE AND ADVANCED  FEATURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE NON-TARGETED AND TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING  USED BY DERMATOLOGISTS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE UTILIZATION OF DEEP NARROW-BAND  UVB (\u201cNB-UVB\u201d) LEDS AS LIGHT SOURCES; THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH UVA OR NB-UVB THERAPEUTIC WAVELENGTHS; AN INTEGRATED  HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL CAMERA AND CLIENT RECORD INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES; THE ABILITY TO EXPORT TO AN EXTERNAL USB MEMORY DEVICE  A PDF FILE OF TREATMENT INFORMATION INCLUDING A PATENT PENDING GRAPH THAT INCLUDES DIGITAL IMAGES PLOTTED AGAINST USER TRACKED  METRICS WHICH CAN BE SUBMITTED TO IMPROVE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS; AN ACCESSORY PORT AND ABILITY TO UPDATE SOFTWARE; EASE OF PLACEMENT  AND PORTABILITY; ADVANCED TREATMENT SITE DETECTION SAFETY SENSOR; INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT; A WARRANTY WHICH INCLUDES THE  UV LAMP(S); AND A NON-CHANGEABLE TREATMENT LOG (THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HIPPA INFORMATION).  18  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS: A BASE CONSOLE, A COLOR DISPLAY WITH TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL, AND A HAND-HELD DELIVERY  DEVICE WITH A CONDUIT (OR TETHER) BETWEEN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND THE BASE CONSOLE. PSI REQUIRES CLEARANCE BY THE UNITED STATES  FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS PERMISSION FROM  TUV SUD AMERICA INC., PSI\u2019S NOTIFIED BODY, TO AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE PSORIA-LIGHT IN ORDER TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE  IN COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  TO  OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE AND PERMISSION TO AFFIX THE CE MARK, PSI WAS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT EMC AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY TESTING, WHICH  IT COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. PSI RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2011 (NO. K103540) AND WAS GRANTED PERMISSION  TO AFFIX THE CE MARK ON NOVEMBER 10, 2011. IN ITS 510(K) APPLICATION WITH THE FDA (APPLICATION NUMBER K103540), PSI ASSERTED THAT  THE PSORIA-LIGHT WAS \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT\u201d IN INTENDED USE AND TECHNOLOGY TO TWO PREDICATE DEVICES, THE X -TRAC  EXCIMER LASER, WHICH HAS WIDE ACCEPTANCE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING LITERATURE AND HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE IN THE U.S., AND THE  DUALIGHT, ANOTHER COMPETING TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE.  PSI  HAS ESTABLISHED AN ISO 13485 COMPLIANT QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE PSORIA-LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRST AUDITED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.  THIS SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE PSI DEVICES WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN A CONTROLLED AND RELIABLE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT ITS RESOURCES  FOLLOW SIMILAR PRACTICES AND IS REQUIRED FOR SALES IN COUNTRIES REQUIRING A CE MARK. PSI HAS ALSO RECEIVED CERTIFIED SPACE TECHNOLOGY  DESIGNATION FROM THE SPACE FOUNDATION, BASED ON PSI\u2019S INCORPORATION OF ESTABLISHED NASA-FUNDED LED TECHNOLOGY.  PSI  BEGAN PSORIA-LIGHT BETA DEPLOYMENT IN JANUARY 2012. IT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND STRATEGIES WILL EVER BE SUCCESSFUL. PSI\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTANCE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS  AND CLIENTS OF PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT AS A PREFERRED METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS AND OTHER UV-TREATABLE SKIN CONDITIONS.

IN ORDER  FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE PSI OPERATIONS, IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND IT WILL HAVE TO SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATE INTEGRATION  OF PSI OPERATIONS WITHOUT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING CONTINUATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS.  SCI  SCI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ON MARCH 18, 2014. SCI ACQUIRED CERTAIN STEALTH MARK ASSETS ON APRIL  4, 2014 AND OPERATES AS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY.

CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION  ON DECEMBER 20, 2018, TWO OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (THE \u201cMERGER AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH THE PARENT OF CARAUSTAR INDUSTRIES, INC. (\u201cCARAUSTAR\u201d) PROVIDING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR FOR A PURCHASE PRICE OF  $1.8 BILLION  IN CASH, SUBJECT TO THE PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS SET FORTH IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT, AND ON FEBRUARY 11, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR  ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR (THE \u201cCARAUSTAR ACQUISITION\u201d).  CARAUSTAR IS A LEADER IN THE PRODUCTION OF UNCOATED RECYCLED PAPERBOARD AND COATED RECYCLED PAPERBOARD, WITH A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS THAT INCLUDE TUBES AND CORES AND A DIVERSE MIX OF SPECIALTY PRODUCTS.

CONCURRENTLY WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, AND IN ORDER TO FUND THE PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WE ISSUED NEW  $500.0 MILLION  AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF  6.50%  SENIOR NOTES DUE 2027 AND ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AND RESTATED SENIOR SECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT.  SEE \u201cBORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - SENIOR NOTES\u201d AND \u201c- 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT.\u201d  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA, ALSO A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT IS RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE OF THE FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE.  IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SOURCE OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND IS INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE.  THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FIRST  QUARTER RESULTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  .

LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  243,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS.  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE.  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTY IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER \u201cGAIN ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET\u201d AND REPORT THE SALE OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \u201cNET SALES\u201d AND \u201cCOST OF PRODUCTS SOLD.\u201d ALL HBU, DEVELOPMENT AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IS USED BY US TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL SOLD. TIMBERLAND GAINS ARE RECORDED AS GAINS ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO WATER, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD APPROXIMATELY  17,600  ACRES OF SPECIAL USE PROPERTY IN THE UNITED STATES.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET SALES INCREASED TO  $6.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED WITH  $6.5 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $20.0 MILLION  ON  $55.7 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 WAS  $15.6 MILLION  ON  $44.5 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. IN ADDITION TO THE TIMING OF THE ANNUAL TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR THE QUARTERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270, WE ALSO RECORDED TAX EXPENSE AND BENEFITS RELATED TO THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \u201cTAX REFORM ACT\u201d), WHICH WENT INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 REFLECTED AN INCREMENTAL  $2.3 MILLION  OF TAX EXPENSE THAT WAS RECORDED RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY, OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES OF  $1.7 MILLION  RECOGNIZED DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE PERMANENT REINVESTMENT ASSERTION THAT OCCURRED DURING THE QUARTER UNDER ASC 740-30. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF AN INDEMNIFICATION ON THE DIVESTURE OF ONE OF GREIF\u2019S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES, GREIF RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITY OF  $2.3 MILLION  . OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN TAX BENEFIT OF  $0.7 MILLION  . FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, THE NET TAX BENEFIT RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT WAS  $29.4 MILLION  , WHICH INCLUDED THE REVALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX LIABILITY. OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN A NET TAX BENEFIT OF  $1.0 MILLION.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  THE ESTIMATED NET DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RANGES FROM  ZERO  TO  $5.0 MILLION  . ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES THAT WAS SUBTRACTED FROM NET INCOME TO ARRIVE AT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  WAS  $6.1 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET OPERATING PROFIT OF THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT JOINT VENTURE THAT WAS FORMED IN 2010 BY GREIF, INC. AND ONE OF ITS INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFLEXIBLE PACKAGING JV\u201d OR \u201cFPS VIE\u201d).  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC.  BASED ON THE ABOVE, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC. WAS  $29.7 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $56.5 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018.  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) CHANGES  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 830, \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS,\u201d THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN A FOREIGN CURRENCY ARE TRANSLATED INTO UNITED STATES DOLLARS AT THE RATE OF EXCHANGE EXISTING AT THE END OF THE CURRENT PERIOD, AND REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE MONTH IN WHICH THEY ARE INCURRED.

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET  CHANGE IN MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, NET WAS  $0.8 MILLION  AND  $0.9 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  BALANCE SHEET CHANGES  WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES  THE  $104.7 MILLION  INCREASE  IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO  $561.4 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $456.7 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES CREDIT FACILITIES AS PART OF A LARGER CAPITAL ALIGNMENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION. FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE CHANGES, SEE \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES - INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES\".  THE  $37.1 MILLION  INCREASE  IN INVENTORIES TO  $326.6 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $289.5 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES, LOWER SALES, AND A $2.5 MILLION IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.  THE  $26.8 MILLION  DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TO  $377.0 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM  $403.8 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND DECREASED SALES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR QUARTER AND A $3.0 MILLION IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OFFSET BY INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES.  OTHER BALANCE SHEET CHANGES  THE  $11.5 MILLION  INCREASE  IN PREPAID EXPENSES TO  $51.3 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM $39.8 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  THE  $10.3 MILLION  DECREASE  IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS TO  $81.8 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  FROM $92.1 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE QUARTERLY TAX PROVISION AND TRUE UPS FOR RETURN FILINGS, OFFSET BY TAX PAYMENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, THE SENIOR NOTES WE HAVE ISSUED, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE USE THESE SOURCES TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FUND THESE ITEMS IN A LIKE MANNER. WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT OPERATING CASH FLOWS, BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITY, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT, POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND OTHER LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS. MOREOVER, AS A RESULT OF THE TAX REFORM ACT, IF DISTRIBUTIONS FROM OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE NEEDED TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, OR ACQUISITIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE WOULD BE NO ADDITIONAL U.S. TAXES ON SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF 2019 AND 2018, WE INVESTED  $26.0 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $0.9 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES) AND  $28.0 MILLION  (EXCLUDING  $2.6 MILLION  FOR PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES), RESPECTIVELY, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EXCLUDING PURCHASES OF AND INVESTMENTS IN TIMBER PROPERTIES, TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $170.0  TO  $190.0 MILLION  IN  2019  . WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE EXPENDITURES WILL REPLACE AND IMPROVE EXISTING EQUIPMENT AND FUND NEW FACILITIES.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NONCONTROLLING INTEREST  WE HAVE CONDITIONAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS TO REDEEM THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTEREST OF CERTAIN NONCONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS IN OUR JOINT VENTURES AT WHICH TIME WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CASH OUTFLOWS.  ON NOVEMBER 15, 2018, ONE OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNERS RELATED TO ONE OF OUR PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES JOINT VENTURES EXERCISED ITS PUT OPTION TO REQUIRE US TO PURCHASE ALL OF ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST. WE MADE A PAYMENT FOR  $10.1 MILLION  TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNER IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019. ALSO IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH ANOTHER NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OWNER RELATED TO THE SAME PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES JOINT VENTURE, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE OWNER RECEIVED A  $1.8 MILLION  PAYMENT FOR ALL OF ITS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THIS JOINT VENTURE.

UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITY  ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2018, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR EXISTING RECEIVABLES FACILITY IN THE UNITED STATES TO ESTABLISH A  $150.0 MILLION  UNITED STATES TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITY (THE \"U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY\") WITH A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY MATURES ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. THE  $150.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING BALANCE UNDER THE U.S. RECEIVABLE FACILITY AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  IS REPORTED IN LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATION ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENT OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT. THE FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY WERE  $0.1 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AND ARE RECORDED AS A DIRECT DEDUCTION FROM THE LONG-TERM DEBT LIABILITY.  WE CAN TERMINATE THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY AT ANY TIME UPON FIVE DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE.

INTEREST IS PAYABLE ON A MONTHLY BASIS AND THE PRINCIPAL BALANCE IS PAYABLE UPON TERMINATION OF THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY. THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CERTAIN COVENANTS AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT, WHICH ARE MATERIALLY SIMILAR TO THE 2017 CREDIT AGREEMENT COVENANTS.

SEE NOTE 8 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE RECEIVABLES FACILITY.  INTERNATIONAL TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AS PART OF A LARGER CAPITAL STRUCTURE ALIGNMENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE CARAUSTAR ACQUISITION, A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE WAS ADDED TO THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA. A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE NULLIFIES LEGAL ISOLATION AND TRUE-SALE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BECAUSE A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE IS A FORM OF CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT REMOVE FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, AND THE EUROPEAN RPA AND SINGAPORE RPA ARE NOW PRESENTED AS LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENTS OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT.  IN 2012, COOPERAGE RECEIVABLES FINANCE B.V. AND GREIF COORDINATION CENTER BVBA, OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY ENTERED INTO THE NIEUW AMSTERDAM RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cEUROPEAN RPA\u201d) WITH AFFILIATES OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN RPA, WE AGREED TO SELL TRADE RECEIVABLES MEETING CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, BASED ON A FORMULA, APPROXIMATING  75  TO  90  PERCENT OF THE ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN OCTOBER 2007, GREIF SINGAPORE PTE. LTD., OUR INDIRECT WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ENTERED INTO THE SINGAPORE RECEIVABLE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (THE \u201cSINGAPORE RPA\u201d) WITH A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANK. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SINGAPORE RPA, WE AGREED TO SELL TRADE RECEIVABLES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, BASED ON A FORMULA, OF APPROXIMATELY  90  PERCENT OF THE ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES.  THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES TO BE SOLD AND OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME UNDER THE EUROPEAN RPA IS  \u20ac100.0 MILLION  (  $114.3 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ). THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES TO BE FINANCED UNDER THE SINGAPORE RPA IS  15.0 MILLION  SINGAPORE DOLLARS (  $11.1 MILLION  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  ).  PRIOR TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE STRUCTURE OF THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA (AS SUCH TERMS ARE DEFINED BELOW) PROVIDED FOR A LEGAL TRUE SALE, ON A REVOLVING BASIS, OF THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED FROM OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES TO THE RESPECTIVE PURCHASERS. THE REMAINING (DEFERRED) PURCHASE PRICE WAS SETTLED UPON COLLECTION OF THE RECEIVABLES. THEREFORE, WE REMOVED FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE SINCE THEY MET THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA OF ASC 860, \u201cTRANSFERS AND SERVICING,\u201d AND WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE RECEIVABLES WERE SOLD ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS WITH THE TOTAL FUNDS IN THE SERVICING COLLECTION ACCOUNTS PLEDGED TO THE BANKS BETWEEN SETTLEMENT DATES. THE CASH INITIALLY RECEIVED, ALONG WITH THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE, RELATED TO THE SALE OR ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES AND WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OTHER RISKS GIVEN THEIR SHORT TERM NATURE. THEREFORE, WE REFLECTED ALL CASH FLOWS UNDER THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SALES PROGRAMS AS OPERATING CASH FLOWS ON THE OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE VARIOUS RPAS.  INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES  WE HAVE VARIOUS BORROWING FACILITIES WHICH CHARGE INTEREST BASED ON THE ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR RATE PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ENTERED INTO  FOUR  FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATING TO THE DEBT TO BE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE QUARTER. SEE \"BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT\".  THESE FOUR FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAPS HAVE A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $866.7 MILLION  AND ARE EFFECTIVE MARCH 11, 2019. WE WILL BEGIN TO RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON 1 MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND IN RETURN ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  2.50%.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A FORWARD INTEREST RATE SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $300.0 MILLION  . AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2017, WE BEGAN TO RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON ONE MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND IN RETURN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A FIXED RATE OF  1.19%  PLUS AN INTEREST SPREAD.  THESE DERIVATIVES ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME LINE ITEM ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND IN THE SAME PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS.  SEE NOTE 9 AND NOTE14 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES.  FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ITS ATTENTION ON BUSINESS OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $185.8 MILLION  (  $194.4 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  ).  SEE NOTE 9 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE HEDGES.  CROSS CURRENCY SWAP  WE HAVE OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. ON MARCH 6, 2018 WE ENTERED INTO A CROSS CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT SYNTHETICALLY SWAPS  $100.0 MILLION  OF FIXED RATE DEBT TO EURO DENOMINATED FIXED RATE DEBT AT A RATE OF  2.35%  . THE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES AND WILL MATURE ON MARCH 6, 2023. ACCORDINGLY, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THIS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS INCLUDED IN THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE NET INVESTMENT IS SOLD, DILUTED,  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OR LIQUIDATED. INTEREST PAYMENTS RECEIVED FOR THE CROSS CURRENCY SWAP ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE NET INVESTMENT HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT AND ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ON THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ON NOVEMBER 19, 2018 WE ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM (THE \"2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM\") DESIGNED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE DILUTION RESULTING FROM ISSUANCE OF STOCK UNDER THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE EQUITY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THE PURCHASE OF UP TO  $1.75 BILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK AT THE COMPANY'S DISCRETION AND HAS NO FIXED TERMINATION DATE. THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES AND MAY BE SUSPENDED, AMENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME. DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE REPURCHASED AND RETIRED APPROXIMATELY  1.1 MILLION  SHARES FOR  $75 MILLION  UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.

LOOKING FORWARD, WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DIFFERENTIATING PRODUCT SOLUTIONS, IMPROVING OUR CUSTOMERS' EXPERIENCE AND  GROWING OUR EARNINGS. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION THROUGH OUR DIVIDEND AND SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT FOREIGN CURRENCY TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE FOR THE REST OF 2019 BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE THE CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE CURRENCY IMPACT.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) IN THE U.S. THE PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP IN THE U.S. REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MATERIALLY AND INVOLVE DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS BY MANAGEMENT. THOSE POLICIES ARE REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORY VALUATION, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSUMPTIONS, GOODWILL AND PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES. OTHER THAN ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION AND INCOME TAXES AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AS DESCRIBED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ALTHOUGH THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S BEST KNOWLEDGE OF CURRENT EVENTS AND ACTIONS THAT MAY IMPACT THE COMPANY IN THE FUTURE, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATES.  AN ACCOUNTING POLICY IS DEEMED TO BE CRITICAL IF IT REQUIRES AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE TO BE MADE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THE TIME THE ESTIMATE IS MADE AND IF DIFFERENT ESTIMATES THAT REASONABLY COULD HAVE BEEN USED OR CHANGES IN THE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO OCCUR COULD MATERIALLY CHANGE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  .    ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  (\u201cASC 606\u2019\u2019).  WE ENTER INTO AGREEMENTS TO SELL PRODUCTS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), SERVICES AND OTHER ARRANGEMENTS (MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS) THAT INCLUDE COMBINATIONS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  WE DERIVE REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF ANALYTICAL AND DIAGNOSTICS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS A PROMISE IN A CONTRACT TO TRANSFER A DISTINCT PRODUCT OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER AND IS THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT UNDER ASC 606. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION THAT WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, THE TRANSACTION PRICE. FOR EQUIPMENT, CONSUMABLES, AND MOST SOFTWARE LICENSES SOLD BY US, CONTROL TRANSFERS TO THE CUSTOMER AT A POINT IN TIME. WE USE PRESENT RIGHT TO PAYMENT, LEGAL TITLE, PHYSICAL POSSESSION OF THE ASSET, AND RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP AS INDICATORS TO DETERMINE THE TRANSFER OF CONTROL TO THE CUSTOMER. WHERE ACCEPTANCE IS NOT A FORMALITY, THE CUSTOMER MUST HAVE DOCUMENTED THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. FOR PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE INSTALLATION, IF THE INSTALLATION MEETS THE CRITERIA  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO BE CONSIDERED A SEPARATE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION, PRODUCT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL HAS PASSED TO THE CUSTOMER, AND RECOGNITION OF INSTALLATION REVENUE OCCURS ONCE COMPLETED. PRODUCT REVENUE, INCLUDING SALES TO RESELLERS AND DISTRIBUTORS IS REDUCED FOR PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTIES, RETURNS, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SALES ARE RECORDED.  REVENUE FROM SERVICES INCLUDES EXTENDED WARRANTY, CUSTOMER AND SOFTWARE SUPPORT INCLUDING: SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (\"SAAS\"), POST CONTRACT SUPPORT (PCS), CONSULTING INCLUDING COMPANION DIAGNOSTICS, AND TRAINING AND EDUCATION. INSTRUMENT SERVICE CONTRACTS AND SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS ARE TYPICALLY ANNUAL CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE BILLED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTRACT OR MAINTENANCE PERIOD. THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS TO REVENUE OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. THERE ARE NO DEFERRED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SERVICE CONTRACT, AS THE COST OF THE SERVICE IS RECORDED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED. SERVICE CALLS ARE RECOGNIZED TO REVENUE AT THE TIME A SERVICE IS PERFORMED.  WE HAVE  SALES FROM STANDALONE SOFTWARE. THESE ARRANGEMENTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE SOFTWARE LICENSES AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS, BOTH OF WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO ALLOCATE TO THE LICENSE AND MAINTENANCE CONTRACT BASED ON THE RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE OF EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. SOFTWARE LICENSE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE MAINTENANCE PERIOD, WHICH IS THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE CONTRACT, AS A TIME-BASED MEASURE OF PROGRESS BEST REFLECTS OUR PERFORMANCE IN SATISFYING THIS OBLIGATION. UNSPECIFIED RIGHTS TO SOFTWARE UPGRADES ARE TYPICALLY SOLD AS PART OF THE MAINTENANCE CONTRACT ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS.  OUR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPRISED OF A COMBINATION OF INSTRUMENTS, INSTALLATION OR OTHER START-UP SERVICES, AND/OR SOFTWARE, AND/OR SUPPORT OR SERVICES. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ELEMENTS ARE TYPICALLY DELIVERED AT THE SAME TIME AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN CONTROL PASSES TO THE CUSTOMER. SERVICE REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE CONTRACTUAL PERIOD OR AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. OUR ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY PROVISIONS FOR CANCELLATION, TERMINATION, OR REFUNDS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT RECOGNIZED REVENUE.  FOR CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, WE ALLOCATE THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON RELATIVE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES AND RECOGNIZE THE RELATED REVENUE WHEN OR AS CONTROL OF EACH INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. WE ESTIMATE THE STANDALONE SELLING PRICE BY CALCULATING THE AVERAGE HISTORICAL SELLING PRICE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PER COUNTRY FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICES (SSP) ARE DETERMINED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION FOR EACH DISTINCT GOOD OR SERVICE IN THE CONTRACT AND THEN WE ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE IN PROPORTION TO THOSE STANDALONE SELLING PRICES BY PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REVENUE RELATE TO LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. STANDALONE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF ASC 606 AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 840, LEASES. EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS IS EVALUATED AS A LEASE ARRANGEMENT, EITHER AS AN OPERATING LEASE OR A SALES-TYPE CAPITAL LEASE USING THE CURRENT LEASE CLASSIFICATION GUIDANCE.  ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.  WE MUST MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS OCCUR IN THE CALCULATION OF TAX CREDITS, BENEFITS AND DEDUCTIONS, AND IN THE CALCULATION OF CERTAIN TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHICH ARISE FROM DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND EXPENSE FOR TAX AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, AS WELL AS INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THESE ESTIMATES MAY RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX PROVISION IN A SUBSEQUENT PERIOD. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE PROVIDE FOR INCOME TAXES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC COMPOSITION OF WORLDWIDE EARNINGS, TAX REGULATIONS GOVERNING EACH REGION, AVAILABILITY OF TAX CREDITS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES.  WE MONITOR THE CHANGES IN MANY FACTORS AND ADJUST OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE ON A TIMELY BASIS.  IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHETHER DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED IN FULL OR IN PART. WHEN IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT ALL OR SOME PORTION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS MAY NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE MUST BE ESTABLISHED AGAINST SUCH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EVIDENCE ON A JURISDICTION-BY-JURISDICTION BASIS WHEN ASSESSING WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE RECOVERABLE. WE CONSIDER EVIDENCE SUCH AS OUR PAST OPERATING RESULTS, THE EXISTENCE OF LOSSES IN RECENT YEARS AND OUR FORECAST OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME. AT JANUARY 31, 2019, WE CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR CERTAIN U.S. AND U.S STATE AND FOREIGN DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. WE INTEND TO MAINTAIN A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN THESE JURISDICTIONS UNTIL SUFFICIENT POSITIVE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUPPORT ITS REVERSAL.  THE CALCULATION OF OUR TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAW AND REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES PRESCRIBES THE USE OF A RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT MODEL, THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION HAS MET THOSE THRESHOLDS WILL CONTINUE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT BY MANAGEMENT. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, FOR ALL U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS, WE RECOGNIZE POTENTIAL LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES BASED ON OUR ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES AND INTEREST WILL BE DUE. THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF TAX UNCERTAINTIES MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT IS CURRENTLY ESTIMATED, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPACT ON INCOME TAX EXPENSE. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF INCOME TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, A FURTHER CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD BE REQUIRED. IF EVENTS OCCUR AND THE PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE UNNECESSARY, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN WE DETERMINE THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY. WE INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT WAS ENACTED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGES THE EXISTING U.S. TAX LAW AND INCLUDES NUMEROUS PROVISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE TRANSITION TAX EXPENSES AMOUNT. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE FURTHER GUIDANCE FROM FEDERAL AND STATE TAX AUTHORITIES ON ITS BUSINESS AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. ANY FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS DISCRETE INCOME TAX EXPENSE OR BENEFIT IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE DETERMINED. WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS AND ELECTED TO TREAT GILTI AS \u201cCURRENT PERIOD COST\u201d.  SEE NOTE 5, \"INCOME TAXES\" FOR MORE DETAILS.  ADOPTION OF NEW PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE NOTE 2, \u201cNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,\u201d TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  OUR REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, AND MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF OUR GLOBAL OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. THE UNFAVORABLE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAS DECREASED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY  2  PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  . WHEN MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUE IT WILL ALSO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES. WE CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES MOVEMENTS BY APPLYING THE ACTUAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE LAST MONTH OF EACH QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR TO BOTH THE APPLICABLE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR PERIODS. WE HEDGE REVENUES, EXPENSES AND BALANCE SHEET EXPOSURES THAT ARE NOT DENOMINATED IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES ON A SHORT TERM AND ANTICIPATED BASIS. WE DO EXPERIENCE SOME FLUCTUATIONS WITHIN INDIVIDUAL LINES OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND BALANCE SHEET BECAUSE OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS NOT DESIGNED TO OFFSET THE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS IN EACH CATEGORY OF REVENUES, EXPENSES, MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. OUR HEDGING PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO HEDGE CURRENCY MOVEMENTS ON A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BASIS (UP TO A ROLLING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD). THEREFORE, WE ARE EXPOSED TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE LONGER TERM. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY FOR ALL, OR PORTIONS, OF AN ACQUISITION PRICE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WE MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS TO REDUCE THE RISK THAT CURRENCY MOVEMENTS WILL IMPACT THE U.S. DOLLAR COST OF THE TRANSACTION.

THE RESTRUCTURING ALONG WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE NEW ACCOUNTING RULES UNDER ASU 2016-16, INTRA-ENTITY TRANSFER OF ASSETS ON NOVEMBER 1, 2018, RESULTED IN A  $299 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  , THE COMPANY'S INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $553 MILLION  WITH AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  237.3 PERCENT  .

IN OTHER MAJOR JURISDICTIONS WHERE THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS, THE TAX YEARS GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN BACK TO THE YEAR 2001. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K TO THE STATUS OF THE OPEN TAX YEARS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS DUE TO EITHER THE EXPIRATION OF A STATUTE OF LIMITATION OR A TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF YEARS AND NUMEROUS MATTERS THAT REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE CHANGES TO THE BALANCE OF OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS.  SEGMENT OVERVIEW  IN 2019, WE ADOPTED NEW GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COST.

FRANCHISE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN OUR OBLIGATIONS TO PREPARE THE FRANCHISEE FOR OPERATION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE.  \u2022  AREA DEVELOPER (\"AD\") FEES:  OUR FEES FOR AD AREAS VARY BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE REVENUE POTENTIAL OF EACH AD AREA AND ALSO DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF ANY EXISTING FRANCHISEES WITHIN THE AD AREA BEING SOLD.  OUR ADS GENERALLY RECEIVE 50% OF FRANCHISE FEES, ROYALTIES, AND A PORTION OF THE INTEREST INCOME DERIVED FROM TERRITORIES LOCATED  35  IN THEIR AREA. AD FEES RECEIVED ARE RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE INITIAL CONTRACT TERM OF EACH AD AGREEMENT.  \u2022  ROYALTIES:  OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE FRANCHISEES TO PAY US A BASE ROYALTY TYPICALLY EQUAL TO 14% OF THE FRANCHISEES' TAX PREPARATION REVENUE, GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SPECIFIED MINIMUMS.  \u2022  ADVERTISING FEES:  OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE ALL FRANCHISEES TO PAY US AN ADVERTISING FEE OF 5% OF THE FRANCHISEES' TAX PREPARATION REVENUE, WHICH WE USE PRIMARILY TO FUND COLLECTIVE ADVERTISING EFFORTS.  \u2022  FINANCIAL PRODUCTS:  WE OFFER TWO TYPES OF TAX SETTLEMENT FINANCIAL PRODUCTS: REFUND TRANSFER PRODUCTS, WHICH INVOLVE PROVIDING A MEANS BY WHICH A CUSTOMER MAY RECEIVE HIS OR HER REFUND MORE QUICKLY AND CONVENIENTLY, AND REFUND-BASED LOANS. WE EARN FEES FROM THE ARRANGING OF THE SALE OF THESE FINANCIAL PRODUCTS.  \u2022  INTEREST INCOME:  WE EARN INTEREST INCOME FROM OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS RELATED TO BOTH INDEBTEDNESS FOR THE UNPAID PORTIONS OF THEIR FRANCHISE AND AD FEES, AND FOR OTHER LOANS WE EXTEND TO OUR FRANCHISEES RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF THEIR TERRITORIES. WE ALSO EARN INTEREST ON OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  \u2022  ASSISTED TAX PREPARATION FEES:  WE EARN TAX PREPARATION FEES, NET OF DISCOUNTS, DIRECTLY FROM THE OPERATION OF COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA.  \u2022  ELECTRONIC FILING FEES:  WE EARN FEES FOR THE ELECTRONIC FILING OF FEDERAL RETURNS PREPARED IN U.S. FRANCHISEE OWNED OFFICES. EACH LOCATION DETERMINES IF THEY WANT TO CHARGE AN ELECTRONIC FILING FEE.  WE OPERATE COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IF THESE OFFICES REMAIN UNSOLD AT THE START OF A TAX SEASON WE WILL OPERATE THEM FOR THE TAX SEASON WITH THE INTENT OF SELLING THEM TO QUALIFIED FRANCHISEES THE NEXT YEAR, AND, AS A RESULT, THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES WILL VARY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. GOING FORWARD, THE NUMBER OF COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES MAY INCREASE IF THE COMPANY REACQUIRES MORE OFFICES FROM EXISTING FRANCHISEES AND DOES NOT FIND A SUITABLE BUYER TO TAKE OVER THE OFFICE.   DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY CLOSED COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES AS PART OF ITS RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES. THE COMPANY INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $9.3 MILLION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.

FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , TOTAL REVENUES DECREASED  $17.4 MILLION  , OR  27%  , TO  $46.8 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $64.2 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A DECREASE OF $8.4 MILLION IN FINANCIAL PRODUCTS RELATED TO BANK FEES REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME IN FISCAL 2019 AND AS OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO CONTRACTUAL CHANGES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606 AND A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF TAX RETURNS FILED BY OUR FRANCHISEES;  \u2022  A $2.8 MILLION DECREASE IN ASSISTED TAX PREPARATION FEES DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES;  \u2022  A $2.4 MILLION REDUCTION IN ELECTRONIC FILING FEES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECORDING OF  FRANCHISEE REBATES AS A DEDUCTION OF REVENUE INSTEAD OF EXPENSE DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606;  \u2022  A DECREASE OF $2.3 MILLION IN OTHER REVENUES DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES AND RELATED TO GAINS RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018 ON AD AND FRANCHISEE ACQUISITIONS WHERE THE CONSIDERATION WAS LESS THAN THE VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED ASSET;  37  \u2022  A DECREASE OF $1.8 MILLION IN INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO A REDUCTION IN WORKING CAPITAL LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN THE LOANS DUE FROM REACQUIRED ADS AND FRANCHISEES;  \u2022  A REDUCTION OF $1.5 MILLION IN ROYALTIES AND ADVERTISING FEES DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF TAX RETURNS FILED BY OUR FRANCHISEES; AND  \u2022  AN INCREASE OF $1.7 MILLION IN FRANCHISE AND AD FEES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE NET OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A $1.3 MILLION INCREASE IN ADVERTISING EXPENSES MAINLY DUE TO THE TIMING AND CATEGORIZING OF SPENDING;  \u2022  A $1.8 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SEVERANCE COSTS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES; AND  \u2022  A $16.1 MILLION DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO BANK FEE AND REBATE EXPENSES REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME IN FISCAL 2019 AND AS OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO CONTRACTUAL CHANGES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606, COST REDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES AND REDUCED BAD DEBT EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FEWER FRANCHISEE TERMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EXPENSES DUE TO AUDIT AND LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2019 SEC FILINGS.  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES WERE  $92.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $100.6 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, REPRESENTING A DECREASE OF  $8.6 MILLION  , OR  9%  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE NET OF THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A $6.0 MILLION INCREASE IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES RELATED TO COMPANY-STORE EXIT COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CONTRACT TERMINATION RECORDED IN FISCAL 2018;  \u2022  A $1.8 MILLION INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE MAINLY DUE TO ASSETS PUT INTO SERVICE;  \u2022  A $2.5 MILLION DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SEVERANCE COSTS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES; AND  38  \u2022  A $13.5 MILLION DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO BANK FEE AND REBATE EXPENSES REPORTED AS A REDUCTION OF INCOME IN FISCAL 2019 AND AS OPERATING EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO CONTRACTUAL CHANGES AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASC 606, COST REDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF U.S. COMPANY-OWNED STORES AND THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR YEAR-ROUND ACCOUNTING OFFICES AND REDUCED BAD DEBT EXPENSE RESULTING FROM FEWER FRANCHISEE TERMINATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EXPENSES DUE TO AUDIT AND LEGAL COSTS RELATED TO FISCAL 2018 AND FISCAL 2019 SEC FILINGS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT.  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX BENEFITS (EXPENSE) WITH EFFECTIVE RATES OF  182.0%  AND  31.3%  DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY AND (  57.4%  ) AND  35.7%  FOR THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE EXPECT ANY LOSSES THAT WE INCUR THROUGH THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR WILL BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE RESULTS OF THE LAST FOUR MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  39  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW OF FACTORS AFFECTING OUR LIQUIDITY  SEASONALITY OF CASH FLOW.  OUR TAX RETURN PREPARATION BUSINESS IS SEASONAL, AND MOST OF OUR REVENUES AND CASH FLOW ARE GENERATED DURING THE PERIOD FROM LATE JANUARY THROUGH APRIL 30. FOLLOWING EACH TAX SEASON, FROM MAY 1 THROUGH LATE JANUARY OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR, WE RELY SIGNIFICANTLY ON EXCESS OPERATING CASH FLOW FROM THE PREVIOUS SEASON, FROM CASH PAYMENTS MADE BY FRANCHISEES AND ADS WHO PURCHASE NEW TERRITORIES AND AREAS PRIOR TO THE NEXT TAX SEASON, AND ON THE USE OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATING EXPENSES AND INVEST IN THE FUTURE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. OUR BUSINESS HAS HISTORICALLY GENERATED A STRONG CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.  WE DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CASH RESOURCES DURING THE OFF SEASON TO FINANCE THE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR FRANCHISEES, AND EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE.  CREDIT FACILITY.  OUR AMENDED CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTS OF A $21.2 MILLION TERM LOAN AND A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT CURRENTLY ALLOWS BORROWING OF UP TO $170.0 MILLION  WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE THAT PERMITS THE COMPANY TO REQUEST AN INCREASE IN AVAILABILITY OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION.  UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF COVENANTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY RESTRICT HOW WE CARRY OUT OUR BUSINESS, OR THAT REQUIRE US TO MEET CERTAIN PERIODIC TESTS IN THE FORM OF FINANCIAL COVENANTS. THE RESTRICTIONS WE CONSIDER TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR ONGOING BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  WE MUST SATISFY A \"LEVERAGE RATIO\" TEST THAT IS BASED ON OUR OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER.  \u2022  WE MUST SATISFY A \"FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO\" TEST AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER.  \u2022  WE MUST REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE UNDER OUR REVOLVING LOAN TO ZERO FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST 45 CONSECUTIVE DAYS EACH FISCAL YEAR.  \u2022  WE MUST ALSO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM NET WORTH REQUIREMENT, MEASURED AT APRIL 30 OF EACH YEAR.  OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS CUSTOMARY AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING LIMITATIONS ON INDEBTEDNESS, LIMITATIONS ON LIENS AND NEGATIVE PLEDGES, LIMITATIONS ON INVESTMENTS, LOANS AND ACQUISITIONS, LIMITATIONS ON MERGERS, CONSOLIDATIONS, LIQUIDATIONS AND DISSOLUTIONS, LIMITATIONS ON SALES OF ASSETS, LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN RESTRICTED PAYMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES, AMONG OTHERS.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019.  FRANCHISEE LENDING AND POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS.  A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR CASH FLOW DURING THE YEAR IS UTILIZED TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO OUR FRANCHISEES. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR TOTAL BALANCE OF LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS, REPRESENTING CASH AMOUNTS WE HAD ADVANCED TO THE FRANCHISEES AND ADS, WAS $56.1 MILLION. IN ADDITION, AT THAT DATE, OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS TOGETHER OWED US AN ADDITIONAL $90.5 MILLION, NET OF UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE OF $8.1 MILLION, FOR AMOUNTS REPRESENTING THE UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE FOR FRANCHISE TERRITORIES OR AREAS COMPRISING CLUSTERS OF TERRITORIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS OWED TO US FOR ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS FOR WHICH OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS HAD OUTSTANDING PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A BREAKDOWN OF OUR POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS.  (IN MILLIONS)  AT JANUARY 31, 2019  LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND EQUIPMENT LOANS  $56.1  UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE OF FRANCHISE TERRITORIES, ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS, GROSS  98.6  UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE  (8.1  )  UNPAID PURCHASE PRICE OF FRANCHISE TERRITORIES, ROYALTIES AND OTHER AMOUNTS, NET  90.5  BOOK BALANCE OF AMOUNTS DUE  146.6  AD SHARE OF ROYALTIES AND FRANCHISE FEES  (9.8  )  EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL CREDIT LOSS  $136.8  OUR FRANCHISEES MAKE ELECTRONIC RETURN FILINGS FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS UTILIZING OUR SYSTEMS. OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS ALLOW US TO OBTAIN REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS DUE TO US FROM OUR FRANCHISEES THROUGH AN ELECTRONIC FEE INTERCEPT PROGRAM BEFORE OUR FRANCHISEES RECEIVE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM TAX PREPARATION AND OTHER FEES THEY HAVE CHARGED TO THEIR CUSTOMERS ON TAX RETURNS ASSOCIATED WITH TAX SETTLEMENT PRODUCTS. THEREFORE, WE ARE ABLE TO MINIMIZE THE NONPAYMENT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS  40  OUTSTANDING FROM FRANCHISEES BY OBTAINING DIRECT ELECTRONIC PAYMENT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE THROUGHOUT THE TAX SEASON. OUR CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING TO ADS IS ALSO MITIGATED BY OUR ELECTRONIC FEE INTERCEPT PROGRAM, WHICH ENABLES US TO RETAIN REPAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE FLOW THROUGH TO ADS AS THEIR SHARE OF FRANCHISE FEE AND ROYALTY PAYMENTS, TO THE EXTENT OF AN AD'S INDEBTEDNESS TO US.  THE UNPAID AMOUNTS OWED TO US FROM OUR ADS AND FRANCHISEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE OR AREA AND, WHEN THE FRANCHISE OR AREA OWNER IS AN ENTITY, ARE GENERALLY GUARANTEED BY THE RELATED OWNERS OF THE RESPECTIVE ENTITY. ACCORDINGLY, TO THE EXTENT A FRANCHISEE OR AD DOES NOT SATISFY ITS PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO US, WE MAY REPOSSESS THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE OR AREA IN ORDER TO RESELL IT IN THE FUTURE. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD AN INVESTMENT IN IMPAIRED ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AND RELATED INTEREST RECEIVABLE OF APPROXIMATELY  $21.7 MILLION  . WE CONSIDER ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE TO BE IMPAIRED IF THE AMOUNTS DUE EXCEED THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE AND ESTIMATE AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THAT EXCESS. AMOUNTS DUE INCLUDE THE RECORDED VALUE OF THE ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE REDUCED BY THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTED INTEREST, AMOUNTS DUE TO ADS FOR THEIR PORTION OF FRANCHISEE RECEIVABLES, ANY RELATED UNRECOGNIZED REVENUE AND AMOUNTS OWED TO THE FRANCHISEE OR AD BY US. IN ESTABLISHING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING FRANCHISE, WE CONSIDER NET FEES OF OPEN TERRITORIES AND THE NUMBER OF UNOPENED TERRITORIES. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAVE RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR IMPAIRED ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE OF  $10.3 MILLION  . THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL FRANCHISEE OR AD AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  .  WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  IS ADEQUATE FOR OUR EXISTING LOSS EXPOSURE. WE CLOSELY MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS AND WILL ADJUST OUR ALLOWANCES AS APPROPRIATE IF WE DETERMINE THE EXISTING ALLOWANCES ARE INADEQUATE TO COVER ESTIMATED LOSSES.  DIVIDENDS  .   BEGINNING IN APRIL 2015 THROUGH JULY 2018, WE ANNOUNCED A $0.16 PER SHARE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND. WE HAVE NOT DECLARED A DIVIDEND SINCE JULY 2018 AND MAY NOT CONTINUE TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE. THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ON OUR EARNINGS, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL ALSO BE SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT ARE CONTAINED IN OUR CREDIT FACILITY AND MAY BE RESTRICTED BY ANY FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS THAT WE INCUR OR ISSUANCES OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, APPLICABLE LAW REQUIRES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO DETERMINE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SURPLUS PRIOR TO THE DECLARATION OF DIVIDENDS. WE CANNOT PROVIDE AN ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PAY DIVIDENDS AT ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL OR AT ALL.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE USED  $0.5 MILLION  MORE CASH IN OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018. THE CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IS RELATIVELY FLAT DUE TO A LARGER NET LOSS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NON-CASH EXPENSES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE UTILIZED  $7.7 MILLION  LESS CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . THIS DECREASE IS LARGELY DUE TO A $3.5 MILLION REDUCTION IN NET CASH USED FOR THE ISSUANCE OF OPERATING LOANS TO FRANCHISEES AND ADS, NET OF REPAYMENTS, $2.2 MILLION LESS IN THE PURCHASES OF AD RIGHTS, COMPANY-OWNED OFFICES AND ACQUIRED CUSTOMER LISTS, AND $1.2 MILLION LESS IN THE PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  IN THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED  $8.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  . THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION OF $12.3 MILLION IN NET BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4.4 MILLION DECREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  FUTURE CASH NEEDS AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  OPERATING CASH FLOW NEEDS.  WE BELIEVE OUR CREDIT FACILITY ENTERED INTO ON APRIL 30, 2012, AS AMENDED, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR CASH FLOW NEEDS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , USING THE LEVERAGE RATIO APPLICABLE UNDER OUR LOAN COVENANTS AT THE END OF THE QUARTER, OUR MAXIMUM UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY WAS  $46.4 MILLION  . WE ARE CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATIONS ON A NEW CREDIT FACILITY TO REPLACE OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITY WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 30, 2019.  OUR CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CONTAINS A REQUIREMENT THAT WE REDUCE THE BALANCE OF OUR REVOLVING LOAN TO ZERO FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST 45 CONSECUTIVE DAYS EACH FISCAL YEAR; HOWEVER, BECAUSE OUR TERM LOAN WILL REMAIN OUTSTANDING DURING THAT 45 DAY PERIOD, AND GIVEN OUR HISTORIC CASH FLOW EXPERIENCE AT THE END OF AND BEGINNING OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE UNAVAILABILITY OF OUR REVOLVING LOAN DURING THAT 45 DAY PERIOD EACH FISCAL YEAR WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW. AS OF JUNE 14,  2018  , WE HAD MAINTAINED A ZERO BALANCE ON OUR REVOLVER FOR THE REQUIRED 45 DAYS AND THUS HAVE ALREADY MET THE REQUIREMENT FOR FISCAL  2019.  41  SEVERAL FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR CASH FLOW IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE DELAY BY THE IRS TO ISSUE REFUNDS TO TAXPAYERS WHO CLAIM THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT OR THE CHILD TAX CREDIT;  \u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE EXTEND OPERATING FINANCING TO OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS AND THE EXTENT THAT OUR FRANCHISEES AND ADS REPAY THEIR NOTES TO US;  \u2022  THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES;  \u2022  THE CASH FLOW EFFECT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ENGAGE IN STOCK REPURCHASES;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FEES AND OTHER INCOME RELATED TO TAX SETTLEMENT PRODUCTS IN LIGHT OF REGULATORY PRESSURES ON US AND OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS;  \u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE AD AREAS, WHICH WILL INVOLVE THE USE OF CASH IN THE SHORT-TERM, BUT IMPROVE CASH RECEIPTS IN FUTURE PERIODS FROM WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE AD'S SHARE OF ROYALTIES AND FRANCHISE FEES;  \u2022  THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE REPURCHASE CERTAIN ASSETS FROM FRANCHISEES AND THIRD PARTIES AND OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE THESE ASSETS PROFITABLY;  \u2022  THE EXTENT, IF ANY, TO WHICH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ELECTS TO CONTINUE TO DECLARE CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK;  \u2022  THE EXTENT AND TIMING OF PAYMENTS RELATED TO LITIGATION SETTLEMENTS; AND  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO A NEW CREDIT FACILITY PRIOR TO THE MATURITY OF OUR CURRENT FACILITY ON APRIL 30, 2019.  EFFECT OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY COVENANTS ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  OUR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH MATURES ON APRIL 30, 2019, IMPOSES SEVERAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS, INCLUDING A COVENANT THAT REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A LEVERAGE RATIO OF NOT MORE THAN 5.5:1 AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER ENDING JANUARY 31 AND A LEVERAGE RATIO OF NOT MORE THAN 3.0:1 AT THE END OF EACH OTHER FISCAL QUARTER. THE HIGHER PERMITTED LEVERAGE RATIO AT THE END OF THE JANUARY 31 QUARTER REFLECTS THE FACT THAT AS OF THAT DATE, WE HAVE TYPICALLY EXTENDED SIGNIFICANT CREDIT TO OUR FRANCHISEES FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER NEEDS THAT IS NOT REFLECTED IN REPAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM OUR FRANCHISEES UNTIL THE PERIOD BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY EACH YEAR.  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR LEVERAGE RATIO WAS  3.9:1.  WE CONTINUE TO BE OBLIGATED UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY TO SATISFY A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO TEST, WHICH REQUIRES THAT RATIO TO BE NOT LESS THAN 1.50:1 AT THE END OF EVERY FISCAL QUARTER. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS  2.0:1.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE RATIO TESTS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  .  WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE OUR CASH FLOW AND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE TERM OF THAT FACILITY.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE REPORT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP; HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT (\"EBITDA\") AND OTHER NON-GAAP RESULTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED, IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE FOR, NET LOSS, AS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  WE CONSIDER OUR NON-GAAP CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS TO BE A USEFUL METRIC FOR MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS WITH PRIOR PERIODS.  BECAUSE NOT ALL COMPANIES USE THE SAME CALCULATIONS, OUR DEFINITION OF EBITDA MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED FIGURES FROM OTHER COMPANIES.  IN ADDITION, WHEN EVALUATING NON-GAAP RESULTS, WE EXCLUDE CERTAIN ITEMS THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE PART OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.  DESCRIPTIONS OF THE ITEMS WHICH ARE EXCLUDED ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS, INCLUDING STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:  WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CASH AND NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, RELATED THIRD-PARTY EXPENSES AND PERQUISITES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT WITH EXECUTIVES OF THE COMPANY.  \u2022  COMPLIANCE TASK FORCE AND RELATED COSTS:  WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THIRD-PARTY EXPENSES WE INCUR RELATED TO OUR COMPLIANCE TASK FORCE. THESE EXPENSES INCLUDE PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES.  42  \u2022  RESTRUCTURING EXPENSE:  WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CASH AND NON-CASH EXPENSES OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES. THESE EXPENSES INCLUDE PROPERTY AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS AND EXIT COSTS.  \u2022  EXECUTIVE RECRUITMENT COSTS:  WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ONE-TIME COSTS INCURRED TO RECRUIT AND HIRE NEW EXECUTIVES.  \u2022  SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION COSTS:  WE EXCLUDE FROM OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ONE-TIME COSTS INCURRED RELATED TO SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION.

SEASONALITY OF OPERATIONS  GIVEN THE SEASONAL NATURE OF THE TAX RETURN PREPARATION BUSINESS, WE HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE MOST OF OUR CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 1 THROUGH APRIL 30 OF EACH YEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, IN FISCAL  2018  WE EARNED 28% OF OUR ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DURING OUR FISCAL THIRD QUARTER ENDED JANUARY 31 AND 91% OF OUR ANNUAL REVENUES DURING THE COMBINED FISCAL THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF  2018  . WE HISTORICALLY OPERATE AT A LOSS THROUGH THE FIRST EIGHT MONTHS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, DURING WHICH WE INCUR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING TAX SEASON.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE ARE A PARTY TO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE FLUCTUATIONS IN CASH FLOW RESULTING FROM CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATE ON OUR VARIABLE RATE MORTGAGE. THIS SWAP EFFECTIVELY CHANGES THE VARIABLE-RATE OF OUR MORTGAGE INTO A FIXED RATE OF 4.12%. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR INTEREST RATE SWAP WAS AN ASSET OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.

SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING  STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES, AND OTHER FACTORS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR  ACHIEVEMENTS OF BRIDGFORD FOODS CORPORATION TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED  OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. SUCH FACTORS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE FOLLOWING: GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS  CONDITIONS; THE IMPACT OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND PRICING; SUCCESS OF OPERATING INITIATIVES; DEVELOPMENT AND OPERATING COSTS;  ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL EFFORTS; ADVERSE PUBLICITY; ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS; CONSUMER TRIAL AND FREQUENCY; CHANGES  IN BUSINESS STRATEGY OR DEVELOPMENT PLANS; AVAILABILITY, TERMS AND DEPLOYMENT OF CAPITAL; AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL;  COMMODITY, LABOR, AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS; CHANGES IN, OR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH, GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; WEATHER CONDITIONS;  CONSTRUCTION SCHEDULES; AND OTHER FACTORS REFERENCED IN THIS REPORT. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO BUDGETING, MARKETING, AND OTHER MANAGEMENT  DECISIONS ARE SUBJECTIVE IN MANY RESPECTS AND THUS SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTERPRETATIONS AND PERIODIC REVISIONS BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE  AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH MAY CAUSE US TO ALTER OUR MARKETING, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE OR OTHER BUDGETS, WHICH  MAY IN TURN AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. THE READER IS THEREFORE CAUTIONED NOT  TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN AND TO CONSIDER OTHER RISKS DETAILED MORE FULLY IN OUR  ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2018 (THE \u201cANNUAL REPORT\u201d). WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION  TO PUBLICLY RELEASE THE RESULT OF ANY REVISIONS TO THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHICH MAY BE MADE TO REFLECT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES  AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, OR TO REFLECT THE OCCURRENCE OF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE  UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS  AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED REVENUES  AND EXPENSES DURING THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING PERIODS. SOME OF THE ESTIMATES NEEDED TO BE MADE BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE THE ALLOWANCE  FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, PROMOTIONAL AND RETURNS ALLOWANCES, INVENTORY RESERVES, THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT,  AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD MATERIALLY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS TO RECORD BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE VIEW AS REASONABLE UNDER  THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT AVAILABLE INFORMATION. THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS FORM THE BASIS FOR OUR CONCLUSION  AS TO THE VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER INDEPENDENT SOURCES. AMOUNTS ESTIMATED RELATED  TO LIABILITIES FOR SELF-INSURED WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE HEALTHCARE AND PENSION BENEFITS ARE ESPECIALLY SUBJECT TO  INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND THESE ESTIMATED LIABILITIES MAY ULTIMATELY SETTLE AT AMOUNTS WHICH VARY FROM OUR CURRENT ESTIMATES.  CURRENT  ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRE THAT OUR PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATION BE MEASURED USING AN INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN (\u201cIRR\u201d)  ANALYSIS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DISCOUNT RATE SELECTION PROCESS. THE IRR CALCULATION FOR THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF BRIDGFORD  FOODS CORPORATION IS MEASURED ANNUALLY AND BASED ON THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE. THE CITIGROUP PENSION DISCOUNT RATE AS  OF JANUARY 31, 2019 WAS 4.07% AS COMPARED TO 4.30% AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2018. THE DISCOUNT RATE APPLIED CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT  THE VALUE OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS WELL AS THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.  OUR  CREDIT RISK IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. LOSSES DUE TO CREDIT RISK HAVE RECENTLY BEEN  IMMATERIAL. THE PROVISION FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IS BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT COLLECTION RISK. WE HAVE  SIGNIFICANT RECEIVABLES WITH A FEW LARGE, WELL KNOWN CUSTOMERS WHICH, ALTHOUGH HISTORICALLY SECURE, COULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL  RISK SHOULD THESE CUSTOMERS\u2019 OPERATIONS SUDDENLY DETERIORATE. WE MONITOR THESE CUSTOMERS CLOSELY TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF  LOSS.  11  OF 20  THE  TABLE BELOW SHOWS CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 20% OF CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cAR\u201d) OR 10% OF  CONSOLIDATED SALES FOR THE TWELVE WEEKS ENDED JANUARY 25, 2019 AND JANUARY 26, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.

SALES  ARE RECOGNIZED UPON PASSAGE OF TITLE TO THE CUSTOMER, TYPICALLY UPON PRODUCT PICK-UP, SHIPMENT OR DELIVERY TO CUSTOMERS. PRODUCTS  ARE DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OWN LONG-HAUL FLEET OR THROUGH OUR OWN DIRECT STORE DELIVERY SYSTEM.  WE  RECORD THE CASH SURRENDER OR CONTRACT VALUE FOR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID IN DETERMINING THE EXPENSE  OR INCOME TO BE RECOGNIZED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR THE PERIOD.  WE  PROVIDE TAX RESERVES FOR FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL EXPOSURES RELATING TO AUDIT RESULTS, TAX PLANNING INITIATIVES  AND COMPLIANCE RESPONSIBILITIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE RESERVES REQUIRES JUDGMENTS ABOUT TAX ISSUES, POTENTIAL OUTCOMES AND  TIMING, AND IS A SUBJECTIVE ESTIMATE. ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME OF THESE TAX AUDITS IS UNCERTAIN, IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S OPINION ADEQUATE  PROVISIONS FOR INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR POTENTIAL LIABILITIES, IF ANY, RESULTING FROM THESE REVIEWS. ACTUAL OUTCOMES MAY  DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  WE  ASSESS THE RECOVERABILITY OF OUR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS OR WHENEVER ADVERSE EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  OR BUSINESS CLIMATE INDICATE THAT EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO SUCH LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT  TO SUPPORT THE NET BOOK VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. IF UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THE RECORDED ASSETS, WE  RECOGNIZE AN IMPAIRMENT TO REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE APPLICABLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE.  WE  PARTICIPATE IN \u201cMULTIEMPLOYER\u201d PENSION PLANS ADMINISTERED BY LABOR UNIONS ON BEHALF OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. WE PAY MONTHLY  CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNION TRUST FUNDS, A PORTION OF WHICH IS USED TO FUND PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. THE CONTRIBUTION  AMOUNT MAY CHANGE DEPENDING UPON THE ABILITY OF PARTICIPATING COMPANIES TO FUND THESE PENSION LIABILITIES AS WELL AS THE ACTUAL  AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS. SHOULD WE WITHDRAW FROM THE UNION AND CEASE PARTICIPATION IN A UNION PLAN, FEDERAL  LAW COULD IMPOSE A PENALTY FOR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN. THE PENALTY WOULD BE RECORDED AS AN EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OF THE WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY IS DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING THE FUNDED  STATUS OF THE PLAN AND CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY OTHER PARTICIPATING COMPANIES.  IN  MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS AMENDED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT (COLLECTIVELY,  THE \u201cPPACA\u201d), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. REQUIREMENTS OF THE LAW INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF THE LIFETIME LIMITS ON ACTIVE AND  RETIREE MEDICAL COVERAGE, EXPANDING DEPENDENT COVERAGE TO AGE 26 AND ELIMINATION OF PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS THAT MAY IMPACT OTHER  POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS COSTS. IN ADDITION, THE PPACA INCLUDES POTENTIAL EXCISE TAX ON THE VALUE OF BENEFITS THAT EXCEED A PRE-DEFINED  LIMIT WHICH MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN BENEFIT PLAN LEVELS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THIS ADDITIONAL COST. FINALLY, THE PPACA INCLUDES  PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO OFFER HEALTH BENEFITS TO ALL FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (DEFINED AS 30 HOURS PER WEEK). THE HEALTH  COVERAGE MUST MEET MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE ACTUARIAL VALUE OF THE BENEFITS OFFERED AND EMPLOYEE AFFORDABILITY. BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION  AND CONGRESS HAVE MADE RECENT ATTEMPTS TO REPLACE PPACA WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SYSTEM. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT  CHANGES IN THE RULES THAT COMPEL AN EMPLOYER SUCH AS BRIDGFORD FOODS TO OFFER AFFORDABLE COVERAGE TO ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES. THE  RECENT TAX LAW CHANGES REMOVED THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PROVISION THAT IS INCLUDED IN PPACA AND REQUIRES ALL INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE  HEALTH INSURANCE OR PAY A PENALTY. DESPITE THIS CHANGE, THE RECENT TAX CHANGES DID NOT ADJUST OR REMOVE THE EMPLOYER MANDATE.  WE CANNOT ANTICIPATE FURTHER CHANGES AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE BELIEVE THAT CURRENT PLANS MEET THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS. WE WILL  CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE ACCOUNTING IMPLICATIONS OF THE PPACA AND ITS IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AS MORE LEGISLATIVE AND INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE POTENTIAL FUTURE EFFECTS AND COST OF COMPLYING WITH THE PROVISIONS  OF THE PPACA ARE NOT DETERMINABLE AT THIS TIME  OVERVIEW  OF REPORTING SEGMENTS  WE  OPERATE IN TWO BUSINESS SEGMENTS \u2013 THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS (THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT),  AND THE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION OF SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS (THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT). FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE SEPARATE  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS REFER TO NOTE 4 OF THE NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. WE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE AN EXTENSIVE LINE OF FOOD PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BISCUITS, BREAD DOUGH ITEMS,  ROLL DOUGH ITEMS, DRY SAUSAGE PRODUCTS AND BEEF JERKY.  12  OF 20  FROZEN  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY MANUFACTURES AND DISTRIBUTES BISCUITS, BREAD DOUGH ITEMS, ROLL DOUGH ITEMS AND SHELF STABLE  SANDWICHES. ALL ITEMS WITHIN THIS SEGMENT ARE CONSIDERED SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED AT THIS LEVEL. OUR FROZEN FOOD  BUSINESS COVERS THE UNITED STATES. PRODUCTS PRODUCED BY THE FROZEN FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE GENERALLY SUPPLIED TO FOOD SERVICE  AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTORS WHO TAKE TITLE TO THE PRODUCT UPON SHIPMENT RECEIPT THROUGH COMPANY LEASED LONG-HAUL VEHICLES. IN ADDITION  TO REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS, WE MAINTAIN A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT FOOD SERVICE AND RETAIL BROKERS COVERING MOST OF THE UNITED STATES.  BROKERS ARE COMPENSATED ON A COMMISSION BASIS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR BROKER RELATIONSHIPS, IN CLOSE COOPERATION WITH OUR REGIONAL  SALES MANAGERS, ARE A VALUABLE ASSET PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW PRODUCT AND CUSTOMER OPPORTUNITIES. REGIONAL SALES MANAGERS PERFORM  SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONS FOR US, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING AND DEVELOPING NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES AND PROVIDING CUSTOMER SERVICE  AND SUPPORT TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS AND END PURCHASERS THROUGH THE EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR BROKER NETWORK.  SNACK  FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT  OUR  SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTES PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY US. ALL ITEMS WITHIN THIS SEGMENT ARE CONSIDERED SIMILAR  PRODUCTS AND HAVE BEEN AGGREGATED AT THIS LEVEL. THE DRY SAUSAGE DIVISION INCLUDES PRODUCTS SUCH AS JERKY, MEAT SNACKS, SAUSAGE  AND PEPPERONI PRODUCTS. OUR SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT SELLS APPROXIMATELY 120 DIFFERENT ITEMS THROUGH A DIRECT STORE DELIVERY  NETWORK SERVING APPROXIMATELY 17,000 SUPERMARKETS, MASS MERCHANDISE AND CONVENIENCE RETAIL STORES LOCATED IN 48 STATES. THESE  CUSTOMERS ARE COMPRISED OF LARGE RETAIL CHAINS AND SMALLER \u201cINDEPENDENT\u201d OPERATORS.  PRODUCTS  PRODUCED OR DISTRIBUTED BY THE SNACK FOOD PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE SUPPLIED TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH EITHER DIRECT-STORE-DELIVERY OR DIRECT  DELIVERY TO CUSTOMER WAREHOUSES. PRODUCT DELIVERED USING THE COMPANY-OWNED FLEET DIRECT TO THE STORE IS CONSIDERED A DIRECT-STORE-DELIVERY.  IN THIS CASE, WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE OF SETTING UP AND MAINTAINING THE DISPLAY AND STOCKING OUR PRODUCTS. PRODUCTS DELIVERED TO  CUSTOMER WAREHOUSES ARE DISTRIBUTED TO THE RETAIL STORE AND STOCKED BY THE CUSTOMER WHERE IT IS THEN RESOLD TO THE END CONSUMER.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS FOR THE TWELVE-WEEKS ENDED JANUARY 25, 2019 AND JANUARY 26, 2018  NET  SALES-CONSOLIDATED  NET  SALES INCREASED BY $3,849 (9.3%) TO $45,041 IN THE FIRST TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD OF THE 2019 FISCAL YEAR COMPARED TO THE SAME TWELVE-WEEK  PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN VOLUME FOR OUR SHELF-STABLE  SANDWICH BUSINESS TO INSTITUTIONAL AND RETAIL CUSTOMERS. OTHER INSTITUTIONAL FROZEN FOOD PRODUCT SALES, INCLUDING SHEET DOUGH  AND ROLLS, INCREASED 4% BY VOLUME WHILE RETAIL SALES VOLUME DECREASED 14%.

THE NET INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER NET  INCOME OF $1,876 AND LIQUIDATION OF INVENTORY OF $1,649 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $2,284 AND  PAYMENTS FOR ESTIMATED INCOME TAXES OF $3. DURING THE TWELVE-WEEK PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 25, 2019, WE DID NOT CONTRIBUTE  FUNDS TOWARDS OUR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN.

THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  31  A DECREASE OF $11.2 MILLION IN SALES OF OUR 5410/5430 RECONFIGURABLE SWITCHING SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD AND GROSS PROFIT  PRODUCT COST OF GOODS SOLD CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF AMOUNTS PAID TO THIRD-PARTY CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS, COMPONENT COSTS,  EMPLOYEE-RELATED COSTS AND OVERHEAD, SHIPPING AND LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING-RELATED OPERATIONS, WARRANTY  AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, ROYALTIES, LICENSE FEES, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, COST OF EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY  AND, WHEN APPLICABLE, ESTIMATED LOSSES ON COMMITTED CUSTOMER CONTRACTS.  SERVICES COST OF GOODS SOLD CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF DIRECT AND THIRD-PARTY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PROVISION OF SERVICES  INCLUDING INSTALLATION, DEPLOYMENT, MAINTENANCE SUPPORT, CONSULTING AND TRAINING ACTIVITIES AND, WHEN APPLICABLE, ESTIMATED  LOSSES ON COMMITTED CUSTOMER CONTRACTS. THE MAJORITY OF THESE COSTS RELATE TO PERSONNEL, INCLUDING EMPLOYEE AND THIRD-PARTY  CONTRACTOR-RELATED COSTS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR \u201cGROSS MARGIN,\u201d CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN  VIEWED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN FLUCTUATE AND BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DEPENDING UPON OUR REVENUE  CONCENTRATION WITHIN A PARTICULAR SEGMENT, PRODUCT LINE, GEOGRAPHY, OR CUSTOMER, INCLUDING OUR SUCCESS IN SELLING SOFTWARE IN A  PARTICULAR PERIOD. OUR GROSS MARGIN REMAINS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO DRIVE PRODUCT COST REDUCTIONS RELATIVE  TO THE PRICE EROSION THAT WE REGULARLY ENCOUNTER IN OUR MARKETS. MOREOVER, WE ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO COMPETE WITH AGGRESSIVE  PRICING AND COMMERCIAL TERMS AND, TO SECURE BUSINESS WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS, WE MAY AGREE TO PRICING OR OTHER  UNFAVORABLE COMMERCIAL TERMS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WHEN WE HAVE SUCCESS IN TAKING SHARE AND WINNING NEW  BUSINESS, IT CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGIN FROM THESE PRICING DYNAMICS AND THE EARLY STAGES OF THESE NETWORK  DEPLOYMENTS. EARLY STAGES OF NEW NETWORK BUILDS ALSO OFTEN INCLUDE AN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF LOWER MARGIN \u201cCOMMON\u201d  EQUIPMENT SALES AND INSTALLATION SERVICES, WITH THE INTENT TO IMPROVE MARGIN AS WE SELL CHANNEL CARDS AND MAINTENANCE SERVICES  TO CUSTOMERS ADDING CAPACITY OR SERVICES TO THEIR NETWORKS. GROSS MARGIN CAN BE IMPACTED BY TECHNOLOGY-BASED PRICE  COMPRESSION AND THE INTRODUCTION OR SUBSTITUTION OF NEW PLATFORMS WITH IMPROVED PRICE FOR PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO EXISTING  SOLUTIONS THAT CARRY HIGHER MARGINS. GROSS MARGIN CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN EXPENSE FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE  INVENTORY AND WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS.  SERVICE GROSS MARGIN CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE MIX OF CUSTOMERS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY THE MIX BETWEEN DEPLOYMENT AND  MAINTENANCE SERVICES, GEOGRAPHIC MIX AND THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF ANY INVESTMENTS IN INTERNAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THIS  BUSINESS.

WE WERE SUCCESSFUL IN EXECUTING OUR STRATEGY DURING FISCAL 2018, WHICH ALLOWED US TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL REVENUE GROWTH AND ADDITIONAL MARKET SHARE, BUT WHICH ADVERSELY IMPACTED GROSS MARGINS.

SECOND QUARTER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WERE DOWN IN FISCAL 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE FISCAL 2018, IN OUR AMERICAS RECYCLING AND INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENTS, LEADING TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN NET SALES IN THESE SEGMENTS ON BOTH A QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS; HOWEVER, MARGINS REMAINED STABLE. CONTRACTS IN OUR AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENT RELATED TO OUR EXISTING OPERATIONS CONTINUE TO REFLECT AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT HAVE LAGGED INCREASED INPUT AND PRODUCTION COSTS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN FISCAL  2019  WERE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST OF $3.0 MILLION AND $6.8 MILLION FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  54.9%  AND  40.9%  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH  15.0%  AND  19.6%  , FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD WAS GREATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF TAX EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF THE TCJA COMPARED TO BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SEE  NOTE 12, INCOME TAX  , FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA TO EACH COMPARATIVE PERIOD.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE PRIMARY DRIVERS FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES WERE REDUCTIONS IN THE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP PRICING ENVIRONMENT, RESULTING IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN AVERAGE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SELLING PRICES OF  7%  AND  15%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY 68% OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO A DECLINE IN NONFERROUS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES, RESULTING FROM A GENERAL DECLINE IN PRICING ACROSS NONFERROUS COMMODITIES, INCLUDING COPPER AND ALUMINUM.

THE INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY METAL MARGIN EXPANSION OF  32%  AND  29%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS DEMAND DRIVEN BY U.S. NON-RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REMAINS STRONG. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO INCREASED METAL MARGIN ARE THE HIGHER VOLUMES PROVIDED BY THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING MARGIN EXPANSION, ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  REFLECTED INCREASED COSTS RELATED TO THE OPERATION OF NEW FACILITIES AND INFLATIONARY COST PRESSURE ON CERTAIN SUPPLIES, INCLUDING ELECTRODES AND ALLOYS.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN SHORT TONS SHIPPED OF  155 THOUSAND  AND  209 THOUSAND  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO SHIPMENTS BY THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  DURING FISCAL 2019.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE, SECOND QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE SHIPMENTS BY OUR EXISTING FABRICATION FACILITIES WERE DOWN 16% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, AS INCLEMENT WEATHER ACROSS THE U.S. SLOWED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY.  ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WERE INCREASES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  $46  AND  $68  PER TON, RESPECTIVELY, AS SELLING PRICES HAVE INCREASED IN RESPONSE TO RISING INPUT COSTS.

FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE REDUCTION IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE IN SHIPMENTS OF  12%  AND  7%  , RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018.   THIS REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF DELAYED CUSTOMER ORDERS IN ANTICIPATION OF EUROPEAN UNION TARIFF RATE QUOT  A  SAFEGUARD MEASURES, WHICH OCCURRED DURING FEBRUARY 2019.  THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ALSO REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY $18.2 MILLION AND $26.7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED  36%  AND  15%  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  , DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE SECOND QUARTER VOLUME DECREASES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A $22.5 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  AND OTHER LEGAL EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN A COST EFFICIENT MANNER. OUR FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING CAPITAL MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATING MADE BY ANY RATING AGENCY.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE  $350.0 MILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SALE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS, AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  33  OUR BUSINESS REGULARLY GENERATES A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS. WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL CONDITION, WE RECORD ALLOWANCES AS SOON AS WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTS ARE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AS WE MAKE OUR ASSESSMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE CREDIT INSURANCE INTERNATIONALLY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INSURED RECEIVABLES (AND THOSE COVERED BY EXPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT) WAS APPROXIMATELY  12%  OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019.

CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF STEEL AND RELATED PRODUCTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, SALES OF NONFERROUS METAL PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A DIVERSE AND GENERALLY STABLE CUSTOMER BASE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE FUTURES OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN METAL COMMODITY PRICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NATURAL GAS PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. SEE  NOTE 10, DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WITH THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, CASH RECEIPTS RELATED TO THE COLLECTION OF THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\"DPP\") FROM OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. AND POLAND (THE \"PROGRAMS\"), PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES, WERE RECORDED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. UPON ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15, COUPLED WITH AMENDMENTS MADE TO THE PROGRAMS, AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 6, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS  , CASH COLLECTIONS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  RELATED TO OUR  $367.5 MILLION  OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT  AUGUST 31, 2018  WERE REFLECTED AS CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS TO THE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING COLLECTIONS RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING DPP BALANCE AT  AUGUST 31, 2018  , FUTURE CASH COLLECTIONS OF TRADE RECEIVABLES UNDER THE PROGRAMS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AND CASH ADVANCES, INCLUDING REPAYMENT OF SUCH ADVANCES, ARE CLASSIFIED AS FINANCING ACTIVITIES BEGINNING IN FISCAL  2019.  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $352.9 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $183.6 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS DUE, IN PART, TO THE CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (\"WORKING CAPITAL\") FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WHICH REFLECT A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL OF APPROXIMATELY  $85.7 MILLION  .  THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN WORKING CAPITAL THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO AN OVERALL WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTION IN FISCAL 2018 RESULTING FROM THE WIND DOWN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS DURING FISCAL 2018. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH RESULTED IN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF  $367.5 MILLION  AND  $322.4 MILLION  RELATED TO CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, DAYS SALES OUTSTANDING WERE FLAT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, WHILE DAYS SALES IN INVENTORY INCREASED BY  TEN  DAYS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  34  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $550.6 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS, THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-15 RESULTED IN A TOTAL YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  OF  $135.1 MILLION  , INCLUDING  $45.1 MILLION  RELATED TO THE CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE DPP FROM THE PROGRAMS, AND $90.0 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS DURING FISCAL 2018 RELATED TO CASH ADVANCES TAKEN UNDER THE PROGRAM.  WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL BUDGET WILL RANGE BETWEEN  $175 MILLION TO $225 MILLION  . WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR CAPITAL SPENDING BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED RESULTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  BY  $227.2 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  THE  INCREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $180.0 MILLION DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  DURING FISCAL  2019  AS WELL AS NET SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS OF  $47.4 MILLION  UNDER THE PROGRAMS. WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE USE OF OUR CASH IN EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  WE ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PRUDENT USES OF OUR CAPITAL, SUCH AS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $380 MILLION  FROM  AUGUST 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  . THE INCREASE INCLUDES FINANCING AND RELATED INTEREST OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  RELATED TO ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS PURCHASING ACTIVITIES. OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDING  FEBRUARY 28  , 2020 ARE APPROXIMATELY  $570 MILLION  AND PRIMARILY CONSIST OF EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITIES.  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS REQUEST. AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD COMMITTED  $28.2 MILLION  UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH  $3.3 MILLION  REDUCED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE REVOLVER, AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , WE HAVE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND POLAND.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, THE PROGRAMS WERE AMENDED SUCH THAT THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACCOUNTED FOR TRANSFERS OF THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS SALES: TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TRANSFERRED WERE REMOVED FROM THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND CASH ADVANCES RECEIVED WERE REFLECTED AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  CONTINGENCIES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS, WE BECOME INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL  INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE MAY INCUR SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE MATTERS. LIABILITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES REQUIRE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EACH MATTER AND THE ADVICE OF OUR LEGAL COUNSEL. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION-RELATED LOSSES WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS. WE EVALUATE THE MEASUREMENT OF RECORDED LIABILITIES EACH REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIC TO EACH MATTER. THE ULTIMATE LOSSES INCURRED UPON FINAL RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY RECORDED AT A PARTICULAR BALANCE SHEET DATE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR.

A DISCUSSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS AFFECTING THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE CONTEXT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS MD&A.  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING THE ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INCORPORATED IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  AN ANALYSIS OF OUR OPERATIONS FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPARING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. A DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS FOLLOWED BY A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT.  \u2022  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.

AN OVERVIEW OF CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, RETIREMENT AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS, COST-SAVING PLANS, UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS.  THE DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOWS PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT WILL ASSIST THE READER IN UNDERSTANDING OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CHANGES IN CERTAIN KEY ITEMS IN THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR THOSE CHANGES, AS WELL AS HOW CERTAIN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AFFECT OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THIS DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR ELSEWHERE IN THIS DOCUMENT.  OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF PERSONAL COMPUTING AND OTHER ACCESS DEVICES, IMAGING AND PRINTING PRODUCTS, AND           RELATED TECHNOLOGIES, SOLUTIONS, AND SERVICES. WE SELL TO INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMBS AND LARGE ENTERPRISES, INCLUDING CUSTOMERS IN THE GOVERNMENT, HEALTH, AND EDUCATION SECTORS. WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: PERSONAL SYSTEMS, PRINTING AND CORPORATE INVESTMENTS. THE PERSONAL SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS COMMERCIAL AND CONSUMER DESKTOP AND NOTEBOOK PCS, WORKSTATIONS, THIN CLIENTS, COMMERCIAL MOBILITY DEVICES, RETAIL POS SYSTEMS, DISPLAYS AND OTHER RELATED ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE, SUPPORT, AND SERVICES. THE PRINTING SEGMENT PROVIDES CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL PRINTER HARDWARE, SUPPLIES, SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS SCANNING DEVICES. CORPORATE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE HP LABS AND CERTAIN BUSINESS INCUBATION PROJECTS.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, OUR STRATEGIC FOCUS IS ON PROFITABLE GROWTH THROUGH HYPER MARKET SEGMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO ENHANCED INNOVATION IN MULTI-OPERATING SYSTEMS, MULTI-ARCHITECTURE, GEOGRAPHY, CUSTOMER SEGMENTS AND OTHER KEY ATTRIBUTES. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE INVESTING IN PREMIUM FORM FACTORS SUCH AS CONVERTIBLE NOTEBOOKS TO MEET CUSTOMER PREFERENCE FOR MOBILE, THINNER AND LIGHTER DEVICES. WE HAVE  INCREASED OUR FOCUS ON DEVICE AS A SERVICE AS THE MARKET BEGINS TO SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE WELL POSITIONED DUE TO OUR COMPETITIVE PRODUCT LINEUP.  \u2022  IN PRINTING, OUR STRATEGIC GROWTH FOCUS IS ON SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS AND GRAPHICS, AS WELL AS EXPANDING OUR FOOTPRINT IN THE 3D PRINTING MARKETPLACE. THE SHIFT TO CONTRACTUAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDES AN INCREASED FOCUS ON MPS AND INSTANT INK, SUPPORTING OUR STRATEGY OF PLACING HIGHER VALUE PRINTER UNITS (INCLUDING OUR A3 PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS) WHICH OFFER STRONG ANNUITY OF TONER AND INK. IN THE GRAPHICS SPACE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATIONS SUCH AS OUR INDIGO AND LATEX PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WHICH SUPPORT ACCELERATED GROWTH IN OUR GRAPHIC SOLUTIONS. WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE ON OUR KEY INITIATIVES OF FOCUSING ON HIGH-VALUE PRODUCTS TARGETED AT HIGH USAGE CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW REVENUE DELIVERY MODELS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE CHALLENGES THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ONE SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO DYNAMIC MARKET TRENDS, SUCH AS FORECASTED DECLINING PC CLIENT MARKETS AND HOME PRINTING MARKETS. A SECOND SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO CHANGES IN THE COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE. OUR PRIMARY COMPETITORS ARE EXERTING COMPETITIVE PRESSURE IN TARGETED AREAS AND ARE ENTERING NEW MARKETS, OUR EMERGING COMPETITORS ARE INTRODUCING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS, AND OUR ALLIANCE PARTNERS IN SOME BUSINESSES ARE INCREASINGLY BECOMING OUR COMPETITORS IN OTHERS. A THIRD SET OF CHALLENGES RELATES TO BUSINESS MODEL CHANGES AND OUR GO-TO-MARKET EXECUTION IN AN EVOLVING DISTRIBUTION AND RESELLER LANDSCAPE, WITH INCREASING OMNICHANNEL PRESENCE.  \u2022  IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS,  WE FACE CHALLENGES WITH INDUSTRY COMPONENT AVAILABILITY.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  \u2022  IN PRINTING,  WE  OBTAIN MANY COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE SOURCES DUE TO TECHNOLOGY, AVAILABILITY, PRICE, QUALITY OR OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. FOR INSTANCE, WE SOURCE THE  MAJORITY OF OUR A4 AND A PORTION OF OUR A3 PORTFOLIO OF  LASER PRINTER ENGINES AND LASER TONER CARTRIDGES FROM CANON. ANY DECISION BY EITHER PARTY TO NOT RENEW OUR AGREEMENT WITH CANON OR TO LIMIT OR REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THE AGREEMENT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE FROM LASERJET PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, WE HAVE A LONG-STANDING BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP WITH CANON AND ANTICIPATE RENEWAL OF THIS AGREEMENT. WE ARE ALSO SEEING INCREASES IN COMMODITY COSTS IMPACTING OUR BILL OF MATERIALS.  OUR BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ALSO DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FACE GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES, TARIFF-DRIVEN HEADWINDS,  UNCERTAINTY IN THE MARKETS, VOLATILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES, WEAKER MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND EVOLVING DYNAMICS IN THE GLOBAL TRADE ENVIRONMENT.  THE IMPACT OF THESE AND OTHER GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES ON OUR BUSINESS CANNOT BE KNOWN AT THIS TIME.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE INNOVATION WITH A VIEW TOWARDS DEVELOPING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALIGNED WITH GENERATING MARKET DEMAND AND MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING OUR OPERATIONS, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ENHANCING OUR END-TO-END PROCESSES, ANALYTICS AND EFFICIENCIES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK ON OPTIMIZING OUR SALES COVERAGE MODELS, ALIGN OUR SALES INCENTIVES WITH OUR STRATEGIC GOALS, IMPROVE CHANNEL EXECUTION, STRENGTHEN OUR CAPABILITIES IN OUR AREAS OF STRATEGIC FOCUS, AND DEVELOP AND CAPITALIZE ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES.  WE TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE HIGHER NET REVENUES IN OUR FOURTH QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL HOLIDAY DEMAND. HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF OUR FUTURE NET REVENUES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  FOR A FURTHER DISCUSSION OF TRENDS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING RESULTS, SEE THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MD&A IS BASED ON OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, NET REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT LIABILITIES. OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  TO THE ITEMS THAT WE DISCLOSED AS OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES IN MD&A IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31,  2018  , EXCEPT AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY IN \u201cNOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d, WE HAVE ADOPTED THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICY IS UPDATED.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE DEPICTING THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE ARE EXPECTED TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. WE EVALUATE CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO PAY BASED ON VARIOUS FACTORS LIKE HISTORICAL PAYMENT EXPERIENCE, FINANCIAL METRICS AND CUSTOMER CREDIT SCORES.  WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND WHILE MANY OF OUR SALES CONTRACTS CONTAIN STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THERE ARE CONTRACTS WHICH CONTAIN NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FURTHER, MANY OF OUR ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT INTERPRETATION MAY BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS CONSIDERED TO BE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, THE ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE AMONG PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE TIMING OF TRANSFER OF CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES FOR EACH OF THOSE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS.  WE EVALUATE EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN AN ARRANGEMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT REPRESENTS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING. A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION CONSTITUTES A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING WHEN THE CUSTOMER CAN BENEFIT FROM THE GOODS OR SERVICES EITHER ON ITS OWN OR TOGETHER WITH OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE TO THE CUSTOMER AND THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS DISTINCT WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE CONTRACT.  TRANSACTION PRICE IS THE AMOUNT OF CONSIDERATION TO WHICH WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR TRANSFERRING GOODS OR SERVICES TO THE CUSTOMER. IF THE TRANSACTION PRICE INCLUDES A VARIABLE AMOUNT, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT USING EITHER THE EXPECTED VALUE OR MOST LIKELY AMOUNT METHOD. WE REDUCE THE TRANSACTION PRICE AT THE TIME OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVE OFFERINGS, REBATES, PROMOTIONS, OTHER VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES AND EXPECTED RETURNS. WE USE ESTIMATES TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR SUCH PROGRAMS BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, EXPECTED CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  WHEN A SALES ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS HARDWARE AND/OR SERVICES, WE ALLOCATE REVENUE TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SELLING PRICE. THE SELLING PRICE FOR EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS BASED ON ITS STANDALONE SELLING PRICE (\u201cSSP\u201d). WE ESTABLISH SSP USING THE PRICE CHARGED FOR A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION WHEN SOLD  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  SEPARATELY (\u201cOBSERVABLE PRICE\u201d) AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, USING THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY. WHEN OBSERVABLE PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, WE ESTABLISH SSP BASED ON MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENT CONSIDERING INTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS MARGIN OBJECTIVES, PRICING PRACTICES AND CONTROLS, CUSTOMER SEGMENT PRICING STRATEGIES AND THE PRODUCT LIFE-CYCLE. CONSIDERATION IS ALSO GIVEN TO MARKET CONDITIONS SUCH AS COMPETITOR PRICING STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY LIFE CYCLES. WE MAY MODIFY OR DEVELOP NEW GO-TO-MARKET PRACTICES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES, IMPACTING STANDALONE SELLING PRICE DETERMINATION. IN MOST ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, THE TRANSACTION PRICE IS ALLOCATED TO EACH PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICE. HOWEVER, THE AFOREMENTIONED FACTORS MAY RESULT IN A DIFFERENT SSP DETERMINATION APPLYING MANAGEMENT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THIS MAY CHANGE THE PATTERN AND TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR IDENTICAL ARRANGEMENTS EXECUTED IN FUTURE PERIODS BUT WILL NOT CHANGE THE TOTAL REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR ANY GIVEN ARRANGEMENT.  REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN, OR AS, A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION IS SATISFIED BY TRANSFERRING CONTROL OF A PROMISED GOOD OR SERVICE TO A CUSTOMER. WE GENERALLY INVOICE THE CUSTOMER UPON DELIVERY OF THE GOODS OR SERVICES AND THE PAYMENTS ARE DUE AS PER CONTRACT TERMS. FOR FIXED PRICE SUPPORT OR MAINTENANCE AND OTHER SERVICE CONTRACTS THAT ARE IN THE NATURE OF STAND-READY OBLIGATIONS, PAYMENTS ARE GENERALLY RECEIVED IN ADVANCE FROM CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER TIME FOR THE DURATION OF THE CONTRACT. IN INSTANCES WHEN REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM SALES OF THIRD-PARTY VENDOR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, WE RECORD REVENUE ON A GROSS BASIS WHEN WE ARE A PRINCIPAL IN THE TRANSACTION AND ON A NET BASIS WHEN WE ARE ACTING AS AN AGENT BETWEEN THE CUSTOMER AND THE VENDOR. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE ARE ACTING AS A PRINCIPAL OR AN AGENT, MOST NOTABLY WHETHER WE ARE THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER, HAVE ESTABLISHED OUR OWN PRICING AND HAVE INVENTORY AND CREDIT RISKS.  TAXES ON EARNINGS  THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW. THE TCJA LOWERED OUR U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, WHILE ALSO IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS.  IN DECEMBER 2017, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED SAB NO. 118, WHICH ALLOWS REGISTRANTS TO RECORD PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS DURING A ONE YEAR \u201cMEASUREMENT PERIOD\u201d.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TCJA WITH NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RECORDED DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD.  IN JANUARY 2018, THE FASB RELEASED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING FOR TAX ON THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX PROVISIONS OF TCJA. THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX PROVISIONS IMPOSE A TAX ON FOREIGN INCOME IN EXCESS OF A DEEMED RETURN ON TANGIBLE ASSETS OF FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. THE GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT EITHER ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED TAXES RELATED TO GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSIONS OR TO TREAT ANY TAXES ON GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSIONS AS PERIOD COST ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE METHODS SUBJECT TO AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION. WE HAVE ELECTED TO TREAT THE GLOBAL MINIMUM TAX INCLUSION AS PERIOD COSTS.  PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. FEDERAL TAXES BECAUSE WE HAD PLANNED TO REINVEST SUCH EARNINGS INDEFINITELY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. WE PLAN DISTRIBUTIONS OF FOREIGN EARNINGS BASED ON PROJECTED CASH FLOW NEEDS AS WELL AS THE WORKING CAPITAL AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS. BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WE ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO INDEFINITELY INVEST OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AND THE AMOUNTS WE EXPECT TO DISTRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES AND PROVIDE THE U.S. FEDERAL TAXES DUE ON AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE UNDERTAKEN, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES AND, IN SOME CASES, IS WHOLLY EXEMPT FROM TAXES FOR FISCAL YEARS THROUGH 2027.  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FOR A SUMMARY OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS APPLICABLE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SEE NOTE 1, \u201cBASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d, TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  REVENUE FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS HAS HISTORICALLY REPRESENTED, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO REPRESENT, A MAJORITY OF OUR OVERALL NET REVENUE. AS A RESULT, OUR NET REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN IMPACTED, AND WE EXPECT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED, BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING PERFORMANCE EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE SUPPLEMENT THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE WITH THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS, WHICH EXCLUDES THE EFFECT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY  46  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  EXCHANGE FLUCTUATIONS CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING CURRENT PERIOD REVENUES USING MONTHLY AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES FROM THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD AND DOES NOT ADJUST FOR ANY REPRICING OR DEMAND IMPACTS FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SO THAT NET REVENUE CAN BE VIEWED WITH AND WITHOUT THE EFFECT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW MANAGEMENT EVALUATES OUR NET REVENUE RESULTS AND TRENDS, AS MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THE EXCLUDED ITEMS ARE REFLECTIVE OF ONGOING OPERATING RESULTS. THE CONSTANT CURRENCY MEASURES ARE PROVIDED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET REVENUE ON A GAAP BASIS. OTHER COMPANIES MAY CALCULATE AND DEFINE SIMILARLY LABELED ITEMS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH MAY LIMIT THE USEFULNESS OF THIS MEASURE FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE WERE AS FOLLOWS.

U.S. NET REVENUE DECREASED 2% TO $4.9 BILLION, WHILE NET REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS INCREASED 3% TO $9.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS AND PRINTING HARDWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINE IN SUPPLIES AND DESKTOPS, AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGES IN SEGMENT NET REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN \u201cSEGMENT INFORMATION\u201d BELOW.  GROSS MARGIN  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , OUR GROSS MARGIN REMAINED FLAT, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRICING IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COMMODITY AND LOGISTICS COSTS IN PERSONAL SYSTEMS, LOWER SUPPLIES MIX IN PRINTING AND UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS.  A DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE CHANGES IN SEGMENT GROSS MARGINS IS INCLUDED UNDER \u201cSEGMENT INFORMATION\u201d BELOW.  OPERATING EXPENSES  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (\u201cR&D\u201d)  R&D EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, AND RELATE TO CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN PRINTING AND PERSONAL SYSTEMS.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d)  SG&A EXPENSE INCREASED 1.5% FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INVESTMENT IN DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE FISCAL 2017 PLAN.  47  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)  ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES  ACQUISITION-RELATED CHARGES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 RELATE PRIMARILY TO THIRD-PARTY PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES, AND INTEGRATION-RELATED COSTS.  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  RELATES PRIMARILY TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF SAMSUNG\u2019S PRINTER BUSINESS AND THE APOGEE GROUP.  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET  INTEREST AND OTHER, NET EXPENSE INCREASED BY  $18 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKET-RELATED RETIREMENT CREDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO REDUCTION OF DEBT IN MARCH 2018.  (PROVISION FOR) BENEFIT FROM TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  10.8%  AND (114.1%) FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 21% AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE GENERALLY DIFFERS FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 23% DUE TO THE IMPACT OF U.S. TAX REFORM, AND FAVORABLE TAX RATES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM OUR OPERATIONS IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED U.S. TAXES FOR ALL FOREIGN EARNINGS BECAUSE WE PLAN TO REINVEST SOME OF THOSE EARNINGS INDEFINITELY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  DURING THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE RECORDED  $9 MILLION  OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. AS DISCUSSED IN THE NOTE 5, WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FULL IMPACT OF TCJA. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE RECORDED TAX BENEFIT OF $21 MILLION RELATED TO FINAL TAX REFORM ADJUSTMENTS AND A TAX BENEFIT OF $12 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING. THESE BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $20 MILLION AND OTHER TAX CHARGES OF $4 MILLION.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED $1.1 BILLION OF NET TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE PROVISION FOR TAXES. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2018, WE HAD NOT YET COMPLETED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE FULL IMPACT OF TCJA HOWEVER WE RECORDED A PROVISIONAL TAX BENEFIT OF $1.1 BILLION RELATED TO $5.5 BILLION NET BENEFIT FOR THE DECREASE IN OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.2 BILLION NET EXPENSE FOR THE REPATRIATION TAX PAYABLE IN INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS AND $1.2 BILLION NET EXPENSE FOR REMEASUREMENT OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE REVALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO THE NEW US RATE OF 21%. THIS AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDED TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, ACQUISITION CHARGES AND OTHER TAX BENEFITS OF $32 MILLION, $18 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OFFSET BY UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION CHARGES OF $43 MILLION.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  A DESCRIPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR EACH SEGMENT CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 2, \u201cSEGMENT INFORMATION\u201d TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. FUTURE CHANGES TO THIS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE SEGMENTS DISCLOSED.  REALIGNMENT  EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF ITS FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WE IMPLEMENTED AN ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE TO ALIGN OUR BUSINESS UNIT FINANCIAL REPORTING MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR CURRENT BUSINESS STRUCTURE. THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGE RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN SAMSUNG-BRANDED PRODUCT CATEGORIES FROM COMMERCIAL TO CONSUMER WITHIN THE PRINTING SEGMENT. WE REFLECTED THIS CHANGE TO OUR BUSINESS UNIT INFORMATION IN PRIOR REPORTING PERIODS ON AN AS-IF BASIS. THE REPORTING CHANGE HAD NO IMPACT TO PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SEGMENT NET REVENUE, CONSOLIDATED NET REVENUE, EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS, NET EARNINGS OR NET EPS.

THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS AND WORKSTATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS AND A DECLINE IN DESKTOPS DUE TO COMPONENT AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS. THE NET REVENUE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY A 5.5% INCREASE IN ASPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3.0% DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME, AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN ASPS WAS DUE TO POSITIVE MIX SHIFTS AND HIGHER PRICING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY IMPACTS. THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINE IN DESKTOPS.  CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL REVENUE INCREASED 1.3% AND 2.8%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN NOTEBOOKS, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER ASPS.  NET REVENUE DECREASED 3.3% IN DESKTOPS AND INCREASED 5.8% IN NOTEBOOKS AND 3.5% IN WORKSTATIONS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  PERSONAL SYSTEMS EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN AND A DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ASPS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN COMMODITY AND LOGISTICS COSTS. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.

THE DECLINE IN NET REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SUPPLIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HARDWARE, SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS REVENUE, AND FAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS. NET REVENUE FOR SUPPLIES DECREASED 2.5% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEMAND WEAKNESS. PRINTER UNIT VOLUME INCREASED 2.6% WHILE ASPS DECREASED 2.7% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY UNIT INCREASES IN CONSUMER AND COMMERCIAL HARDWARE. PRINTER ASPS DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DISCOUNTING.  NET REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL HARDWARE INCREASED BY 5.1% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE APOGEE GROUP INCLUDING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS.  NET REVENUE FOR CONSUMER HARDWARE INCREASED 1.6% AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO A 2.4% INCREASE IN PRINTER UNIT VOLUME PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 1.2% DECREASE IN ASPS. THE UNIT VOLUME INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE LASERJET HOME BUSINESS. THE DECREASE IN ASPS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY MIX SHIFT TO LOW-END PRINTERS.  PRINTING EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE INCREASED BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN. THE GROSS MARGIN DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER SUPPLIES MIX. OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EXPENSE MANAGEMENT.  CORPORATE INVESTMENTS  THE LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN CORPORATE INVESTMENTS FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR INCUBATION PROJECTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE USE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. WE BELIEVE THAT INTERNALLY GENERATED CASH FLOWS ARE GENERALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT OUR OPERATING BUSINESSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS, RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, MATURING DEBT, INCOME TAX PAYMENTS AND THE PAYMENT OF STOCKHOLDER DIVIDENDS, IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. WE ARE ABLE TO SUPPLEMENT THIS SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, IF NECESSARY, WITH BROAD ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS AND CREDIT FACILITIES MADE AVAILABLE BY VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. WHILE OUR ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS MAY BE CONSTRAINED AND OUR COST OF BORROWING MAY INCREASE UNDER CERTAIN BUSINESS, MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, OUR ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF FUNDING SOURCES TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS IS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE CONTINUED ACCESS TO CAPITAL RESOURCES UNDER ALL SUCH CONDITIONS. OUR LIQUIDITY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS INCLUDING THE RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN ITEM 1A OF PART I IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 AND THE MARKET RISKS IDENTIFIED IN THE SECTION ENTITLED \u201cQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\u201d IN ITEM 3 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  OUR CASH BALANCES ARE HELD IN NUMEROUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. WE UTILIZE A VARIETY OF PLANNING AND FINANCING STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT OUR WORLDWIDE CASH IS AVAILABLE WHEN AND WHERE IT IS NEEDED. OUR CASH POSITION REMAINS STRONG, AND WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH BALANCES, ANTICIPATED CASH FLOW GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR EXPECTED NEAR-TERM CASH OUTLAYS.  AMOUNTS HELD OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NON-U.S. LIQUIDITY NEEDS  AND MAY FROM TIME TO TIME BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES. THE TCJA MADE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE U.S. TAX LAW, INCLUDING A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. THE PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX WILL BE PAID OVER EIGHT YEARS BEGINNING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR. WE EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WILL NO LONGER BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON A SUBSEQUENT REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION TAX ON ACCUMULATED FOREIGN EARNINGS. HOWEVER, A PORTION OF THIS CASH MAY STILL BE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN INCOME TAX OR WITHHOLDING TAX CONSEQUENCES UPON REPATRIATION. AS WE EVALUATE THE FUTURE CASH NEEDS OF OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REVISE THE AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND HOW TO UTILIZE SUCH FUNDS, INCLUDING REDUCING OUR GROSS DEBT LEVEL, OR OTHER USES.

DSO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR RECEIVABLES ARE OUTSTANDING. DSO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET OF ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE NET REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN DSO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO UNFAVORABLE REVENUE LINEARITY.  DOS MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS FROM PROCUREMENT TO SALE OF OUR PRODUCT. DOS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING INVENTORY BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE DECREASE IN DOS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTION IN INVENTORY DRIVEN BY RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN BALANCES TO OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, PURSUANT TO ADOPTION OF THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  DPO MEASURES THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF DAYS OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES ARE OUTSTANDING. DPO IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING ENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY A 90-DAY AVERAGE COST OF REVENUE. THE INCREASE IN DPO WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVENTORY PURCHASING VOLUME AND NEGOTIATED VENDOR PAYMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $1.4 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF $0.6 BILLION, A DECREASE IN COLLATERAL RELATED TO OUR DERIVATIVES OF $0.5 BILLION AND INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS WITHIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS BY $0.4 BILLION.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR  2018  , NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $1.5 BILLION  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER OF $0.9 BILLION, PAYMENT OF DEBT OF $0.4 BILLION AND A HIGHER SHARE REPURCHASE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT OF $0.3 BILLION.

WHILE WE DO NOT HAVE ANY RATING DOWNGRADE TRIGGERS THAT WOULD ACCELERATE THE MATURITY OF A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF OUR DEBT, PREVIOUS DOWNGRADES HAVE INCREASED THE COST OF BORROWING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, HAVE REDUCED MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER AND HAVE REQUIRED THE POSTING OF ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL UNDER SOME OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, ANY FURTHER DOWNGRADE TO OUR CREDIT RATINGS BY ANY RATING AGENCIES MAY FURTHER IMPACT US IN A SIMILAR MANNER, AND, DEPENDING ON THE EXTENT OF ANY SUCH DOWNGRADE, COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL POSITION. WE CAN ACCESS ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FUNDING, INCLUDING DRAWDOWNS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, IF NECESSARY, TO OFFSET POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN THE MARKET CAPACITY FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE CERTAIN RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED IN SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  SUCH RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE CAUTIONARY LANGUAGE SET FORTH HEREIN; OPERATIONS DISRUPTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION; OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT OR RETAIN QUALIFIED SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND SERVICE TECHNICIANS WHO RELATE DIRECTLY WITH OUR CUSTOMERS; THE REDUCTION, MODIFICATION, CANCELLATION OR DELAY OF PURCHASES OF INNOVATIVE, HIGH-MARGIN EQUIPMENT; MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR PURCHASING RELATIONSHIPS WITH SUPPLIERS; CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND IMPORTANT FACTORS CONTAINED AND IDENTIFIED IN PATTERSON\u2019S PREVIOUS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, SUCH AS ITS QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND ANNUAL REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, ANY OF WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  IS SUMMARIZED IN THIS MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES. THE FOLLOWING BACKGROUND IS PROVIDED TO READERS TO ASSIST IN THE REVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  WE PRESENT THREE REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: DENTAL, ANIMAL HEALTH AND CORPORATE. DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH ARE STRATEGIC BUSINESS UNITS THAT OFFER SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO DIFFERENT CUSTOMER BASES. DENTAL PROVIDES A VIRTUALLY COMPLETE RANGE OF CONSUMABLE DENTAL PRODUCTS, EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE, TURNKEY DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND VALUE-ADDED SERVICES TO DENTISTS AND DENTAL LABORATORIES THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA. ANIMAL HEALTH IS A LEADING, FULL-LINE DISTRIBUTOR IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE U.K. OF ANIMAL HEALTH PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BOTH THE PRODUCTION-ANIMAL AND COMPANION-PET MARKETS. OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING HOME OFFICE SUPPORT COSTS IN AREAS SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, FINANCE, LEGAL, HUMAN RESOURCES AND FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, CUSTOMER FINANCING AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN CORPORATE RESULTS.  OPERATING MARGINS OF THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE DENTAL BUSINESS. WHILE OPERATING EXPENSES RUN AT A LOWER RATE IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS WHEN COMPARED TO THE DENTAL BUSINESS, GROSS MARGINS IN THE ANIMAL HEALTH BUSINESS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER DUE GENERALLY TO THE LOW MARGINS EXPERIENCED ON THE SALE OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE OPERATE WITH A 52-53 WEEK ACCOUNTING CONVENTION WITH OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL. THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND 2018 REPRESENTS THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  AND THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  AND  JANUARY 27, 2018  EACH INCLUDED 39 WEEKS. FISCAL 2019 WILL INCLUDE 52 WEEKS AND FISCAL 2018 INCLUDED 52 WEEKS.  WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF OUR BUSINESS THAT ARE USEFUL IN ANALYZING IT, INCLUDING: (1) GROWTH IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE; (2) INTERNAL GROWTH; (3) GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITION; AND (4) CONTINUED FOCUS ON CONTROLLING COSTS AND ENHANCING EFFICIENCY. MANAGEMENT DEFINES INTERNAL GROWTH AS THE INCREASE IN NET SALES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, ADJUSTING FOR DIFFERENCES IN THE NUMBER OF WEEKS IN FISCAL YEARS, EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND EXCLUDING THE NET SALES, FOR A PERIOD OF TWELVE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION DATE, OF BUSINESSES WE HAVE ACQUIRED.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RESULTS  U.S. TAX REFORM  . ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ENACTED COMPREHENSIVE TAX LEGISLATION COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTAX ACT\u201d). THE TAX ACT SIGNIFICANTLY REVISES THE FUTURE ONGOING U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATES AND IMPLEMENTING A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, THE TAX ACT REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%.  RECEIVABLES SECURITIZATION PROGRAM.  ON JULY 24, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A RECEIVABLES PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH MUFG BANK, LTD. (\"MUFG\"). UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, MUFG ACTS AS AN AGENT TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN PATTERSON RECEIVABLES (THE \u201cRECEIVABLES\u201d) TO CERTAIN UNAFFILIATED FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (THE \u201cPURCHASERS\u201d).  THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THESE RECEIVABLES COMPRISE A COMBINATION OF CASH AND A DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE (\u201cDPP\u201d) RECEIVABLE. THE INITIAL TRANSACTION WAS A SALE OF $237.6 MILLION OF NET RECEIVABLES.  FROM THIS SALE, WE RECEIVED $171.0 MILLION OF CASH AND A DPP RECEIVABLE WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $65.9 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A LOSS OF $0.7 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE INITIAL SALE WERE PRIMARILY USED TO REDUCE DEBT.  THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY PATTERSON FOLLOWING THE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES SOLD TO THE PURCHASERS. THE COLLECTION OF THE DPP RECEIVABLE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN INCREASE TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, WITH A CORRESPONDING REDUCTION TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  LEGAL RESERVE  . IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION ENTITLED  IN RE DENTAL SUPPLIES ANTITRUST LITIGATION  . UNDER THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE PAID $28.3 MILLION INTO ESCROW UPON PRELIMINARY COURT APPROVAL.  SUCH FUNDS WILL BE RELEASED UPON FINAL COURT APPROVAL OF THE SETTLEMENT.  WE PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED A PRE-TAX RESERVE OF $28.3 MILLION (\"LEGAL RESERVE\") DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS MATTER.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  QUARTER ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  COMPARED TO QUARTER ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR RESULTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  JANUARY 27, 2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES  78.6  78.6  GROSS PROFIT  21.4  21.4  OPERATING EXPENSES  18.2  17.8  OPERATING INCOME  3.2  3.6  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  (0.5  )  (0.7  )  INCOME BEFORE TAXES  2.7  2.9  INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)  0.5  (5.0  )  NET INCOME  2.2  7.9  NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  \u2014  \u2014  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATTERSON COMPANIES, INC.  2.2%  7.9%  NET SALES.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  1.1%  ON CURRENT QUARTER SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED ON A NET BASIS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.1% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES. POSITIVE END MARKET FUNDAMENTALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CURRENT QUARTER SALES GROWTH.  GROSS PROFIT.  THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WAS UNCHANGED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER AT  21.4%  . GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES DECREASED IN BOTH THE DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , WHILE HIGHER NET SALES IN OUR CORPORATE SEGMENT RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WERE  $254.1 MILLION  , A  3.9%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER OF  $244.7 MILLION  . WE INCURRED HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS. THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSE RATIO OF  18.2%  INCREASED  40  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THIS SAME FACTOR.  OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , OPERATING INCOME WAS  $45.4 MILLION  , OR  3.2%  OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO  $50.0 MILLION  , OR  3.6%  OF NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER GROSS MARGINS. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.  DENTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $51.1 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $7.3 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES, INCLUDING HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AS WELL AS LOWER GROSS MARGINS.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $15.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $3.0 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GREATER OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , INCLUDING HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORPORATE SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS WAS  $20.8 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF  $26.4 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  . THE CHANGE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER NET SALES RELATED TO OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING CONTRACTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  NET OTHER EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WAS  $7.7 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $9.7 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  .  NET OTHER EXPENSE WAS LOWER DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)  . THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WAS  17.4%  COMPARED TO  (170.0)%  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  . THE CHANGE IN THE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATTERSON COMPANIES INC. AND EARNINGS PER SHARE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATTERSON COMPANIES INC. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WAS  $31.2 MILLION  , COMPARED TO  $109.0 MILLION  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  .

THE DECREASE IN SALES OF CONSUMABLES WAS MAINLY DUE TO CHANGES IN OUR SALES FORCE AND DISRUPTIONS RESULTING FROM OUR ERP SYSTEM INITIATIVES.  ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT SALES FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WERE  $2,488.1 MILLION  , A  3.9%  INCREASE FROM  $2,394.6 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  . FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES HAD AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF  0.3%  ON CURRENT PERIOD SALES. SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED ON A GROSS BASIS WERE RECOGNIZED  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON A NET BASIS DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , RESULTING IN AN ESTIMATED 0.2% UNFAVORABLE IMPACT TO SALES. POSITIVE END MARKET FUNDAMENTALS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CURRENT PERIOD SALES GROWTH.  GROSS PROFIT.  THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  DECREASED  120  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD TO  21.2%  . GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATES DECREASED IN BOTH THE DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT. A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF SALES CAME FROM OUR LOWER MARGIN ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , RESULTING IN A LOWER CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE. UNFAVORABLE SALES MIX, PRICING PRESSURE AT THE POINT OF SALE AND INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS IN BOTH OUR DENTAL AND ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN THE CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE.  OPERATING EXPENSES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  WERE  $787.2 MILLION  , A  7.7%  INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD OF  $730.9 MILLION  . WE INCURRED HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE $28.3 MILLION LEGAL RESERVE, HIGHER PERSONNEL COSTS AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES. THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING EXPENSE RATIO OF  19.0%  INCREASED  100  BASIS POINTS FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, WHICH WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY THESE SAME FACTORS.  OPERATING INCOME.  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , OPERATING INCOME WAS  $91.1 MILLION  , OR  2.2%  OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO  $178.6 MILLION  , OR  4.4%  OF NET SALES FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 27, 2018  . THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME AND OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN OPERATING MARGINS IN OUR DENTAL SEGMENT, THE IMPACT OF THE $28.3 MILLION LEGAL RESERVE AND HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES EXPENSES. IN ADDITION, A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF SALES CAME FROM OUR LOWER MARGIN ANIMAL HEALTH SEGMENT DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , WHICH LOWERED OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENT OF SALES.  DENTAL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS  $128.6 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 26, 2019  , A DECREASE OF  $54.6 MILLION  FROM THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NET SALES AND A LOWER GROSS PROFIT MARGIN RATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, IN ADDITION TO GREATER OPERATING EXPENSES.

IN ADDITION, BY CONSOLIDATING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR SCALE, INCREASE OUR PURCHASING POWER, AND IDENTIFY PREFERRED SUPPLIERS, WHICH HAS ENABLED COST SAVING OPPORTUNITIES IN SUPPLIES AND MATERIALS PROCUREMENT.  DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS  ECONOMIC LABOR OUTLOOK  THE U.S. ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE POSITIVE UNDERLYING FUNDAMENTALS, WITH EXPANDING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT GROWTH AND IMPROVING EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS, WHICH HAVE LED TO HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS OF BOTH UNEMPLOYMENT AND UNDEREMPLOYMENT ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THESE FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LOWER AVAILABILITY OF QUALIFIED LABOR FOR OUR BUSINESS AND HIGHER TURNOVER IN CERTAIN MARKETS, AS OUR EMPLOYEES HAVE MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OUR INDUSTRY. THIS IN TURN HAS CAUSED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO CAUSE, HIGHER LABOR AND RELATED PERSONNEL COSTS.  28  RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE INITIATED A RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM TO ACHIEVE COST SYNERGIES FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF GCA SERVICES GROUP (\u201cGCA\u201d). WE INCURRED THE MAJORITY OF OUR ANTICIPATED SEVERANCE EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2018. WE EXPECT TO INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER PROJECT FEES AS WE CONTINUE TO FURTHER INTEGRATE AND CONSOLIDATE OUR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PROCESSES TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH AND CAPABILITIES OF OUR SHARED SERVICES AND OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE STANDARDIZING OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND STREAMLINING OUR OPERATIONS BY MIGRATING AND UPGRADING SEVERAL KEY MANAGEMENT PLATFORMS, INCLUDING OUR HUMAN RESOURCES INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM, AND LABOR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.

THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW INDICATED THE CHANGES WE HAVE MADE TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM HAVE REDUCED THE FREQUENCY OF CLAIMS; HOWEVER, WE ARE EXPERIENCING ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS THAT IMPACT CLAIM COSTS RELATING TO PRIOR PERIODS. CLAIM MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES INCLUDE PROGRAMS TO IDENTIFY THOSE CLAIMS EARLIER IN THE CLAIMS CYCLE THAT MAY POTENTIALLY DEVELOP ADVERSELY AND ENSURE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESERVES CONSISTENT WITH KNOWN FACT PATTERNS. HOWEVER, WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS RELATED TO PRIOR FISCAL YEARS, THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW SHOWED UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE LOSSES RELATED TO GENERAL LIABILITY, PROPERTY DAMAGE, WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION, AND AUTOMOBILE LIABILITY CLAIMS.  BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE ACTUARIAL REVIEW AND SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENTS, WE INCREASED OUR TOTAL RESERVES FOR KNOWN CLAIMS AS WELL AS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCURRED BUT NOT REPORTED CLAIMS BY  $5.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS  $3.0 MILLION  HIGHER  THAN THE TOTAL ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS OF  $2.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018.  WE WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS, WHICH MAY RESULT IN FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO RESERVES.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER GROSS MARGIN, PARTICULARLY WITHIN B&I, AND LOWER CORPORATE EXPENSES DUE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED EXPENSES.  \u2022  OUR INCOME TAXES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  INCREASED BY  $0.7 MILLION DUE TO CERTAIN RESERVES AND DECREASED BY  $0.5 MILLION  OF EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS.

TYPICALLY, OUR TOTAL OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ARE LOWER THAN IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. WE EXPECT OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FOR 2019.  \u2022  DIVIDENDS OF  $11.9 MILLION  WERE PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND DIVIDENDS TOTALING  $0.180  PER COMMON SHARE WERE DECLARED DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  \u2022  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , TOTAL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY WERE  $997.0 MILLION  , AND WE HAD UP TO  $410.2 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY; HOWEVER, COVENANT RESTRICTIONS LIMITED OUR ACTUAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO  $352.5 MILLION.  30  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019  COMPARED WITH THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2018  CONSOLIDATED  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  ($ IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  REVENUES  $1,607.9  $1,588.3  $19.6  1.2%  OPERATING EXPENSES  1,446.0  1,429.3  16.7  1.2%  GROSS MARGIN  10.1%  10.0%  6 BPS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  112.7  109.0  3.7  3.4%  RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED EXPENSES  3.8  14.3  (10.5  )  (73.6)%  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS  15.2  16.2  (1.0  )  (6.2)%  OPERATING PROFIT  30.3  19.5  10.8  55.4%  INCOME FROM UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET  0.9  0.5  0.4  71.1%  INTEREST EXPENSE  (13.5  )  (14.3  )  0.8  (5.7)%  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  17.8  5.8  12.0  NM*  INCOME TAX (PROVISION) BENEFIT  (4.7  )  22.2  (26.9  )  NM*  INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS  13.0  28.0  (15.0  )  (53.4)%  LOSS FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, NET OF TAXES  (0.1  )  (0.1  )  \u2014  (55.8)%  NET INCOME  13.0  27.8  (14.8  )  (53.4)%  OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  INTEREST RATE SWAPS  (8.7  )  18.6  (27.3  )  NM*  FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION  3.1  9.4  (6.3  )  (67.4)%  INCOME TAX BENEFIT (PROVISION)  2.4  (5.0  )  7.4  NM*  COMPREHENSIVE INCOME  $9.7  $50.9  $(41.2  )  (80.9)%  *NOT MEANINGFUL  REVENUES  REVENUES  INCREASED  BY  $19.6 MILLION  , OR  1.2%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO ORGANIC GROWTH IN B&I, IN OUR U.S. TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, AND IN T&M. THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A RECLASSIFICATION OF  $11.3 MILLION  OF RENT EXPENSE RELATED TO SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS, PRIMARILY WITHIN AVIATION. THIS EXPENSE WAS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE BUT IS NOW RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUES, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 853. ADDITIONALLY, WE LOST CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN AVIATION, IN OUR U.K. TECHNICAL SOLUTIONS BUSINESS, AND IN EDUCATION.

THE  INCREASE  IN GROSS MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MARGINS ON CERTAIN B&I AND T&M ACCOUNTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A HIGHER SELF-INSURANCE ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO PRIOR YEAR CLAIMS.  31  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  BY  $3.7 MILLION  , OR  3.4%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  INCREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO.  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF A $4.0 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT OF PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED LEGAL SETTLEMENT COSTS;  \u2022  A  $3.7 MILLION  INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED SUPPORT; AND  \u2022  A $2.1 MILLION INCREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CLIENT RECEIVABLES.  THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY.  \u2022  A $5.4 MILLION DECREASE IN COMPENSATION AND RELATED EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  THE ABSENCE OF $1.4 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN OUR U.S. BUSINESS, A DECREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES IN CERTAIN STATES, AND LOWER LEGAL SETTLEMENT COSTS. THIS  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS IN OUR U.K. BUSINESS AND A PROVISION FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF A UNION HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS AUDIT.

THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RECLASSIFICATION OF  $11.1 MILLION  OF RENT EXPENSE RELATED TO SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 853. THIS EXPENSE IS NOW RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF REVENUES, BUT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECORDED AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. THE  DECREASE  WAS ALSO DUE TO THE LOSS OF CERTAIN FACILITY SERVICES AND PASSENGER SERVICES ACCOUNTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ORGANIC GROWTH IN CATERING LOGISTICS.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO IMPROVED MARGINS ON CERTAIN ACCOUNTS AND THE LOSS OF A LOW MARGIN ACCOUNT IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CLIENT RECEIVABLES AND  AN INCREASE IN WAGES AND RELATED PERSONNEL COSTS.  34  EDUCATION  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  ($ IN MILLIONS)  2019  2018  INCREASE / (DECREASE)  REVENUES  $204.7  $206.9  $(2.2  )  (1.1)%  OPERATING PROFIT  10.3  9.2  1.1  11.8%  OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN  5.0%  4.4%  58 BPS  EDUCATION REVENUES  DECREASED  BY  $2.2 MILLION  , OR  1.1%  , DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  .

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN SALES COMMISSIONS EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 606. THESE AMOUNTS WERE PREVIOUSLY EXPENSED WHEN INCURRED, BUT ARE NOW CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED OVER THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP PERIOD. THE  INCREASE  WAS ALSO DUE TO LOWER AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. THE  INCREASE  WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS ON CERTAIN POWER PROJECTS AND ON ENERGY SAVINGS PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS IN OUR U.S. BUSINESS, THE LOSS OF CERTAIN HIGHER MARGIN CONTRACTS IN OUR U.K. BUSINESS, AND SPECIFIC RESERVES ESTABLISHED FOR CERTAIN CLIENT RECEIVABLES.

WE ASSESS OUR LIQUIDITY IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH TO FUND OUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS. AS SUCH, WE PROJECT OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS.  IN ADDITION TO NORMAL WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM CASH REQUIREMENTS WILL INCLUDE FUNDING LEGAL SETTLEMENTS, INSURANCE CLAIMS, DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND INTEGRATION COSTS RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION. WE ANTICIPATE LONG-TERM CASH USES WILL ALSO INCLUDE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. IN THE EVENT THAT OUR PLANS CHANGE OR OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE GREATER THAN WE ANTICIPATE, WE MAY NEED TO ACCESS THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO FINANCE FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US SHOULD WE NEED IT OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT THE TERMS WILL BE SATISFACTORY TO US AND NOT DILUTIVE TO EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS.  ON A LONG-TERM BASIS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON OUR CREDIT FACILITY FOR ANY LONG-TERM FUNDING NOT PROVIDED BY OPERATING CASH FLOWS. IN ADDITION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT FUTURE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE AUGMENTED BY WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS DRIVEN BY OUR  2020  VISION  , SUCH AS THE MANAGEMENT OF COSTS THROUGH CONSOLIDATED PROCUREMENT.  IFM ASSURANCE COMPANY (\u201cIFM\u201d) IS A WHOLLY-OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WE FORMED IN 2015. IFM IS PART OF OUR ENTERPRISE-WIDE, MULTI-YEAR INSURANCE STRATEGY THAT IS INTENDED TO BETTER POSITION OUR RISK AND SAFETY PROGRAMS AND PROVIDE US WITH INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN THE END-TO-END MANAGEMENT OF OUR INSURANCE PROGRAMS. IFM BEGAN PROVIDING COVERAGE TO US AS OF JANUARY 1, 2015. IN  2019  , WE EXPECT ACCELERATED CASH TAX SAVINGS RELATED TO COVERAGE PROVIDED BY IFM TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $5 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2017, WE REFINANCED AND REPLACED OUR THEN-EXISTING  $800.0 MILLION  CREDIT FACILITY WITH A NEW SENIOR, SECURED FIVE-YEAR SYNDICATED CREDIT FACILITY (THE \u201cCREDIT FACILITY\u201d), CONSISTING OF A  $900.0 MILLION  REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND AN  $800.0 MILLION  AMORTIZING TERM LOAN, SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2022. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE LINE OF CREDIT WAS REDUCED TO  $800.0 MILLION  ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2018. INITIAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WERE USED TO FINANCE, IN PART, THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE RELATED TO THE GCA ACQUISITION, TO REFINANCE CERTAIN EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS OF ABM, AND TO PAY TRANSACTION COSTS.  OUR ABILITY TO DRAW DOWN AVAILABLE CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, AS AMENDED, IS SUBJECT TO, AND LIMITED BY, COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS, WHICH INCLUDE A MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIO OF 4.50 TO 1.0, WHICH STEPS DOWN TO 3.50 TO 1.0 BY JULY 2021, AND A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF 1.50 TO 1.0. OTHER COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY INCLUDE LIMITATIONS ON LIENS, DISPOSITIONS, FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES, INVESTMENTS, AND CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND PAYMENTS. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AND EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , WE MADE  $10.0 MILLION  OF PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY IN THE FORM OF CASH BORROWINGS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WERE  $997.0 MILLION  AND  $152.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , WE HAD UP TO  $410.2 MILLION  OF BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY; HOWEVER, COVENANT RESTRICTIONS LIMITED OUR ACTUAL BORROWING CAPACITY TO  $352.5 MILLION.  REINVESTMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS  WE PLAN TO REINVEST OUR FOREIGN EARNINGS TO FUND FUTURE NON-U.S. GROWTH AND EXPANSION, AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE REMITTING SUCH EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES. WHILE U.S. FEDERAL TAX EXPENSE HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF THE TAX ACT, NO DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED.  37  SHARE REPURCHASES  ON SEPTEMBER 2, 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $200.0 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PURCHASES MAY TAKE PLACE ON THE OPEN MARKET OR OTHERWISE, AND ALL OR PART OF THE REPURCHASES MAY BE MADE PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1 PLANS OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS. THE TIMING OF REPURCHASES IS AT OUR DISCRETION AND WILL DEPEND UPON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, FUTURE CASH FLOWS, SHARE PRICE, AND SHARE AVAILABILITY. REPURCHASED SHARES ARE RETIRED AND RETURNED TO AN AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED STATUS. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  . AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AUTHORIZATION FOR  $134.1 MILLION  OF REPURCHASES REMAINED UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  CASH FLOWS  IN ADDITION TO REVENUES AND OPERATING PROFIT, OUR MANAGEMENT VIEWS OPERATING CASH FLOWS AS A GOOD INDICATOR OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, BECAUSE STRONG OPERATING CASH FLOWS PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITIONS. NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $39.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019.  TYPICALLY, OUR TOTAL OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN THE FIRST QUARTER ARE LOWER THAN IN SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER. WE EXPECT OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS TO PROVIDE POSITIVE CASH FLOWS FOR 2019.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS PRIMARILY DEPEND ON: REVENUE LEVELS; THE QUALITY AND TIMING OF COLLECTIONS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS AND OTHER VENDORS; THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; AND THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS ON INSURANCE CLAIMS AND LEGAL SETTLEMENTS.

THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED  TO THE TIMING OF CLIENT RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  DECREASED  BY  $3.9 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A WORKING CAPITAL SETTLEMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE GCA ACQUISITION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $42.0 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $14.3 MILLION  DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2018  . THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER NET BORROWINGS OF  $46.7 MILLION.  38  CONTINGENCIES  WE ARE A PARTY TO A NUMBER OF LAWSUITS, CLAIMS, AND PROCEEDINGS INCIDENT TO THE OPERATION OF OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, CONTRACTS, PERSONAL INJURY, AND OTHER MATTERS, SOME OF WHICH ALLEGE SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY DAMAGES. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS MAY BE BROUGHT AS CLASS ACTIONS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OR PURPORTED CLASS OF EMPLOYEES.  AT  JANUARY 31, 2019  ,  THE TOTAL AMOUNT ACCRUED FOR ALL PROBABLE LITIGATION LOSSES WHERE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS COULD BE MADE WAS  $12.1 MILLION.  LITIGATION OUTCOMES ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND THE ESTIMATION OF PROBABLE LOSSES REQUIRES THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES. IF ONE OR MORE MATTERS ARE RESOLVED IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD IN AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF, OR IN A MANNER DIFFERENT THAN, WHAT WE ANTICIPATED, THIS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.  WE DO NOT ACCRUE FOR CONTINGENT LOSSES THAT, IN OUR JUDGMENT, ARE CONSIDERED TO BE REASONABLY POSSIBLE BUT NOT PROBABLE. THE ESTIMATION OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES ALSO REQUIRES THE ANALYSIS OF MULTIPLE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES THAT OFTEN DEPEND ON JUDGMENTS ABOUT POTENTIAL ACTIONS BY THIRD PARTIES.  OUR MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY ESTIMATES THE RANGE OF LOSS FOR ALL REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES FOR WHICH A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS CAN BE MADE IS BETWEEN  ZERO  AND  $6 MILLION.  FACTORS UNDERLYING THIS ESTIMATED RANGE OF LOSS MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME, AND ACTUAL RESULTS MAY VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  IN SOME CASES, ALTHOUGH A LOSS IS PROBABLE OR REASONABLY POSSIBLE, WE CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL LOSSES FOR PROBABLE MATTERS OR THE RANGE OF LOSSES FOR REASONABLY POSSIBLE MATTERS. THEREFORE, OUR ACCRUAL FOR PROBABLE LOSSES AND OUR ESTIMATED RANGE OF LOSS FOR REASONABLY POSSIBLE LOSSES DO NOT REPRESENT OUR MAXIMUM POSSIBLE EXPOSURE.

OVERVIEW  EATON VANCE CORP. PROVIDES ADVANCED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND  WEALTH MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS TO FORWARD-THINKING INVESTORS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS IS MANAGING INVESTMENT FUNDS  AND PROVIDING INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY SERVICES TO HIGH-NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS. OUR CORE STRATEGY IS  TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN MANAGEMENT EXPERTISE ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT DISCIPLINES AND TO OFFER LEADING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES  AND SERVICES THROUGH MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. IN EXECUTING OUR CORE STRATEGY, WE HAVE DEVELOPED BROADLY DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES AND A HIGHLY FUNCTIONAL MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICE ORGANIZATION.  WE  MEASURE OUR SUCCESS AS A COMPANY BASED ON INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DELIVERED, CLIENT SATISFACTION, REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE,  PROGRESS ACHIEVING STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES, EMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT AND SATISFACTION, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, AND SHAREHOLDER  VALUE CREATED.  WE CONDUCT OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AND ADVISORY BUSINESS  THROUGH WHOLLY- AND MAJORITY-OWNED INVESTMENT AFFILIATES, WHICH INCLUDE: EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, PARAMETRIC PORTFOLIO ASSOCIATES  LLC (PARAMETRIC), ATLANTA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT COMPANY, LLC (ATLANTA CAPITAL) AND CALVERT RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT (CALVERT). WE ALSO  OFFER INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT ADVISORY SERVICES THROUGH MINORITY-OWNED AFFILIATE HEXAVEST INC. (HEXAVEST).  THROUGH EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT, ATLANTA CAPITAL, CALVERT AND  OUR OTHER AFFILIATES, WE MANAGE ACTIVE EQUITY, INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES ACROSS A RANGE OF INVESTMENT STYLES AND ASSET  CLASSES, INCLUDING U.S. AND GLOBAL EQUITIES, FLOATING-RATE BANK LOANS, MUNICIPAL BONDS, GLOBAL INCOME, HIGH-YIELD AND INVESTMENT  GRADE BONDS. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE MANAGE A RANGE OF SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING SYSTEMATIC EQUITY, SYSTEMATIC  ALTERNATIVES AND MANAGED OPTIONS STRATEGIES. THROUGH PARAMETRIC, WE ALSO PROVIDE CUSTOM  46  PORTFOLIO IMPLEMENTATION AND OVERLAY SERVICES, INCLUDING TAX-MANAGED  AND NON-TAX-MANAGED CUSTOM CORE EQUITY STRATEGIES, CENTRALIZED PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT OF MULTI-MANAGER PORTFOLIOS AND EXPOSURE MANAGEMENT  SERVICES. WE ALSO OVERSEE THE MANAGEMENT OF, AND DISTRIBUTE, INVESTMENT FUNDS SUB-ADVISED BY UNAFFILIATED THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS,  INCLUDING GLOBAL, EMERGING MARKET AND REGIONAL EQUITY AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES.  OUR BREADTH OF INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES SUPPORTS  A WIDE RANGE OF STRATEGIES AND SERVICES OFFERED TO FUND SHAREHOLDERS, RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNT INVESTORS, INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS  AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS.  OUR EQUITY STRATEGIES ENCOMPASS A DIVERSITY OF INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES,  RISK PROFILES, INCOME LEVELS AND GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION. OUR INCOME INVESTMENT STRATEGIES COVER A BROAD DURATION, GEOGRAPHIC  REPRESENTATION AND CREDIT QUALITY RANGE AND ENCOMPASS BOTH TAXABLE AND TAX-FREE INVESTMENTS. WE ALSO OFFER A RANGE OF ALTERNATIVE  INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, INCLUDING COMMODITY- AND CURRENCY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND ABSOLUTE RETURN STRATEGIES. ALTHOUGH WE MANAGE AND  DISTRIBUTE A WIDE RANGE OF INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND SERVICES, WE OPERATE IN ONE BUSINESS SEGMENT, NAMELY AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER  TO FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD $444.7 BILLION IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT.  WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FUNDS AND RETAIL MANAGED ACCOUNTS PRINCIPALLY  THROUGH FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES. WE HAVE BROAD MARKET REACH, WITH DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS INCLUDING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL BROKER-DEALERS,  INDEPENDENT BROKER-DEALERS, REGISTERED INVESTMENT ADVISORS, BANKS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE SUPPORT THESE DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS  WITH A TEAM OF APPROXIMATELY 130 SALES PROFESSIONALS COVERING U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.  WE ALSO COMMIT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO SERVING INSTITUTIONAL  AND HIGH-NET-WORTH CLIENTS WHO ACCESS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES ON A DIRECT BASIS AND THROUGH INVESTMENT CONSULTANTS. THROUGH  OUR WHOLLY AND MAJORITY-OWNED AFFILIATES AND CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, WE MANAGE INVESTMENTS FOR A BROAD RANGE OF CLIENTS IN THE  INSTITUTIONAL AND HIGH-NET-WORTH MARKETPLACE IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING CORPORATIONS, SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, ENDOWMENTS,  FOUNDATIONS, FAMILY OFFICES AND PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS.  OUR REVENUE IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM MANAGEMENT, DISTRIBUTION  AND SERVICE FEES RECEIVED FROM EATON VANCE-, PARAMETRIC- AND CALVERT-BRANDED FUNDS AND MANAGEMENT FEES RECEIVED FROM SEPARATE ACCOUNTS.  OUR FEES ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS WE MANAGE AND FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THE TOTAL VALUE  AND MIX OF ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT. AS A MATTER OF COURSE, INVESTORS IN OUR SPONSORED OPEN-END FUNDS AND SEPARATE ACCOUNTS HAVE  THE ABILITY TO REDEEM THEIR INVESTMENTS AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AND THERE ARE NO MATERIAL RESTRICTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT  THEM FROM DOING SO. OUR MAJOR EXPENSES ARE EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION, DISTRIBUTION-RELATED EXPENSES, SERVICE FEE EXPENSE, FUND-RELATED  EXPENSES, FACILITIES EXPENSE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EXPENSE.  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING  PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES  US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURES  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE  ASSETS, INCOME TAXES, INVESTMENTS AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS  THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE  CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE  ESTIMATES.  47  CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE PURSUING FIVE PRIMARY STRATEGIC PRIORITIES TO SUPPORT  BUSINESS GROWTH: (1) BUILDING UPON AND DEFENDING OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN SPECIALTY STRATEGIES AND SERVICES FOR HIGH-NET-WORTH  AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS; (2) CAPITALIZING ON THE CURRENT INTEREST ENVIRONMENT TO GROW OUR MARKET POSITION IN FLOATING-RATE  AND SHORT-DURATION FIXED INCOME STRATEGIES; (3) EXPANDING OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING; (4) INCREASING OUR  GLOBAL INVESTMENT CAPABILITIES AND DISTRIBUTION REACH OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES; AND (5) POSITIONING EATON VANCE TO PROFIT FROM  A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE  STRONG GROWTH IN OUR CUSTOM BETA STRATEGIES, WHICH INCLUDE PARAMETRIC\u2019S CUSTOM CORE EQUITY AND EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT\u2019S  LADDERED MUNICIPAL AND CORPORATE BOND SEPARATE ACCOUNT STRATEGIES. THESE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS COMBINE THE BENEFITS OF PASSIVE  INVESTING WITH THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE PORTFOLIOS TO MEET INDIVIDUAL PREFERENCES AND NEEDS. COMPARED TO INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS AND  EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS, CUSTOM CORE SEPARATE ACCOUNTS CAN PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH THE ABILITY TO TAILOR THEIR MARKET EXPOSURES TO ACHIEVE  BETTER TAX OUTCOMES AND TO REFLECT CLIENT-SPECIFIED RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CRITERIA AND OTHER DESIRED PORTFOLIO TILTS AND EXCLUSIONS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NET INFLOWS INTO OUR CUSTOM BETA STRATEGIES OFFERED AS INDIVIDUAL SEPARATE ACCOUNTS TOTALED  $3.9 BILLION, WHICH EQUATES TO ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH IN MANAGED ASSETS OF 19 PERCENT.  IN A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT FOR FLOATING-RATE BANK LOAN INVESTMENT  STRATEGIES, WE SAW NET OUTFLOWS OF $2.9 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AS INVESTORS REDUCED THEIR EXPOSURE TO BELOW  INVESTMENT GRADE CREDITS. OUR LINEUP OF FIXED INCOME MUTUAL FUNDS POSITIONED AS SHORT- OR ULTRA-SHORT DURATION, SHORT-TERM OR ADJUSTABLE-RATE,  WHICH INVEST PRIMARILY IN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT INSTRUMENTS, CONTINUED TO DEMONSTRATE STRONG APPEAL TO INVESTORS IN THE FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AMONG OUR LEADING FUNDS IN THIS CATEGORY ARE THE HIGHLY RATED EATON VANCE SHORT-DURATION GOVERNMENT INCOME  AND EATON VANCE SHORT-DURATION MUNICIPAL OPPORTUNITIES FUNDS, WHICH HAD COMBINED NET INFLOWS OF $1.8 BILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CONTINUES  TO EXPAND. THE CALVERT FUNDS ARE ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSIFIED FAMILIES OF RESPONSIBLY INVESTED MUTUAL FUNDS, ENCOMPASSING  ACTIVELY AND PASSIVELY MANAGED EQUITY, FIXED AND FLOATING-RATE INCOME, AND ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES MANAGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  THE CALVERT PRINCIPLES FOR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT OR OTHER RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. SINCE CALVERT BECAME PART OF EATON  VANCE, WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS GROWING MANAGED ASSETS IN CALVERT-BRANDED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES AND POSITIONING CALVERT  AS A CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) RESEARCH AND ENGAGEMENT. INCLUDING THE ATLANTA CAPITAL-SUBADVISED  CALVERT EQUITY FUND, ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT IN CALVERT STRATEGIES GREW TO $15.4 BILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2019 FROM $14.7 BILLION  AT OCTOBER 31, 2018, REFLECTING NET INFLOWS OF $0.6 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE APPRECIATION OF $0.1 BILLION. CALVERT\u2019S $0.6  BILLION OF NET INFLOWS FOR THE QUARTER EQUATES TO 17 PERCENT ANNUALIZED INTERNAL GROWTH RATE IN MANAGED ASSETS, RANKING AS THE  BEST GROWTH QUARTER SINCE WE ACQUIRED THE CALVERT BUSINESS JUST OVER TWO YEARS AGO.  WHILE CALVERT IS THE CENTERPIECE OF OUR RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT  STRATEGY, OUR COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE INVESTING DOES NOT END THERE. EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT CONTINUES TO INTEGRATE CONSIDERATION  OF RESPONSIBLE INVESTING CRITERIA INTO THE FIRM\u2019S FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH PROCESSES, CAPITALIZING ON CALVERT\u2019S PROPRIETARY  ESG RESEARCH. ATLANTA CAPITAL ALSO MAINTAINS A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, AND PARAMETRIC MANAGES OVER $20 BILLION  OF CLIENT ASSETS BASED ON CLIENT-DIRECTED RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT CRITERIA. ON AN OVERALL BASIS, EATON VANCE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST  PARTICIPANTS IN RESPONSIBLE INVESTING, A POSITION WE ARE COMMITTED TO GROWING IN CONJUNCTION WITH RISING DEMAND FOR INVESTMENT  STRATEGIES THAT INCORPORATE ESG-INTEGRATED INVESTMENT RESEARCH AND/OR ARE MANAGED WITH A DUAL OBJECTIVE TO ACHIEVE FAVORABLE INVESTMENT  RETURNS AND POSITIVE SOCIETAL IMPACT.  48  WHILE CHANGE IS A CONSTANT IN THE ASSET MANAGEMENT INDUSTRY,  THE PACE OF CHANGE APPEARS TO BE ACCELERATING. WE SEE THIS IN CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS, SHIFTS IN INVESTOR  SENTIMENT AND OUTLOOK, ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS STRATEGIES OF KEY INTERMEDIARIES AND GATEKEEPERS,  AND NEW TAX AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES. THROUGH CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS, WE STRIVE TO ANTICIPATE THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF INVESTORS  AND TO DEVELOP TIMELY SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. POSITIONING THE COMPANY FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS AMID ACCELERATING CHANGE  IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  TOGETHER WITH EATON VANCE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND TRUST, FILED AN EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION TO PERMIT THE OFFERING OF EXCHANGE-TRADED  FUNDS (ETFS) THAT WOULD EMPLOY A NOVEL METHOD OF SUPPORTING EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET TRADING OF FUND SHARES, WHICH WE CALL THE  CLEARHEDGE METHOD. BECAUSE DISCLOSURE OF CURRENT HOLDINGS WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY UNDER THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD, AN ETF\u2019S PORTFOLIO  TRADING ACTIVITY COULD REMAIN CONFIDENTIAL. IN CONJUNCTION WITH FILING THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD EXEMPTIVE APPLICATION, EATON VANCE  FORMED A NEW WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS, TO MANAGE THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ETFS UTILIZING  THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD AND OTHER FUND-RELATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THROUGH LICENSING AND SERVICES AGREEMENTS, EATON VANCE AND  ADVANCED FUND SOLUTIONS SEEK TO MAKE THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD BROADLY AVAILABLE ACROSS THE ETF INDUSTRY, INCLUDING ACTIVELY MANAGED  AND INDEX-BASED ETFS. WE BELIEVE THE CLEARHEDGE METHOD COULD BENEFIT ETF INVESTORS BY LOWERING THE COSTS THEY PAY TO BUY AND SELL  SHARES, MITIGATING THE PERFORMANCE IMPACT OF FRONT-RUNNING AND FREE-RIDING, AND FACILITATING THE INTRODUCTION OF PROPRIETARY ACTIVE  STRATEGIES NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AS ETFS.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, 68 OF OUR U.S. MUTUAL FUNDS WERE RATED  4 OR 5 STARS BY MORNINGSTAR  TM  FOR AT LEAST ONE CLASS OF SHARES, INCLUDING 30 FIVE-STAR RATED FUNDS. A GOOD SOURCE OF  PERFORMANCE-RELATED INFORMATION FOR OUR FUNDS IS OUR WEBSITE, WWW.EATONVANCE.COM. ON OUR WEBSITE, INVESTORS CAN ALSO OBTAIN OTHER  CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FUNDS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT POLICIES, PORTFOLIO CHARACTERISTICS,  EXPENSES AND MORNINGSTAR RATINGS.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT  PREVAILING EQUITY AND INCOME MARKET CONDITIONS AND INVESTOR  SENTIMENT AFFECT THE SALES AND REDEMPTIONS OF OUR INVESTMENT OFFERINGS, MANAGED ASSET LEVELS, OPERATING RESULTS AND THE RECOVERABILITY  OF OUR INVESTMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE S&P 500 INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. EQUITY MARKET PERFORMANCE,  HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF -0.8 PERCENT AND THE MSCI EMERGING MARKET INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF EMERGING MARKET EQUITY PERFORMANCE, HAD  TOTAL RETURNS OF 8.5 PERCENT. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, THE BARCLAYS U.S. AGGREGATE BOND INDEX, A BROAD MEASURE OF U.S. BOND MARKET  PERFORMANCE, HAD TOTAL RETURNS OF 3.4 PERCENT.  CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT OF $444.7 BILLION ON JANUARY  31, 2019 DECREASED $4.6 BILLION, OR 1 PERCENT, FROM $449.2 BILLION OF CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT ON JANUARY 31, 2018.  THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT REFLECTS NET INFLOWS OF $11.7 BILLION AND MARKET PRICE DECLINES  IN MANAGED ASSETS OF $16.3 BILLION.  49  THE FOLLOWING TABLES SUMMARIZE OUR CONSOLIDATED ASSETS UNDER  MANAGEMENT BY INVESTMENT MANDATE, INVESTMENT VEHICLE AND INVESTMENT AFFILIATE AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018.

WE MAINTAIN A $300 MILLION UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY  WITH SEVERAL BANKS THAT EXPIRES ON DECEMBER 11, 2023. THE FACILITY, WHICH WE ENTERED INTO ON DECEMBER 11, 2018, PROVIDES THAT WE  MAY BORROW AT LIBOR-BASED RATES OF INTEREST THAT VARY DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL OF USAGE OF THE FACILITY AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE  AGREEMENT CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS WITH RESPECT TO LEVERAGE AND INTEREST COVERAGE AND REQUIRES US TO PAY AN ANNUAL COMMITMENT  FEE ON ANY UNUSED PORTION. WE HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT JANUARY 31, 2019 OR AT ANY POINT DURING  THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL DEBT COVENANTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR LIQUIDITY DAILY. WE REMAIN COMMITTED  TO GROWING OUR BUSINESS AND RETURNING CAPITAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING LIQUID  ASSETS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENT AND FORECASTED  OPERATING CASH NEEDS. THE RISK EXISTS, HOWEVER, THAT IF WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL OR REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT IN THE FUTURE,  RESOURCES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. OUR ABILITY TO ENTER THE CAPITAL MARKETS IN  A TIMELY MANNER DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STATE OF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT  SPREADS AND OUR CREDIT RATINGS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS TO ISSUE NEW DEBT, REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT OR SELL SHARES  OF OUR NON-VOTING COMMON STOCK AS NEEDED, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, OUR BUSINESS COULD  BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE TEST OUR INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY METHOD INVESTEES, GOODWILL  AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, OR AS FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES  INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS IS WARRANTED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE FIRST THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EXISTS AT JANUARY 31, 2019.  69  WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR DEFERRED SALES COMMISSIONS AND AMORTIZING  IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AS EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.

SKKYNET\u2019S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE SET FORTH ON THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE RISKS SET FORTH IN SKKYNET\u2019S FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND CHANGES IN THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MAKING SUCH FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  SKKYNET IS A NEVADA CORPORATION HEADQUARTERED IN MISSISSAUGA, CANADA. SKKYNET OPERATES THREE DIFFERENT LINES OF BUSINESS THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES COGENT REAL-TIME SYSTEMS, INC. (\u201cCOGENT\u201d), SKKYNET, INC. (\u201cSKKYNET (USA)\u201d), SKKYNET CORP. (\u201cSKKYNET (CANADA)\u201d), AND SKKYNET JAPAN CORPORATION (\u201cFORMALLY NIC\u201d). SKKYNET WAS ESTABLISHED TO ENHANCE COGENT\u2019S EXISTING BUSINESS LINES THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF CLOUD-BASED SYSTEMS, AND TO DELIVER A SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE (\u201cSAAS\u201d) PRODUCT TARGETING THE INDUSTRIAL INTERNET OF THINGS (\u201cIOT\u201d) MARKET, NOW REFERRED TO BY THE TERMS \u201cINDUSTRY 4.0\u201d AND \u201cINDUSTRIAL INTERNET CONSORTIUM\u201d.  THE COMPANY PROVIDES SOFTWARE AND RELATED SYSTEMS AND FACILITIES TO COLLECT PROCESS AND DISTRIBUTE REAL-TIME INFORMATION OVER A NETWORK. THIS CAPABILITY ALLOWS THE CUSTOMERS TO BOTH LOCALLY AND REMOTELY MANAGE, SUPERVISE AND CONTROL INDUSTRIAL PROCESSES AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS. BY USING THIS SOFTWARE AND, WHEN REQUESTED BY A CLIENT, OUR WEB BASED ASSETS, OUR CLIENTS AND THEIR CUSTOMERS (TO THE EXTENT RELEVANT) ARE GIVEN THE ABILITY AND THE TOOLS TO OBSERVE AND INTERACT WITH THESE PROCESSES AND SERVICES IN REAL-TIME AS THEY ARE UNDERWAY AND TO GIVE THEM THE POWER TO ANALYZE, ALTER, STOP OR OTHERWISE INFLUENCE THESE ACTIVITIES TO CONFORM TO THEIR PLANS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, REVENUE WAS $293,129 COMPARED TO $382,879 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. REVENUE DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019 OVER SAME PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 BY 23.4%. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 IS ATTRIBUTED TO LOWER SALES BY THE COGENT AND SKKYNET JAPAN DIVISIONS, ON AN INTERNATIONAL BASIS, OF THE PRODUCTS OF THE COMPANY VERSES AN UNUSUALLY HIGH SALES FOR THE COMPANY IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS $447,604 FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $517,809 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS A RESULT OF LOWER OPERATING EXPENSE ALONG WITH LOWER PAYROLL IN 2019 OVER 2018.  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY POSTED OPERATING LOSS OF $160,749 COMPARED TO OPERATING LOSS OF $148,457 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING LOSS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SALES IN THE 2019 PERIOD OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, OFFSET PARTIALLY BY DECREASED EXPENSES IN CONSULTING, SALARIES, AND OFFICE EXPENSES IN THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS INCOME OF $6,437 COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE OF $20,645 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 DUE TO CURRENCY CHANGES.  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF $154,312 WAS RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OF $169,102 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE LOWER LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD IN 2019 CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO LOWER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND OTHER INCOME IN 2019 COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE IN 2018.  NET LOSS AFTER TAXES OF $154,312 WAS RECORDED FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS AFTER TAXES OF $169,102 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  THE COMPANY INCURRED A COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $165,963 FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO A COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF $135,682 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO NET LOSS WITH ACCRUED PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ALONG WITH TAXES TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT JANUARY 31, 2019, SKKYNET HAD CURRENT ASSETS OF $816,163 AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $277,843, RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL OF $538,320. ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS $5,501,335 WITH TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY OF $552,875.  NET CASH PROVIDED IN OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS $3,649 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $29,461 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATIONS DECREASED $33,110 PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN NET LOSS IN 2019 OVER 2018 OF WHICH $43,068 IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER OPTION DISCOUNTS IN 2019 OVER 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES, DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 WAS $0.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A MULTINATIONAL COMPANY WITH OPERATIONS  PRIMARILY IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENT INDUSTRIES. WE HAVE TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES  AND NET2PHONE (FORMERLY NET2PHONE-UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AS A SERVICE, OR UCAAS). OUR TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES  RETAIL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND PAYMENT OFFERINGS AS WELL AS WHOLESALE INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE TRAFFIC TERMINATION. OUR NET2PHONE  SEGMENT IS COMPRISED OF (1) CLOUD-BASED COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES OFFERED TO ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS MAINLY THROUGH VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS,  SERVICE PROVIDERS, TELECOM AGENTS AND MANAGED SERVICE PROVIDERS, (2) SESSION INITIATION PROTOCOL, OR SIP, TRUNKING, WHICH SUPPORTS  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CALLING FROM AN IP PBX, AND (3) CABLE TELEPHONY. OPERATING SEGMENTS NOT REPORTABLE  INDIVIDUALLY ARE INCLUDED IN ALL OTHER.  IN FISCAL 2019, WE MODIFIED THE WAY WE  REPORT OUR BUSINESS VERTICALS WITHIN OUR TELECOM & PAYMENT SERVICES AND NET2PHONE SEGMENTS TO ALIGN MORE CLOSELY WITH OUR BUSINESS  STRATEGY AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE. THE MODIFICATION TO THE BUSINESS VERTICALS DID NOT CHANGE THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ON MARCH 26, 2018, WE COMPLETED A PRO  RATA DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMMON STOCK OF OUR FORMER SUBSIDIARY, RAFAEL HOLDINGS, INC., OR RAFAEL, TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD  AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 13, 2018, WHICH WE REFER TO AS THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF. THE DISPOSITION OF RAFAEL DID NOT MEET  THE CRITERIA TO BE REPORTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION AND ACCORDINGLY, RAFAEL\u2019S ASSETS, LIABILITIES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  AND CASH FLOWS HAVE NOT BEEN RECLASSIFIED. AT THE TIME OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, RAFAEL OWNED THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS AND  INTERESTS IN TWO CLINICAL STAGE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES THAT WE PREVIOUSLY HELD. THE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS CONSISTED  OF OUR HEADQUARTERS BUILDING AND ITS ASSOCIATED PUBLIC GARAGE IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY, AN OFFICE/DATA CENTER BUILDING IN PISCATAWAY,  NEW JERSEY AND A PORTION OF A BUILDING IN ISRAEL THAT HOSTS OFFICES FOR US AND CERTAIN AFFILIATES. THE PHARMACEUTICAL HOLDINGS  INCLUDED DEBT INTERESTS AND WARRANTS IN RAFAEL PHARMACEUTICALS, INC., WHICH IS A CLINICAL STAGE, ONCOLOGY-FOCUSED PHARMACEUTICAL  COMPANY COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF THERAPIES THAT EXPLOIT THE METABOLIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN NORMAL CELLS  AND CANCER CELLS, AND A MAJORITY EQUITY INTEREST IN LIPOMEDIX PHARMACEUTICALS LTD., A PHARMACEUTICAL DEVELOPMENT COMPANY BASED  IN ISRAEL. IN ADDITION, PRIOR TO THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, WE TRANSFERRED ASSETS TO RAFAEL SUCH THAT, AT THE TIME OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF,  RAFAEL HAD $42.3 MILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, PLUS APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION IN HEDGE FUND AND  OTHER INVESTMENTS.  WE LEASE OFFICE SPACE AND PARKING IN RAFAEL\u2019S  BUILDING AND PARKING GARAGE LOCATED AT 520 BROAD ST, NEWARK, NEW JERSEY. WE ALSO LEASE OFFICE SPACE IN ISRAEL FROM RAFAEL. THE  LEASES EXPIRE IN APRIL 2025. IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, WE INCURRED RENT EXPENSE OF $0.5 MILLION AND $0.9  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN CONNECTION WITH THE RAFAEL LEASES.  24  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,  OR U.S. GAAP. OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN  OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL 2018. THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND  ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AS WELL AS THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE THAT REQUIRE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\u2019S MOST SUBJECTIVE OR  COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. OUR CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES INCLUDE THOSE RELATED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, GOODWILL, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCOME  TAXES AND REGULATORY AGENCY FEES, AND DIRECT COST OF REVENUES\u2014DISPUTED AMOUNTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER  FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES,  SEE OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON  FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL 2018.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD NOT YET ADOPTED  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD, OR FASB, ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE, OR ASU, NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , AND HAS SINCE ISSUED  AMENDMENTS THERETO, RELATED TO THE ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS \u201cASC 842\u201d). ASC 842ESTABLISHES  A RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) MODEL THAT REQUIRES A LESSEE TO RECORD A ROU ASSET AND A LEASE LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET  FOR ALL LEASES WITH TERMS LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS. LEASES WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER FINANCE OR OPERATING, WITH CLASSIFICATION  AFFECTING THE PATTERN OF EXPENSE RECOGNITION IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. WE WILL ADOPT ASC 842ON AUGUST 1, 2019. A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE  TRANSITION APPROACH IS REQUIRED FOR LESSEES FOR CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES EXISTING AT, OR ENTERED INTO AFTER, THE BEGINNING  OF THE EARLIEST COMPARATIVE PERIOD PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WITH CERTAIN PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AVAILABLE. ENTITIES  HAVE THE OPTION TO CONTINUE TO APPLY HISTORICAL ACCOUNTING UNDER TOPIC 840, INCLUDING ITS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, IN COMPARATIVE  PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. AN ENTITY THAT ELECTS THIS OPTION WILL RECOGNIZE A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE  OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION INSTEAD OF THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED. WE EXPECT TO ELECT TO  APPLY THE ASC 842 TRANSITION PROVISIONS BEGINNING ON AUGUST 1, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, WE WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY TOPIC 840 PRIOR TO  AUGUST 1, 2019, INCLUDING TOPIC 840 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, IN THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS PRESENTED. WE EXPECT TO ELECT THE PACKAGE  OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS FOR ALL OUR LEASES THAT COMMENCED BEFORE AUGUST 1, 2019. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING OUR REAL ESTATE  LEASES, OUR CONNECTIVITY AND FACILITY AGREEMENTS FOR OUR SERVERS AND ROUTING EQUIPMENT, AND OUR NET2PHONE-UCAAS TELEPHONE EQUIPMENT  CONTRACTS. WE EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 WILL MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR BALANCE SHEET AND HAVE AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN JUNE 2016, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU THAT  CHANGES THE IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND CERTAIN OTHER INSTRUMENTS. FOR RECEIVABLES, LOANS AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS,  ENTITIES WILL BE REQUIRED TO USE A NEW FORWARD-LOOKING \u201cEXPECTED LOSS\u201d MODEL THAT GENERALLY WILL RESULT IN THE EARLIER  RECOGNITION OF ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. FOR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES, ENTITIES WILL MEASURE CREDIT  LOSSES IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO CURRENT PRACTICE, EXCEPT THE LOSSES WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS ALLOWANCES INSTEAD OF REDUCTIONS IN THE  AMORTIZED COST OF THE SECURITIES. IN ADDITION, AN ENTITY WILL HAVE TO DISCLOSE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ALLOWANCES,  CREDIT QUALITY INDICATORS AND PAST DUE SECURITIES. THE NEW PROVISIONS WILL BE APPLIED AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED  EARNINGS. WE WILL ADOPT THE NEW STANDARD ON AUGUST 1, 2020. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THE NEW STANDARD WILL HAVE ON OUR  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2017, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU  INTENDED TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL REPORTING OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS TO BETTER PORTRAY THE ECONOMIC RESULTS OF AN ENTITY\u2019S  RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN ADDITION, THE ASU INCLUDES CERTAIN TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS TO SIMPLIFY  THE APPLICATION OF HEDGE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE IN U.S. GAAP. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US ON AUGUST 1, 2019. EARLY  APPLICATION IS PERMITTED. ENTITIES WILL APPLY THE AMENDMENTS TO CASH FLOW AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS THAT EXIST ON  THE DATE OF ADOPTION USING A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS WILL BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.  WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED AN ASU TO  SIMPLIFY SEVERAL ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS BY EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION\u2014STOCK COMPENSATION  , TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM  NONEMPLOYEES. AN ENTITY SHOULD APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS OF TOPIC 718 TO NONEMPLOYEE AWARDS EXCEPT FOR SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON INPUTS  TO AN OPTION PRICING MODEL AND THE ATTRIBUTION OF COST (THAT IS, THE PERIOD OF TIME OVER WHICH SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS VEST  AND THE PATTERN OF COST RECOGNITION OVER THAT PERIOD). THE AMENDMENTS SPECIFY THAT TOPIC 718 APPLIES TO ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENT  TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH A GRANTOR ACQUIRES GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED OR CONSUMED IN A GRANTOR\u2019S OWN OPERATIONS BY ISSUING  SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO CLARIFY THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY  PROVIDE (1) FINANCING TO THE ISSUER OR (2) AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF  A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  . THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS ASU ARE EFFECTIVE  FOR US ON AUGUST 1, 2019. WE ARE EVALUATING THE IMPACT THAT THIS ASU WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  25  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THREE  AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018  WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR OPERATING  BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED PRIMARILY ON INCOME (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCOME AND EXPENSE LINE ITEMS BELOW INCOME  (LOSS) FROM OPERATIONS ARE ONLY INCLUDED IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-09,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606)  , AND HAS SINCE ISSUED AMENDMENTS THERETO (COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS  \"ASC 606\"). THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF ASC 606 IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED  GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE  FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES, AND THE GUIDANCE DEFINES A FIVE-STEP PROCESS TO ACHIEVE THIS CORE PRINCIPLE. THE FIVE-STEP PROCESS  TO ACHIEVE THIS PRINCIPLE IS AS FOLLOWS: (I) IDENTIFY THE CONTRACT(S) WITH A CUSTOMER, (II) IDENTIFY THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT(S), (III) DETERMINE THE TRANSACTION PRICE, (IV) ALLOCATE THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE  OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT(S), AND (V) RECOGNIZE REVENUE WHEN, OR AS, THE ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. ASC  606 ALSO MANDATES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUES AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM  CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND CHANGES IN JUDGMENTS AND ASSETS RECOGNIZED FROM COSTS INCURRED TO OBTAIN  OR FULFILL A CONTRACT.  WE APPLIED ASC 606 TO THOSE CONTRACTS  THAT WERE NOT COMPLETED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018. FOR INCOMPLETE CONTRACTS THAT WERE MODIFIED BEFORE AUGUST 1, 2018, WE ELECTED TO  USE THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT AVAILABLE UNDER THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD, WHICH ALLOWS US TO AGGREGATE THE EFFECT OF ALL MODIFICATIONS  WHEN IDENTIFYING SATISFIED AND UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE AND ALLOCATING TRANSACTION  PRICE TO THE SATISFIED AND UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE MODIFIED CONTRACT AT TRANSITION. RESULTS FOR THE REPORTING  PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER AUGUST 1, 2018 ARE PRESENTED UNDER ASC 606, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO  BE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH HISTORIC ACCOUNTING UNDER ASC TOPIC 605.  WE ADOPTED ASC 606 AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018,  USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. AS THIS METHOD REQUIRES THAT THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF INITIALLY APPLYING ASC 606 BE RECOGNIZED  AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION, AT AUGUST 1, 2018, WE RECORDED AN $8.6 MILLION REDUCTION TO \u201cDEFERRED REVENUE\u201d, WITH AN OFFSETTING  REDUCTION TO \u201cACCUMULATED DEFICIT\u201d, FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION. THIS ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE CHANGE  IN ACCOUNTING FOR BREAKAGE PRIMARILY FROM OUR BOSS REVOLUTION INTERNATIONAL CALLING SERVICE, TRADITIONAL CALLING CARDS, AND INTERNATIONAL  AND DOMESTIC MOBILE TOP-UP. A CUSTOMER\u2019S NONREFUNDABLE PREPAYMENT GIVES THE CUSTOMER A RIGHT TO RECEIVE A GOOD OR SERVICE  IN THE FUTURE (AND OBLIGES US TO STAND READY TO TRANSFER A GOOD OR SERVICE). HOWEVER, CUSTOMERS MAY NOT EXERCISE ALL OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL  RIGHTS. THOSE UNEXERCISED RIGHTS ARE REFERRED TO AS BREAKAGE. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606, WE RECORDED BREAKAGE REVENUE WHEN  THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISING ITS REMAINING RIGHTS BECAME REMOTE. WE GENERALLY DEEMED THE LIKELIHOOD REMOTE AFTER 12  OR 24 MONTHS OF NO ACTIVITY. PER ASC 606, IF AN ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO A BREAKAGE AMOUNT, THE ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE  THE EXPECTED BREAKAGE AMOUNT AS REVENUE IN PROPORTION TO THE PATTERN OF RIGHTS EXERCISED BY THE CUSTOMER, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT  THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A SIGNIFICANT REVERSAL IN THE AMOUNT OF CUMULATIVE REVENUE RECOGNIZED WILL NOT OCCUR WHEN THE UNCERTAINTY  ASSOCIATED WITH THE BREAKAGE IS SUBSEQUENTLY RESOLVED. WE DETERMINED THAT $8.6 MILLION INCLUDED IN OUR OPENING BALANCE OF \u201cDEFERRED  REVENUE\u201d WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS BREAKAGE REVENUE UNDER ASC 606 IN PRIOR PERIODS, AND ACCORDINGLY, RECORDED THE CUMULATIVE  EFFECT ADJUSTMENT AS OF AUGUST 1, 2018.  IN ADDITION, ASC 606 CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING  FOR COSTS TO OBTAIN AND FULFILL CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS SUCH THAT INCREMENTAL COSTS OF OBTAINING AND DIRECT COSTS OF FULFILLING  CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED CONSISTENT WITH THE TRANSFER OF THE RELATED GOOD OR SERVICE.

THE CHANGE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR  PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT THAT WE RECORDED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED A NONCURRENT RECEIVABLE AND AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $3.3 MILLION FOR THE  ANTICIPATED REFUND OF AN AMT CREDIT CARRY-OVER BECAUSE OF \u201cTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.\u201d EXCLUDING THIS INCOME TAX BENEFIT,  THE CHANGES RELATE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF INCOME EARNED IN THE VARIOUS TAXING JURISDICTIONS.  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT  ENACTED \u201cAN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR RECONCILIATION PURSUANT TO TITLES II AND V OF THE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR  FISCAL YEAR 2018\u201d, WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cTHE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT,\u201d OR THE TAX ACT. THE TAX ACT  REDUCES THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0% EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, REQUIRES COMPANIES TO PAY  A ONE-TIME REPATRIATION TAX, OR TRANSITION TAX, ON EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY TAX DEFERRED,  AND MAKES OTHER CHANGES TO THE U.S. INCOME TAX CODE. DUE TO OUR JULY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE LOWER CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE IS  PHASED IN, RESULTING IN A BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 26.9% FOR OUR FISCAL 2018, AND 21.0% FOR OUR  FISCAL YEARS THEREAFTER.  31  WE HAVE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE  INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE TAX ACT. THE TRANSITION TAX IS BASED ON TOTAL POST-1986 EARNINGS AND PROFITS WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED  FROM U.S. INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL 2018, WE ESTIMATED THAT WE WILL UTILIZE $12 MILLION OF FEDERAL NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  TO OFFSET THE TRANSITION TAX THAT WE EXPECT WE WILL INCUR. IN FISCAL 2019, WE ADJUSTED THIS AMOUNT TO $11 MILLION OF FEDERAL NET  OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS USAGE. THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS HAVE A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND AS SUCH THERE IS  NO IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME  (\u201cGILTI\u201d) AND BASE EROSION ANTI-ABUSE TAX (\u201cBEAT\u201d) BECAME EFFECTIVE ON AUGUST 1, 2018. WE REVIEWED THE  PROPOSED GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IN SEPTEMBER 2018. AS A RESULT OF OUR FULLY RESERVED NET OPERATING  LOSSES IN THE UNITED STATES, WE CONCLUDED THERE WILL BE NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR TAX PROVISION AS A RESULT OF GILTI. WE CURRENTLY  BELIEVE THERE WILL BE NO IMPACT FROM THE BEAT.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR ASSUMPTIONS MAY  CHANGE AS A RESULT OF FUTURE GUIDANCE AND INTERPRETATION FROM THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, THE SEC, THE FASB, AND VARIOUS OTHER  TAXING JURISDICTIONS, AND ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE MADE AT THAT TIME.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS  . THE CHANGE IN THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SIMILAR PERIODS IN FISCAL 2018 WAS DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN THE NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS IN RAFAEL AS A RESULT OF THE RAFAEL SPIN-OFF, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING  INTERESTS IN CERTAIN IDT TELECOM SUBSIDIARIES DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE NET INCOME OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  GENERAL  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT OUR CASH FROM OPERATIONS  IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND THE BALANCE OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES THAT WE HELD AT JANUARY 31, 2019  TO BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH  PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020.  AT JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH  EQUIVALENTS AND DEBT SECURITIES OF $75.5 MILLION AND A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT (CURRENT LIABILITIES IN EXCESS OF CURRENT ASSETS)  OF $20.4 MILLION.  WE TREAT UNRESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  HELD BY IDT PAYMENT SERVICES AS SUBSTANTIALLY RESTRICTED AND UNAVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES. AT JANUARY 31, 2019, \u201cCASH AND  CASH EQUIVALENTS\u201d IN OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET INCLUDED AN AGGREGATE OF $13.9 MILLION HELD BY IDT PAYMENT SERVICES THAT  WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR OTHER PURPOSES.  ON AUGUST 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED THE ASU  RELATED TO THE CLASSIFICATION AND PRESENTATION OF CHANGES IN RESTRICTED CASH IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THE ASU REQUIRES THAT  A STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS EXPLAIN THE CHANGE DURING THE PERIOD IN THE TOTAL OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND AMOUNTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED  AS RESTRICTED CASH OR RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS. AMOUNTS GENERALLY DESCRIBED AS RESTRICTED CASH OR RESTRICTED CASH EQUIVALENTS  ARE INCLUDED WITH CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WHEN RECONCILING THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD AND END OF THE PERIOD TOTAL AMOUNTS SHOWN  ON THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. THIS ASU ALSO EFFECTED THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31,  2019  2018  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES   $38.0  $(23.3  )  INVESTING ACTIVITIES   (9.8  )  0.8  FINANCING ACTIVITIES   8.1  (10.2  )  EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   (0.2  )  9.5  INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS   $36.1  $(23.2  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY  FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND FROM YEAR TO YEAR, DEPENDING ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS AND  PAYMENTS, SPECIFICALLY TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND TRADE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  GROSS TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DECREASED  TO $53.2 MILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2019 FROM $72.6 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO COLLECTIONS IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY  31, 2019 IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS BILLED DURING THE PERIOD.  DEFERRED REVENUE ARISES FROM SALES OF  PREPAID PRODUCTS AND VARIES FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE MIX AND THE TIMING OF REVENUES. DEFERRED REVENUE DECREASED TO  $41.4 MILLION AT JANUARY 31, 2019 FROM $55.0 MILLION AT JULY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $8.6 MILLION NON-CASH REDUCTION TO DEFERRED  REVENUE, WITH AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO ACCUMULATED DEFICIT, FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 606 AS OF AUGUST  1, 2018. THE REMAINING DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN THE BOSS REVOLUTION INTERNATIONAL CALLING SERVICE AND TRADITIONAL  CALLING CARDS BALANCES.  32  THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT  RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF OF STRAIGHT PATH PROVIDES FOR US AND STRAIGHT PATH TO INDEMNIFY EACH OTHER FOR CERTAIN LIABILITIES. WE  AND STRAIGHT PATH EACH COMMUNICATED THAT IT WAS ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH THE INQUIRY DESCRIBED  ABOVE AND RELATED MATTERS. ON OCTOBER 24, 2017, WE, STRAIGHT PATH, STRAIGHT PATH IP GROUP, INC., OR SPIP, AND PR-SP IP HOLDINGS  LLC, OR PR-SP, AN ENTITY OWNED BY HOWARD S. JONAS, OUR CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND RELEASE THAT  PROVIDES FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE SETTLEMENT AND MUTUAL RELEASE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS THAT MAY EXIST OR ARISE  UNDER THE SEPARATION AND DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND STRAIGHT PATH. IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MUTUAL RELEASE, IN OCTOBER 2017,  WE PAID STRAIGHT PATH AN AGGREGATE OF $16 MILLION IN CASH, STRAIGHT PATH TRANSFERRED TO US ITS MAJORITY OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN STRAIGHT  PATH IP GROUP HOLDING, INC., OR NEW SPIP, WHICH HOLDS THE EQUITY OF SPIP, THE ENTITY THAT HOLDS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PRIMARILY  RELATED TO COMMUNICATIONS OVER COMPUTER NETWORKS, SUBJECT TO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE 22% OF THE NET PROCEEDS, IF ANY, RECEIVED BY  SPIP FROM LICENSES, SETTLEMENTS, AWARDS OR JUDGMENTS INVOLVING ANY OF THE PATENT RIGHTS AND CERTAIN TRANSFERS OF THE PATENTS OR  RELATED RIGHTS, THAT WILL BE RETAINED BY STRAIGHT PATH\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS (SUCH EQUITY INTEREST, SUBJECT TO THE RETAINED INTEREST  RIGHT, THE \u201cIP INTEREST\u201d), AND WE UNDERTOOK CERTAIN FUNDING AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO SPIP. THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT  AND RELEASE ALLOCATES (I) $10 MILLION OF THE PAYMENT AND THE RETAINED INTEREST RIGHT TO THE SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS AND THE MUTUAL  RELEASE AND (II) $6 MILLION TO THE TRANSFER OF THE IP INTEREST. IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS IN  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, $10 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PAYMENT TO STRAIGHT PATH WAS INCLUDED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  AND $6 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PAYMENT WAS INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  IN AUGUST 2017, WE ENTERED INTO A RECIPROCAL  SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH A TELECOM OPERATOR IN CENTRAL AMERICA FOR A FULL RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TERMINATION  OF INBOUND AND OUTBOUND INTERNATIONAL LONG-DISTANCE VOICE CALLS. WE HAVE COMMITTED TO PAY SUCH TELECOM OPERATOR MONTHLY COMMITTED  AMOUNTS DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PARTIES MAY RENEGOTIATE THE AMOUNT  OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS. IN THE EVENT THE PARTIES DO NOT AGREE ON RE-PRICING TERMS AFTER GOOD FAITH NEGOTIATIONS, THEN EITHER PARTY  HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, IN SEPTEMBER 2017, WE DEPOSITED $11.75 MILLION INTO AN ESCROW  ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE TELECOM OPERATOR, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS. IN FISCAL 2018, THE ESCROW ACCOUNT BALANCE WAS REDUCED TO $9.2 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN \u201cOTHER  CURRENT ASSETS\u201d AT JANUARY 31, 2019 AND JULY 31, 2018 IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BASED ON THE TERMS AND  CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $9.4 MILLION  AND $10.9 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020 WILL BE $19 MILLION TO $22 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  WITH OUR NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES ON HAND.  ON SEPTEMBER 14, 2018, WE ACQUIRED 100%  OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF VERSATURE, A SAAS BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS SOLUTIONS AND HOSTED VOIP PROVIDER SERVING THE CANADIAN  MARKET.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2017, WE SOLD OUR ENTIRE  MAJORITY INTERESTS IN NEW SPIP TO PR-SP IN EXCHANGE FOR $6 MILLION AND THE ASSUMPTION BY PR-SP OF OUR FUNDING AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, $6 MILLION OF THE AGGREGATE PAYMENT TO STRAIGHT PATH THAT WAS ALLOCATED TO THE TRANSFER OF THE IP INTEREST  WAS INCLUDED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE  NIL AND $19.8 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. PROCEEDS FROM MATURITIES AND SALES OF MARKETABLE  SECURITIES WERE $4.6 MILLION AND $31.6 MILLION IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018,  WE PAID CASH DIVIDENDS OF $0.38 PER SHARE ON OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK AND CLASS B COMMON STOCK, OR $9.4 MILLION IN TOTAL.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2018, WE SOLD 2,546,689  SHARES OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK THAT WERE HELD IN TREASURY TO HOWARD S. JONAS FOR AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION OF $14.8 MILLION.  THE PRICE PER SHARE OF $5.89 WAS EQUAL TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF OUR CLASS B COMMON STOCK ON APRIL 16, 2018, THE LAST CLOSING PRICE  BEFORE APPROVAL OF THE SALE BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND ITS CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE. ON MAY 31, 2018, MR.

AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION IN SEPTEMBER  2018, VERSATURE HAD FINANCING-RELATED OTHER LIABILITIES OF $0.7 MILLION. DURING THE PERIOD FROM THE ACQUISITION TO JANUARY 31,  2019, WE REPAID $0.6 MILLION OF THESE LIABILITIES.  33  AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2018, IDT TELECOM, INC.,  OR IDT TELECOM, ENTERED INTO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH TD BANK, N.A.

WE HAVE AN EXISTING STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM  AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN AGGREGATE OF 8.0 MILLION SHARES OF OUR CLASS B COMMON  STOCK.

THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES UNDER THE PROGRAM IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018. AT JANUARY 31, 2019,  6.9 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  IN THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND 2018, WE PAID $16,000 AND $0.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO REPURCHASE 2,036 AND 5,170 SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR CLASS B COMMON  STOCK THAT WERE TENDERED BY EMPLOYEES OF OURS TO SATISFY THE EMPLOYEES\u2019 TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH THE  LAPSING OF RESTRICTIONS ON AWARDS OF RESTRICTED STOCK. SUCH SHARES WERE REPURCHASED BY US BASED ON THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE ON THE  TRADING DAY IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE.

WE INTEND TO, WHERE APPROPRIATE, MAKE  STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS TO COMPLEMENT, EXPAND, AND/OR ENTER INTO NEW BUSINESSES. IN CONSIDERING ACQUISITIONS AND  INVESTMENTS, WE SEARCH FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO PROFITABLY GROW OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES AND/OR TO ADD QUALITATIVELY TO THE RANGE AND  DIVERSIFICATION OF BUSINESSES IN OUR PORTFOLIO. AT THIS TIME, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL BE PRESENTED WITH ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES  THAT MEET OUR RETURN ON INVESTMENT CRITERIA, OR THAT OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS THAT MEET OUR CRITERIA WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  TOROTEL, INC. (\"TOROTEL\") CONDUCTS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, TOROTEL PRODUCTS, INC. (\"TOROTEL PRODUCTS\"). THE TERMS \u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d AND THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d AS USED HEREIN INCLUDE TOROTEL AND ALL OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING TOROTEL PRODUCTS, UNLESS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. TOROTEL SPECIALIZES IN THE CUSTOM DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRECISION MAGNETIC COMPONENTS CONSISTING OF TRANSFORMERS, INDUCTORS, REACTORS, CHOKES, TOROIDAL COILS, HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSFORMERS, DRY-TYPE TRANSFORMERS AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES FOR USE IN MILITARY, COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS. THESE PRODUCTS ARE USED TO MODIFY AND CONTROL ELECTRICAL VOLTAGES AND CURRENTS IN ELECTRONIC DEVICES. TOROTEL SELLS THESE PRODUCTS TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS, WHICH USE THEM IN APPLICATIONS SUCH AS.  \u00b7  AIRCRAFT NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT;  \u00b7  DIGITAL CONTROL DEVICES;  \u00b7  AIRPORT RUNWAY LIGHTING DEVICES;  \u00b7  MEDICAL EQUIPMENT;  \u00b7  AVIONICS SYSTEMS;  \u00b7  RADAR SYSTEMS;  \u00b7  DOWN-HOLE DRILLING;  \u00b7  CONVENTIONAL MISSILE GUIDANCE SYSTEMS; AND  \u00b7  OTHER AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE APPLICATIONS.  TOROTEL MARKETS ITS COMPONENTS PRIMARILY THROUGH AN INTERNAL SALES FORCE AND INDEPENDENT MANUFACTURERS\u2019 REPRESENTATIVES PAID ON A COMMISSION BASIS.  THESE COMMISSIONS ARE EARNED WHEN A PRODUCT IS SOLD AND/OR SHIPPED TO A CUSTOMER WITHIN THE REPRESENTATIVE\u2019S ASSIGNED TERRITORY.  TOROTEL ALSO UTILIZES ITS ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT IN ITS DIRECT SALES EFFORTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPANDING ITS REACH INTO NEW MARKETS AND/OR CUSTOMERS.  THE INDUSTRY MIX OF THE CUSTOMERS THAT ACCOUNTED FOR TOROTEL\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING APRIL 30, 2019 (\u201cFISCAL YEAR 2019\u201d) WAS 47%  DEFENSE, 48% COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE, AND 5% INDUSTRIAL COMPARED TO 51% DEFENSE, 44% COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE, AND 5% INDUSTRIAL FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING APRIL 30, 2018 (\u201cFISCAL YEAR 2018\u201d).  APPROXIMATELY 91% OF TOROTEL\u2019S SALES DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM DOMESTIC CUSTOMERS.  TOROTEL IS AN APPROVED SOURCE FOR MAGNETIC COMPONENTS USED IN NUMEROUS MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE SYSTEMS, WHICH MEANS TOROTEL IS AUTOMATICALLY SOLICITED FOR ANY PROCUREMENT NEEDS FOR SUCH APPLICATIONS.  THE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS MANUFACTURED BY TOROTEL ARE SOLD PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND MOST SALES ARE AWARDED ON A COMPETITIVE BID BASIS.  THE MARKETS IN WHICH TOROTEL COMPETES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.  A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF COMPANIES SELL COMPONENTS OF THE TYPE MANUFACTURED AND SOLD BY TOROTEL.  IN ADDITION, TOROTEL SELLS TO A NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF MANUFACTURING THEIR OWN ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS.  THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF COMPETITION FOR ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETS SERVED BY TOROTEL INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, PRICE, ON-TIME DELIVERY PERFORMANCE, LEAD TIMES, CUSTOMIZED PRODUCT ENGINEERING AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, MARKETING CAPABILITIES, QUALITY ASSURANCE, MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY, AND EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS\u2019 ENGINEERS.  WHILE WE BELIEVE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS ARE GENERALLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, TOROTEL\u2019S SALES, WHICH DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MARKET, ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DECLINE GIVEN THE COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE MARKET.  BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS  DEFENSE MARKETS  DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEARS 2019 AND 2018 THE AMOUNT OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES DERIVED FROM CONTRACTS WITH PRIME CONTRACTORS OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (\u201cDOD\u201d) WAS APPROXIMATELY  47%  AND 51%  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESPECTIVELY. AS A RESULT, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD COULD BE IMPACTED SUBSTANTIALLY BY SPENDING CUTS OR INCREASES IN THE DOD BUDGET AND THE FUNDS APPROPRIATED FOR CERTAIN MILITARY PROGRAMS.  DESPITE ONGOING UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOD BUDGET, WE BELIEVE OUR OVERALL DEFENSE BUSINESS OUTLOOK REMAINS FAVORABLE DUE TO THE PRESENT DEMAND FOR THE POTTED COIL ASSEMBLY AND OTHER EXISTING ORDERS FROM MAJOR DEFENSE CONTRACTORS. AS OF JANUARY 31,  2019, OUR CONSOLIDATED ORDER BACKLOG FOR THE DEFENSE MARKET WAS NEARLY $12.2 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $5.9 MILLION FOR THE POTTED COIL ASSEMBLY.  COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS  WE PROVIDE MAGNETIC COMPONENTS AND ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES FOR A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS. THE PRIMARY DEMAND DRIVERS FOR THESE MARKETS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ORDERS, OIL AND GAS DRILLING EXPLORATION ACTIVITY, AND GENERAL ECONOMIC GROWTH. WHILE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH REMAINS POSITIVE, THE ABOVE DEMAND DRIVERS COULD BE IMPACTED BY SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY SUCH AS SPIKES OR DECLINES IN THE PRICE OF OIL, WAR, TERRORISM, OR CHANGES IN REGULATION. OTHER THREATS TO OUR ANTICIPATED POSITIVE NEAR-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKET OUTLOOK INCLUDE DELAYS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COMPETITION FROM INTERNATIONAL SUPPLIERS. AS OF JANUARY 31,  2019, OUR CONSOLIDATED ORDER BACKLOG FOR THE AEROSPACE AND INDUSTRIAL MARKETS WAS $4.3 MILLION. HOWEVER, A MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS HAS BEEN CONVERTED TO LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS.  BUSINESS OUTLOOK  OUR BACKLOG AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 AS COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2018 INCREASED FROM $10.1 MILLION TO $16.5 MILLION, A 63% INCREASE. THIS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN MAGNETICS AND ASSEMBLY ORDERS.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL IMPROVE FROM NET SALES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2018. THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF NEWER PROGRAM REVENUE THAT IS PROJECTED TO SHIP IN FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE ANTICIPATE THAT 34% AND 62% OF OUR $16.5 MILLION BACKLOG AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019 IS EXPECTED TO SHIP AND BE CONVERTED TO SALES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, AND IN THE ENSUING TWELVE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, RESPECTIVELY.  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENT COMMENTS REGARDING TOROTEL\u2019S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND OUTLOOK SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT.  THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE OPERATIONS OF TOROTEL AND ITS SUBSIDIARY TOROTEL PRODUCTS AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019.

CONSOLIDATED NET SALES INCREASED PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF  INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES COMBINED WITH INCREASED DEMAND IN LARGE TRANSFORMERS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR BOTH THE THREE MONTHS AND THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MONTH PERIOD AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE IMPACTED FAVORABLY BY THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER  ASC 606  IN THE AMOUNTS OF $536,000 AND $1,003,000, RESPECTIVELY.

CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE APPROXIMATE $487,000 INCREASE IN COSTS OF GOODS SOLD DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018, WHICH INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF PRODUCTS WITH A HIGHER MATERIAL CONTENT AND INCREASED DIRECT LABOR COSTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT INCREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES ARISING FROM INCREASED DEMAND IN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES COMBINED WITH INCREASED DEMAND IN LARGE TRANSFORMERS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANAURY 31, 2019 WHEN COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD AND NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDING JANUARY 31, 2019 WAS IMPACTED FAVORABLY BY THE NEW REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARD UNDER  ASC 606  IN THE AMOUNTS OF $233,000 AND $496,000, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED 4%, OR $51,000 AND 5%, OR $193,000 IN THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31,  2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.

FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO INCOME TAXES, SEE NOTE 5 OF NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY  CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS TOGETHER WITH THE BORROWING UNDER OUR LINES OF CREDIT ARE OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE HIGHLIGHTS THE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE TO US AS OF JANUARY 31,  2019 COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2018.  2019  2018  CASH  $40,000  $409,000  AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER OUR BUILDING LINE OF CREDIT  -  35,000  AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER OUR EQUIPMENT LOAN  196,000  400,000  AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER OUR WORKING CAPITAL LINE OF CREDIT  222,000  655,000  TOTAL FUNDS AVAILABLE  $458,000  $1,499,000  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018.  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(590,000)  $(462,000)  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $128,000 DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 VERSUS THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE 2018 FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN INVENTORIES, CONTRACT ASSETS, AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND OPERATING LOSSES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(108,000)  $(52,000)  THE INCREASE OF $56,000 IN NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 WAS DUE TO HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF DESIGN ENGINEERING SOFTWARE.  WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURE SPENDING TO RISE MODERATELY DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE ANTICIPATED NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $163,000  $625,000  THE CHANGE OF $462,000 FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL YEAR 2018 IS DUE PRIMARILY TO PROCEEDS FROM THE LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL YEAR 2018.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE PROJECTED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO SUPPLEMENT OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, BASED ON HISTORICAL LEVELS. OUR ASSET-BASED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND GUIDANCE LINE OF CREDIT ARE SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 19, 2019.  WE EXPECT TO RENEW EACH OF THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS, IF DEEMED NECESSARY.  AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019,  WE HAD $1,028,000 DRAWN ON THE $1,250,000 ASSET-BASED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT AND $54,000 DRAWN ON THE $250,000 GUIDANCE LINE OF CREDIT, PRIMARILY UTILIZED TO FINANCE EQUIPMENT.   AS OF JANUARY 31, 2019  OUR TOTAL BORROWING CAPACITY IS APPROXIMATELY $1,500,000, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $1,082,000 HAS BEEN DRAWN, UNDER OUR EXISTING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS, PLUS $40,000 OF CASH ON HAND.  WE BELIEVE THAT INFLATION WILL HAVE ONLY A MINIMAL EFFECT ON FUTURE OPERATIONS SINCE SUCH EFFECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OFFSET BY SALES PRICE INCREASES, WHICH ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT UPON DEMAND.

MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  CERTAIN STATEMENTS MADE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q ARE  \u201c  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  \u201d  (WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995) IN REGARD TO THE PLANS AND OBJECTIVES OF MANAGEMENT FOR FUTURE OPERATIONS. SUCH STATEMENTS INVOLVE KNOWN AND UNKNOWN RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS OF THE REGISTRANT TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANY FUTURE RESULTS, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PLANS AND OBJECTIVES ARE BASED, IN PART, ON ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THE CONTINUED EXPANSION OF BUSINESS. ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO THE FOREGOING INVOLVE JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUTURE ECONOMIC, COMPETITIVE AND MARKET CONDITIONS AND FUTURE BUSINESS DECISIONS, ALL OF WHICH ARE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT ACCURATELY AND MANY OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE REASONABLE, ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS COULD PROVE INACCURATE AND, THEREFORE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT WILL PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES INHERENT IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN, THE INCLUSION OF SUCH INFORMATION SHOULD NOT BE REGARDED AS A REPRESENTATION BY THE REGISTRANT OR ANY OTHER PERSON THAT THE OBJECTIVES AND PLANS OF THE REGISTRANT WILL BE ACHIEVED.  SUBSTANTIAL RISKS EXIST WITH RESPECT TO AN INVESTMENT IN THE COMPANY. THESE RISKS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (  \u201c  COMMISSION  \u201d  ) ON JULY 30, 2018. MORE BROADLY, THESE FACTORS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u25cf  WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES AND EXPECT TO INCUR FUTURE LOSSES;  \u25cf  OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL CONDITION AND IMMEDIATE NEED FOR CAPITAL;  \u25cf  POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT DILUTION RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE OF NEW SECURITIES FOR ANY FUNDING, DEBT CONVERSION  OR ANY BUSINESS COMBINATION; AND  \u25cf  WE ARE A  \u201c  PENNY STOCK  \u201d  COMPANY.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM (  \u201c  WE,  \u201d  \u201c  US,  \u201d  \u201c  OUR,  \u201d  OR THE  \u201c  COMPANY  \u201d  ) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON MAY 7, 1975, UNDER THE NAME VITA PLUS, INC. THE NAME WAS LATER CHANGED TO VITA PLUS INDUSTRIES, INC. AND IN 2000 THE COMPANY  \u2019  S NAME WAS CHANGED TO ITS CURRENT NAME PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE  \u201c  EXCHANGE ACT  \u201d  ). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW.  DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)       FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)      INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF  JANUARY 31  , 201  9  , THE COMPANY HAS $0 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED.  CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE.  OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE  AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  JANUARY 31  , 201  9  ,  THE COMPANY HAD ASSETS OF $7  ,000  IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES. THIS COMPARES WITH CURRENT ASSETS OF $3,333 IN RESPECT OF CERTAIN PREPAID EXPENSES AS OF APRIL 30, 2018. THE COMPANY  \u2019  S CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF  JANUARY  31  , 201  9  TOTALED $337,787  , $1,850  RELATING TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUALS AND $3  35  ,  937  OF ADVANCES FROM  RELATED PARTIES  . THIS COMPARES WITH CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $263,745 AS OF APRIL 30, 2018, COMPRISING $8,720 OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND $255,025 DUE TO RELATED PARTIES. THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO SATISFY ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY  \u2019  S CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY (USED IN) OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY  31  , 201  9  AND 201  8  .

BY COMPARISON, DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUA  R  Y  31, 201  8  , THE COMPAN  Y INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $87,271  WHICH, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR AN INCREASE IN PREPAYMENTS OF $5,833  AND AN INCREA  SE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $5,381  RESULTED IN NET CASH OF $87,723  BEING USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DURING THE PERIOD.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE COMPANY NEITHER GENERATED NOR USED FUNDS IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY  31, 201  9  AND 201  8.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY  31,  201  9  , THE COMPANY RECEIVED $80,912  BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM A RELATED PARTY ENTITY. BY COMPARISON, DURING THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31  , 201  8  , THE COMPANY RECEIVED $87,723  BY WAY OF ADVANCES FROM TWO RELATED PARTY ENTITIES.  THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE RECEIPT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR OTHER FINANCING TO FUND ITS ONGOING OPERATIONS AND TO EXECUTE ITS BUSINESS PLAN OF SEEKING A COMBINATION WITH A PRIVATE OPERATING COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN RELATED PARTIES TO PROVIDE CONTINUED FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY OR THAT THE RELATED PARTIES WILL CONTINUE TO FUND THE COMPANY  \u2019  S WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS. AS A RESULT, THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE.  IT IS MANAGEMENT  \u2019  S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY  \u2019  S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $8,607, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $27,810, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY  \u2019  S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K AND FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

OVERVIEW AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  WE ARE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND SALE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND PRODUCTS UTILIZED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS.  UTILIZING OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM, WE PROVIDE SELECT SERVICES TO PHARMACEUTICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES SEEKING PERSONALIZED APPROACHES TO DRUG DEVELOPMENT. BY PERFORMING STUDIES TO PREDICT THE EFFICACY OF ONCOLOGY DRUGS, OUR PLATFORM FACILITATES DRUG DISCOVERY WITH LOWER COSTS AND INCREASED SPEED OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS INCREASED ADOPTION OF EXISTING DRUGS.  OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES A NOVEL APPROACH TO SIMULATING THE RESULTS OF HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS USED IN DEVELOPING ONCOLOGY DRUGS. ACCORDING TO A 2013 STUDY CONDUCTED BY CUTTING EDGE INFORMATION, IT CAN COST UP TO $100,000 PER PATIENT IN ONCOLOGY CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE TYPICAL COST FOR EACH PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT PER YEAR INCREASES FROM APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION IN THE PRE-CLINICAL SETTING TO APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN PHASE III. SIMULATING TRIALS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM PROVIDES BENEFITS TO BOTH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND PATIENTS. PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES CAN LOWER THE RISK OF SPENDING RESOURCES ON DRUGS THAT DO NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT ANTI-CANCER ACTIVITIES AND INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT THE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT PATH THEY PURSUE WILL BE FOCUSED ON AN APPROPRIATE PATIENT POPULATION AND A SUCCESSFUL COMBINATION WITH OTHER DRUGS.  WE PLAN TO CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND OUR TUMORGRAFT TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM IN ORDER TO EXPAND OUR TOS PROGRAM. OUR POS PROGRAM WILL NOT BE THE FOCUS OF OUR GROWTH MOVING FORWARD.  21  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS HAVE TYPICALLY ARISEN FROM THE FUNDING OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS, WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, AND OTHER STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE MET THESE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CASH, WORKING CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN PRIVATE PLACEMENTS AND PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF OUR SECURITIES AND SALES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY  $381,000  AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS OF  $1.6 MILLION  .  AS OF  JANUARY 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF APPROXIMATELY $70.4 MILLION  , NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF  $177,000  AND CASH OF  $3.3 MILLION  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH ON HAND, TOGETHER WITH CONTINUED IMPROVED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND OPERATIONS THROUGH AT LEAST  MARCH 2020  . SHOULD THE COMPANY BE REQUIRED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT MANAGEMENT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING SUCH CAPITAL ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, IF AT ALL.

THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS DUE TO LAB COSTS AND SALARIES RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS.  SALES AND MARKETING  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $879,000  AND  $627,000  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $252,000  , OR  40.2%  . SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WAS  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $1.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF  $276,000  OR  14.8%  .  THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THREE AND NINE MONTH PERIODS IS MAINLY DUE TO COMMISSIONS PAID TO THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT TEAM ON BOOKINGS.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  WERE  $1.2 MILLION  AND  $1.0 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  $219,000  , OR  21.8%  .  THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND SALARY EXPENSES.

CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $693,000  AND  $1.0 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.4 MILLION  AND  $19,000  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS.

(\u201cFEDEX LOGISTICS\u201d (FORMERLY FEDEX TRADE NETWORKS, INC.)) OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN \u201cCORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS\u201d IN OUR SEGMENT REPORTING. PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE KEY INDICATORS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND OUR OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDE.  \u2022  THE OVERALL CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR OUR VARIOUS SERVICES BASED ON MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY;  \u2022  THE VOLUMES OF TRANSPORTATION SERVICES PROVIDED THROUGH OUR NETWORKS, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY OUR AVERAGE DAILY VOLUME AND SHIPMENT WEIGHT AND SIZE;  \u2022  THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS;  \u2022  THE PRICES WE OBTAIN FOR OUR SERVICES, PRIMARILY MEASURED BY YIELD (REVENUE PER PACKAGE OR POUND OR REVENUE PER SHIPMENT OR HUNDREDWEIGHT FOR LTL FREIGHT SHIPMENTS);  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE (CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OPERATING EXPENSES) TO MATCH SHIFTING VOLUME LEVELS; AND  \u2022  THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL PRICES AND OUR ABILITY TO RECOVER INCREMENTAL FUEL COSTS THROUGH OUR FUEL SURCHARGES.  MANY OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES ARE DIRECTLY IMPACTED BY REVENUE AND VOLUME LEVELS, AND WE EXPECT THESE OPERATING EXPENSES TO FLUCTUATE ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THEREFORE, THE DISCUSSION OF OPERATING EXPENSE CAPTIONS FOCUSES ON THE KEY DRIVERS AND TRENDS IMPACTING EXPENSES OTHER THAN THOSE FACTORS STRICTLY RELATED TO CHANGES IN REVENUES AND VOLUMES. THE LINE ITEM \u201cOTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\u201d INCLUDES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUTSIDE SERVICE CONTRACTS (SUCH AS FACILITY SERVICES AND CARGO HANDLING, TEMPORARY LABOR AND SECURITY), PROFESSIONAL FEES, INSURANCE, UNIFORMS AND TAXES AND LICENSES.  EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED, REFERENCES TO YEARS INDICATE OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDING MAY 31, 2019 OR ENDED MAY 31 OF THE YEAR REFERENCED AND COMPARISONS ARE TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES US TO REPORT ONLY THE SERVICE COST COMPONENT IN THE SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS LINE ITEM. THE OTHER COMPONENTS OF NET BENEFIT COST ARE REQUIRED TO BE PRESENTED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT IN OTHER INCOME, OUTSIDE OF INCOME FROM OPERATIONS. THIS NEW GUIDANCE IMPACTS OPERATING INCOME AND MARGIN BUT HAS NO IMPACT ON NET INCOME OR EARNINGS PER SHARE. WE HAVE APPLIED THESE CHANGES RETROSPECTIVELY.  OVERVIEW  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME IMPROVED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, VOLUME GROWTH, THE FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF FUEL AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX FREIGHT AND FEDEX GROUND. LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED OUR RESULTS BY APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019, SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUMES AT FEDEX EXPRESS. LOWER WEIGHTS IN U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE SHIPMENTS AT FEDEX EXPRESS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS. COMPOUNDING THESE FACTORS, WE ALSO EXPERIENCED A PRODUCT MIX SHIFT TO LOWER YIELDING SERVICES DUE IN PART TO AN INCREASE IN E-COMMERCE TRAFFIC AT FEDEX EXPRESS. IN ADDITION, HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS, RESULTING FROM INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AT FEDEX GROUND AND EXPANDING THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SIX DAYS YEAR-ROUND, STARTING IN JANUARY 2019, NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OUR RESULTS. COMPARABLES FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 ARE AFFECTED BY THE IMPACT OF THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, WHICH REDUCED EARNINGS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2018 BY APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION ($1.14 PER DILUTED SHARE). WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS IN 2019 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON COMPARISONS TO 2018 FOR EITHER THE THIRD-QUARTER OR NINE-MONTH PERIODS.  - 32  -  THE COMPARISON OF NET INCOME BETWEEN 2019 AND 2018 IS SIGNIFICANTLY  AFFECTED BY A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.15 BILLION ($4.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\u201cTCJA\u201d) RECOGNIZED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018, SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED  TAX LIABILITY.  N  ET INCOME FOR THE T  HIRD QUARTER OF 2019 INCLUDES  TAX BENEFIT  S  OF $90 MILLION ($0.  34 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM THE REDUCTION  OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS  AND  $60 MILLION ($0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE) PRIMARILY RELATE  D TO A LOWER STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE UNDER THE TCJA. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  TAX EXPENSE OF $50 MILLION ($0.19 PER DILUTED SHARE)  RELATED TO  A  RECENTLY ENACTED  LOWER TAX RATE  IN THE NETHERLANDS APPLIED TO  OUR DEFERRED TAX  BALANCES.  ADDITIONA  LLY, W  E RECOGNIZED AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF APPROXIMATELY  $2  30  MILLION ($0.86  PER DILUTED SHARE)  IN THE  NINE MONTHS  OF 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO A LOWER STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE  UNDER  THE TCJA. O  UR RESULTS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 INCLUDED TAX BENEF  IT  S  OF $204 MILLION ($0.75 PER DILUTED SHARE) FROM A $1.5 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO OUR TAX-QUALIFIED U.S. DOMESTIC PENSION PLANS (\u201cU.S. PENSION PLANS\u201d) IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND $165 MILLION ($0.60 PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO THE PHASE-IN OF A REDUCED STATUTOR  Y TAX RATE ON 2018 YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION  ($0.44 PER DILUTED SHARE)  WAS  RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND  ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018  EARNINGS.  SEE THE \u201cINCOME TAXES\u201d SECTION BELOW FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  WE INCURRED TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES TOTALING $69 MILLION ($55 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, A $37 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES WERE $304 MILLION ($243 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.92 PER DILUTED SHARE) IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, A $37 MILLION DECREASE FROM THE NINE MONTHS OF 2018. THE INTEGRATION EXPENSES ARE PREDOMINANTLY INCREMENTAL COSTS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTEGRATION OF TNT EXPRESS, INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL AND LEGAL FEES, SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, TRAVEL AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES, AND INCLUDE ANY RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AT TNT EXPRESS. INTERNAL SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE INCLUDED ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE INDIVIDUALS ARE ASSIGNED FULL-TIME TO INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES. THESE COSTS WERE INCURRED AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX CORPORATE. THE IDENTIFICATION OF THESE COSTS AS INTEGRATION-RELATED EXPENDITURES IS SUBJECT TO OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  - 33  -  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS FOR FEDEX  EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT SHOW SELECTED VOLUME TRENDS (IN THOUSANDS) OVER THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  (1)  INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC AVERAGE DAILY PACKAGE VOLUME RELATES TO OUR INTERNATIONAL INTRA-COUNTRY OPERATIONS.  - 34  -  THE FOLLOWING GRAPHS FOR  FEDEX EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT SHOW SELECTED YIELD TRENDS OVER THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  (1)  INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC REVENUE PER PACKAGE RELATES TO OUR INTERNATIONAL INTRA-COUNTRY OPERATIONS.  REVENUE  REVENUES INCREASED 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 8% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED YIELDS AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT. AT FEDEX GROUND, REVENUES INCREASED 9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 12% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO VOLUME GROWTH AND INCREASED YIELDS. FEDEX FREIGHT REVENUES INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 14% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE PER SHIPMENT AND AVERAGE DAILY SHIPMENTS. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTERNATIONAL PRIORITY AND INTERNATIONAL DOMESTIC PACKAGE REVENUE. AT FEDEX EXPRESS, UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATES, LOWER BASE RATES AND DECREASED WEIGHTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS BUT DID NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. REVENUES AT FEDEX EXPRESS INCREASED 5% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO U.S. DOMESTIC PACKAGE VOLUME GROWTH AND INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE AND FREIGHT VOLUME RECOVERY FROM THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PACKAGE YIELD DECLINES. FEDEX EXPRESS REVENUE DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUME GROWTH RESULTING FROM WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  - 35  -  OPERATING EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLES COMPARE OPERATING EXPENSES EXPRESSED AS DOLLAR AMOUNTS (IN MILLIONS) AND AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE FOR THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28.

OPERATING MARGIN IMPROVED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER RATES AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK OPERATIONS TO SIX DAYS YEAR-ROUND, STARTING IN JANUARY 2019. IN ADDITION, LOWER YIELDS AT FEDEX EXPRESS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED OPERATING MARGIN IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. OPERATING MARGIN REMAINED FLAT IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE AND LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING COSTS. AN OVERALL PRODUCT MIX SHIFT AT FEDEX EXPRESS FROM INTERNATIONAL PRIORITY VOLUME TO INTERNATIONAL DEFERRED VOLUME, AS WELL AS CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL VOLUMES AT FEDEX EXPRESS RESULTING FROM WEAKENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING MARGIN DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION COSTS INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 12% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES AT ALL OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS AND INCREASED RATES, INCLUDING FUEL COSTS, AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT, REFLECTING THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF THE TIGHT LABOR MARKET ON OUR RATES. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH AND ANNUAL MERIT INCREASES. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER STAFFING AND MERIT INCREASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 8% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT AT FEDEX EXPRESS. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS EXPENSE INCREASED 5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 9% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED AIRCRAFT ENGINE MAINTENANCE EXPENSE AT FEDEX EXPRESS.  - 36  -  FUEL  THE FOLLOWING GRAPH FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS SHOWS OUR AVERAGE COST OF JET AND VEHICLE FUEL PER GALLON FOR THE FIVE MOST RECENT QUARTERS.  FUEL EXPENSE DECREASED 1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FUEL PRICES AT FEDEX EXPRESS, OFFSET BY HIGHER MILEAGE AT FEDEX FREIGHT. FUEL EXPENSE INCREASED 21% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED FUEL PRICES. HOWEVER, FUEL PRICES REPRESENT ONLY ONE COMPONENT OF THE FACTORS WE CONSIDER MEANINGFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. CONSIDERATION MUST ALSO BE GIVEN TO THE FUEL SURCHARGE REVENUE WE COLLECT. ACCORDINGLY, WE BELIEVE DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS, WHICH IS A COMPARISON OF THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN THESE TWO FACTORS, IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR BUSINESS. IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPACT OF FUEL SURCHARGES ON THE TREND IN REVENUE AND YIELD GROWTH, WE HAVE INCLUDED THE COMPARATIVE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES IN EFFECT FOR THE THIRD QUARTERS OF 2019 AND 2018 IN THE ACCOMPANYING DISCUSSION OF EACH OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS.  MOST OF OUR FUEL SURCHARGES ARE ADJUSTED ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE FUEL SURCHARGE IS BASED ON A WEEKLY FUEL PRICE FROM TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO THE WEEK IN WHICH IT IS ASSESSED. SOME FEDEX EXPRESS INTERNATIONAL FUEL SURCHARGES INCORPORATE A TIMING LAG OF APPROXIMATELY SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS.  THE MANNER IN WHICH WE PURCHASE FUEL ALSO INFLUENCES THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR CONTRACTS FOR JET FUEL PURCHASES AT FEDEX EXPRESS ARE TIED TO VARIOUS INDICES, INCLUDING THE U.S. GULF COAST INDEX. WHILE MANY OF THESE INDICES ARE ALIGNED, EACH INDEX MAY FLUCTUATE AT A DIFFERENT PACE, DRIVING VARIABILITY IN THE PRICES PAID FOR JET FUEL. FURTHERMORE, UNDER THESE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 70% OF OUR JET FUEL IS PURCHASED BASED ON THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING WEEK, WITH THE REMAINDER OF OUR PURCHASES TIED TO THE INDEX PRICE FOR THE PRECEDING MONTH, RATHER THAN BASED ON DAILY SPOT RATES. THESE CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF RAPIDLY CHANGING DAILY SPOT RATES ON OUR JET FUEL PURCHASES.  BECAUSE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE, OUR OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED SHOULD THE MARKET PRICE OF FUEL SUDDENLY CHANGE BY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OR CHANGE BY AMOUNTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN AN ADJUSTMENT IN OUR FUEL SURCHARGES, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR EARNINGS EITHER POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IN THE SHORT-TERM.  WE ROUTINELY REVIEW OUR FUEL SURCHARGES. ON MARCH 18, 2019, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES FOR FEDEX EXPRESS U.S. DOMESTIC SERVICES AND AT FEDEX GROUND. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE UPDATED THE TABLES USED TO DETERMINE OUR FUEL SURCHARGES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AS HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASED FUEL PRICES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS DOES NOT CONSIDER THE EFFECTS THAT FUEL SURCHARGE LEVELS MAY HAVE ON OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEMAND AND SHIFTS IN THE MIX OF SERVICES PURCHASED BY OUR CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, OUR PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE MAY BE IMPACTED BY FUEL COSTS. WHILE FLUCTUATIONS IN FUEL SURCHARGE PERCENTAGES CAN BE SIGNIFICANT FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, FUEL SURCHARGES REPRESENT ONE OF THE MANY INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF OUR PRICING STRUCTURE THAT IMPACT OUR OVERALL REVENUE AND YIELD. ADDITIONAL COMPONENTS INCLUDE THE MIX OF SERVICES SOLD, THE BASE PRICE AND EXTRA SERVICE CHARGES WE OBTAIN FOR THESE SERVICES AND THE LEVEL OF PRICING DISCOUNTS OFFERED.  - 37  -  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 20.6% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND 21.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, COMPARED WITH (137.3)% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND (15.0)% FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2018. THE 2019 TAX RATES INCLUDE A BENEFIT OF $90 MILLION FROM THE REDUCTION OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON CERTAIN TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND AN EXPENSE OF $50 MILLION FROM THE IMPACT ON OUR DEFERRED TAXES ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RECENTLY ENACTED LOWER TAX RATE IN THE NETHERLANDS. THE 2019 TAX RATES WERE ALSO FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE TCJA, WHICH RESULTED IN BENEFITS OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION DURING THE THIRD QUARTER AND $230 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, PRIMARILY FROM THE LOWER STATUTORY TAX RATE ON FISCAL 2019 EARNINGS. THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 ALSO BENEFITED BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION FROM ACCELERATED DEDUCTIONS CLAIMED ON OUR 2018 U.S. INCOME TAX RETURN. THE 2018 TAX RATES WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $1.15 BILLION FROM THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND A PROVISIONAL BENEFIT OF $36 MILLION FROM FOREIGN TAX CREDITS EXCEEDING THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FOREIGN EARNINGS. IN ADDITION TO THESE PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS, WE RECOGNIZED A $204 MILLION BENEFIT FROM A $1.5 BILLION CONTRIBUTION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS IN FEBRUARY 2018 AND $165 MILLION RELATED TO THE PHASE-IN OF A REDUCED STATUTORY TAX RATE ON 2018 YEAR-TO-DATE EARNINGS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $120 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FIRST HALF OF 2018 EARNINGS.  ON JANUARY 15, 2019, THE U.S. TREASURY DEPARTMENT ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS COVERING THE ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON UNREPATRIATED FOREIGN EARNINGS, WHICH WAS ENACTED AS PART OF THE TCJA. CERTAIN GUIDANCE INCLUDED IN THESE FINAL REGULATIONS IS INCONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERPRETATION THAT LED TO THE RECOGNITION OF A $225 MILLION ($0.94 PER DILUTED SHARE) BENEFIT IN 2018 (THE \u201c2018 BENEFIT\u201d). NOTWITHSTANDING THIS INCONSISTENCY, WE REMAIN CONFIDENT IN OUR INTERPRETATION OF THE TCJA AND INTEND TO DEFEND THIS POSITION THROUGH LITIGATION, IF NECESSARY. HOWEVER, IF WE ARE ULTIMATELY UNSUCCESSFUL IN DEFENDING OUR POSITION, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REVERSE THE 2018 BENEFIT.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE TCJA. NO ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE DURING THE QUARTER. AS A RESULT, THE ONLY ADJUSTMENT TO THE AMOUNTS INITIALLY RECORDED ON A PROVISIONAL BASIS IN 2018 WAS A TAX EXPENSE OF $4 MILLION RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AS A REVISION OF THE PROVISIONAL BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMEASUREMENT OF OUR NET U.S. DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. SEE NOTE 1 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  THE TCJA, ENACTED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE U.S. CORPORATE INCOME TAX SYSTEM INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, LOWERING THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%. DUE TO OUR MAY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE LOWER RATE WAS PHASED IN, RESULTING IN A U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL RATE OF 29.2% FOR 2018 AND A STATUTORY FEDERAL RATE OF 21% FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF THE 2018 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES TO THE 2019 EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF THE TCJA, FOR THE PERIODS ENDED FEBRUARY 28.

(B)  THE BENEFIT IS FROM THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION DEDUCTED ON OUR 2017 TAX RETURN AT A TAX RATE OF 35%.  (C)  DUE TO OUR MAY 31 FISCAL YEAR-END, THE TCJA\u2019S LOWER U.S. STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 WAS PHASED IN RESULTING IN A RATE OF 29.2% FOR 2018 AND A RATE OF 21% FOR SUBSEQUENT YEARS.  (D)  THE 2018 TAX RATES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE EFFECT OF THE NOTPETYA CYBERATTACK, COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE INTEGRATION OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS OF FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS, CHANGES IN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND TAX RATE IMPACTS ON CHANGES IN DEFERRED TAX ITEMS AFTER THE TCJA ENACTMENT, AND WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED FROM TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.  - 38  -  WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND VARIOUS U.S. STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN JURIS  DICTIONS. WE ARE CURRENTLY UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (  \u201c  IRS  \u201d  ) FOR THE 2016 AND 2017 TAX YEARS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INITIATED APPEALS PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE IRS\u2019  S  PROPOSED  AUDIT  ADJUSTMENT  FOR THE 2014 AND 2015 TAX YEARS. IT  IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN INCOME TAX RETURN PROCEEDINGS WILL BE COMPLETED DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND COULD RESULT IN A CHANGE IN OUR BALANCE OF UNRECOG  NIZED TAX BENEFITS. THE  IMPACT OF ANY CHANGES  IS NOT EXPECTED TO  BE MATERIAL TO OUR CON  SOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR LIABILITIES FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS SUBSEQUENT TO MAY 31, 2018.  BUSINESS REALIGNMENT COSTS  IN DECEMBER 2018, WE ANNOUNCED COST-REDUCTION PROGRAMS PRIMARILY THROUGH INITIATIVES AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX SERVICES IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  A U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES;  \u2022  LIMITED HIRING IN STAFF FUNCTIONS; AND  \u2022  REDUCTIONS IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, WE BEGAN OFFERING VOLUNTARY CASH BUYOUTS TO ELIGIBLE U.S.-BASED EMPLOYEES IN CERTAIN STAFF FUNCTIONS. THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM INCLUDES VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PAYMENTS AND FUNDING TO HEALTHCARE REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS, WITH THE VOLUNTARY SEVERANCE PAYMENT CALCULATED BASED ON FOUR WEEKS OF GROSS BASE SALARY FOR EVERY YEAR OF CONTINUOUS FEDEX SERVICE UP TO A MAXIMUM PAYMENT OF TWO YEARS OF PAY. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WILL BE SCHEDULED TO VACATE POSITIONS IN PHASES TO ENSURE A SMOOTH TRANSITION IN THE IMPACTED FUNCTIONS SO THAT WE MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. EMPLOYEES IN THE FIRST PHASE WILL VACATE THEIR POSITIONS ON MAY 31, 2019, AND WE EXPECT ALL EMPLOYEES WHO ACCEPT THE BUYOUT TO VACATE THEIR POSITIONS BY THE END OF 2020. COSTS OF THE BENEFITS PROVIDED UNDER THE PROGRAM WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS IN THE PERIOD EMPLOYEES ACCEPT THEIR OFFERS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PREDOMINANTLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019.  WE INCURRED COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION ($3 MILLION, NET OF TAX, OR $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE) DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES. THESE COSTS RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER EXTERNAL COSTS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL FEES. WE EXPECT THE 2019 PRE-TAX COST OF OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM, TO RANGE FROM $450 MILLION TO $575 MILLION IN PRE-TAX CASH EXPENDITURES, BUT ACTUAL COSTS WILL DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE RATES. SEVERANCE PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE AT THE TIME OF DEPARTURE. ADDITIONAL COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED BEYOND 2019, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL FEES. WE EXPECT SAVINGS FROM OUR BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES TO BE BETWEEN $225 MILLION TO $275 MILLION IN 2020.  OUTLOOK  WE EXPECT CONTINUED REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH AT FEDEX FREIGHT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 TO BE DRIVEN BY VOLUME AND YIELD GROWTH. WHILE FEDEX GROUND REVENUE GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019, HIGHER OPERATING COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT RESULTS, AS WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON GROWING VOLUMES TO FILL THE CAPACITY OF OUR NEW SIX-DAY NETWORK. WHILE THE LAUNCH OF SIX-DAY OPERATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A MODEST HEADWIND, WE BELIEVE IT WILL ALLOW FOR THE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF OUR EXISTING ASSETS, WHICH ULTIMATELY WILL DRIVE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AND ENHANCE OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION. AT FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE ON OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 THAT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND SAFETY, ENHANCE SERVICE OFFERINGS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MANAGE OUR COST STRUCTURE. WE EXPECT EARNINGS TO DECREASE AT FEDEX EXPRESS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO LOWER YIELDS AND CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN INTERNATIONAL PACKAGE VOLUMES RESULTING FROM SLOWING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY IN ASIA AND EUROPE. AS A RESPONSE TO THESE NEGATIVE BUSINESS TRENDS, WE ARE IMPLEMENTING REVENUE-QUALITY ENHANCEMENT AND COST-REDUCTION ACTIONS; HOWEVER, THE FULL BENEFITS OF THESE ACTIONS WILL NOT BE REALIZED IMMEDIATELY.  OUR EXPECTATIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 ARE DEPENDENT ON KEY EXTERNAL FACTORS, INCLUDING FUEL PRICES, MODERATE U.S. DOMESTIC ECONOMIC GROWTH AND NO FURTHER WEAKENING IN INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FROM OUR CURRENT FORECAST.  WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION PLANS. THE INTEGRATION PROCESS IS COMPLEX AS IT SPANS OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES AND INVOLVES COMBINING OUR PICKUP-AND-DELIVERY OPERATIONS AT A LOCAL LEVEL, OUR GLOBAL AND REGIONAL AIR AND GROUND NETWORKS, AND OUR EXTENSIVE OPERATIONS, CUSTOMS CLEARANCE, SALES AND BACK-OFFICE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. WE HAVE COMPLETED THE OPERATIONAL INTEGRATION IN THE U.S., CANADA AND MIDDLE EAST, AND EXPECT TO HAVE THE SALES FORCES SUBSTANTIALLY INTEGRATED BY THE END OF 2019. THE SALES FORCE INTEGRATION WILL ALLOW BOTH THE FEDEX EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS SALES TEAMS TO SELL OUR FULL SUITE OF SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS.  - 39  -  A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE IN THE INTEGRATION INCLUDES KEY PROJECTS  THAT ENABLE  THE  INJECTION OF  FEDEX EXPRESS SHIPMENTS INTO THE TNT  EXPRESS EUROPEAN ROAD NETWORK.  THIS INTEGRATION MILESTONE WILL ALLOW FEDEX EXPRESS CUSTOMERS TO  BENEFIT FROM  TRANSIT TIME IMPROVEMENTS  FOR THEIR INTRA-EUROPEAN SHIPMENTS.  WE BEGAN ROLLING OUT THIS SERVICE IN EUROPE IN  FEBRUARY 2019 AND  EXPECT TO  HAVE THIS SERVICE IMPROVEMENT COMPLETED  IN JUNE  2019.  IN ADDITION  , BY THE END OF 2020, WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE PROJECTS  ACROSS  OUR EUROPEAN  HUB AND  STATION  LOCATIONS THAT  WILL  ALLOW  INTEROPERABILITY  BETWEEN NETWORKS  FOR BOTH FEDEX  EXPRESS AND TNT EXPRESS PACKAGES  , WHICH  WILL  FURTHER  LOWER COSTS  AS THE RELATED  FEDEX  EXPRESS  LINEHAUL  OPERATIONS ARE OPTIMIZED.  IN 2019, WE HAVE BEGUN THE OPERATIONAL NETWORK INTEGRATION PROCESS FOR THE KEY COUNTRIES IN EUROPE, WHICH REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF INTERNATIONAL REVENUE, WORKFORCES AND FACILITIES. INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN EUROPE ARE COMPLEX AND REQUIRE CONSULTATIONS WITH WORKS COUNCILS AND EMPLOYEE REPRESENTATIVES IN A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES. WHILE WE EXPECT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON INTEGRATION ACTIVITIES IN 2020, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, INTEGRATION WORK WILL CONTINUE INTO 2021.  WE CURRENTLY ESTIMATE INTEGRATION PROGRAM EXPENSES TO EXCEED $1.5 BILLION THROUGH 2021 AND WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WILL FURTHER TRANSFORM AND OPTIMIZE THE COMBINED BUSINESS. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS IN ANY FUTURE PERIOD MAY CHANGE AS WE REVISE AND IMPLEMENT OUR PLANS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $435 MILLION OF INTEGRATION EXPENSES IN 2019, DOWN FROM OUR PREVIOUS ESTIMATE OF $450 MILLION.  OTHER OUTLOOK MATTERS.  FOR DETAILS ON KEY 2019 CAPITAL PROJECTS, REFER TO THE \u201cLIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A.  FEDEX GROUND PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THE INDEPENDENT SERVICE PROVIDER (\u201cISP\u201d) MODEL THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRE U.S. PICKUP-AND-DELIVERY NETWORK. THE TRANSITION TO THE ISP MODEL IS BEING ACCOMPLISHED ON A DISTRICT-BY-DISTRICT BASIS AND WE ARE NOW TARGETING THE TRANSITION TO BE COMPLETED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, OVER TWO-THIRDS OF FEDEX GROUND VOLUME WAS BEING DELIVERED BY SMALL BUSINESSES OPERATING UNDER THE ISP MODEL. THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TRANSITIONS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS INCURRED AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO ANY FUTURE QUARTER.  SEE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d AND PART II, ITEM 1A \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  SEE NOTE 1  OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR  A DISCUSSION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  FEDEX EXPRESS, FEDEX GROUND AND FEDEX FREIGHT REPRESENT OUR MAJOR SERVICE LINES AND, ALONG WITH FEDEX SERVICES, CONSTITUTE OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING BUSINESSES.

THE ALLOCATIONS OF NET OPERATING COSTS ARE BASED ON METRICS SUCH AS RELATIVE REVENUES OR ESTIMATED SERVICES PROVIDED.  - 40  -  THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT PROVIDES DIRECT AND INDIRECT SUPPORT TO OUR TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES, AND WE ALLOCATE ALL OF THE NET OPERATING COSTS OF THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT (INCLUDI  NG THE NET OPERATING RESULTS OF FEDEX OFFICE) TO REFLECT THE FULL COST OF OPERATING OUR TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES IN THE RESULTS OF THOSE SEGMENTS. WITHIN THE FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT ALLOCATION, THE NET OPERATING RESULTS OF FEDEX OFFICE, WHICH ARE AN IMMATE  RIAL COMPONENT OF OUR ALLOCATIONS, ARE ALLOCATED TO FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. WE REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS BASED ON OPERATING INCOME (INCLUSIVE OF FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT ALLOCATIONS). FOR THE FEDEX SERVICES SE  GMENT, PERFORMANCE IS EVALUATED BASED ON THE IMPACT OF ITS TOTAL ALLOCATED NET OPERATING COSTS ON OUR TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE ALLOCATIONS APPROXIMATE THE NET COST OF PROVIDING THESE FUNCTIONS. OUR ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES ARE REFINED PERI  ODICALLY, AS NECESSARY, TO REFLECT CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESSES.  CORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS  CORPORATE AND OTHER INCLUDES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS COSTS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN LEGAL AND FINANCE FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER COSTS AND CREDITS NOT ATTRIBUTED TO OUR CORE BUSINESS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  ALSO INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER IS THE FEDEX LOGISTICS OPERATING SEGMENT, WHICH PROVIDES CUSTOMS BROKERAGE AND GLOBAL OCEAN AND AIR FREIGHT FORWARDING THROUGH FEDEX TRADE NETWORKS TRANSPORT & BROKERAGE, INC.; CROSS-BORDER ENABLEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS AND E-COMMERCE TRANSPORTATION SOLUTIONS THROUGH FEDEX CROSS BORDER TECHNOLOGIES, INC.; INTEGRATED SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS THROUGH FEDEX SUPPLY CHAIN DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, INC.

(\u201cFEDEX FORWARD DEPOTS\u201d). IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019, THE OPERATING LOSS INCREASE IN \u201cCORPORATE, OTHER AND ELIMINATIONS\u201d WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FEDEX LOGISTICS RESULTING FROM OPERATING LOSSES, THE INCLUSION OF FEDEX FORWARD DEPOTS FOLLOWING THE REALIGNMENT OF FEDEX LOGISTICS AND LOWER TRANSPORTATION VOLUMES DUE TO WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, COSTS INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SETTLEMENT OF A LEGAL MATTER INVOLVING FEDEX GROUND, INCLUDING CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL FEES, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR RESULTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  CERTAIN FEDEX OPERATING COMPANIES PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED SERVICES FOR OTHER FEDEX COMPANIES OUTSIDE THEIR REPORTABLE SEGMENT. BILLINGS FOR SUCH SERVICES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE, AND ARE REFLECTED AS REVENUES OF THE BILLING SEGMENT. THESE RATES ARE ADJUSTED FROM TIME TO TIME BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. SUCH INTERSEGMENT REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE ELIMINATED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND ARE NOT SEPARATELY IDENTIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT INFORMATION BECAUSE THE AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.  - 41  -  FEDEX EXPRESS SEGMENT  FEDEX EXPRESS OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF U.S. DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING SERVICES FOR DELIVERY OF PACKAGES AND FREIGHT INCLUDING PRIORITY, DEFERRED AND ECONOMY SERVICES, WHICH PROVIDE DELIVERY ON A TIME-DEFINITE OR DAY-DEFINITE BASIS.

FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 6% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION, RESULTING FROM INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AND EXPANDING THE OPERATIONS OF THE FEDEX GROUND NETWORK TO SIX DAYS PER WEEK YEAR-ROUND STARTING IN JANUARY 2019, STAFFING AND NETWORK EXPANSION COSTS. HIGHER REVENUES AND THE FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF FUEL PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE FACTORS. HIGHER OPERATING COSTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE OPERATING MARGIN DECLINE IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019. FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 7% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DUE TO VOLUME GROWTH, INCREASED YIELDS AND THE FAVORABLE NET IMPACT OF FUEL. IN ADDITION, LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES BENEFITED OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019.  PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE INCREASED 14% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 16% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUMES, INCREASED CONTRACTOR SETTLEMENT RATES AND EXPANDING TO SIX-DAY OPERATIONS YEAR-ROUND. HIGHER FUEL COSTS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASE IN PURCHASED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSE IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019. SALARIES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS EXPENSE INCREASED 9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND 14% IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO SUPPORT VOLUME GROWTH, MERIT INCREASES AND NETWORK EXPANSION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VARIABLE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSES.  THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL HAD A MODERATE BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS OF 2019, AS HIGHER FUEL SURCHARGES MORE THAN OFFSET INCREASED FUEL PRICES. SEE THE \u201cFUEL\u201d SECTION OF THIS MD&A FOR A DESCRIPTION AND ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF FUEL ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE FINANCING SOURCES WILL BE ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR LIQUIDITY NEEDS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, TNT EXPRESS INTEGRATION EXPENSES AND BUSINESS REALIGNMENT ACTIVITIES (INCLUDING THE U.S.-BASED VOLUNTARY EMPLOYEE BUYOUT PROGRAM). OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 INCLUDES $1.0 BILLION OF CASH IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR PERMANENT REINVESTMENT STRATEGY. WE ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE MAJORITY OF THIS CASH WITHOUT A MATERIAL TAX COST, AS THE ENACTMENT OF THE TCJA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE COST OF REPATRIATING FOREIGN EARNINGS FROM A U.S. TAX PERSPECTIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THE INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF THESE FUNDS IMPAIRS OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR U.S. DOMESTIC DEBT OR WORKING CAPITAL OBLIGATIONS.  OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION IN 2019, AND INCLUDE SPENDING FOR AIRCRAFT MODERNIZATION AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND SPENDING ON FACILITIES AND SORT EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY AT FEDEX EXPRESS AND FEDEX GROUND. WE INVESTED $1.5 BILLION IN AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT IN THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AND EXPECT TO INVEST AN ADDITIONAL $0.6 BILLION FOR AIRCRAFT AND RELATED EQUIPMENT DURING THE REMAINDER OF 2019. IN ADDITION, OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, WE WILL BE INVESTING A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE FEDEX EXPRESS INDIANAPOLIS HUB AND A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION TO MODERNIZE THE FEDEX EXPRESS MEMPHIS WORLD HUB. WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING UNSECURED FINANCING, FROM BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SOURCES, ALTHOUGH THE MARKETPLACE FOR SUCH INVESTMENT CAPITAL CAN BECOME RESTRICTED DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC FACTORS.  - 51  -  WE HAVE A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) THAT ALLOWS US TO SELL, IN ONE OR MORE FUTURE OFFERINGS, ANY COMBINATION OF OUR UNSECURED DEBT SECURITIES AND COMMON STOCK.

SEE NOTE 3 OF THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE TERMS AND SIGNIFICANT COVENANTS OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS OF 2019, WE MADE VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $1.0 BILLION TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS. WE DO NOT EXPECT TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019. OUR U.S. PENSION PLANS HAVE AMPLE FUNDS TO MEET EXPECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES TO DEVELOP AMOUNTS REFLECTED AND DISCLOSED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. IN MANY CASES, THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE POLICIES OR ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES THAT COULD BE USED. WE MAINTAIN A THOROUGH PROCESS TO REVIEW THE APPLICATION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE MANY ESTIMATES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A COMPLEX, GLOBAL CORPORATION. HOWEVER, EVEN UNDER OPTIMAL CIRCUMSTANCES, ESTIMATES ROUTINELY REQUIRE ADJUSTMENT BASED ON CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND NEW OR BETTER INFORMATION.  GOODWILL.  GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT HAS FALLEN BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THERE HAS BEEN ANY OTHER CHANGE OF EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A REEVALUATION OF THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS REQUIRED AS OF FEBRUARY 28, 2019, NOR DO WE BELIEVE THE GOODWILL OF OUR REPORTING UNITS IS AT RISK OF FAILING IMPAIRMENT TESTING. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT.

MBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019  28  DECREASED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN PRICING WHICH OUTPACED MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS. SBU OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 DECLINED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE DECREASES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS ENABLED BY OUR EXECUTION IN TRANSITIONING TO ADVANCED TLC 3D NAND PRODUCTS. EBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 DECLINED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN PRICING WHICH OUTPACED MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS.  CNBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER R&D COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST REDUCTIONS. MBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES OF HIGH-VALUE MANAGED NAND PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS, WHICH OUTPACED DECLINES IN SELLING PRICES. SBU OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 DECLINED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE DECREASES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS AND INCREASES IN SALES VOLUMES. SBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY FIXED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERUTILIZATION OF OUR SHARE OF IMFT'S CAPACITY. EBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 AS A RESULT OF DECLINES IN SELLING PRICES AND HIGHER R&D COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE UNCHANGED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 7% AND 8% HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN LEGAL COSTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  R&D EXPENSES VARY PRIMARILY WITH THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENT WAFERS PROCESSED, THE COST OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT DEDICATED TO NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONNEL COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE LEAD TIMES NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, WE TYPICALLY BEGIN TO PROCESS WAFERS BEFORE COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TESTING. DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT IS DEEMED COMPLETE WHEN IT IS QUALIFIED THROUGH REVIEWS AND TESTS FOR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. R&D EXPENSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF PRODUCT QUALIFICATION.  R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019. R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 15% AND 25% HIGHER, RESPECTIVELY, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN VOLUMES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-QUALIFICATION WAFERS, DECREASES IN REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR R&D COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW, INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN CAPITAL SPENDING, AND, FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS.  WE SHARE THE COST OF CERTAIN PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PARTNERS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS TO JOINTLY DEVELOP NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES WITH INTEL. OUR R&D EXPENSES WERE REDUCED BY REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THESE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER ARRANGEMENTS OF  $23 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , $30 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AND $58 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018  . THE DECREASE IN R&D REIMBURSEMENTS IN THE SECOND AND FIRST QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN OUR JOINT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH INTEL FOR NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES, WHICH WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2019.  29  INCOME TAXES  OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.

OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FOREIGN MINIMUM TAX. WE OPERATE IN A NUMBER OF TAX JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITES STATES, INCLUDING SINGAPORE, WHERE WE HAVE TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH EXPIRE IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2034, THAT ARE CONDITIONAL, IN PART, UPON MEETING CERTAIN BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT THRESHOLDS. THE EFFECT OF TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS REDUCED OUR TAX PROVISION BY  $244 MILLION  (BENEFITING OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY  $0.21  ) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  2019  , $427 MILLION ($0.36 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, AND  $436 MILLION  (  $0.35  PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2018.  OTHER  INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 INCREASED 53% AND 115% AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CASH BALANCES INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS AND INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES. INTEREST INCOME FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED 92% AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED 18% AND 69% AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 72% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL SPENDING.

CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES FOR EFFICIENTLY FUNDING OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ONGOING OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF FINANCING TRANSACTIONS FOR SUCH PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES. WE HAVE AN UNDRAWN REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JULY 2023 AND PROVIDES FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO  $2.50 BILLION  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND AVAILABLE FINANCING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH, ACHIEVE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, AND MAINTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY, WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND R&D. WE ESTIMATE THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 FOR PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, NET OF PARTNER CONTRIBUTIONS, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION, FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS AND PRODUCT ENABLEMENT. THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS FOR 2019 WILL VARY DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , WE HAD COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID WITHIN ONE YEAR.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE DISCRETIONARY REPURCHASE OF UP TO  $10 BILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, BEGINNING IN OUR FISCAL 2019, WHICH WE MAY PURCHASE ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS THROUGH OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, BLOCK TRADES, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND/OR PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR ONGOING DETERMINATION OF THE BEST USE OF AVAILABLE CASH. THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE US TO ACQUIRE ANY COMMON STOCK. IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED  21 MILLION  AND  63 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, FOR  $702 MILLION  AND  $2.51 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, A RULE 10B5-1 PLAN, AND THROUGH OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES.  ON JANUARY 14, 2019, WE EXERCISED OUR OPTION TO ACQUIRE INTEL'S INTEREST IN IMFT. AS A RESULT, INTEL CAN ELECT TO SET THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION TO BE ANY TIME BETWEEN APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS TO ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE WE EXERCISED OUR CALL OPTION.

OUR INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE, FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK, WE INVEST THROUGH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BY POLICY GENERALLY LIMIT THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE BY RESTRICTING THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS WITH ANY SINGLE OBLIGOR.  LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS  MMJ GROUP  .  CASH AND MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCLUDED $494 MILLION HELD BY THE MMJ GROUP.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d)  OVERHEAD  UNALLOCATED OVERHEAD EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED BY  $0.2 MILLION  TO  $23.1 MILLION  , FROM  $23.3 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR QUARTER. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $4.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE ABANDONMENT OF LEGACY BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR QUARTER WITH NO IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $2.3 MILLION, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO BUILDING AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES NOW IN SERVICE, HIGHER TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN SEVERANCE EXPENSE OF $2.3 MILLION.  UNALLOCATED OVERHEAD EXPENSE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED BY  $3.9 MILLION  TO  $73.4 MILLION  , FROM  $77.3 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF  $11.0 MILLION  RELATED TO THE ABANDONMENT OF LEGACY BUILDING IMPROVEMENTS WITH NO IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL PERIOD, A DECREASE IN SALARY-RELATED EXPENSES OF $3.3 MILLION AND A DECREASE IN STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $2.3 MILLION.

SEASONALITY  THE COMPANY\u2019S  CHILDREN\u2019S BOOK PUBLISHING AND DISTRIBUTION  SCHOOL-BASED BOOK FAIRS AND BOOK CLUB CHANNELS AND MOST OF ITS  EDUCATION  BUSINESSES OPERATE ON A SCHOOL-YEAR BASIS; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY SEASONAL. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR GENERALLY ARE LOWER THAN ITS REVENUES IN THE OTHER TWO FISCAL QUARTERS. TYPICALLY, SCHOOL-BASED CHANNELS AND MAGAZINE REVENUES ARE MINIMAL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR AS SCHOOLS ARE NOT IN SESSION. TRADE SALES CAN VARY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DUE TO VARYING RELEASE DATES OF PUBLISHED TITLES. THE COMPANY GENERALLY EXPERIENCES A LOSS FROM OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST AND THIRD QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR. AS THE COMPANY'S  EDUCATION  SEGMENT BEGINS  TO SELL ITS CORE CURRICULUM OFFERING, SCHOLASTIC LITERACY, THESE REVENUES ARE LIKELY TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, WHEN SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS ARE PREPARING FOR THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR.  36  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $60.5 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $64.9 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF  $4.4 MILLION  . THE DECREASE IN CASH PROVIDED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER CUSTOMER RECEIVABLE BALANCES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASED TRADE CHANNEL REVENUES.  IN RESPONSE TO CERTAIN CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS AND LONGER LEAD TIMES WITH STRATEGIC PRINTERS AND SUPPLIERS, THE COMPANY IS UTILIZING ITS BALANCE SHEET TO IMPROVE VENDOR RELATIONS AND OPTIMIZE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES WHICH WILL RESULT IN HIGHER LEVELS OF INVENTORY AND QUICKER PAYMENT TERMS WHICH WILL HAVE A NEAR-TERM IMPACT ON WORKING CAPITAL UTILIZATION AND RESULT IN FREE CASH FLOW FOR THE FISCAL YEAR.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $103.8 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $116.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING LOWER CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $13.0 MILLION  . THIS DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS BUILDING MODERNIZATION PROJECT AS IT IS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PREPUBLICATION SPENDING IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PERIOD FOR NEW PRINT AND DIGITAL CORE INSTRUCTION PRODUCTS WITHIN THE  EDUCATION  SEGMENT.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS  $9.9 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED TO CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $30.2 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, REPRESENTING A DECREASE IN CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $20.3 MILLION  . THE DECREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY, WHICH WERE  $23.8 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD COMPARED TO  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR PERIOD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROCEEDS PURSUANT TO STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  CASH POSITION  THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED  $338.1 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  ,  $391.9 MILLION  AT MAY 31, 2018 AND  $362.6 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY\u2019S U.S. OPERATIONS TOTALED $317.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , $371.1 MILLION  AT MAY 31, 2018 AND $342.4 MILLION  AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2018.  DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS AS DISCUSSED UNDER \u201cSEASONALITY\u201d ABOVE, THE COMPANY USUALLY EXPERIENCES NEGATIVE CASH FLOWS IN THE JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER TIME PERIOD. AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS CYCLE, BORROWINGS HAVE HISTORICALLY INCREASED DURING JUNE, JULY AND AUGUST, HAVE GENERALLY PEAKED IN SEPTEMBER OR OCTOBER, AND HAVE BEEN AT THEIR LOWEST POINT IN MAY.  THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING PHILOSOPHY IS TO USE CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO CREATE VALUE BY PAYING DOWN DEBT, REINVESTING IN EXISTING BUSINESSES AND, FROM TIME TO TIME, MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT WILL COMPLEMENT ITS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES OR ACQUIRING OTHER STRATEGIC ASSETS, AS WELL AS ENGAGING IN SHAREHOLDER ENHANCEMENT INITIATIVES, SUCH AS SHARE REPURCHASES OR DIVIDEND DECLARATIONS. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO USE ITS CASH POSITION, COMBINED WITH IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN DATA, TO REDUCE PROCUREMENT COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY'S BUSINESSES.  THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED, AND EXPECTS TO MAINTAIN FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, DIVIDENDS, CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES, DEBT SERVICE, PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY CONSISTED OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF  $338.1 MILLION  , CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND FUNDING AVAILABLE UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT TOTALING APPROXIMATELY  $375.0 MILLION  . THE COMPANY MAY AT ANY TIME, BUT IN ANY EVENT NOT MORE THAN ONCE IN ANY CALENDAR YEAR, REQUEST THAT THE AGGREGATE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT UNDER THE LOAN AGREEMENT BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT OF $10.0 MILLION OR AN INTEGRAL MULTIPLE OF $10.0 MILLION (BUT NOT TO EXCEED $150.0 MILLION). ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS SHORT-TERM CREDIT FACILITIES OF $49.1 MILLION, LESS CURRENT BORROWINGS OF  $11.0 MILLION  AND COMMITMENTS OF  $4.9 MILLION  , RESULTING IN $33.2 MILLION OF CURRENT AVAILABILITY AT  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  . ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE ITS ONGOING OPERATING NEEDS, AS WELL AS ITS FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  37  SCHOLASTIC CORPORATION  ITEM 2.

(\u201cCROWN EQUITY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN AUGUST 1995 IN NEVADA. THE COMPANY IS OFFERING ITS SERVICES TO COMPANIES SEEKING TO BECOME PUBLIC ENTITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IT HAS LAUNCHED A WEBSITE, WWW.CROWNEQUITYHOLDINGS.COM, WHICH OFFERS ITS SERVICES IN A WIDE RANGE OF FIELDS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES VARIOUS CONSULTING SERVICES TO COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS DEALING WITH CORPORATE STRUCTURE AND OPERATIONS GLOBALLY. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES PUBLIC RELATIONS AND NEWS DISSEMINATION FOR PUBLICLY AND PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES.  IN DECEMBER, 2010, THE COMPANY FORMED TWO WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES CROWN TELE SERVICES, INC. AND CROWN DIRECT, INC. CROWN TELE SERVICES, INC. WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE VOICE OVER INTERNET (\u201cVOIP\u201d) SERVICES TO CLIENTS AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE AND CROWN DIRECT, INC. WAS FORMED TO PROVIDE DIRECT SALES TO CUSTOMERS. BOTH ENTITIES HAD MINIMUM SALES DURING THE QUARTER.  IN MARCH, 2011, THE COMPANY FORMED A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY CRWE REAL ESTATE, INC. AS A SUBSIDIARY TO ENGAGE IN POTENTIAL REAL ESTATE HOLDINGS. THE ENTITY HAD MINIMAL ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER.  THE COMPANY HAS FOCUSED ITS PRIMARY VISION TO USING ITS NETWORK OF WEBSITES TO PROVIDE ADVERTISING AND MARKETING SERVICES, AS A WORLDWIDE ONLINE MEDIA ADVERTISING PUBLISHER, DEDICATED TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF QUALITY BRANDING INFORMATION. THE COMPANY OFFERS INTERNET MEDIA-DRIVEN ADVERTISING SERVICES, WHICH COVER AND CONNECT A WIDE RANGE OF MARKETING SPECIALTIES, AS WELL AS SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZATION FOR CLIENTS INTERESTED IN ONLINE MEDIA AWARENESS. AS PART OF ITS OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TECHNICIANS IN DEVELOPING ITS WEBSITES AND ADDING ADDITIONAL WEBSITES. THIS ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO DISSEMINATE NEWS AND PRESS RELEASES FOR ITS CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS GENERAL NEWS AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE THAN IT DID PREVIOUSLY. THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS SERVICES TO COMPANIES SEEKING MARKET AWARENESS OF THEM AND THE SERVICES OR GOODS THAT THEY OFFER. THE COMPANY THEN PUBLISHES INFORMATION CONCERNING THESE COMPANIES ON ITS MANY WEBSITES  CROWN EQUITY\u2019S OFFICE IS LOCATED AT 11226 PENTLAND DOWN STREET, LAS VEGAS, NV 89141.  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, CROWN EQUITY HAD NO PAID EMPLOYEES AND WAS UTILIZING THE SERVICES OF ONE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND CONSULTANT.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, REVENUES WERE $5,796 AND $654 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS DUE TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MANAGED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SERVICES AND 24/7 SUPPORT (INCLUDING DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, TESTING, MAINTAIN FUNCTIONALITY, INFRASTRUCTURE MONITORING, MANAGING, AND HOSTING) TO A RELATED PARTY.  OPERATING EXPENSES WERE $35,230 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND $58,743 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO STOCK ISSUED FOR SERVICES BEING $33,000 LESS IN THE 2018 PERIOD VERSUS 2017 OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION OF APPROXIMATELY $7,000. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WERE OTHER EXPENSES OF $5,823 AND OTHER EXPENSES OF $519 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN 2017. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO INTEREST EXPENSE BEING $2,104 HIGHER AND THE $3,200 OF AMORTIZATION OF THE BENEFICIAL CONVERSION FEATURE RELATED FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED FOR WHICH THERE WAS ZERO IN 2017.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017 WAS $2,623 AND $519, RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF MARCH 31, 2018, CROWN EQUITY HAD CURRENT ASSETS OF $1,241 AND CURRENT LIABILITIES OF $272,840 RESULTING IN WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT OF $271,599. NET CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $5,464 COMPARED TO NET CASH USED OF $10,314 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOW RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM POSITIVE FACTORS OF A DECREASE IN OUR NET LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $23,000, AN INCREASE IN THE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE YEAR OVER YEAR OF $4,000, AN INCREASE IN OUR AMORTIZATION AND DEPRECIATION OF 10,000 AS WELL AS OFFSETTING THESE AMOUNTS WAS A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT FOR STOCK ISSUED FOR SERVICES OF APPROXIMATELY $33,000.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS ZERO FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 WAS $4,843 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED OF $0 IN 2017. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WE BORROWED $5,235 ON CONVERTIBLE NOTES AND REPAID $392 ON NOTES PAYABLE. THERE WAS NO SIMILAR ACTIVITY FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2017.  OUR EXISTING CAPITAL MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET CROWN EQUITY\u2019S CASH NEEDS, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONTINUING REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. THIS CONDITION RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO CROWN EQUITY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF CROWN EQUITY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Crown Equity Holdings, Inc.", "CIK": 1103833, "Date": "2019-03-27T00:00:00", "Ticker": "CRWE", "Name": "Crown Equity Holdings Inc", "Exchange": "OTC", "SIC": 5734.0, "Business": "NV", "Incorporated": "NV", "IRS": 330677140.0, "key": "20190327CRWE", "labelr1": 0.0, "labelr2": 0.0, "labelr3": 0.0, "labelr4": 0.0, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.6082588000000001, "prof1": 0.39174116, "return1&2": 1.0, "return1&2&3": 1.0, "return1&2&3&4": 1.0, "return2": 1.0, "return1": 1.0, "return3": 1.0, "return4": 1.0, "1_day_return": 0.0, "cumulative_return1": 0.6769349919839205, "cumulative_return1&2": 0.8163127201478085, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 0.2261522137369059, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 0.14340965784831236, "indexx": 220, "cumreturn1b": 1.1192057370963209, "cumreturndow": 1.0092449016564804, "cumreturnsp500": 0.996544689561098}, {"Unnamed: 0": 221, "level_0": 228, "index": 49493, "text": "ITEM 2.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE EVENTS THAT MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. ACTUAL OUTCOMES AND RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM WHAT IS EXPRESSED OR FORECAST IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VOLATILE, NEGATIVE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONDITIONS ON OUR CLIENTS\u2019 BUSINESSES AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON GENERATING AND MAINTAINING ONGOING, PROFITABLE CLIENT DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADAPTATION AND EXPANSION OF OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ONGOING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SUCH DEMAND OR AN INABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CLIENT DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONALS WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS, OUR BUSINESS, THE UTILIZATION RATE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  WE COULD FACE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT CLIENT AND/OR ACCENTURE DATA FROM SECURITY BREACHES OR CYBERATTACKS.  \u2022  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR LEVEL OF TAXES, AS WELL AS AUDITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND TAX PROCEEDINGS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  OUR PROFITABILITY COULD MATERIALLY SUFFER IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, IF OUR COST-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR IF WE EXPERIENCE DELIVERY INEFFICIENCIES.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS AND OUR GROWTH STRATEGY TO CONTINUE GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, WE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN RISKS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE INCUR LEGAL LIABILITY.  \u2022  OUR WORK WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SIZE, WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  \u2022  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIANCE PARTNERS OR IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE AND ESTABLISH NEW ALLIANCES IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEES MAY DEPEND ON OUR REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  WE MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AT ACQUIRING, INVESTING IN OR INTEGRATING BUSINESSES, ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES OR DIVESTING BUSINESSES.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR IF OUR SERVICES OR SOLUTIONS INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR IN THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS THAT LINK SOME OF OUR FEES TO THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS TARGETS AND/OR REQUIRE US TO MEET SPECIFIC SERVICE LEVELS. THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHARE PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL, IT MAY DILUTE OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN US.  \u2022  WE ARE INCORPORATED IN IRELAND AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO ENFORCE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY RELATED TO OUR INCORPORATION IN IRELAND.  \u2022  IRISH LAW DIFFERS FROM THE LAWS IN EFFECT IN THE UNITED STATES AND MIGHT AFFORD LESS PROTECTION TO SHAREHOLDERS.  FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS, SEE THE INFORMATION UNDER THE HEADING \u201cRISK FACTORS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  AUGUST 31, 2018  . OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SPEAK ONLY AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT OR AS OF THE DATE THEY ARE MADE, AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OVERVIEW  REVENUES ARE DRIVEN BY THE ABILITY OF OUR EXECUTIVES TO SECURE NEW CONTRACTS AND TO DELIVER SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS THAT ADD VALUE RELEVANT TO OUR CLIENTS\u2019 CURRENT NEEDS AND CHALLENGES. THE LEVEL OF REVENUES WE ACHIEVE IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MARKET-LEADING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS AND TO DEPLOY SKILLED TEAMS OF PROFESSIONALS QUICKLY AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THIS VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY AND SEEK TO MANAGE OUR COSTS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, U.K. POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, ON JANUARY 10, 2019, PIERRE NANTERME STEPPED DOWN AS OUR CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND AS A DIRECTOR FOR HEALTH REASONS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 10, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTED DAVID ROWLAND, WHO WAS SERVING AS OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS THE INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND A DIRECTOR OF ACCENTURE, AND KC MCCLURE, WHO WAS SERVING AS OUR MANAGING DIRECTOR\u2014FINANCE OPERATIONS, AS OUR CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AND NAMED OUR LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR, MARGE MAGNER, AS THE NON-EXECUTIVE CHAIR OF THE BOARD.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION, WE PRESENT TOTAL REVENUES AND NO LONGER REPORT REVENUES BEFORE REIMBURSEMENTS (NET REVENUES). THIS CHANGE HAS NO IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME BUT DOES AFFECT RATIOS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, SUCH AS OPERATING MARGIN. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE FISCAL 2019 PRESENTATION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONG, RESULTING IN GROWTH ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  , REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN RESOURCES, COMMUNICATION, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS, AND MODEST IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE EXPERIENCED VERY STRONG GROWTH IN GROWTH MARKETS AND STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE. REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS STRONG IN CONSULTING AND OUTSOURCING DURING THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINED COMPETITIVE, WE EXPERIENCED PRICING IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE USE THE TERM \u201cPRICING\u201d TO MEAN THE CONTRACT PROFITABILITY OR MARGIN ON THE WORK THAT WE SELL.  IN OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED  7%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  10%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES, STRONG GROWTH IN PRODUCTS, COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND SLIGHT GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES  . OUR CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR DIGITAL-, CLOUD- AND SECURITY-RELATED SERVICES AND ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DELIVER COST SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO INTEGRATE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GROW AND TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES.  IN OUR OUTSOURCING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY, RESOURCES AND PRODUCTS, AND MODEST GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES, WHILE HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE HAD A SLIGHT DECLINE. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMAND TO ASSIST CLIENTS WITH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DIGITAL-RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD ENABLEMENT. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING THEIR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENCY.  AS WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  4%  AND  3%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY WITHIN RECENT RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2019  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2019  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  3%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH  THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE CONTINUE TO HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  15%  , UP FROM  13%  IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN SKILL SETS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, COMPENSATION INCREASES  BECOME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1ST OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  WE STRIVE TO ADJUST PRICING AND/OR THE MIX OF RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF COMPENSATION INCREASES ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO: KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR AMOUNTS OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING; RECOVER INCREASES IN COMPENSATION; DEPLOY OUR EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY ON A TIMELY BASIS; MANAGE ATTRITION; AND/OR EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE AND UTILIZE NEW EMPLOYEES.

THE COMMENTARY BELOW PROVIDES INSIGHT INTO OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING OPERATING GROUP PERFORMANCE AND OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  .  \u2022  COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.  \u2022  FINANCIAL SERVICES OPERATING INCOME DECREASED AS HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY AND REVENUE GROWTH WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE OPERATING INCOME DECREASED AS REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER OUTSOURCING CONTRACT PROFITABILITY WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  PRODUCTS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES.  \u2022  RESOURCES OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUE GROWTH AND HIGHER CONSULTING CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS  18.6%  , COMPARED WITH  23.0%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . IN THE  SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  , WE RECORDED A  $137 MILLION  TAX CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT. ABSENT THIS CHARGE, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  WOULD HAVE BEEN  18.0%  . THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AND HIGHER EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF FASB ASU NO. 2016-16, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER BENEFITS FROM FINAL DETERMINATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR TAXES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON MANY FACTORS AND SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY YEAR TO YEAR. WE EXPECT THE  FISCAL 2019  ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO BE IN THE RANGE OF  22.5%  TO  23.5%  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR INTERIM PERIODS CAN VARY BECAUSE OF THE TIMING OF WHEN CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR DURING THE YEAR.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  DECREASED  $88 MILLION  , OR  73%  , FROM THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  DUE TO THE DECREASE IN THE NON-CONTROLLING OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE FROM  4%  HELD BY ACCENTURE HOLDINGS PLC AND ACCENTURE CANADA HOLDINGS INC. TO LESS THAN  1%  HELD BY ONLY ACCENTURE CANADA HOLDINGS INC. DRIVEN BY THE ACCENTURE HOLDINGS PLC MERGER WITH AND INTO ACCENTURE PLC. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE MERGER, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d.  EARNINGS PER SHARE  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $3.69  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $3.16  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  . THE  $0.53  INCREASE IN OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF THE  $137 MILLION  TAX CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX ACT, WHICH DECREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  BY  $0.21  . EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THIS CHARGE, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019  INCREASED  $0.32  COMPARED WITH THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE OF  $0.28  FROM HIGHER REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,  $0.03  FROM LOWER NON-OPERATING EXPENSES  AND  $0.03  FROM LOWER WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF  $0.02  FROM A HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  .FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS, SEE NOTE 3 (EARNINGS PER SHARE) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF  FEBRUARY 28, 2019  , CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WAS  $4.5 BILLION  , COMPARED WITH  $5.1 BILLION  AS OF  AUGUST 31, 2018.

THE  $120 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SPENDING ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 5 (BUSINESS COMBINATIONS) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  THE  $412 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET PURCHASES OF SHARES AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN CASH DIVIDENDS PAID, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN NET PROCEEDS FROM SHARE ISSUANCES. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE  7  (MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS AFFECTING SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT AND LONGER-TERM WORKING CAPITAL, INVESTMENTS AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE SATISFIED FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AND THEREAFTER THROUGH CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND, TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY, FROM OUR BORROWING FACILITIES AND FUTURE FINANCIAL MARKET ACTIVITIES.  SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR CASH IS HELD IN JURISDICTIONS WHERE THERE ARE NO REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS OR MATERIAL TAX EFFECTS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS. DOMESTIC CASH INFLOWS FOR OUR IRISH PARENT, PRINCIPALLY DIVIDEND DISTRIBUTIONS FROM LOWER-TIER SUBSIDIARIES, HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR HISTORIC CASH REQUIREMENTS, AND WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO THE FUTURE.

DESCRIPTION  OF BUSINESS  BACKGROUND  WELLNESS  CENTER USA, INC. (\u201cWCUI\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN JUNE 2010 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  NEVADA. THE COMPANY INITIALLY ENGAGED IN ONLINE SPORTS AND NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY  EXPANDED INTO ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL SECTORS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING PSORIA-SHIELD INC.  (\u201cPSI\u201d), NATIONAL PAIN CENTERS, INC. (\u201cNPC\u201d) AND STEALTHCO INC. (\u201cSCI\u201d), D/B/A STEALTH MARK,  INC. ON AUGUST 11, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NPC, WHICH  HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2016. SEE NOTE 3 FOR DETAILS RELATING TO THE SALE.  THE  COMPANY CURRENTLY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (I) DISTRIBUTION OF TARGETED ULTRA VIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY  DEVICES FOR DERMATOLOGY; AND (II) AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE SEGMENTS ARE OPERATED, RESPECTIVELY,  THROUGH PSI AND SCI.  PSI  PSI WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF  THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JUNE 17, 2009. ON AUGUST 24, 2012, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF STOCK IN PSI.  PSI IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND DURING A PORTION OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT WAS OPERATED  BY PSORIA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY LLC, AN ILLINOIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\u201cPDC\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN WCUI/PSI  AND THE MEDICAL ALLIANCE, INC., A FLORIDA CORPORATION (\u201cTMA\u201d).  17  ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2018, PSI AND TMA ENTERED INTO A WITHDRAW AND MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THEIR JOINT VENTURE  AGREEMENT. ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES OF THE JOINT  VENTURE TOTALED TO $405,383. UPON TERMINATION, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE COMPANY FORGAVE THE  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES AND RECORDED A LOSS FROM DECONSOLIDATION OF  NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST OF $405,383.  IN  DECEMBER 2018, PSI ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH GEN2 TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, LICENSING AND/OR SALE OF  PSI TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH NEO. PSI AND GEN2 WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF NEO, OWNING  50.5% AND 36.0%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE UNITS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF NEO. AN ADDITIONAL 13.5% OF SUCH UNITS  WILL BE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE AS INCENTIVES FOR KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS. UNTIL SUCH SHARES ARE DISTRIBUTED, THE COMPANY  CONTROLS 68% OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND GEN2 THE REMAINING 32%. PSI AND GEN2 WILL MANAGE NEO\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. PSI  WILL CONTRIBUTE PSI TECHNOLOGY TO NEO AND GEN2 WILL CONTRIBUTE $700,000. REPAYMENT OF THE $700,000 INVESTMENT BY GEN2 WILL BEGIN  THROUGH AND UPON THE DATE WHICH NEO HAS REALIZED AND RETAINED CUMULATIVE NET INCOME/DISTRIBUTABLE CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $300,000.  DISTRIBUTIONS THEREAFTER WILL BE MADE TO PSI, GEN2 AND OTHER MEMBERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE UNIT OWNERSHIP, AT THE  TIMES AND IN THE MANNER DETERMINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE MANAGERS, IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. GEN2 CONSISTS OF ACCREDITED INVESTORS,  AND INVESTMENT PARTICIPATION FROM SEVERAL WCUI OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, INCLUDING CALVIN R. O\u2019HARROW AND ROY M. HARSCH.  AS  OF DECEMBER 31, 2018, GEN2 HAD RECEIVED $375,000 OF INVESTMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEO AND THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS PROPORTIONATE  SHARE OF $255,000 TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND $120,000 TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER  31, 2018, NEO DID NOT RECORD ANY INCOME OR EXPENSES RELATING TO ITS OPERATIONS.  PSI  DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS A TARGETED ULTRAVIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE CALLED THE PSORIA-LIGHT. THE PSORIA-LIGHT  IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN TARGETED PUVA PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND UVB PHOTOTHERAPY AND IS DESIGNED TO TREAT CERTAIN SKIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING  PSORIASIS, VITILIGO, ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA), SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS, AND LEUKODERMA.  PSORIASIS,  ECZEMA, AND VITILIGO, ARE COMMON SKIN CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO TREAT, AND OFTEN CAUSE THE CLIENT SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOSOCIAL  STRESS. CLIENTS MAY UNDERGO A VARIETY OF TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE SKIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ROUTINE CONSUMPTION OF SYSTEMIC  AND BIOLOGIC DRUG THERAPIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY TOXIC, REDUCE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION, AND COME WITH A HOST OF CHEMOTHERAPY-LIKE  SIDE EFFECTS. ULTRAVIOLET (UV) PHOTOTHERAPY IS A CLINICALLY VALIDATED ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR THESE DISORDERS.  TRADITIONALLY,  \u201cNON-TARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED BY LAMPS THAT EMITTED EITHER UVA OR UVB LIGHT TO BOTH DISEASED AND  HEALTHY SKIN. WHILE SUNBLOCKS OR OTHER UV BARRIERS MAY BE USED TO PROTECT HEALTHY SKIN, THE UV ADMINISTERED IN THIS MANNER MUST  BE LOW DOSAGE TO AVOID EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE OF HEALTHY TISSUE. TODAY, \u201cTARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES ADMINISTER  MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES OF LIGHT ONLY TO AFFECTED TISSUE, RESULTING IN \u201cCLEARANCE\u201d IN THE CASE OF PSORIASIS AND ECZEMA,  AND \u201cREPIGMENTATION\u201d IN THE CASE OF VITILIGO, AT MUCH FASTER RATES THAN NON-TARGETED (LOW DOSAGE) UV TREATMENTS.  TARGETED  UV TREATMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED TO SMALLER TOTAL BODY SURFACE AREAS, AND ARE THEREFORE USED TO TREAT THE MOST INTENSE  PARTS OF A CLIENT\u2019S DISEASE. NON-TARGETED UV TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY USED AS A FOLLOW-UP AND FOR MAINTENANCE, CAPABLE OF  TREATING LARGE SURFACES OF THE BODY. EXCIMER LASER DEVICES (UVB AT 308NM) ARE EXPENSIVE AND CONSUME DANGEROUS CHEMICALS (XENON  AND CHLORINE). MERCURY LAMP DEVICES (UVB AND/OR UVA) REQUIRE EXPENSIVE LAMP REPLACEMENTS REGULARLY AND REQUIRE SPECIAL DISPOSAL  (DUE TO MERCURY CONTENT). ADDITIONALLY, MERCURY LAMP DEVICES TYPICALLY DELIVER WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT BELOW 300NM. WHILE WITHIN  THE UVB SPECTRUM, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT WAVELENGTHS BELOW 300NM PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE \u201cSUNBURN\u201d TYPE SIDE EFFECTS  THAN DO WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 300 AND 320NM WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT IN THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT.  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT IS A TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE THAT PRODUCES UVB LIGHT BETWEEN 300 AND 320 NM AS WELL AS UVA LIGHT BETWEEN  350 AND 395NM. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSUMPTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR REQUIRE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL, AND IS COST EFFECTIVE  FOR CLINICIANS, WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PATIENT ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE AND ADVANCED  FEATURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE NON-TARGETED AND TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING  USED BY DERMATOLOGISTS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE UTILIZATION OF DEEP NARROW-BAND  UVB (\u201cNB-UVB\u201d) LEDS AS LIGHT SOURCES; THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH UVA OR NB-UVB THERAPEUTIC WAVELENGTHS; AN INTEGRATED  HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL CAMERA AND CLIENT RECORD INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES; THE ABILITY TO EXPORT TO AN EXTERNAL USB MEMORY DEVICE  A PDF FILE OF TREATMENT INFORMATION INCLUDING A PATENT PENDING GRAPH THAT INCLUDES DIGITAL IMAGES PLOTTED AGAINST USER TRACKED  METRICS WHICH CAN BE SUBMITTED TO IMPROVE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS; AN ACCESSORY PORT AND ABILITY TO UPDATE SOFTWARE; EASE OF PLACEMENT  AND PORTABILITY; ADVANCED TREATMENT SITE DETECTION SAFETY SENSOR; INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT; A WARRANTY WHICH INCLUDES THE  UV LAMP(S); AND A NON-CHANGEABLE TREATMENT LOG (THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HIPPA INFORMATION).  18  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS: A BASE CONSOLE, A COLOR DISPLAY WITH TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL, AND A HAND-HELD DELIVERY  DEVICE WITH A CONDUIT (OR TETHER) BETWEEN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND THE BASE CONSOLE. PSI REQUIRES CLEARANCE BY THE UNITED STATES  FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS PERMISSION FROM  TUV SUD AMERICA INC., PSI\u2019S NOTIFIED BODY, TO AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE PSORIA-LIGHT IN ORDER TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE  IN COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  TO  OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE AND PERMISSION TO AFFIX THE CE MARK, PSI WAS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT EMC AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY TESTING, WHICH  IT COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. PSI RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2011 (NO. K103540) AND WAS GRANTED PERMISSION  TO AFFIX THE CE MARK ON NOVEMBER 10, 2011. IN ITS 510(K) APPLICATION WITH THE FDA (APPLICATION NUMBER K103540), PSI ASSERTED THAT  THE PSORIA-LIGHT WAS \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT\u201d IN INTENDED USE AND TECHNOLOGY TO TWO PREDICATE DEVICES, THE X -TRAC  EXCIMER LASER, WHICH HAS WIDE ACCEPTANCE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING LITERATURE AND HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE IN THE U.S., AND THE  DUALIGHT, ANOTHER COMPETING TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE.  PSI  HAS ESTABLISHED AN ISO 13485 COMPLIANT QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE PSORIA-LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRST AUDITED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.  THIS SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE PSI DEVICES WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN A CONTROLLED AND RELIABLE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT ITS RESOURCES  FOLLOW SIMILAR PRACTICES AND IS REQUIRED FOR SALES IN COUNTRIES REQUIRING A CE MARK. PSI HAS ALSO RECEIVED CERTIFIED SPACE TECHNOLOGY  DESIGNATION FROM THE SPACE FOUNDATION, BASED ON PSI\u2019S INCORPORATION OF ESTABLISHED NASA-FUNDED LED TECHNOLOGY.  PSI  BEGAN PSORIA-LIGHT BETA DEPLOYMENT IN JANUARY 2012. IT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND STRATEGIES WILL EVER BE SUCCESSFUL. PSI\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTANCE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS  AND CLIENTS OF PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT AS A PREFERRED METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS AND OTHER UV-TREATABLE SKIN CONDITIONS.  PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO CLIENTS, WITHOUT DEMONSTRABLE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS OR SAFETY ISSUES,  AS EVIDENCED BY MORE THAN 10,000 TREATMENTS COMPLETED ON MORE THAN 1,000 CLIENTS, DOMESTICALLY AND MEXICO, SINCE 2012. IN ORDER  FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE PSI OPERATIONS, IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND IT WILL HAVE TO SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATE INTEGRATION  OF PSI OPERATIONS WITHOUT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING CONTINUATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS.  SCI  SCI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ON MARCH 18, 2014. SCI ACQUIRED CERTAIN STEALTH MARK ASSETS ON APRIL  4, 2014 AND OPERATES AS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. IT IS A TENNESSEE-BASED PROVIDER OF: A) STEALTH MARK ENCRYPTION  AND AUTHENTICATION SOLUTIONS OFFERING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN THE SECURITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT VERTICAL SECTORS  (MICROPARTICLES)  ,  AND B) ADVANCED DATA INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFERING PROPRIETARY, UNPRECEDENTED, AND ACTIONABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES,  AND AGENCIES ON A GLOBAL SCALE (  ACTIVEDUTYTM).  INTELLIGENT  MICROPARTICLES  SCI  PROVIDES CLIENTS PREMIERE AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PROTECTION OF A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND BRANDS FROM ILLICIT COUNTERFEITING  AND DIVERSION ACTIVITIES. ITS TECHNOLOGY IS APPLICABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AFFECTED BY COUNTERFEITING, DIVERSION AND  THEFT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACEUTICALS, DEFENSE/AEROSPACE, AUTOMOTIVE, ELECTRONICS, TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMER AND PERSONAL  CARE GOODS, DESIGNER PRODUCTS, BEVERAGE/SPIRITS, AND MANY OTHERS.  SCI  DELIVERS THE CLIENT A COMPLETE, SIMPLE TO USE, EASY TO IMPLEMENT, AND COST EFFECTIVE TURNKEY SYSTEM THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT  TO COMPROMISE. SCI\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND INTELLIGENT MICROPARTICLE MARKS THAT  ARE UNDUPLICATABLE AND UNDETECTABLE TO THE HUMAN EYE.
