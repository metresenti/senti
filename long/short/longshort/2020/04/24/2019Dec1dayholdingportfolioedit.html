UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR THE CONTEXT REQUIRES OTHERWISE, THE WORDS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, \u201cOUR\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cOUR COMPANY\u201d REFER TO DAIS CORPORATION, A NEW YORK CORPORATION, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  OVERVIEW  DAIS CORPORATION (\u201cDAIS\u201d, \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) IS A NANOMATERIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING PRODUCTS USING THE NANOMATERIAL CALLED AQUALYTE. THE FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS THE AQUALYTE NANOMATERIAL ITSELF. IT IS USEFUL IN MANAGING MOISTURE AND KEY GASES IN A VARIETY OF CROSS-INDUSTRY PRODUCTS. THE SECOND COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS CALLED CONSERV, A FIXED PLATE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATOR WHICH IS USEFUL IN MEETING BUILDING INDOOR FRESH AIR REQUIREMENTS WHILE SAVING ENERGY AND LOWERING EMISSIONS FOR MOST FORMS OF HEATING, VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) EQUIPMENT. THE THIRD COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS NANOCLEAR, A WATER CLEAN-UP PROCESS USEFUL IN THE CREATION OF POTABLE WATER FROM MOST FORMS OF CONTAMINATED WATER INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL PROCESS WASTEWATER (PETROCHEMICAL, STEEL, ETC.) SEA, BRACKISH, OR WASTEWATER. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OTHER AQUALYTE USES IN CROSS-INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, HVAC/REFRIGERATION, ENERGY, AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT.  CORPORATE HISTORY  WE WERE INCORPORATED AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION ON APRIL 8, 1993 AS DAIS CORPORATION. THE COMPANY WAS FORMED TO DEVELOP NEW, COST-EFFECTIVE POLYMER MATERIALS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING PROVIDING A LOWER COST MEMBRANE MATERIAL FOR POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS. WE BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH ON MATERIALS SCIENCE HAS YIELDED TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF SELECTIVE ION TRANSPORT POLYMER MATERIALS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN DECEMBER 1999, THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE ASSETS OF ANALYTIC POWER CORPORATION, A CORPORATION FOUNDED IN 1984 TO PROVIDE DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD OF FUEL CELLS, FUEL PROCESSORS, AND INTEGRATED FUEL CELL POWER SYSTEMS. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON DECEMBER 13, 1999, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME TO DAIS ANALYTIC CORPORATION.  IN MARCH 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ITS FUEL CELL ASSETS TO CHEVRON, A LARGE U.S. OIL COMPANY FOR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION BY SUCH COMPANY OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OBLIGATIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ITS NANO-STRUCTURED POLYMER PLATFORM, HAVING ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATOR (\u201cERV\u201d) APPLICATION AS OUR FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.  IN NOVEMBER OF 2018 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE COMPANY FROM DAIS ANALYTIC CORPORATION TO DAIS CORPORATION (THE \u201cNAME CHANGE\u201d). THE NAME CHANGE TOOK EFFECT WITH FINRA ON FEBRUARY 27, 2019.  OUR TECHNOLOGY  WE USE PROPRIETARY NANOTECHNOLOGY TO REFORMULATE THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS CALLED POLYMERS. NANOTECHNOLOGY INVOLVES STUDYING AND WORKING WITH MATTER ON AN ULTRA-SMALL SCALE. POLYMERS ARE CHEMICAL, PLASTIC-LIKE COMPOUNDS USED IN DIVERSE PRODUCTS SUCH AS DACRON, TEFLON, AND POLYURETHANE. A THERMOPLASTIC IS A MATERIAL THAT IS PLASTIC OR DEFORMABLE, MELTS TO A LIQUID WHEN HEATED AND TO A BRITTLE, GLASSY STATE WHEN COOLED SUFFICIENTLY. THESE REFORMULATED POLYMERS HAVE PROPERTIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE USED IN UNIQUE WAYS. WE TRANSFORM POLYMERS FROM A HARD, WATER IMPERMEABLE SUBSTANCE INTO A MATERIAL WHICH WATER AND SIMILAR LIQUIDS CAN, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, PERMEATE AT A MOLECULAR LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO FLOWING IN BULK AS LIQUID WATER THROUGH A PORE. WATER AND SIMILAR MOLECULES PERMEATE READILY THROUGH THE THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL WHILE OXYGEN AND MOST CHEMICALS SHOW SEVERELY LIMITED PERMEABILITY. IT IS BELIEVED THIS SELECTIVITY DEPENDS ON THE SIZE AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOLECULES. WE CALL THIS SPECIALIZED MATERIAL AQUALYTE.  AQUALYTE  TM  THE COMPANY INVENTED AND PATENTED A DISRUPTIVE PLATFORM PLASTIC MATERIAL TECHNOLOGY CALLED AQUALYTE WITH CAREFULLY TAILORED PROPERTIES FOR USE IN AIR, ENERGY AND WATER APPLICATIONS. IT IS MADE FROM COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE POLYMER RESIN IN FLAKE FORM AND INDUSTRIAL GRADE SOLVENTS WHICH ARE MIXED USING A PROPRIETARY PROCESS INVOLVING HEAT, INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, AND SOLVENTS. THE RESIN AND THE SOLVENTS ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FROM ANY NUMBER OF CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSES, OR FIRMS SUCH AS DOW. OUR PROCESS CHANGES THE MOLECULAR PROPERTIES OF THE STARTING POLYMER RESINS SUCH THAT IN THEIR FINAL FORM THEY SELECTIVELY ALLOW MOLECULES THROUGH THE PLASTIC, INCLUDING WATER MOLECULES.  THE COMPANY USES PATENT-PROTECTED AND TRADE SECRET RECIPES AND PROCESSES TO FORMULATE THE AQUALYTE RESIN INTO THIN FILM MEMBRANES WITH CAREFULLY CONTROLLED COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE. THIS MODIFIED BLOCK CO-POLYMER MEMBRANE WITH A NANOSCALE ORGANIZATION SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE DAIS PRODUCT LINE. IT IS A NON-POROUS NANOMATERIAL THAT SELECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORTS MOISTURE THROUGH A SOLID MEMBRANE AND BLOCKS PASSAGE OF MOST GASES AND VOLATILE COMPOUNDS. THE MEMBRANE IS ROBUST AND DURABLE WITH NO PORES TO CLOG AND NO BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL GROWTH. WE BEGAN SELLING AQUALYTE IN 2018 TO STRATEGIC CUSTOMERS AND CONTINUE TO HAVE GROWING SALES OF AQUALYTE. WE PROJECT EVEN FURTHER GROWTH IN THIS AREA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND BEYOND.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEXT GENERATION VERSIONS OF OUR AQUALYTE MATERIAL BY ADDING NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVING THE MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE NANOMATERIAL. THESE AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ALLOW AQUALYTE TO SERVE A WIDER VARIETY OF USES IN THE CONSERV AND NANOCLEAR TARGET MARKETS. AQUALYTE IS THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONSERV, FIXED-PLATE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATORS (ERVS), AND NANOCLEAR, A HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTAMINATED WATER CLEANING PROCESS. AQUALYTE REPRESENTS THE BASIS FOR A BROAD CLASS OF MATERIALS WITH UNIQUE FEATURES PRECISELY MANAGED BY ENGINEERED PROCESSES. FEATURES OF THE AQUALYTE TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO CREATE HERMETIC COMPOSITE MEMBRANES POSSESSING ION CONDUCTION, HIGH MOISTURE TRANSFER AND HIGH MOLECULAR SELECTIVITY. OUR ENGINEERING PROCESS MANAGES THESE FEATURES TO OFFER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS LIKE CONSERV AND NANOCLEAR THAT ARE TARGETING WORLDWIDE NEEDS IN THE CLEAN AIR, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN WATER MARKETS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JULY OF 2017, DAIS FIRST ENTERED INTO A MULTI-YEAR, EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE HAIER GROUP TO PROVIDE ITS AQUALYTE  NANOMATERIALS FOR USE IN SELECT REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS. THIS FIRST AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO GENERATE QUARTERLY REVENUE FOR DAIS. WE PROJECT THESE REVENUES SHOULD INCREASE AS HAIER CONTINUES ITS FULL ROLLOUT WHICH IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETE DURING 2020. DAIS PROJECTS THIS FIRST AGREEMENT FOR TARGETED REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS SHOULD ULTIMATELY GENERATE OVER $5 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES. HAIER\u2019S USE OF DAIS\u2019S AQUALYTE MATERIAL FOLLOWS A GROWING WORLD-WIDE TREND REPORTED  BY MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS  (JULY 18, 2018) THAT STATES GLOBAL ADOPTION OF MATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY MATERIALS CONTINUES TO GROW AND IS ON TRACK TO REACH $90.5 BILLION BY 2021 FROM $39.2 BILLION IN 2016 AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR) OF 18.2%, FROM 2016 TO 2021. DAIS WAS LISTED AS ONE OF THE COMPANIES BY  MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS  ALONG WITH BASF, BAYER AG, DOW CHEMICAL, AND OTHERS.  IN ADDITION, DURING 2019 AND IN THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2019, DAIS SOLD AQUALYTE TO MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS FOR USE IN VENTILATION AND WASTEWATER CLEANING USES. THESE SALES ARE CONTINUING IN 2019 AND WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO 2020 AS WELL.  CONSERV  TM  WE CONTINUE WIDENING SALES CHANNELS FOR OUR CONSERV PRODUCT, AN HVAC ENERGY CONSERVATION PRODUCT WHICH SHOULD SAVE AN AVERAGE OF 30% ON HVAC VENTILATION AIR OPERATING COSTS. THESE SAVINGS TYPICALLY ALLOW THE REMAINDER OF THE SYSTEM TO BE SMALLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE, REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO  2  ) EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION. CONSERV GENERALLY ATTACHES ONTO EXISTING HVAC SYSTEMS, TYPICALLY IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, TO PROVIDE IMPROVED VENTILATION AIR WITHIN THE STRUCTURE. CONSERV SEPARATES INCOMING FRESH VENTILATION AIR FROM OUTGOING EXHAUST AIR WITH OUR AQUALYTE NANOTECHNOLOGY POLYMER IN AN ENTHALPY HEAT EXCHANGER REFERRED TO AS A \u201cCORE\u201d. WHILE AQUALYTE PHYSICALLY ISOLATES THE AIR STREAMS SO THEY DON\u2019T MIX, HEAT AND MOISTURE ARE FREELY EXCHANGED THROUGH THE MATERIAL. FOR SUMMER AIR CONDITIONING, THE CORE REMOVES SOME OF THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY FROM THE INCOMING AIR AND TRANSFERS IT TO THE EXHAUST AIR STREAM, THEREBY SAVING ENERGY UNDER MANY CONDITIONS. FOR WINTER HEATING, THE CORE TYPICALLY RECOVERS A PORTION OF THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY IN THE EXHAUST AIR AND TRANSFERS IT INTO THE INCOMING AIR TO REDUCE HEARING REQUIREMENTS.  CONSERV SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AT THE BEGINNING OF 2017 FROM THE DECEMBER 2016 TERMINATION OF A FAILED LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A NORTH AMERICAN COMPANY. IN 2018, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING ITS CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING THIS EFFORT TO EXPAND ITS NORTH AMERICAN SALES CHANNELS TO GROW CONSERV SALES WITH INITIATIVES AIMED AT TARGETED PROFESSIONALS AND COMPANIES SPECIALIZING IN THE SALE OF HVAC COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING NANOMATERIAL TO COMPANIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CONTINUES DISCUSSIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES TO EXPAND THE MARKET FOR AQUALYTE SALES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER THE COMPANY BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TO SPECIFY OR DISTRIBUTE CONSERV NANOMATERIAL, CORES AND SYSTEMS. IT IS BELIEVED OUR CONTINUING EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS WILL SEE REVENUES GROW THROUGHOUT 2019 INTO 2020, AND BEYOND.  IN DECEMBER 2017 JULY 2017, WE SIGNED A 7-YEAR EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE ZHEJIANG MENRED ENVIRONMENTAL TECH CO., LTD, ZHEJIANG PROVINCE , CHINA, TO PROVIDE OUR AQUALYTE MOISTURE TRANSFER NANOMATERIAL IN A NEW LINE OF MENRED ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATORS (ERV) TO BE SOLD IN THE GROWING CHINESE HVAC MARKET, AND FOR POSSIBLE EXPORT USE BY DAIS TO MEET ITS GROWING NEEDS. THIS ARRANGEMENT GENERATED ITS FIRST REVENUES IN THE QUARTER REPRESENTED BY THIS FILING, AND IT IS PROJECTED TO YIELD INCREASING REVENUES THROUGHOUT 2019 INTO 2020, AND BEYOND.  WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE, BASED ON TEST RESULTS CONDUCTED BY THE AIR-CONDITIONING, HEATING AND REFRIGERATION INSTITUTE (AHRI), A LEADING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, CONSERV MAINTAINS AN INDUSTRY-LEADING POSITION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LATENT HEAT. THE COMPANY INTRODUCED AN UPDATED LINE OF CONSERV PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2019 MARKETED AS VITALITY  TM  , PURITY  TM  AND CLARITY  TM  WITH FURTHER UPGRADES PROJECTED TO BE INTRODUCED IN 1Q 2020. SALES FROM THESE PRODUCTS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE REVENUE DURING 2019 AND BEYOND.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NANOCLEAR  TM  WE HAVE COMMERCIALLY INTRODUCED THE FIRST NANOCLEAR MEMBRANE EVAPORATORS FOR PILOT TESTING, WHICH REMOVE QUANTITIES OF METALS, ACIDS, SALT AND OTHER IMPURITIES FROM VARIOUS CONTAMINATED WATER SOURCES, PRODUCING POTABLE WATER USING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, LOW MAINTENANCE DESIGN THAT IS COMPETITIVE WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS IN TERMS OF ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION. WE CONSTRUCTED AND OPERATE A PILOT PLANT INSTALLED AT A LOCAL COUNTY WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY THAT WAS COMMISSIONED IN MAY 2013 AND UPDATED TO THE CURRENT GENERATION OF MEMBRANE EVAPORATOR IN NOVEMBER 2016. THIS SITE HAS SERVED AS A SHOWCASE FOR POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS A TEST BED FOR NEWER MATERIALS AND HARDWARE READYING FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. THE ACCUMULATED TEST DATA, ANALYZED BY AN INDEPENDENT 3RD PARTY FIRM, SHOWS THE QUALITY OF THE WATER BEING PRODUCED HAS NOT DIMINISHED SINCE SYSTEM START-UP. THE EVOLVING NANOCLEAR PRODUCT LINE PURIFIES CONTAMINATED WATER, CREATED LARGELY DURING COOLING OF KEY MANUFACTURING AND UTILITY PROCESSES. THESE SORTS OF APPLICATIONS ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY FOCUS. THIS INCLUDES HIGHER SALT CONCENTRATIONS AND LOW PH WASTE STREAMS.  DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON A U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, $1,000,000, PHASE II SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) AWARD CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 2019 TO DEVELOP NANOCLEAR WATER CLEANING TECHNOLOGY FOR MILITARY USE. THE NANOCLEAR FUNDING PROJECT TITLED \"NON-FOULING WATER REUSE TECHNOLOGIES\" USES OUR PATENTED AQUALYTE MEMBRANE TO PRODUCE POTABLE WATER FROM GREY-WATER SOURCES. THE POTENTIAL PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS FROM THIS AWARD WILL WIDEN NANOCLEAR\u2019S APPLICATIONS IN SEPARATING CLEAN WATER FROM CONTAMINATED WASTE STREAMS.  WE RECEIVED ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF OUR NANOCLEAR INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER CLEANING PRODUCT FOR PILOT EVALUATIONS IN MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES THROUGHOUT 2018 AND THUS FAR IN 2019. THE PRODUCT\u2019S CORE STRENGTH, SUPPORTED BY COMPANY, CUSTOMER, AND THIRD PARTY GENERATED INFORMATION, IS ITS ABILITY TO CLEAN CONTAMINATED WASTEWATER CREATED BY A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE DELIVERED OUR LARGEST COMMERCIAL PROJECT TO DATE IN THE QUARTER ENDING IN JUNE 2019, WITH NANOCLEAR EVAPORATOR MODULES FOR INSTALLATION IN MULTIPLE COGENERATION POWER PLANT TEST SITES IN CHINA.  POLYCOOL  TM  POLYCOOL IS A PRODUCT IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS BELIEVED TO OFFER STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING COOLING TOWER SYSTEMS. IN EFFECT, THE PROCESS WATER IS ISOLATED IN A LARGELY CLOSED SYSTEM (LIKE DRY COOLING TECHNOLOGY) AND INITIAL TESTING SHOWS IT REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DANGEROUS GERMS AND VIRUSES SUCH AS LEGIONELLA BECOMING AIRBORNE. IN-HOUSE TESTING HAS SHOWN THE ABILITY TO GENERATE COOLING EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO TODAY\u2019S EXISTING COOLING TOWERS WHILE LARGELY ISOLATING THE PROCESS WATER FROM THE AIR STREAM.  POLYCOOL SYSTEMS ARE EXPECTED TO USE UP TO 32% LESS ENERGY THAN A CONVENTIONAL COOLING TOWER WHILE REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE CHEMICAL BIOCIDE APPLICATION PROGRAMS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF RISK OF SPREADING DANGEROUS DISEASES. WE BELIEVE THESE SAVINGS CAN REDUCE THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF A COOLING TOWER BY UP 74% VERSUS CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY. THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY OF AQUALYTE TO RESIST FOULING AND OPERATE WITH DISSOLVED SOLIDS LEVELS UP TO 25% SALINITY ALLOWS POLYCOOL TECHNOLOGY TO OPERATE WITH SEAWATER, BRINE, OR OTHER FORMS OF WASTEWATER INSTEAD OF CONSUMING POTABLE WATER AS WITH CONVENTIONAL EVAPORATIVE COOLING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS ADVANTAGE EXPANDS THE APPLICABILITY OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING INTO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM WATER SCARCITY OR STRESS. IN ADDITION, THE DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY ISSUES ALLOWS USE OF POLYCOOL IN SMALLER INSTALLATIONS WITH CORRESPONDINGLY SMALLER MAINTENANCE BUDGETS AND LESS RISK TOLERANCE, WHICH CONVENTIONALLY USE LESS EFFICIENT DRY COOLING INSTEAD OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY (SEPTEMBER 2018) ANNOUNCED THAT WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND DEFINITIVE TWO-PART, LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE HAIER GROUP OF QINGDAO, CHINA FOR A NEW PRODUCT FOR HAIER\u2019S HVAC COOLING SYSTEMS. PROTOTYPE TESTING CONTINUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019; ONCE COMPLETE, THE PRODUCT WILL MOVE INTO FIELD TESTING PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT INTO HAIER\u2019S SALES CHANNELS THROUGHOUT GREATER CHINA. ONCE SUCCESSFUL FIELD TESTING IS COMPLETE, THE NEW PRODUCT IS ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE IMPACT FOR DAIS, PROJECTED TO BE AS MUCH AS $73 MILLION ANNUALLY. THESE REVENUES COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020. THE PRODUCT IS AN INNOVATIVE POLYCOOL CONDENSING UNIT DESIGNED FOR INCORPORATION INTO COMMERCIAL HAIER COOLING UNITS TO BE DEPLOYED INTO HAIER\u2019S GREATER CHINA SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.  PRODUCT SUMMARY  DAIS\u2019S ADVANCED MATERIAL HAS MANY DEMONSTRATED USES IN THE DESCRIBED PRODUCTS. MANAGEMENT IS PLACING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RESOURCES BEHIND THE TWO MOST MATURE PRODUCTS IN TWO MAJOR REVENUE GENERATING PATHS: CONSERV CORES, AND SYSTEMS, AND THE SALE OF AQUALYTE NANOMATERIALS AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT IN AREAS WHERE AQUALYTE HAS SHOWN PROVEN RESULTS YET DAIS\u2019S PRODUCT IN THESE AREAS OVER COMMITS THE COMPANY\u2019S RESOURCES AND PRODUCT MATURITY.  MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THIS NARROWER FOCUS WILL INCREASE REVENUES ALLOWING PROFITABILITY TO OCCUR FASTER BY LEVERAGING ITS DEPTH IN MARKETING, BUILDING AND SELLING CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS MAINLY IN N. AMERICA, AND IN SELLING HIGH PERFORMING AQUALYTE NANOMATERIAL WHERE AQUALYTE HAS SHOWN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OVER CURRENT INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS.  THE ADVANCE MATERIALS-ONLY SALES ACTIVITIES ARE BEING DONE WITH SELECT, SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOUTH EAST ASIA (INCLUDING CHINA) WHICH TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF DAIS\u2019S PAST AND CONTINUING MARKET PENETRATION EFFORTS. THE USES INCLUDE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATION AND OTHER KNOWN HVAC AND SELECT CROSS-INDUSTRY USES.  TO HELP US SUPPORT OUR CAPABILITIES TO DELIVER CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS, AND AQUALYTE ADVANCED NANOMATERIAL, WE HAVE QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING COMPANIES TO JOIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO PRODUCE MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS FOR US, GUIDED BY DAIS-QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING PRACTICES TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR PRODUCT IN N. AMERICA, IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOUTH EAST ASIA (INCLUDING CHINA). WE PROJECT THIS EXPANSION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN WILL RESULT IN LOWER COSTS AND QUICKER ORDER FULFILLMENT, GENERATING REVENUES FASTER.  ORDERS ARE ALREADY BEING GENERATED FROM THESE AGREEMENTS, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO INCREASE AS WE EXPAND AND ADD NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. THE NEW ORDERS INCLUDE SALES OF AQUALYTE NANOMATERIALS, COMPONENTS FOR ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATION, AND OTHER KNOWN HVAC AND SELECT CROSS INDUSTRY PRODUCTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN DATA DERIVED FROM OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE GROSS MARGIN INCREASE RESULTED FROM FOCUSED EFFORTS TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE INCURRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $214,292 AND $246,499 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, A DECREASE OF $32,207 OR 13%. WE ACCOUNT FOR PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A REDUCTION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE RECORDED PROCEEDS AGAINST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ON THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OF $55,849 AND $49,304 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, AN INCREASE OF $6,545 OR 13%. VARIANCES IN GRANT EXPENDITURES AND REIMBURSEMENTS ARE DUE TO AN EMPHASIS ON COMPLETING AN EXISTING SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH PHASE II GRANT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PAYROLL AND RELATED BENEFITS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, PROFESSIONAL FEES, MARKETING AND CHANNEL SUPPORT COSTS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS SUCH AS INSURANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,025,043 AND $1,492,330 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, A DECREASE OF $467,287 OR 31%  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u00b7  ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR CONSERV  AND AQUALYTE  PRODUCTS AND/OR NEW PRODUCT APPLICATIONS OF OUR POLYMER TECHNOLOGY FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, PHYSICAL SPACE, MARKETING AND CHANNEL SUPPORT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;  \u00b7  THE ISSUANCE AND RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO FAIR VALUE OF NEW SHARE-BASED AWARDS, WHICH IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE; AND  \u00b7  ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF BEING AN SEC REPORTING COMPANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE, DIRECTOR FEES, SEC COMPLIANCE EXPENSES, TRANSFER AGENT FEES, ADDITIONAL STAFFING, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND SIMILAR EXPENSES.  THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 IS THE RESULT OF DECREASED PAYROLL COSTS AND MARKETING EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER EXPENSES WERE $1,766,798 AND $643,709 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF $1,123,089 OR 174.5%. THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL DEBT DISCOUNT, FINANCE COST, CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES (PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE), AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF DEBT AT TIME OF EXTINGUISHMENT, AND ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $2,623,838 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $2,024,561 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER LOSS IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ASSUMING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $2,623,838 AND HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $52,761,028, A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $8,285,957 AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $13,774. WE USED $474,624 AND $637,076 OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS FUNDED PRIMARILY BY PROCEEDS FROM NOTE PAYABLES AND GROSS MARGIN. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED. WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING THE FOLLOWING SOURCES OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM WORKING CAPITAL.  1.  WE ARE HOLDING PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH PARTIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LICENSING, PURCHASING THE RIGHTS TO OR ESTABLISHING A JOINT VENTURE TO COMMERCIALIZE APPLICATIONS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY.  2.  WE ARE SEEKING GROWTH CAPITAL FROM CERTAIN STRATEGIC AND/OR GOVERNMENT (GRANT) RELATED SOURCES. THESE SOURCES MAY, PURSUANT TO ANY AGREEMENTS THAT MAY BE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SUCH FUNDING, ASSIST IN THE PRODUCT DEFINITION AND DESIGN, ROLL-OUT AND CHANNEL PENETRATION OF PRODUCTS.  3.  THE COMPANY IS HOLDING DISCUSSIONS WITH INVESTORS, POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERS, AND INVESTMENT BANKS TO OBTAIN DEBT AND/OR EQUITY FINANCING.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION AND OUR PROJECTED ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS, GIVEN THE GROWTH IN 2019 IN MANUFACTURING AND SALES OF PRODUCTS BOTH IN CONSERV AND AQUALYTE IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BALANCE OF 2019. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE SUCH ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF PRODUCT REVENUE OR CAPITAL.  ANY FAILURE BY US TO TIMELY PROCURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR INVESTMENT ADEQUATE TO FUND THE ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PLANNED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, WILL HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AS COULD ANY UNFAVORABLE TERMS. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING AND PLANNED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COMMERCIALIZATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSETS, OR THE AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT IN JUNE 2016 PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED A SENIOR SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE THAT GRANTS THE HOLDER A SECURED INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $13,774 COMPARED TO $29,300 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. CASH IS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $474,624 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $637,076 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING LOSS, CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSIT AND AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $5,222 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $47,032 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN PATENT COSTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $464,320 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $766,336 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, RESULTING FROM LOANS FROM A RELATED PARTY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS  ON JUNE 24, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (\u201cSECURITY AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH PATRICIA TANGREDI (THE \u201cHOLDER\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED A SENIOR SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE FOR $150,000 (THE \u201cNOTE\u201d). THE INTEREST RATE IS 12% PER ANNUM COMPOUNDED DAILY WITH A MINIMUM INTEREST PAYMENT OF $2,000. THE NOTE GRANTS THE HOLDER A SECURED INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. MS. TANGREDI IS THE WIFE OF TIMOTHY N. TANGREDI, THE COMPANY\u2019S CEO AND STOCKHOLDER, AND THEREFORE IS A RELATED PARTY OF THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE NOTE, THE COMPANY IS TO PAY THE HOLDER THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $150,000 PLUS ALL INTEREST DUE THEREON IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SECURITY AGREEMENT ON THE EARLIER OF: (I) THE DATE UPON WHICH THE COMPANY SECURES FUNDS, REGARDLESS OF SOURCE, EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING, IN THE AGGREGATE, $1,000,000 OR (II) OCTOBER 31, 2016.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING 2016 THROUGH THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE HOLDER EXTENDED THE NOTE PURSUANT TO VARIOUS AMENDMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENTS, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DUE WAS INCREASED TO $1,592,500 WITH AN EXTENDED MATURITY DATE OF NOVEMBER 21, 2019. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS AND MODIFICATION OF THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY ISSUED TO THE RELATED PARTY WARRANTS TO PURCHASE AN AGGREGATE OF 78,250,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $0.01 WITH A TEN-YEAR EXERCISE PERIOD AND 480,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE THIRTEEN WEEKS (THIRD QUARTER) AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS (NINE MONTHS) ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO  THE THIRTEEN WEEKS (THIRD QUARTER) AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS (NINE MONTHS) ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018  OVERVIEW  WE ARE THE LEADING OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS RETAILER IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. WE SELL A RAPIDLY CHANGING ASSORTMENT OF APPAREL, HOME FASHIONS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE AT PRICES GENERALLY 20% TO 60% BELOW FULL-PRICE RETAILERS\u2019 (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT, SPECIALTY AND MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS) REGULAR PRICES ON COMPARABLE MERCHANDISE, EVERY DAY. WE OPERATE OVER 4,500 STORES THROUGH OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS: IN THE U.S., MARMAXX (WHICH OPERATES T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS, TJMAXX.COM AND MARSHALLS.COM) AND HOMEGOODS (WHICH OPERATES HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE); TJX CANADA (WHICH OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA); AND TJX INTERNATIONAL (WHICH OPERATES T.K. MAXX, HOMESENSE AND TKMAXX.COM IN EUROPE, AND T.K. MAXX IN AUSTRALIA). IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  \u2013  NET SALES INCREASED 6% TO $10.5 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER SALES OF $9.8 BILLION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE NUMBER OF STORES IN OPERATION INCREASED 5% AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE END OF THE FISCAL 2019 THIRD QUARTER.  \u2013  COMP SALES INCREASED 4% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OVER AN INCREASE OF 7% FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE COMP SALES INCREASE AT ALL FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS.  \u2013  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $0.68 VERSUS $0.61 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  PRE-TAX MARGIN (THE RATIO OF PRE-TAX INCOME TO NET SALES) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 10.7%, FLAT COMPARED WITH 10.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, RATIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 71.2%, A 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH 71.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 18.0%, A 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH 17.9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY ON HAND AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY IN TRANSIT) AND EXCLUDING OUR E-COMMERCE SITES AND SIERRA STORES, WERE UP 9% ON A REPORTED BASIS AND CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO A 9% INCREASE IN AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES ON A REPORTED BASIS AND A 10% INCREASE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RETURNED $778 MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  INVESTMENT IN FAMILIA  ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY, THROUGH A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, COMPLETED AN INVESTMENT OF $225 MILLION FOR A 25% OWNERSHIP STAKE IN PRIVATELY HELD FAMILIA, AN ESTABLISHED, OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS RETAILER WITH MORE THAN 275 STORES THROUGHOUT RUSSIA. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT REPRESENTS A NON-CONTROLLING, MINORITY POSITION. AS PART OF THIS INVESTMENT, TJX HAS THE RIGHT TO APPOINT ONE MEMBER TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FAMILIA.  THE INVESTMENT WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FROM THE DATE OF INVESTMENT FORWARD. TJX WILL REPORT ITS SHARE OF FAMILIA\u2019S RESULTS ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG AS THEIR RESULTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN TIME TO BE RECORDED IN THE CONCURRENT PERIOD.  IMPACT OF BREXIT  THE U.K\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT\u201d, REMAINS UNSETTLED. SHOULD THE U.K. EXIT THE EU, THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EACH OF WHICH CREATES RISKS FOR TJX, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. CURRENT U.K. LAW STATES THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE EU ON JANUARY 31, 2020 WITH OR WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU, THE LATTER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \"HARD BREXIT\". OUR TJX EUROPE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EVALUATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, IDENTIFIED AREAS OF CONCERN AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO HELP MITIGATE THEM.  24  OUR CURRENT EUROPEAN OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND LABOR BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE BREXIT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE MERCHANDISE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. BREXIT COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR TALENT IN THE REGION, BOTH BY IMPACTING CURRENT ASSOCIATES, WHO ARE EITHER EU CITIZENS WORKING IN THE U.K. OR U.K. CITIZENS WORKING IN THE EU, AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FOR OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  IF THE U.K. DOES EXIT THE EU, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. WE HAVE REALIGNED OUR EUROPEAN DIVISION\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF MERCHANDISE FLOWING BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND HAVE ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THIS PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ASSOCIATES ABOUT BREXIT INCLUDING PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED POST-BREXIT. IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS MENTIONED ABOVE, FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND BEHAVIOR, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES, CUSTOMS DUTIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT TO OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH A HARD BREXIT.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. WE BELIEVE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN, AND PLAN TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, WILL HELP US MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT WE EXPECT COULD RESULT FROM BREXIT THAT COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO TRADE EFFECTIVELY IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  TARIFFS  TO DATE, THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED, AND CONTINUES TO PROPOSE ADDITIONAL TARIFFS ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE DEVELOPMENTS VERY CLOSELY AND HAVE STARTED TO SEE MARGIN PRESSURE BASED ON THE TARIFFS CURRENTLY IN PLACE ON THE GOODS SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM CHINA. THE IMPACT ON VENDOR AND COMPETITOR PRICING, CONSUMER DEMAND, POTENTIAL TARIFF PASS-THROUGHS AND THE FLUCTUATION OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY IS UNCERTAIN.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 TOTALED $10.5 BILLION, A 6% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER NET SALES OF $9.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 3% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INCREASE COMPARES TO SALES GROWTH OF 12% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH REFLECTS A 7% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 6% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  NET SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 TOTALED $29.5 BILLION, A 6% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S NINE-MONTH NET SALES OF $27.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 3% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INCREASE COMPARES TO A SALES GROWTH OF 12% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH REFLECTS A 6% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES, A 5% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 1% POSITIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, OUR STORE COUNT INCREASED 5% AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER LAST YEAR.  COMP SALES FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 REFLECT AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL MAJOR SEGMENTS. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS' PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARABLE FOR THE QUARTER AND APPAREL OUTPERFORMED HOME FASHIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. COMP SALES GROWTH FOR TJX INTERNATIONAL WAS ABOVE THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE AND TJX CANADA WAS BELOW THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, OR COMP SALES, TO BE SALES OF STORES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TWO CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS, OR IN OTHER WORDS, STORES THAT ARE STARTING THEIR THIRD FISCAL YEAR OF OPERATION. WE CALCULATE COMP SALES ON A 52-WEEK BASIS BY COMPARING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR WEEKLY PERIODS THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED. RELOCATED STORES AND STORES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN SIZE ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ORIGINAL STORE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE STORES ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMP PERCENTAGE IS IMMATERIAL.  WE DEFINE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AND AVERAGE TICKET TO BE THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE OF THE UNITS SOLD. WE DEFINE AVERAGE TRANSACTION OR AVERAGE BASKET TO BE THE AVERAGE DOLLAR VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION.  25  SALES EXCLUDED FROM COMP SALES (\u201cNON-COMP SALES\u201d) CONSIST OF SALES FROM.  \u2013  NEW STORES - STORES THAT HAVE NOT YET MET THE COMP SALES CRITERIA, WHICH REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-COMP SALES  \u2013  STORES THAT ARE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME  \u2013  SALES FROM OUR E-COMMERCE SITES, MEANING SIERRA.COM, TJMAXX.COM, MARSHALLS.COM AND TKMAXX.COM  WE DETERMINE WHICH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND THE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR UNLESS A STORE IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR. STARTING IN FISCAL 2020, SIERRA STORES THAT OTHERWISE FIT THE COMP STORE DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN COMP STORES IN OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT.  COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS AT THE SAME EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS REMOVES THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  COMP SALES MAY BE REFERRED TO AS \u201cSAME STORE\u201d SALES BY OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING COMP SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THEREFORE OUR MEASURE OF COMP SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR OR A DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES. TWO WAYS IN WHICH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2013  TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATIONS OF TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING CURRENCY RATES IN EFFECT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS CAN RESULT IN MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS IN NET SALES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE SEGMENTS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION GENERALLY DOES NOT AFFECT OPERATING MARGINS, OR AFFECTS THEM ONLY SLIGHTLY, AS SALES AND EXPENSES OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD.  \u2013  INVENTORY-RELATED DERIVATIVES.  WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO INVENTORY-RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR DIVISIONS, PRINCIPALLY TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL. AS WE HAVE NOT ELECTED \u201cHEDGE ACCOUNTING\u201d FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WE RECORD A MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET WHEN THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED IS RECEIVED AND PAID FOR. WHILE THESE EFFECTS OCCUR EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THEY ARE OF MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT ON THESE DERIVATIVES DOES NOT AFFECT NET SALES, BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE COST OF SALES, OPERATING MARGINS AND EARNINGS WE REPORT.  26  WE REFER TO THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE TWO ITEMS THROUGHOUT OUR DISCUSSION AS \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY.\u201d THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE ON VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN AN OPERATING DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY. WHEN DISCUSSING THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS WE REFER TO IT AS \u201cTRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE.\u201d  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 71.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 71.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 71.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, AN INCREASE OF 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 71.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES GROWTH. MERCHANDISE MARGIN REFLECTS INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE 18.0% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER RATIO OF 17.9%. THE INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WAGE INCREASES AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TJX FOUNDATION.  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND FLAT TO LAST YEAR'S RATIO FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE EXPENSE RATIO REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND A BENEFIT FROM INSURANCE CLAIM SETTLEMENTS RECEIVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND WAGE INCREASES OFFSET THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS.  PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TJX ANNUITIZED AND TRANSFERRED CURRENT PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN U.S. RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE FUNDED PLAN THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF A GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACT WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY. TJX TRANSFERRED $207.4 MILLION OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY, THEREBY REDUCING ITS PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE TRANSACTION HAD NO CASH IMPACT ON TJX BUT DID RESULT IN A NON-CASH PRE-TAX PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE OF $36.1 MILLION.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT ACCOUNTING AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE A\u2014BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 26.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 27.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 25.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 25.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCED IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF INCOME.  27  NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $828 MILLION, OR $0.68 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO $762 MILLION, OR $0.61 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE HAD A $0.02 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A $0.01 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS $2.3 BILLION, OR $1.86 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO $2.2 BILLION, OR $1.75 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE THIRD QUARTER PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE HAD A $0.02 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A $0.01 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO A $0.01 POSITIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHICH REDUCE OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING, BENEFITED OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 3% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  WE OPERATE FOUR MAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS. OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT (T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS, TJMAXX.COM AND MARSHALLS.COM) AND THE HOMEGOODS SEGMENT (HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE) BOTH OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR TJX CANADA SEGMENT OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA, AND OUR TJX INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES T.K. MAXX, HOMESENSE AND TKMAXX.COM IN EUROPE AND T.K. MAXX IN AUSTRALIA. IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS BASED ON \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d WHICH WE DEFINE AS PRE-TAX INCOME OR LOSS BEFORE GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d AS WE DEFINE THE TERM, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER ENTITIES. THE TERMS \u201cSEGMENT MARGIN\u201d OR \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN\u201d ARE USED TO DESCRIBE SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.

THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH PERIOD REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 2% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. GEOGRAPHICALLY, COMP SALES GROWTH FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. HOME FASHIONS OUTPERFORMED APPAREL FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN INCREASED TO 12.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 12.8% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY STORE EXPENSE SAVINGS, LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020 AND EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS FLAT TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES WERE OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON AND REDUCED MARKDOWNS.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 13.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 13.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020, EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DUE TO INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON AND REDUCED MARKDOWNS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, MARMAXX MADE ONLINE SHOPPING AVAILABLE AT WWW.MARSHALLS.COM, ITS NEW E-COMMERCE WEBSITE. OUR U.S. E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES, WHICH REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF MARMAXX\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR SEGMENT MARGIN COMPARISONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  29  HOMEGOODS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,582  $1,464  $4,404  $4,061  SEGMENT PROFIT  $173  $166  $439  $456  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  10.9%  11.3%  10.0%  11.2%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  1%  7%  \u2014%  4%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE THIRD QUARTER REPRESENTS A 7% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND 1% COMP SALES. THE NINE-MONTH INCREASE IN NET SALES REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 8% FROM NON-COMP SALES AND FLAT COMP SALES. THE 1% COMP SALES INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 10.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 11.3% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE COMP SALES AND THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DUE TO STRONG MARKON AND LOWER MARKDOWNS WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 10.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 11.2% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE COMP SALES, THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.  30  FOREIGN SEGMENTS  TJX CANADA  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,082  $1,037  $2,897  $2,828  SEGMENT PROFIT  $170  $182  $386  $446  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  15.7%  17.6%  13.3%  15.8%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  2%  5%  1%  5%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE THIRD QUARTER REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 2% INCREASE IN COMP SALES GROWTH, OFFSET BY A 2% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE NINE-MONTH INCREASE IN NET SALES REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 1% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES GROWTH, OFFSET BY A 3% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 15.7% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 17.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSSES, HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN STORE PAYROLL, DUE TO WAGE INCREASES, COLLECTIVELY REDUCED SEGMENT MARGIN BY 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE 2% COMP SALES GROWTH, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE FISCAL 2020 SEGMENT MARGIN AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. THE HIGHER COST OF MERCHANDISE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS PUT PRESSURE ON THE THIRD QUARTER MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 13.3% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 15.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. MERCHANDISE MARGIN DECREASED BY 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE COST OF MERCHANDISE. CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSSES, HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN STORE PAYROLL COLLECTIVELY REDUCED SEGMENT MARGIN BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION, SEGMENT MARGIN REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON RELATED TO A LEASE BUYOUT GAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE 1% COMP SALES GROWTH.  31  TJX INTERNATIONAL  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,433  $1,352  $3,947  $3,754  SEGMENT PROFIT  $99  $102  $178  $192  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  6.9%  7.6%  4.5%  5.1%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  6%  3%  7%  3%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD REPRESENTS A 7% INCREASE IN COMP SALES GROWTH AND A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 6% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. E-COMMERCE SALES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF TJX INTERNATIONAL\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 6.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 7.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020, A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES, OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG 6% COMP SALES GROWTH. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE COST OF MERCHANDISE.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 4.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 5.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THIS DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES, HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020 AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG 7% COMP SALES GROWTH. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN IS DUE TO THE SAME FACTORS IMPACTING THE QUARTER AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT OF OUR FUEL HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TJX FOUNDATION MADE DURING THE QUARTER.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON FROM THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS MADE IN FISCAL 2019. THE IMPACT OF THIS ITEM WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  32  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SUPPLEMENTED, AS NEEDED, BY SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS OR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING.  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, DESCRIBED IN NOTE I \u2013LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT LINES OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HELD $2.1 BILLION IN CASH AND NO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY $0.8 BILLION OF OUR CASH WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH $0.4 BILLION HELD IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE PROVISIONALLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. TJX PROVIDED FOR ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, ITALY, INDIA, HONG KONG AND VIETNAM THROUGH NOVEMBER 2, 2019. IF WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, WE SHOULD NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE AND OUR CASH WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.9 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND $2.5 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN EACH OF THESE FISCAL PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EARNINGS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  BY $0.6 BILLION COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE  DECREASE  IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 BILLION.  IN ADDITION, LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER CASH FLOWS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREFUNDING OF CERTAIN SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF $1.0 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND $0.4 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY REFLECTED PROPERTY ADDITIONS FOR NEW STORES, STORE IMPROVEMENTS AND RENOVATIONS AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR OFFICES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING BUYING AND MERCHANDISING SYSTEMS AND OTHER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CASH OUTFLOWS FOR PROPERTY ADDITIONS WERE $1.0 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.9 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CAPITAL SPENDING FOR FISCAL 2020 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION. WE PLAN TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.  WE PURCHASED $0.2 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, AND THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $0.6 BILLION OF INFLOWS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SOLD OR MATURED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE FISCAL 2019 INVESTING ACTIVITY PRIMARILY RELATED TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WHICH HAD INITIAL MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS CASH ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PRESENTED.  ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED $0.2 BILLION IN FAMILIA, AN ESTABLISHED OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHION RETAIL CHAIN IN RUSSIA.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF $1.8 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  AND $2.1 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018.  THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EQUITY REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  EQUITY  UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WE PAID $1.2 BILLION TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE 22.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR STOCK ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. THESE OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, NET OF SHARES WITHHELD FOR TAXES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE PAID $1.6 BILLION TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE 33.9 MILLION SHARES ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING EQUITY REPURCHASES, SEE NOTE D \u2013 CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  33  IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF TJX COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 BILLION OF TJX STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO $1.75 BILLION OF STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN FISCAL 2020. WE DETERMINE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REPURCHASES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXCESS CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  AS SUCH, WE MAY ADJUST THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE PURCHASES.  DIVIDENDS  WE DECLARED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH TOTALED $0.69 PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.585 PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH PAYMENTS FOR DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK TOTALED $0.8 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.7 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  OVERVIEW  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, NET EARNINGS OF $126, OR $0.81 PER DILUTED SHARE, EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS, DEMONSTRATING SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY AND STRENGTH OF OUR OPERATING DISCIPLINE. OUR NET SALES DECREASE OF 2.2% WAS IN-LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, REFLECTING IMPROVED SALES TRENDS ACROSS OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE CONSISTENT STRENGTH OF OUR INVENTORY AND EXPENSE EXECUTION CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR THE QUARTER. WE MAINTAINED A POSITIVE SPREAD BETWEEN SALES AND INVENTORY FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE QUARTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE REALIZED $170 IN EXPENSE SAVINGS YEAR-TO-DATE, EXPECTING TO EXCEED OUR PLAN OF $150 TO $200 FOR THE YEAR.  THE FOLLOWING ACHIEVEMENTS DEMONSTRATE OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER AND EXECUTION.  KEY EVENTS  \u2014 TO DRIVE OUR TOP AND BOTTOM-LINE RESULTS, WE MADE NOTABLE CHANGES TO TWO KEY EVENTS: ANNIVERSARY SALE AND HOLIDAY. WE IMPROVED THE ECONOMICS OF OUR ANNIVERSARY SALE EVENT, WHICH POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO MERCHANDISE MARGINS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FOR THE HOLIDAYS, WE ARE MEANINGFULLY EXPANDING OUR GIFTING OFFER ACROSS FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND GIFTS BY RECIPIENT AND PRICE POINT.  OFF-PRICE  \u2014 WE IMPROVED INVENTORY FLOW, REFINED PRODUCT ALLOCATION AND EMPHASIZED SEASONALLY RELEVANT MERCHANDISE. AS A RESULT, WE DELIVERED POSITIVE SALES GROWTH ON LESS INVENTORY AND INCREASED INVENTORY TURN FOR THE EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER. COMBINED WITH OUR STRONG EXPENSE EXECUTION, WE EXCEEDED OUR BOTTOM-LINE EXPECTATIONS.  MARKET STRATEGY  \u2014 OUR MARKET STRATEGY LEVERAGES INVENTORY TO SERVE CUSTOMERS ON THEIR TERMS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN DIGITAL CAPABILITIES AND IN PEOPLE, PRODUCT AND PLACE. OUR GOAL IS TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHILE DRIVING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND INVENTORY EFFICIENCIES. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS TO THIS STRATEGY: FIRST, WE ARE PROVIDING CUSTOMERS A GREATER SELECTION OF PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR NEXT-DAY PICKUP OR DELIVERY, WITHOUT INCREASING INVENTORY LEVELS. SECOND, WE ARE INCREASING ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING EXPRESS SERVICES SUCH AS ORDER PICKUP, RETURNS AND ALTERATIONS AT ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS.  SINCE SCALING OUR MARKET STRATEGY IN LOS ANGELES, THIRD QUARTER SALES GROWTH OUTPACED OTHER MARKETS BY APPROXIMATELY 100 BASIS POINTS. WE RECENTLY ACCELERATED OUR MARKET STRATEGY TO NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, CHICAGO AND DALLAS AND WILL EXPAND TO OUR REMAINING TOP TEN MARKETS BY THE END OF 2020.  NEW YORK  \u2014 WE ACHIEVED AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE WITH THE OPENING OF OUR NEW YORK CITY FLAGSHIP STORE, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR PRESENCE IN THE WORLD\u2019S TOP RETAIL MARKET. WE SAW A STRONG CUSTOMER RESPONSE WITH 85,000 VISITS DURING THE OPENING WEEKEND ALONE. IN THE BROADER NEW YORK CITY MARKET, CUSTOMERS HAVE FASTER ACCESS TO INVENTORY ACROSS EIGHT FLS STORES, INCLUDING OUR FLAGSHIP AND FULFILLMENT CENTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE ENGAGING WITH CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING EXPRESS SERVICES AT NORDSTROM LOCAL AND NORDSTROM RACK LOCATIONS.  WE MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUING OUR OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE MOMENTUM IN OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES AS WE EXECUTE OUR HOLIDAY STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH NORDSTROM AS A GIFTING DESTINATION FOR CUSTOMERS.  17  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  IN OUR ONGOING EFFORT TO ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE ACROSS OUR CHANNELS. WE INVESTED EARLY IN OUR OMNI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES, INTEGRATING OUR OPERATIONS, MERCHANDISING AND TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR STORES AND ONLINE, IN BOTH OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES. WHILE OUR CUSTOMERS MAY ENGAGE WITH US THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS, WE KNOW THEY VALUE THE OVERALL NORDSTROM BRAND EXPERIENCE AND VIEW US SIMPLY AS NORDSTROM, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY HOW WE VIEW OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE ONE RETAIL REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND ANALYZE OUR RESULTS ON A TOTAL COMPANY BASIS.  WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE THROUGH MARKET SHARE, OPERATIONAL AND NET SALES METRICS. AS THIS IS HOW WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE, AND AS COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE NET SALES GROWTH IN  2019  , WE ONLY REPORT CHANGES IN NET SALES.

SALES TRENDS IMPROVED BY MORE THAN 200 BASIS POINTS FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, DRIVEN BY AGGRESSIVE ACTION TAKEN RELATED TO LOYALTY, DIGITAL MARKETING AND MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT. DIGITAL SALES INCREASED  7%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  AND  6%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. WE SAW SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN DIGITAL TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER. IN OCTOBER 2019, WE EXPANDED NORDSTROM NYC WITH THE OPENING OF OUR FLAGSHIP STORE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE OPENED ONE FLS STORE, FIVE NORDSTROM RACK STORES AND TWO NORDSTROM LOCALS AND CLOSED SIX FLS STORES.  FULL-PRICE NET SALES  DECREASED  4.1%  AND  5.3%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN  2018  . FULL-PRICE SALES REFLECTED A DECREASE IN NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER ITEM SOLD FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  . THE TOP-PERFORMING MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES WERE ACCESSORIES AND SHOES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND SHOES AND ACCESSORIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  OFF-PRICE NET SALES  INCREASED  1.2%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  AND  DECREASED  0.4%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN  2018  . OFF-PRICE SALES REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER ITEM SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  . MEN\u2019S AND WOMEN\u2019S WERE THE TOP-PERFORMING MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.

THE  INCREASE  S OF  $6  AND  $13  FOR THE QUARTER AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF GROWING THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE.  18  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  ADJUSTED ROIC (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED ROIC IS A USEFUL FINANCIAL MEASURE FOR INVESTORS AND CREDIT AGENCIES IN EVALUATING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN OUR BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INCORPORATED IT IN OUR EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE MEASURES AND WE BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 RETURN OVER THE LONG TERM.  FOR 2019, INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY FOR ADJUSTED NET OPERATING PROFIT AND BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS FOR AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ARE COMPRISED OF THREE QUARTERS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE  LEASE STANDARD  FOR 2019, AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD. UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD, WE ESTIMATED THE VALUE OF OUR OPERATING LEASES AS IF THEY MET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL LEASES OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES. THIS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT ESTIMATED THE INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING LEASES. ESTIMATED DEPRECIATION ON CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES AND AVERAGE ESTIMATED ASSET BASE OF CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, NOR AN ALTERNATIVE FOR,  GAAP  AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP.  ADJUSTED ROIC IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, RETURN ON ASSETS, NET EARNINGS, TOTAL ASSETS OR OTHER GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED UNDER GAAP WHICH IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED ROIC IS RETURN ON ASSETS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS TO ADJUSTED ROIC.

OPERATING LEASE INTEREST IS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING LEASE COST RECORDED IN OCCUPANCY COSTS AND IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEASE STANDARD.  2  CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ASSET BASE WE WOULD RECORD FOR OUR LEASES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD IF THEY HAD MET THE CRITERIA FOR A FINANCE LEASE OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTY. THE ASSET BASE FOR EACH QUARTER IS CALCULATED AS THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS OF RENT EXPENSE MULTIPLIED BY EIGHT, A COMMONLY USED METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE ASSET BASE WE WOULD RECORD FOR OUR CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES.  3  FOR LEASES WITH PROPERTY INCENTIVES THAT EXCEED THE  ROU ASSETS  , WE RECLASSIFY THE AMOUNT FROM ASSETS TO OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD, WE REDUCE AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, AS THIS BETTER REFLECTS HOW WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  4  RESULTS FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018 INCLUDED THE $72 IMPACT RELATED TO THE  ESTIMATED NON-RECURRING CHARGE  , WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RETURN ON ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS AND ADJUSTED ROIC BY APPROXIMATELY 80 BASIS POINTS. FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RETURN ON ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY 90 BASIS POINTS AND ADJUSTED ROIC BY APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS.  21  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY AND POTENTIAL FUTURE BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND.  OVER THE LONG TERM, WE MANAGE OUR CASH AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER RETURN, MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, MANAGE REFINANCING RISK AND ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR DEBT AND LEVERAGE LEVELS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS, DIVIDEND PAYOUTS, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES AND OTHER FUTURE INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON-HAND OF  $487  , AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY OF  $800  AND POTENTIAL FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THESE SCHEDULED FUTURE PAYMENTS AND POTENTIAL LONG-TERM INITIATIVES.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $269  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO NORDSTROM NYC AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR OMNI-CHANNEL CENTER.  THE OPENING OF OUR FIRST LARGE-SCALE OMNI-CHANNEL CENTER IN RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, WHICH WILL INITIALLY SUPPORT OUR FULL-PRICE CUSTOMERS IN THE WEST COAST REGION AND OFF-PRICE CUSTOMERS IN THE FUTURE, IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN THE SPRING OF 2020. WE ALSO PLAN TO OPEN A SMALLER LOCAL OMNI-CHANNEL HUB IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WHICH WILL SUPPORT THE GREATER LOS ANGELES MARKET AS PART OF OUR MARKET STRATEGY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $74  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY EXECUTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  22  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  FREE CASH FLOW IS ONE OF OUR KEY LIQUIDITY MEASURES, AND WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAAP MEASURES, WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OUR BUSINESS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WHICH ARE NON-OPERATING IN NATURE IN ORDER TO EVALUATE OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AGAINST PRIOR PERIODS. THE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED UNDER GAAP WHICH IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NET EARNINGS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET EARNINGS, OVERALL CHANGE IN CASH OR LIQUIDITY OF THE BUSINESS AS A WHOLE. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

PROVIDED THAT WE OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM OUR LENDERS, WE HAVE THE OPTION TO INCREASE THE REVOLVER BY UP TO  $200  , TO A TOTAL OF  $1,000  , AND  TWO  OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE REVOLVER BY ONE YEAR. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  NO  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVER. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, SEE  NOTE 5: DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES  IN  ITEM 1.  IMPACT OF CREDIT RATINGS  CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY IMPACT OUR COSTS TO BORROW AND MAY REQUIRE WE HOLD COLLATERAL.  FOR OUR REVOLVER, THE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO ANY BORROWINGS WE MAY ENTER INTO DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF BORROWING INCURRED PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN, WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND OUTLOOK WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  SHOULD THE RATINGS ASSIGNED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IMPROVE, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER MAY DECREASE, RESULTING IN A LOWER BORROWING COST UNDER THIS FACILITY. CONVERSELY, SHOULD THE RATINGS ASSIGNED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT WORSEN, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER MAY INCREASE, RESULTING IN A HIGHER BORROWING COST UNDER THIS FACILITY.  DEBT COVENANTS  THE REVOLVER REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR LEVERAGE RATIO OF NO MORE THAN FOUR TIMES. THE REVOLVER\u2019S RATIO CALCULATION METHODOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS COVENANT.  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR  IS ONE OF OUR KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DEBT LEVELS ARE BEST ANALYZED USING THIS MEASURE, AS IT PROVIDES A REFLECTION OF OUR CREDIT WORTHINESS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR CREDIT RATING AND BORROWING COSTS. OUR GOAL IS TO MANAGE DEBT LEVELS TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATING WHILE OPERATING WITH AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  FOR 2019, INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY FOR ADJUSTED EBITDAR IS COMPRISED OF THREE QUARTERS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE LEASE STANDARD FOR 2019 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD. BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS ARE AS OF THE END OF THE QUARTER, AND UNDER THE NEW LEASE STANDARD FOR 2019 AND THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD FOR 2018. UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD, WE ESTIMATED THE VALUE OF OUR OPERATING LEASES AS IF THEY MET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL LEASES OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES. THIS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT ESTIMATED THE INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING LEASES. ESTIMATED CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY IS NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, NOR AN ALTERNATIVE FOR, GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP.  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, DEBT TO NET EARNINGS, NET EARNINGS, DEBT OR OTHER GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD HAD NO IMPACT ON DEBT TO NET EARNINGS NOR ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR.  24  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFERRED TO IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  SIGNET PROVIDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP INFORMATION IN REPORTING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS TO GIVE INVESTORS ADDITIONAL DATA TO EVALUATE ITS OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHEN REVIEWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO ASSIST INVESTORS IN EVALUATING HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT PERIOD PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE REASONS, INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING ALSO INCLUDES NON-GAAP MEASURES. ITEMS MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WHEN THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS PROVIDES GREATER CLARITY TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT SUPERIOR TO OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER PUBLICLY FILED REPORTS. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  1. NET DEBT  NET DEBT IS THE TOTAL OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LESS LOANS, OVERDRAFTS AND LONG-TERM DEBT. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS METRIC TO BE HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE FROM CASH BALANCES ON-HAND.

FREE CASH FLOW  FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED AS THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BUSINESS IS GENERATING CASH FROM ITS OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE USED TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS. FREE CASH FLOW IS AN INDICATOR FREQUENTLY USED BY MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING ITS OVERALL LIQUIDITY AND DETERMINING APPROPRIATE CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES. FREE CASH FLOW DOES NOT REPRESENT THE RESIDUAL CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES.

EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) AND ADJUSTED EBITDA  EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES (OPERATING INCOME), DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. EBITDA IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IT EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES BY ELIMINATING THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE WHICH FURTHER EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT AND UNUSUAL ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE DURING A PERIOD. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ENHANCE INVESTORS\u2019 ABILITY TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS AND EVALUATE PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT ALSO UTILIZES THESE METRICS TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT CREDIT PROFILE, WHICH IS A VIEW CONSISTENT WITH RATING AGENCY METHODOLOGIES.  13 WEEKS ENDED  39 WEEKS ENDED  (IN MILLIONS)  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET INCOME (LOSS)  $(35.5  )  $(29.9  )  $(81.6  )  $(549.5  )  INCOME TAX BENEFIT  (6.0  )  (29.2  )  (3.7  )  (159.1  )  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME  (7.0  )  (0.3  )  (7.5  )  (1.4  )  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  8.6  10.6  27.9  28.9  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  43.7  44.7  129.5  138.4  AMORTIZATION OF UNFAVORABLE LEASES AND CONTRACTS  (1.4  )  (1.8  )  (4.1  )  (5.9  )  EBITDA  $2.4  $(5.9  )  $60.5  $(548.6  )  CREDIT TRANSACTION, NET  \u2014  0.4  \u2014  167.4  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES - COST OF SALES  1.4  \u2014  5.8  63.2  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  9.2  9.5  59.4  35.6  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS  \u2014  \u2014  47.7  448.7  ADJUSTED EBITDA  $13.0  $4.0  $173.4  $166.3  4.

MANAGEMENT FINDS THE INFORMATION USEFUL WHEN ANALYZING FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT AND UNUSUAL ITEMS.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER, NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $8.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $10.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR  THIRD  QUARTER. THIS REDUCTION RESULTED FROM LOWER AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE QUARTER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES DUE TO THE DEBT REFINANCING DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR. SEE NOTE 17 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD, NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $27.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $28.9 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT QUARTER ETR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PRE-TAX EARNINGS MIX BY JURISDICTION. THE PRIOR YEAR TAX BENEFIT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY: 1) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION PLAN; 2) A LOSS RECOGNIZED IN THE U.S. ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE NON-PRIME RECEIVABLES; AND 3) PRE-TAX EARNINGS MIX BY JURISDICTION.  IN THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020, THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS  $3.7 MILLION  , AN ETR OF  4.3%  , COMPARED TO INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  $159.1 MILLION  , AN ETR OF  22.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.

SEE NOTE  14  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED IN EACH PERIOD.  \u2022  NON-CASH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $17.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $80.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF $62.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $63.2 MILLION INVENTORY CHARGE RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DECREASED  $8.9 MILLION  TO  $129.5 MILLION  FROM  $138.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  \u2022  CASH PROVIDED BY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TOTALED  $2.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $55.1 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OUTSOURCING OF THE NORTH AMERICA PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. SEE NOTE  11  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE OUTSOURCING OF THIS CREDIT PROGRAM AND PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD ALSO INCLUDED CASH PROCEEDS OF $445.5 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF ELIGIBLE NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS A NON-CASH LOSS OF $160.4 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE CREDIT TRANSACTION.  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THE PAYMENT PLANS PARTICIPATION RATE WAS  51.5%  COMPARED TO  52.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THESE RATES REFLECT ACTIVITY FOR CREDIT PROGRAM CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA, INCLUDING LEASE PURCHASE CUSTOMERS. THE DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION RATE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A CONTINUED TREND OF LOWER CREDIT APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS TRANSITION TO AN OUTSOURCED CREDIT STRUCTURE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  TOTAL NORTH AMERICA SALES (EXCLUDING JAMES ALLEN)  (1)  (MILLIONS)  $3,445.6  $3,538.6  CREDIT AND LEASE PURCHASE SALES (MILLIONS)  $1,773.5  $1,857.6  CREDIT AND LEASE PURCHASE SALES AS % OF TOTAL NORTH AMERICA SALES  (1)  51.5%  52.5%  (1)  EXCLUDES JAMES ALLEN SALES TOTALING  $166.4 MILLION  AND  $160.2 MILLION  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AS IN-HOUSE CREDIT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO JAMES ALLEN CUSTOMERS DURING THE PERIOD.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR INVENTORY WAS  $133.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $456.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. TOTAL INVENTORY AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  WAS  $2.52 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE QUARTER BALANCE OF  $2.65 BILLION  , REFLECTING THE COMPANY\u2019S STRATEGY TO EXIT LOW-PRICED OWNED BRANDED BEADS AND THE DISPOSITION OF SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN BRIDAL AND CERTAIN FASHION COLLECTIONS. CASH USED FOR INVENTORY DECREASED BY  $323.6 MILLION  FROM PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND LIQUIDATION OF DISCONTINUED BRANDS AND COLLECTIONS.  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THE COMPANY CONTINUED THE PROCESS TO LIQUIDATE THE INVENTORY OF DISCONTINUED BRANDS AND COLLECTIONS IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE PLAN. THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE ITEMS LIQUIDATED TO DATE  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  APPROXIMATED THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE MANAGEMENT ESTIMATED WHEN RECORDING THE CHARGE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , INVENTORY REPRESENTING $30.9 MILLION OF THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 REMAINS ON HAND.  \u2022  CASH PROVIDED BY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS  $183.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $106.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH INVENTORY PURCHASES IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES WAS  $30.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $7.3 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH PAYROLL-RELATED ITEMS INCLUDING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND ADVERTISING.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR INCOME TAXES WAS  $7.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED FROM INCOME TAXES OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER STATE AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  FORWARD-FLOW RECEIVABLES OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH INVESTORS  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF SIGNET\u2019S NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO CARVAL AND CASTLELAKE (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cINVESTORS\u201d), BEGINNING IN JUNE 2018, THE INVESTORS BEGAN PURCHASING THE MAJORITY OF FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES OF SIGNET\u2019S NON-PRIME CREDIT FROM SIGNET FOR A FIVE-YEAR TERM. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR FORM 8-K ON MARCH 12, 2018, THE INVESTORS WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE OF THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES IF THE REALIZED YIELD FALLS BELOW AN AGREED UPON THRESHOLD MEASURED AT CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATES. WHILE THE BACK BOOK RECEIVABLES CONTINUE TO PERFORM AT OR ABOVE THE EXPECTED LEVELS, AND WHILE SIGNET BELIEVES THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES HAVE A LIFETIME PROJECTED CUMULATIVE NET YIELD THAT IS IN-LINE WITH THE MARKET RATE EXPECTATIONS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, SIGNET EXPECTS THAT ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE NEXT CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATE, THE REALIZED YIELD FOR THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES WILL TEMPORARILY BE BELOW THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD, WHICH WILL TECHNICALLY GIVE THE INVESTORS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INVESTORS WILL NOT TERMINATE THE FORWARD FLOW AGREEMENT ON A GO FORWARD BASIS BASED ON THE SHORT TERM REALIZED YIELD AT THE DECEMBER 31, 2019 MEASUREMENT, THE INVESTORS HAVE INFORMED SIGNET THAT, SUBJECT TO THEIR RESERVATION OF RIGHTS, THEY DO NOT INTEND TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON DECEMBER 31, 2019. SIGNET FURTHER BELIEVES THAT THE INVESTORS ARE RECEIVING AN ATTRACTIVE RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT SUCH THAT A TERMINATION BY ONE OR BOTH OF THE INVESTORS IS UNLIKELY.  THIS TERMINATION RIGHT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 30, 2020, THE NEXT SUBSEQUENT CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. THE CUMULATIVE NET YIELD IS EXPECTED TO RISE THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND MAY EXCEED THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD BY THIS DATE. THIS SHORTFALL TO THE AGREED UPON CUMULATIVE NET YIELD THRESHOLD, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE TEMPORARY, IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY VINTAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED NEAR THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM EXPERIENCING HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED CHARGE OFF RATES AND LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED COLLECTION RATES. THE UNDERLYING ISSUES DRIVING THOSE SUBOPTIMAL CHARGE OFF AND COLLECTION RATES WERE ADDRESSED AND THE NON-PRIME MDR WAS INCREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020. SUBSEQUENT VINTAGES, INCLUDING ALL VINTAGES SOLD IN THIS FISCAL YEAR, ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM ABOVE THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD.  THIS TERMINATION RIGHT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE SALE OF THE NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMPLETED IN JUNE 2018 AND ONLY APPLIES TO FUTURE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES ON A GO-FORWARD BASIS, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF SIGNET\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUE. IF ONE BUT NOT BOTH INVESTORS TERMINATE, THE NON-TERMINATING INVESTOR HAS THE OPTION TO BEGIN PURCHASING 100% OF THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES OR SOME OTHER PERCENTAGE AS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN SIGNET AND THE NON-TERMINATING INVESTOR. EVEN IF THE INVESTORS WERE TO TERMINATE THE FORWARD FLOW AGREEMENT, SIGNET BELIEVES SUCH TERMINATION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE OTHER POTENTIAL PROVIDERS CAN SUPPLY A SIMILAR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROGRAM AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS LEASING ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CASEY\u2019S GENERAL STORES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE \"COMPANY\" OR \"CASEY\u2019S\") OPERATE  2,181  CONVENIENCE STORES IN  16  MIDWEST STATES. THE STORES ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES, MANY WITH POPULATIONS OF LESS THAN  5,000.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS OF CASEY'S GENERAL STORES, INC. AND ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL MATERIAL INTER-COMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. CERTAIN INFORMATION AND FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES NORMALLY INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) HAVE BEEN CONDENSED OR OMITTED PURSUANT TO SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAIN ALL ADJUSTMENTS (INCLUDING NORMAL RECURRING ACCRUALS) NECESSARY TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE DISCLOSURES ARE ADEQUATE TO MAKE THE INFORMATION PRESENTED NOT MISLEADING, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENT AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO.  OTHER THAN MENTIONED BELOW, SEE THE FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  FOR OUR CONSIDERATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  THE COMPANY IS A LESSEE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE LEASE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST COMMONLY LAND OR BUILDING, FROM A LESSOR. THE COMPANY IS A LESSOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS LAND OR BUILDING AND LEASES A PORTION OR ALL OF THE PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT TO A TENANT. IN BOTH SITUATIONS, LEASES ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC TOPIC 842-LEASES  . WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE AS OF MAY 1, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND ELECTED THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION METHOD SELECTED, THE COMPANY DID NOT RESTATE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED COMPARABLE PERIODS.  PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 6 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S ADOPTION OF ASC 842 AND THE OUTSTANDING LEASES.  CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR YEAR HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  3.  REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES RETAIL SALES OF FUEL, GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE, PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN AND OTHER REVENUE AT THE TIME OF THE SALE TO THE CUSTOMER.  REVENUE FROM SALES OF PIZZA THAT INCLUDE A REDEEMABLE BOX TOP COUPON ARE DEFERRED UNTIL REDEMPTION FOR THE PORTION OF THE SALE THAT REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE REDEMPTION OF THE BOX TOP COUPON.  REVENUE RELATED TO THE BOX TOP COUPONS IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE ORIGINAL SALE TO THE CUSTOMER. AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A CONTRACT LIABILITY OF  $8,329  AND $6,931  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING BOX TOP COUPONS, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  GIFT CARD RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE GIFT CARDS ARE USED BY THE CUSTOMER. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED GIFT CARD BREAKAGE RATE OVER THE PRO RATA USAGE OF THE CARD.  RENEWABLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (RINS) ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY COMMITS TO A PRICE AND AGREES TO SELL THE RIN. VENDOR REBATES ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND ARE RECOGNIZED PRO RATA OVER THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE APPLICABLE REBATE AGREEMENT. VENDOR REBATES IN THE FORM OF BILLBACKS  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SOLD. WAREHOUSING COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN OPERATING EXPENSES ON THE INCOME STATEMENT.  SALES TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  4.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, LINES OF CREDIT, AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE CURRENT RATES OFFERED TO THE COMPANY FOR DEBT OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUANCES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT WAS APPROXIMATELY  $1,327,000  AND  $1,272,000  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A $300  MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHICH INCLUDES A $30  MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $30  MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR SWINGLINE LOANS (THE \"CREDIT FACILITY\").  THE MATURITY DATE IS JANUARY 11, 2024.  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES BASED UPON, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, EITHER (A) LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OR (B) AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CARRIES A FACILITY FEE BETWEEN  0.2%  AND  0.4%  PER ANNUM BASED ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY HAD  $25,000  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  $75,000  OUTSTANDING AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS AN UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT OF  $25,000  (THE \"BANK LINE\"), UNDER WHICH THERE WAS  $0  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019.  WITHIN CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS A  $569,000  5.22%  SENIOR NOTE THAT IS DUE ON AUGUST 9, 2020.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REFINANCE THIS NOTE.  5.  COMPENSATION RELATED COSTS AND SHARE BASED PAYMENTS  THE 2018 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE \u201c2018 PLAN\u201d), WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE 2018 AND APPROVED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 (\"THE \"2018 PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE\"). THE 2018 PLAN REPLACED THE 2009 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE \"2009 PLAN\")  UNDER WHICH NO NEW AWARDS ARE ALLOWED TO BE GRANTED AS OF THE 2018 PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE. THE 2009 PLAN PREVIOUSLY REPLACED AND SUPERSEDED THE 2000 STOCK OPTION PLAN AND THE NON-EMPLOYEES DIRECTORS\u2019 STOCK OPTION PLAN (COLLECTIVELY WITH THE 2009 PLAN, THE \u201cPRIOR PLANS\u201d).  AWARDS UNDER THE 2018 PLAN MAY TAKE THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AND EQUITY-RELATED AWARDS. EACH SHARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A STOCK OPTION AND EACH SHARE WITH RESPECT TO WHICH A STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT IS EXERCISED (REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES ACTUALLY DELIVERED) IS COUNTED AS  ONE  SHARE AGAINST THE MAXIMUM LIMIT UNDER THE 2018 PLAN, AND EACH SHARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS COUNTED AS  TWO  SHARES AGAINST THE MAXIMUM LIMIT. AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  2,635,034  SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2018 PLAN.  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BY ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS USING THE BLACK SCHOLES MODEL, AND VALUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN USING THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. FOR MARKET BASED AWARDS WE USE THE \"MONTE CARLO\" APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE AWARDS, WHICH SIMULATES THE PRICES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AND EACH MEMBER OF THE PERFORMANCE PEER GROUPS' COMMON STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VOLATILITY AND THE SPECIFICS SURROUNDING EACH TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN METRIC UNDER THE RELEVANT PLAN.  WE RECOGNIZE THESE AMOUNTS AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RATABLY OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, AS ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN RETIREMENT PROVISIONS, AND UPDATED ESTIMATES OF PERFORMANCE BASED AWARDS. ALL AWARDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED AT NO COST TO THE GRANTEE AND/OR NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBER OF THE BOARD.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE 2018 PLAN IS PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S  2019  DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT.  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , OPTIONS FOR  57,866  SHARES (WHICH EXPIRE IN JUNE 2021) WERE OUTSTANDING FOR THE PRIOR PLANS (NO STOCK OPTION AWARDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED UNDER THE 2018 PLAN).  INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE PRIOR PLANS IS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  NUMBER OF  OPTION SHARES  WEIGHTED  AVERAGE OPTION  EXERCISE PRICE  OUTSTANDING AT APRIL 30, 2019  109,827  $44.39  GRANTED  \u2014  \u2014  EXERCISED  51,961  44.39  FORFEITED  \u2014  \u2014  OUTSTANDING AT OCTOBER 31, 2019  57,866  $44.39  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , ALL  57,866  OUTSTANDING OPTIONS WERE VESTED, AND HAD AN AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF  $7,315  AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF  1.67  YEARS  .  THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE FOR THE TOTAL OF ALL OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , WAS  $5,643.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFORMATION CONCERNING THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS UNDER THE 2009 PLAN AND THE 2018 PLAN IS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  UNVESTED AT APRIL 30, 2019  388,800  GRANTED  178,268  VESTED  (  108,484  )  FORFEITED  (  17,448  )  UNVESTED AT OCTOBER 31, 2019  441,136  TOTAL COMPENSATION COSTS RECORDED FOR EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE BOARD MEMBERS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE  $9,922  AND  $12,151  , RELATED ENTIRELY TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  NO  UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO THE PLAN AND PRIOR PLANS FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND  $18,981  OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH FISCAL 2023.  CERTAIN AWARDS IN THE 2017 THROUGH 2019 LONG TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM GRANTS HAVE PERFORMANCE-BASED CONDITIONS BASED ON THE  THREE  -YEAR AVERAGE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) CALCULATION.  6.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES; EMPLOYMENT, PERSONNEL, OR ACCESSIBILITY MATTERS; PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS; AND CLAIMS BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES RELATING TO THE SALE OF PRODUCTS PURSUANT TO LICENSES AND PERMITS ISSUED BY THOSE AUTHORITIES. CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN THOSE ACTIONS MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS, INVESTIGATIONS, OR CLAIMS IS NEVER CERTAIN, IT IS OUR OPINION, AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LEGAL COUNSEL\u2019S ASSESSMENT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND OTHER COLLATERAL SOURCES TO COVER POTENTIAL LOSSES, THAT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF SUCH MATTERS CURRENTLY PENDING OR THREATENED, INDIVIDUALLY OR CUMULATIVELY, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY IS A LESSEE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE LEASE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST COMMONLY LAND OR BUILDING, FROM A LESSOR. THE COMPANY IS A LESSOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS LAND OR BUILDING AND LEASES A PORTION OR ALL OF THE PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT TO A TENANT. IN BOTH SITUATIONS, LEASES ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC TOPIC 842-LEASES  . AS A LESSEE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING ITS RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS. BOTH THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS, WITH SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT DEPENDENT ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCE OR AN OPERATING LEASE. FOR LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS, WE HAVE ELECTED TO NOT RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES AND WILL RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY RECORDS THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY IN 'ACCRUED EXPENSES' AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES AND RECORDS THE FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY WITHIN CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LONG TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE HAVE ELECTED TO ADOPT THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, AS WELL AS THE LAND EASEMENT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT.  AS A LESSOR, THE COMPANY HAS DIRECT FINANCING LEASES AND RECORDS THE ASSETS WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND RECOGNIZES THE LEASE PAYMENTS THROUGH OTHER INCOME. ALL LESSOR RELATED ACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE LEASES INITIALLY RECORDED UNDER ASC 842 WERE RECOGNIZED, AT THE TIME OF ADOPTION, AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE OF DEBT BASED UPON THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASE. NEW LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN IT IS READILY DETERMINABLE. IN THE CASE THE IMPLICIT RATE IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE, THE COMPANY USES THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE OF DEBT BASED ON THE TERM OF THE LEASE.  SEVERAL LEASES HAVE VARIABLE PAYMENT COMPONENTS OF THE LEASE SUCH AS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. FOR THESE LEASES, THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCLUDED THOSE VARIABLE PAYMENTS IN THE CALCULATION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY AS THE PAYMENTS ARE NOT IN-SUBSTANCE FIXED AND DO NOT DEPEND ON AN INDEX OR RATE. THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS WILL BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS OPTIONS TO RENEW OR EXTEND THE CURRENT LEASE ARRANGEMENT ON MANY OF OUR LEASES. IN  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THESE SITUATIONS, IF IT WAS REASONABLY CERTAIN THE LEASE WOULD BE EXTENDED, WE HAVE INCLUDED THOSE EXTENSIONS WITHIN THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF MEASUREMENT.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS  $7,287  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WERE  $9,355  .  IF THIS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT WERE ULTIMATELY RECOGNIZED, $7,412  IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES FOR SUCH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $361  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AND $242  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WAS A NET  EXPENSE  OF $119  AND $77  , RESPECTIVELY.  A NUMBER OF YEARS MAY ELAPSE BEFORE AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS AUDITED AND ULTIMATELY SETTLED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  THESE CHANGES COULD RESULT FROM THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, EXAMINATIONS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING TAX YEARS 2012, 2016, AND 2017.  THE COMPANY HAS NO OTHER ONGOING FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS.  AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY'S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS A  DECREASE  OF $1,100  DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS MAINLY DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF CERTAIN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  THE FEDERAL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS REMAINS OPEN FOR THE TAX YEARS  2012  AND FORWARD.  TAX YEARS  2012  AND FORWARD ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT BY STATE TAX AUTHORITIES DEPENDING ON OPEN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAIVERS AND THE TAX CODE OF EACH STATE.  8.  SEGMENT REPORTING  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , WE OPERATED  2,181  STORES IN  16  STATES. OUR CONVENIENCE STORES OFFER A BROAD SELECTION OF MERCHANDISE, FUEL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO THE CONVENIENCE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MANAGE THE BUSINESS ON THE BASIS OF  ONE  OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR STORES SELL SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND USE SIMILAR PROCESSES TO SELL THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DIRECTLY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE MAKE SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES CONCERNING THE  THREE  BROAD MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES OF FUEL, GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE, AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DISCUSS TRENDS AND OPERATIONAL PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH WE CAN SEPARATE REVENUES AND COST OF GOODS SOLD WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES (AND FURTHER SUB-CATEGORIES), THE OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A STORE THAT SELLS THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT SEPARABLE BY THESE  THREE  CATEGORIES.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  OVERVIEW  CASEY\u2019S AND ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE CONVENIENCE STORES UNDER THE NAMES \"CASEY'S\" AND \u201cCASEY\u2019S GENERAL STORE\u201d (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE \"COMPANY\", \"CASEY\u2019S STORE\u201d OR \u201cSTORES\u201d) IN 16 MIDWESTERN STATES, PRIMARILY IOWA, MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS. THE COMPANY ALSO OPERATES TWO STORES SELLING PRIMARILY TOBACCO PRODUCTS, ONE GROCERY STORE, AND ONE LIQUOR STORE.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE A TOTAL OF  2,181  STORES IN OPERATION. ALL CONVENIENCE STORES OFFER FUEL FOR SALE ON A SELF-SERVE BASIS AND MOST STORES CARRY A BROAD SELECTION OF FOOD (INCLUDING FRESHLY PREPARED FOODS SUCH AS PIZZA, DONUTS AND SANDWICHES), BEVERAGES, TOBACCO PRODUCTS, HEALTH AND BEAUTY AIDS, AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS AND OTHER NON-FOOD ITEMS. THE COMPANY DERIVES ITS REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE RETAIL SALE OF FUEL AND THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN ITS STORES.  APPROXIMATELY  56%  OF OUR STORES WERE OPENED IN AREAS WITH POPULATIONS OF FEWER THAN 5,000 PERSONS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF ALL STORES WERE OPENED IN COMMUNITIES WITH POPULATIONS EXCEEDING 20,000 PERSONS. TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE IN OPERATION, WHICH SUPPLY GROCERY AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE ITEMS TO STORES. ONE IS ADJACENT TO THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER FACILITY IN ANKENY, IOWA, AND THE OTHER IS LOCATED IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED THE LAND AT  2,155  LOCATIONS AND THE BUILDINGS AT  2,160  LOCATIONS, AND LEASED THE LAND AT  26  LOCATIONS AND THE BUILDINGS AT  21  LOCATIONS.  THE COMPANY REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF  $2.21  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . FOR THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR-AGO, DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $1.80.

SAME-STORE SALES IS A COMMON METRIC USED IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE INDUSTRY.  WE DEFINE SAME-STORE SALES AS THE TOTAL SALES INCREASE (OR DECREASE) FOR STORES OPEN DURING THE FULL TIME OF BOTH PERIODS BEING PRESENTED.  WE EXCLUDE FROM THE CALCULATION ANY ACQUIRED STORES AND ANY STORES THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH A NEW STORE, UNTIL SUCH STORES HAVE BEEN OPEN DURING THE FULL TIME OF BOTH PERIODS BEING PRESENTED.  STORES THAT HAVE UNDERGONE A MAJOR REMODEL, HAD ADJUSTMENTS IN HOURS OF OPERATION, ADDED PIZZA DELIVERY, OR HAD OTHER REVISIONS TO THEIR OPERATING FORMAT REMAIN IN THE CALCULATION.  THE  SECOND  QUARTER RESULTS REFLECTED A  1.8%  DECREASE IN SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD, WITH AN AVERAGE FUEL REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) OF  22.9  CENTS PER GALLON, COMPARED TO  20.0  CENTS PER GALLON IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO.  HISTORICALLY, OUR RETAIL FUEL STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO PRICE TO THE COMPETITION, WHERE THE TIMING OF RETAIL PRICE CHANGES WAS DRIVEN BY LOCAL COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY, AS PART OF ITS EVOLVING STRATEGY AROUND FUEL PRICE OPTIMIZATION, HAS BEEN MORE PROACTIVE AND BALANCED TO GROW PROFITABILITY, WHICH HAS IN-PART CONTRIBUTED TO A HIGHER FUEL MARGIN AND LOWER SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD.  IN ADDITION, SOFTER DEMAND IN THE MIDWEST ADVERSELY IMPACTED SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD IN THE QUARTER.  THE COMPANY SOLD  18.7  MILLION RENEWABLE FUEL CREDITS FOR $3.8  MILLION DURING THE QUARTER, COMPARED TO  16.6  MILLION RENEWABLE FUEL CREDITS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH GENERATED $3.4  MILLION.  SAME-STORE SALES OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE INCREASED  3.2%  AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN INCREASED  1.9%  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED  8.5%  IN THE QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  (DOLLARS AND AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2019  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER  MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $1,514,474  $660,562  $297,846  $14,704  $2,487,586  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $140,798  $220,134  $181,452  $14,681  $557,065  9.3%  33.3%  60.9%  99.8%  22.4%  FUEL GALLONS  614,071  THREE MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2018  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER  MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $1,621,868  $618,250  $283,062  $14,825  $2,538,005  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $118,656  $200,193  $176,675  $14,797  $510,321  7.3%  32.4%  62.4%  99.8%  20.1%  FUEL GALLONS  593,750  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  BY  $50,419  (  2.0%  ) OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  .

DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, RETAIL SALES OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE  INCREASED  BY  $42,312  (  6.8%  ), AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN SALES  INCREASED  BY  $14,784  (  5.2%  ), BOTH PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  THE OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF LOTTERY, CAR WASH, AND PREPAID PHONE CARDS, WHICH ARE PRESENTED NET OF APPLICABLE COSTS. THESE REVENUES  DECREASED  $121  (  0.8%  ) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020.  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  22.4%  OF REVENUE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , COMPARED TO  20.1%  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FUEL REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  9.3%  OF FUEL REVENUE DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  7.3%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. REVENUE PER GALLON LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD PER GALLON (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  22.9  CENTS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  20.0  CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) INCREASED TO  33.3%  OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE REVENUE, COMPARED TO  32.4%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY DUE TO A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO HIGHER MARGIN ITEMS. PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) DECREASED TO  60.9%  OF REVENUE, FROM A  62.4%  RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  $29,197  (  8.5%  ) IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  SAME STORE OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD FEES WERE  UP  3.4%  FOR THE QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN STORE LABOR MANAGEMENT AND LOWER INSURANCE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  INCREASED  2.5%  TO  $62,888  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  FROM  $61,356  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  DECREASED  TO  24.2%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  26.5%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  .  THE  DECREASE  IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN UNFAVORABLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES.  NET INCOME  INCREASED  BY  $15,366  (  23.1%  ) TO  $81,981  FROM  $66,615  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018  SIX MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2019  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $3,142,042  $1,348,480  $593,723  $29,970  $5,114,215  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $291,787  $435,587  $365,464  $29,913  $1,122,751  9.3%  32.3%  61.6%  99.8%  22.0%  FUEL GALLONS  1,233,155  SIX MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2018  REVENUE  $3,269,285  $1,263,050  $564,065  $30,037  $5,126,437  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $242,132  $409,119  $350,859  $29,979  $1,032,089  7.4%  32.4%  62.2%  99.8%  20.1%  FUEL GALLONS  1,195,545  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  BY  $12,222  (  0.2%  ) OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  .

PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) DECREASED TO  61.6%  OF REVENUE, COMPARED TO  62.2%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  $49,646  (  7.1%  ) IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  SAME STORE OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD FEES WERE  UP  3.0%  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  .

THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS.   THE EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  WAS LOWER THAN EXPECTED, DUE TO AN APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLON ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE USEFUL LIVES OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS.

THE  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE NET INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA FURTHER ADJUSTS EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS AS WELL AS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. NEITHER EBITDA NOR ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE CONSIDERED GAAP MEASURES, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR OTHER INCOME OR CASH FLOW STATEMENT DATA. THESE MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PUBLICLY FILED REPORTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.  WE BELIEVE EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES USE SUCH CALCULATIONS AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DEBT SERVICE CAPABILITIES, AND THEY ARE REGULARLY USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES INCLUDING OUR CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS, EVALUATING ACQUISITION TARGETS, AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE.  BECAUSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY US, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. IT THEREFORE MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE OUR USE OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WITH THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE INCREASES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , AND SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THESE POLICIES IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY FINANCES ITS INVENTORY PURCHASES PRIMARILY FROM NORMAL TRADE CREDIT AIDED BY THE RELATIVELY RAPID TURNOVER OF INVENTORY. THIS TURNOVER ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS WITHOUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL. AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS  0.36  TO 1. THE RATIO AT  OCTOBER 31, 2018  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS  0.81  TO 1 AND  0.69  TO 1, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN THE RATIO IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF  $569,000  5.22% SENIOR NOTES TO CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THEY ARE DUE ON AUGUST 9, 2020. MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO REFINANCE THE 5.22% SENIOR NOTES.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT BANK LINE OF  $25,000  , ITS CREDIT FACILITY OF  $300,000  , COMBINED WITH THE CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND THE FUTURE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS INCREASED  $7,120  (  2.3%  ) IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CASH USED IN INVESTING IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  INCREASED  $47,580  (  24.0%  ) OVER PRIOR YEAR, IN LINE WITH PROJECTED ANNUAL EXPENDITURES. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED  $22,932  (  21.2%  ), PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN SHARE BUYBACK ACTIVITY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPRESENT THE SINGLE LARGEST USE OF COMPANY FUNDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BY ACQUIRING, BUILDING, AND REINVESTING IN STORES, THE COMPANY WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES AND INCREASE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  , THE COMPANY EXPENDED  $248,364  , PRIMARILY FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, RESULTING FROM THE CONSTRUCTION, REMODELING, AND ACQUISITION OF STORES, COMPARED TO  $200,999  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES SPENDING $516 MILLION IN FISCAL  2020  , PRIMARILY FOR CONSTRUCTION, ACQUISITION AND REMODELING OF STORES, SOURCED PRIMARILY FROM EXISTING CASH, FUNDS GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, AND THE PRIOR YEAR ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $715,060  , (NET OF CURRENT MATURITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF  $577,698  ), $150,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.67% SENIOR NOTES, SERIES A, $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES SERIES B,  $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.65% SENIOR NOTES SERIES C,  $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.72% SENIOR NOTES SERIES D,  $150,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.51% SENIOR NOTES SERIES E,  $250,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.77% SENIOR NOTES SERIES F, AND $15,060  OF FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A  $25,000  BANK LINE OF CREDIT WITH  $0  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AND A  $300,000  CREDIT FACILITY WITH  $25,000  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  .

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS FUNDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK, ISSUANCE OF DEBT, EXISTING CASH, AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS REQUIRED TO FINANCE OPERATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF STORES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MET FROM CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, THE BANK LINE AND THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT OR OTHER SECURITIES AS CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DICTATE, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT LIQUIDITY.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THIS FORM 10-Q, INCLUDING THE FOREGOING MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONTAINS VARIOUS \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OR BELIEFS CONCERNING FUTURE EVENTS, INCLUDING (I) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING FUTURE SALES AND GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES, (II) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING THE CONTINUATION OF HISTORICAL TRENDS AND (III) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE NEEDS. THE WORDS \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATE,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cESTIMATE,\u201d \u201cPROJECT\u201d AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAUTIONS THAT THESE STATEMENTS ARE FURTHER QUALIFIED BY IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATIONS, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS DESCRIBED MORE COMPLETELY IN THE FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  .  COMPETITION  . THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND MARKED BY EASE OF ENTRY AND CONSTANT CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND TYPE OF RETAILERS OFFERING THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOUND IN STORES. MANY OF THE FOOD (INCLUDING PREPARED FOODS) AND NON-FOOD ITEMS SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL TO THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM A VARIETY OF COMPETITORS IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY STORES, AND THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH OTHER CONVENIENCE STORE CHAINS, GASOLINE STATIONS, SUPERMARKETS, DRUG STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, CLUB STORES, MASS MERCHANTS AND \u201cFAST-FOOD\u201d OUTLETS (WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF PREPARED FOODS). SALES OF SUCH NON-FUEL ITEMS (PARTICULARLY PREPARED FOOD ITEMS) HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFITS FROM RETAIL SALES IN RECENT YEARS. FUEL SALES ARE ALSO INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL BRAND GASOLINE STATIONS IN THE SALE OF FUEL, OTHER CONVENIENCE STORE CHAINS AND SEVERAL NON-TRADITIONAL FUEL RETAILERS SUCH AS SUPERMARKETS IN SPECIFIC MARKETS. SOME OF THESE OTHER FUEL RETAILERS MAY HAVE ACCESS TO MORE FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUEL SUPPLY THEN DO THE COMPANY OR THE FIRMS THAT SUPPLY ITS STORES. SOME OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE ABLE TO RESPOND BETTER TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FUEL OPERATIONS  . FUEL SALES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND EARNINGS, AND RETAIL FUEL PROFIT MARGINS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS. PROFIT MARGINS ON FUEL SALES CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY OF FUEL AVAILABLE IN THE RETAIL FUEL MARKET, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE WHOLESALE FUEL MARKET, INCREASES IN WHOLESALE FUEL COSTS GENERALLY DURING A PERIOD, AND PRICE COMPETITION FROM OTHER FUEL MARKETERS. THE MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL AND DOMESTIC WHOLESALE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IS MARKED BY SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, AND IS AFFECTED BY GENERAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND INSTABILITY IN OIL PRODUCING REGIONS SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE VOLATILITY OF THE WHOLESALE FUEL MARKET MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF FUTURE WHOLESALE COST FLUCTUATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUEL GALLON VOLUME, FUEL GROSS PROFIT, AND OVERALL CUSTOMER TRAFFIC LEVELS AT STORES. ANY SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN PROFIT MARGINS ON FUEL SALES OR IN THE NUMBER OF GALLONS SOLD BY STORES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS.  FUEL IS PURCHASED FROM A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PETROLEUM DISTRIBUTORS AND THE FUEL IS LOADED ONTO BOTH CASEY'S FUEL TRUCKS AND 3RD PARTY FUEL TRUCKS.  PURCHASE AGREEMENTS EXIST FOR A PORTION OF OUR FUEL WHICH INCLUDES VARYING PRICING STRUCTURES AND VOLUME COMMITMENTS.  ALTHOUGH IN RECENT YEARS SUPPLIERS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF FUEL TO MEET THE COMPANY\u2019S NEEDS, UNANTICIPATED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, SUCH AS THREATENED OR ACTUAL ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, AND INSTABILITY IN OIL PRODUCING REGIONS COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF FUEL SUPPLIES AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. ANY SUBSTANTIAL CURTAILMENT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FUEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY BY REDUCING ITS FUEL SALES. FURTHER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS RESULTS FROM THE PATRONAGE OF CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY DESIRING TO PURCHASE FUEL AND, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCED FUEL SUPPLIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALE OF NON-FUEL ITEMS. SUCH FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS AND OPERATIONS.  TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS  . SALES OF TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VAPOR PRODUCTS AND E-CIGARETTES, REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE CATEGORY. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN WHOLESALE CIGARETTE COSTS AND TAX INCREASES ON TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS NATIONAL AND LOCAL CAMPAIGNS TO FURTHER REGULATE AND DISCOURAGE SMOKING AND THE USE OF OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE HAD, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE HAVING, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS SOLD IN OUR STORES. ALSO, INCREASING REGULATIONS RELATED TO, AND RESTRICTING THE SALE OF, VAPOR PRODUCTS AND E-CIGARETTES, MAY OFFSET SOME OF THE RECENT GAINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FROM SELLING THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PASS PRICE INCREASES THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS, BUT COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SPECIFIC MARKETS MAY PREVENT IT FROM DOING SO. THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE PRODUCT MIX OF TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, THE RETAIL PRICE AND MARGINS OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, THE VOLUME OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS SOLD BY STORES AND OVERALL CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE CATEGORY AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS AND PROFITS.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS  . THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING IOWA, HAVE ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS FOR OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF UNDERGROUND GASOLINE STORAGE TANKS (USTS) WITH REGARD TO (I) MAINTENANCE OF LEAK DETECTION, CORROSION PROTECTION AND OVERFILL/SPILL PROTECTION SYSTEMS; (II) UPGRADE OF EXISTING TANKS; (III) ACTIONS REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A DETECTED LEAK; (IV) PREVENTION OF LEAKAGE THROUGH TANK CLOSINGS; AND (V) REQUIRED GASOLINE INVENTORY RECORDKEEPING. SINCE 1984, NEW COMPANY STORES HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH NON-CORRODING FIBERGLASS USTS, INCLUDING MANY WITH DOUBLE-WALL CONSTRUCTION, OVER-FILL PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC TANK MONITORING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS  4,953  USTS, OF WHICH  4,076  ARE FIBERGLASS AND  877  ARE STEEL. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS EXISTING FUEL PROCEDURES AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE COMPANY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE UST REGULATIONS.  SEVERAL OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS HAVE TRUST FUND PROGRAMS WITH PROVISIONS FOR SHARING OR REIMBURSING CORRECTIVE ACTION OR REMEDIATION COSTS INCURRED BY UST OWNERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN THE YEARS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY  $774  AND  $1,255  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASSESSMENTS AND REMEDIATION. DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY  $359  FOR SUCH PURPOSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM STATE-SPONSORED TRUST FUND PROGRAMS AND AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $23,417  HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM SUCH PROGRAMS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION. SUCH AMOUNTS ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO STATUTORY PROVISIONS REQUIRING REPAYMENT OF THE REIMBURSED FUNDS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UPGRADE PROVISIONS OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS. NO AMOUNTS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE REPAID. THE COMPANY HAS AN ACCRUED LIABILITY AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF APPROXIMATELY  $376  FOR ESTIMATED EXPENSES RELATED TO ANTICIPATED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS OR REMEDIATION EFFORTS, INCLUDING RELEVANT LEGAL AND CONSULTING COSTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY HAS NO MATERIAL JOINT AND SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY WITH OTHER PARTIES.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY REGULARLY ACCRUES EXPENSES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO ITS FUTURE CORRECTIVE ACTION OR REMEDIATION EFFORTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH ACCRUED AMOUNTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY SUCH COSTS, OR THAT THE  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AT ALL OF ITS CURRENT STORE LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION OR RELATED CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCOVERED OR ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING STORE LOCATIONS OR LOCATIONS THAT THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF FUNDS DISBURSED TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS OR THAT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, OR AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING REGULATIONS, WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES BEYOND THOSE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED.  OTHER FACTORS.  OTHER FACTORS AND RISKS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT OUR CASH BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE NEEDS, TAX INCREASES, POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE SEASONALITY OF DEMAND PATTERNS, AND WEATHER CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC. WE FURTHER CAUTION YOU THAT OTHER FACTORS WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED MAY IN THE FUTURE PROVE TO BE IMPORTANT IN AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ASK YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY SPEAK ONLY OF OUR VIEWS AS OF THE STATEMENT DATES.

YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT REFLECT OUR PLANS, ESTIMATES, AND BELIEFS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THESE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND THE QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 EACH AS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d).  COMPANY OVERVIEW  ASPEN GROUP, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cAGI\u201d) IS AN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY HOLDING COMPANY. AGI HAS THREE SUBSIDIARIES, ASPEN UNIVERSITY INC. ORGANIZED IN 1987, UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY, INC. ORGANIZED IN MAY 2017 FOR THE PURPOSES OF ACQUIRING UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY IN DECEMBER 2017, AND ASPEN NURSING, INC. (\u201cANI\u201d) ORGANIZED IN 2018.

AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, 8,904 OF 10,718 OR 83% OF ALL STUDENTS ACROSS BOTH UNIVERSITIES ARE DEGREE-SEEKING NURSING STUDENTS.  IN MARCH 2014, ASPEN UNIVERSITY UNVEILED A MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS ACROSS EVERY ONLINE DEGREE PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IS DESIGNED SO THAT STUDENTS WILL MAKE ONE PAYMENT PER MONTH, AND THAT MONTHLY PAYMENT IS APPLIED TOWARDS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE (TUITION AND FEES, EXCLUDING TEXTBOOKS). ASPEN UNIVERSITY'S  MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN OFFERS ONLINE ASSOCIATE AND BACHELOR STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAY THEIR TUITION AND FEES AT $250/MONTH, ONLINE MASTER\u2019S STUDENTS $325/MONTH, AND ONLINE DOCTORAL STUDENTS $375/MONTH, INTEREST FREE, THEREBY GIVING STUDENTS A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION VERSUS TAKING OUT A FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID LOAN.

THE SECOND ACADEMIC YEAR IN WHICH STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR CLINICAL COURSES (APPROXIMATE COST OF $18,000) IS REQUIRED TO BE FUNDED THROUGH CONVENTIONAL PAYMENT METHODS (EITHER CASH, PRIVATE LOANS, CORPORATE TUITION REIMBURSEMENT OR FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID).  SINCE 1993, ASPEN UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN NATIONALLY ACCREDITED BY THE DEAC, A NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY RECOGNIZED BY THE DOE. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE DEAC INFORMED ASPEN UNIVERSITY THAT IT HAD RENEWED ITS ACCREDITATION FOR FIVE YEARS TO JANUARY 2024.  SINCE 2009, USU HAS BEEN REGIONALLY ACCREDITED BY WSCUC.  BOTH UNIVERSITIES ARE QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT AND THE FEDERAL STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS (TITLE IV, HEA PROGRAMS).  MONTHLY PAYMENT PROGRAMS OVERVIEW  AGI OFFERS TWO MONTHLY PAYMENT PROGRAMS.  \u2022  A MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IN WHICH STUDENTS MAKE PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH OVER A FIXED PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE DEGREE PROGRAM; AND  \u2022  A MONTHLY INSTALLMENT PLAN IN WHICH STUDENTS PAY THREE MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS (DAY 1, DAY 31 AND DAY 61 AFTER THE START OF EACH COURSE).  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW BY 17% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FROM 5,074 TO 5,927. THOSE 5,927 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 66% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.

AGI NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS  AGI DELIVERED A COMPANY RECORD 2,217 NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 (THE \u201cFISCAL 2020 Q2\u201d), A 15% SEQUENTIAL ENROLLMENT INCREASE AND AN INCREASE OF 42% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTED FOR 1,823 NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS (INCLUDING 190 DOCTORAL ENROLLMENTS AND 437 PRE-LICENSURE BSN AZ CAMPUS ENROLLMENTS), DELIVERING OVERALL ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT ASPEN UNIVERSITY OF 41% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT ASPEN UNIVERSITY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE DOCTORAL UNIT INCREASING BY 43% AND THE PRE-LICENSURE BSN UNIT INCREASING BY 667% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. ENROLLMENT EFFORTS REMAINED FOCUSED ON THE HIGHEST EXPECTED RETURN BUSINESSES AS MANAGEMENT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENT ADVISORS (THE \u201cEA\u201d)DEDICATED TO ASPEN\u2019S DOCTORAL AND PRE-LICENSURE UNITS DURING THE QUARTER.  IN  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITION, OUR ASPEN NURSING + OTHER UNIT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENTS PER EA AND COST PER ENROLLMENT DECLINED.  AS A RESULT OF THIS INCREASED EFFICIENCY, ASPEN\u2019S NURSING + OTHER UNIT GREW ENROLLMENTS BY 8% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  USU ACCOUNTED FOR 394 NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS (PRIMARILY FNP ENROLLMENTS), A 45% ENROLLMENT INCREASE YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

MARKETING EFFICIENCY RATIO (MER) =  REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (RPE)  COST PER ENROLLMENT (CPE)  COST PER ENROLLMENT (CPE)  THE COST PER ENROLLMENT MEASURES THE ADVERTISING INVESTMENT SPENT IN A GIVEN SIX MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS ACHIEVED IN THAT GIVEN SIX MONTH PERIOD, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN AVERAGE CPE FOR THE PERIOD MEASURED.  REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (RPE)  THE REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT TAKES EACH QUARTERLY COHORT OF NEW DEGREE-SEEKING STUDENT ENROLLMENTS, AND MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF EARNED REVENUE INCLUDING TUITION AND FEES TO DETERMINE THE AVERAGE RPE FOR THE COHORT MEASURED. FOR THE LATER PERIODS OF A COHORT, WE HAVE USED REASONABLE PROJECTIONS BASED OFF OF HISTORICAL RESULTS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE WE WILL EARN IN LATER PERIODS OF THE COHORT.  THE CURRENT MARKETING EFFICIENCY RATIO (MER = REVENUE-PER-ENROLLMENT OR LTV/COST-PER-ENROLLMENT OR CAC) FOR OUR FOUR DEGREE UNITS IS REFLECTED IN THE BELOW TABLE.

ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN HYBRID (ONLINE/ON-CAMPUS) DEGREE PROGRAM  IN JULY 2018, ASPEN UNIVERSITY THROUGH ANI BEGAN OFFERING ITS PRE-LICENSURE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING (BSN) DEGREE PROGRAM AT ITS INITIAL CAMPUS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. AS A RESULT OF OVERWHELMING DEMAND IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA, IN JANUARY 2019 ASPEN UNIVERSITY BEGAN OFFERING BOTH DAY (JULY, NOVEMBER, MARCH SEMESTERS) AND EVENING/WEEKEND (JANUARY, MAY, SEPTEMBER SEMESTERS) PROGRAMS, EQUALING SIX SEMESTER STARTS PER YEAR. MOREOVER, IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AGI ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO OPEN A SECOND CAMPUS IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HONORHEALTH. THE INITIAL SEMESTER AT HONORHEALTH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S INNOVATIVE HYBRID (ONLINE/ON-CAMPUS) PROGRAM ALLOWS MOST OF THE CREDITS TO BE COMPLETED ONLINE (83 OF 120 CREDITS OR 69%), WITH PRICING OFFERED AT CURRENT LOW TUITION RATES OF $150/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES AND $325/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE CORE NURSING COURSES. FOR STUDENTS WITH NO PRIOR COLLEGE CREDITS, THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS LESS THAN $50,000.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM IS OFFERED AS A FULL-TIME, THREE-YEAR (NINE SEMESTER) PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY HOLD A STATE NURSING LICENSE AND HAVE NO PRIOR NURSING EXPERIENCE. ASPEN IS ADMITTING STUDENTS INTO ONE OF TWO PROGRAM COMPONENTS: (1) A PRE-PROFESSIONAL NURSING COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT HAVE LESS THAN THE REQUIRED 41 GENERAL EDUCATION CREDITS COMPLETED (YEAR 1), AND (2) THE NURSING CORE COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPETITIVE EVALUATION PROCESS FOR ENTRY (YEARS 2-3).  NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS FOR ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM INCREASED FROM 276 TO 437, OR 58% SEQUENTIALLY.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY ENDED THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER WITH 1,051 ACTIVE STUDENTS IN ITS PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM.  PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM CAMPUS EXPANSION PLAN  ASPEN UNIVERSITY PLANS TO LAUNCH A STAND-ALONE CAMPUS IN TAMPA, FLORIDA IN THE SUMMER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020. A CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXECUTED WITH BAYFRONT HEALTH, A REGIONAL NETWORK OF SEVEN HOSPITALS AND OVER 1,900 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF SERVING THE RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA\u2019S GULF COAST.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, ASPEN UNIVERSITY PLANS TO LAUNCH A STAND-ALONE CAMPUS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS IN THE WINTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020. A CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXECUTED WITH BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH \u2013 CENTRAL DIVISION. AS THE LARGEST NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN TEXAS AND ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES, BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH WAS BORN FROM THE 2013 COMBINATION OF BAYLOR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND SCOTT & WHITE HEALTHCARE. TODAY, BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE INCLUDES 48 HOSPITALS, MORE THAN 800 PATIENT CARE SITES, MORE THAN 7,800 ACTIVE PHYSICIANS, OVER 47,000 EMPLOYEES AND THE SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH PLAN.  THE COMPANY HAS STRATEGICALLY TARGETED EXISTING CAMPUS LOCATIONS IN AUSTIN AND TAMPA THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT-OUT INCLUDING FF&E (FURNITURE, FIXTURES, AND EQUIPMENT) IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CAPEX) REQUIRED TO LAUNCH THESE CAMPUSES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THIS WILL ALLOW THE CAPEX FOR EACH NEW CAMPUS TO BE IN THE SAME RANGE AS THE COST OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S EMBEDDED CAMPUS AT HONORHEALTH LOCATED IN NORTH PHOENIX.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN  SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IN THE SPRING OF 2014, THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, HAS GROWN FROM A NET NUMBER OF $649,890 AT APRIL 30, 2014 TO A NET NUMBER OF $18,304,250 AT OCTOBER 31, 2019. THIS GROWTH COULD BE PORTRAYED AS THE ENGINE OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE ATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR A DEGREE OVER A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME HAS FUELED THE GROWTH OF THIS PLAN AND, AS A RESULT, THE INCREASE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE.  EACH STUDENT\u2019S RECEIVABLE ACCOUNT IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW MANY CLASSES A STUDENT TAKES EACH PERIOD. IF A STUDENT TAKES TWO CLASSES EACH EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD WHILE PAYING $250, $325 OR $375 A MONTH AS AN EXAMPLE, THAT STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE BALANCE WILL RISE ACCORDINGLY. THE CONVERSE IS TRUE ALSO. A STUDENT WHO TAKES COURSES AT A SLOWER PACE, EVEN TAKING TIME OFF BETWEEN EIGHT-WEEK TERMS, COULD HAVE A BALANCE DUE TO THEM. IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY HOWEVER THAT A STUDENT PARTICIPATING IN THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN WILL HAVE AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, AS THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM OF STUDY PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE FIXED MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN.  THE COMMON THREAD IS THE ACTUAL MONTHLY PAYMENT, WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT WITH NO INTEREST THAT EACH STUDENT COMMITS TO PAY OVER A FIXED NUMBER OF MONTHS. IF A STUDENT STOPS PAYING, THAT PERSON CAN NO LONGER REGISTER FOR A CLASS. IF A STUDENT DECIDES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE UNIVERSITY, THEIR ACCOUNT WILL BE SETTLED, EITHER THROUGH COLLECTION OF THEIR BALANCE OR DISBURSEMENT OF THE AMOUNT OWED THEM. ASPEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW BY 17% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FROM 5,074 TO 5,927. THOSE 5,927 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 66% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  USU STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW FROM 1,053 TO 1,101 STUDENTS SEQUENTIALLY. THOSE 1,101 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 65% OF USU\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE  THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE FOR ANY PERIOD IS THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING THREE FACTORS.  1.  REVENUE;  2.  CASH RECEIPTS; AND  3.  THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED REVENUE.  ALL THREE FACTORS EQUALLY DETERMINE THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF ONE QUARTER EXPERIENCES PARTICULARLY HIGH CASH RECEIPTS, THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL GO DOWN. THE SAME EFFECT IF CASH RECEIPTS ARE LOWER OR IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER OF THE OTHER FACTORS.  SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE CHANGE IN REVENUE DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO AN EQUALLY SIMILAR CHANGE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN CASH AND THE DEFERRAL MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. FOR NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE CHANGES IN THE RESERVE MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. ANY ADDITIONAL RESERVE OR WRITE-OFFS WILL INFLUENCE THE BALANCE.  AS IT IS A STRAIGHT MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR BOTH GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS PUBLIC, ONE CAN REASONABLY CALCULATE THE TWO NON-PUBLIC PIECES OF INFORMATION, NAMELY THE CASH RECEIPTS IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND THE WRITE-OFFS IN NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  FOR REVENUE, THE QUARTERLY CHANGE IS PRIMARILY BILLINGS AND THE NET IMPACT OF DEFERRED REVENUE. THE DEFERRAL FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER OR YEAR IS ADDED TO THE BILLINGS AND THE DEFERRAL AT THE END OF THE PERIOD IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE AMOUNT BILLED. THE TOTAL  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEFERRED REVENUE AT THE END OF EVERY PERIOD IS REFLECTED IN THE LIABILITY SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET. DEFERRED REVENUE CAN VARY FOR MANY REASONS, BUT SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING OF THE CLASS STARTS IN RELATION TO THE END OF THE QUARTER WILL CAUSE CHANGES IN THE BALANCE.  AS MENTIONED IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECTION, THE CHANGE IN REVENUE CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. REVENUE DOES NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF CASH RECEIVED WHEREAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DOES. DEPENDING ON THE MONTH AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED, IT IS LIKELY THAT REVENUE OR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL INCREASE AT A RATE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER. THE IMPACT OF CASH IS EASY TO SUBSTANTIATE AS IT AGREES TO DEPOSITS IN OUR BANK ACCOUNTS.  AGI RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES.  AT OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS $1,892,318 WHICH REPRESENTS 9% OF THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE OF $20,196,568, THE SUM OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.  THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WHEN A STUDENT SIGNS UP FOR THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN, THERE IS A CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY CAN EXPECT TO EARN OVER THE LIFE OF THE STUDENT\u2019S PROGRAM. THIS CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT CANNOT BE RECORDED AS AN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE AS THE STUDENT DOES HAVE THE OPTION TO STOP ATTENDING. AS A STUDENT TAKES A CLASS, REVENUE IS EARNED OVER THAT EIGHT-WEEK CLASS. SOME STUDENTS ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRAM, TAKING TWO CLASSES EVERY EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD, AND AS WE DISCUSSED, THAT INCREASES THE STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. IF ANY PORTION OF THAT BALANCE WILL BE PAID IN A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS, THAT PORTION IS REFLECTED AS LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MONTHLY PAYMENT PLANS, OUR LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE HAS GROWN FROM $3,085,243 AT APRIL 30, 2019 TO $5,490,733  AT OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE PRIMARY COMPONENT CONSIST OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER 36 AND 39 MONTHS. THE AVERAGE STUDENT COMPLETES THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAM IN 24 MONTHS, THEREFORE MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE SHORT-TERM.  INCLUDED BELOW IS A GRAPHIC OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL VALUE.  A  B  C  CLASSES TAKEN  LESS MONTHLY  PAYMENTS RECEIVED  PAYMENTS FOR CLASSES  TAKEN THAT ARE GREATER  THAN 12 MONTHS  EXPECTED CLASSES  TO BE TAKEN OVER  BALANCE OF PROGRAM.  SHORT-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  LONG-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  NOT RECORDED IN  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE SUM OF A, B AND C WILL EQUAL THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 (FISCAL 2020 Q2) COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 (FISCAL 2019 Q2)  REVENUES  REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED TO $12,085,965 FROM $8,095,344 FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, AN INCREASE OF $3,990,621 OR 49%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LIFETIME VALUE (LTV). BY FOCUSING OUR MARKETING SPEND ON DELIVERING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LIFETIME VALUE (LTV), WE INCREASED OUR AVERAGE REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (OR ARPU) BY 35%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS REVENUE GROWTH TO CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE PRIORITIZING OUR HIGHEST LTV DEGREE PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH PLANS.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED 35% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY'S TRADITIONAL POST-LICENSURE ONLINE NURSING + OTHER BUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTED 61% OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUE IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY 12% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2. FINALLY, USU CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 27% OF THE TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY NOW EXPECTS ANNUAL REVENUE GROWTH TO MEET OR EXCEED 41% FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 2020.  COST OF REVENUES (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION)  THE COMPANY\u2019S COST OF REVENUES CONSISTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES AND MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS.  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES FOR FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED TO $2,181,067 OR 18% OF REVENUES FROM $1,586,904 OR 20% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, AN INCREASE OF $594,163 OR 37%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER  OF CLASS STARTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES REPRESENTED 16% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE USU INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES EQUALED 23% OF USU REVENUES DURING THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 WERE $2,006,989 OR 17% OF REVENUES COMPARED TO $2,248,611 OR 28% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, A DECREASE OF $241,622 OR (11%).

THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TERM EXPECTATIONS THAT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WILL GROW AT APPROXIMATELY HALF THE RATE OF REVENUES. THERE IS A PORTION OF THESE COSTS THAT ARE VARIABLE WHICH INCREASED AS OUR REVENUES INCREASED; BUT THERE ALSO IS A FIXED COST COMPONENT THAT TENDS TO GROW AT A SLOWER RATE.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE AMOUNT REPRESENTED 44% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE USU GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS EQUALED 56% OF USU REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS MAINLY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE. MOREOVER, AGI HAS MADE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE PHOENIX CAMPUSES AND WILL INVEST IN OTHER CAMPUS LOCATIONS THAT WILL CAUSE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

INVESTORS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  OUR MANAGEMENT USES AND RELIES ON EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH MANAGEMENT AND SHAREHOLDERS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN PLANNING, FORECASTING AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. OUR MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISON. OUR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE DESCRIBED EXCLUDED ITEMS.  ASPEN GROUP DEFINES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS EARNINGS (OR LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE THE ITEMS IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $0 IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 AND APPROXIMATELY $118,872 IN THE FISCAL 2019 Q2. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS MANAGEMENT, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO EVALUATE AND ASSESS OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AFTER REMOVING THE IMPACT OF ITEMS OF A NON-OPERATIONAL NATURE THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY.  WE HAVE INCLUDED A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, TOGETHER WITH THE RECONCILIATION TO GAAP, HELPS INVESTORS MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND OTHER COMPANIES. IN MAKING ANY COMPARISONS TO OTHER COMPANIES, INVESTORS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT COMPANIES USE DIFFERENT NON-GAAP MEASURES TO EVALUATE THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. INVESTORS SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SPECIFIC DEFINITION BEING USED AND TO THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN SUCH MEASURE AND THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE PROVIDED BY EACH COMPANY UNDER APPLICABLE SEC RULES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ALLOCABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOWS IS AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(  2,025,107  )  $(  5,487,423  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (  1,253,653  )  (  1,431,598  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  237,713  30,270  NET DECREASE IN CASH  $(  3,041,047  )  $(  6,888,751  )  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $(  2,025,107  ) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(  2,713,450  ) AND A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $(2,365,984), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3,054,327 IN NON-CASH ITEMS.  THE NET LOSS INCLUDED $852,649  FOR INTEREST EXPENSE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS) OF APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION.  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS A FAVORABLE TREND IN WORKING CAPITAL OVER TIME, BUT THERE MAY BE VOLATILITY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.  SO, IN AGGREGATE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A GENERAL TREND TOWARD LOWER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IN FUTURE QUARTERS; HOWEVER, SOME QUARTERS COULD HAVE HIGHER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF MORE CASH USED TO SUPPORT CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. PROGRAM START TIMINGS AND THE RELATED FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID DRAWDOWNS ALSO IMPACT CASH TIMING.  FOR EXAMPLE, THIS QUARTER THE TIMING OF THE DRAWDOWN FOR OUR USU MSN-FNP PROGRAM RESULTED IN OVER $500,000 OF CASH JUST BEFORE QUARTER END. IN THE FUTURE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT MAY OCCUR DEPENDING ON PROGRAM START TIMING DURING THE YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $(  5,487,423  ) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(  5,312,354  ), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1,838,637 IN NON-CASH ITEMS AND $2,013,706 DECREASE IN OPERATING ASSETS  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND LIABILITIES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEM CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $4,028,143  WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $1,022,172  AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $515,291.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $(  1,253,653  ) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $(  1,431,598  ) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN COURSEWARE AND THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AS WE WERE BUILDING UP OUR CAMPUS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $237,713  WHICH REFLECTS PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $30,270  , WHICH REFLECTS STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS NET OF PAYMENT OF OFFERING COSTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY HAD CASH DEPOSITS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.3 MILLION ON DECEMBER 6, 2019, INCLUDING $454,288  OF RESTRICTED CASH. IN ADDITION TO ITS CASH, THE COMPANY ALSO HAD ACCESS TO THE $5 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH IS UNUSED. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS CASH RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OUR CASH BALANCES ARE KEPT LIQUID TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH IS CONCENTRATED IN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASE FR-60, CAUTIONARY ADVICE REGARDING DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, FROM THE SEC, WE HAVE SELECTED OUR MORE SUBJECTIVE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATION PROCESSES FOR PURPOSES OF EXPLAINING THE METHODOLOGY USED IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATE, IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES PERTAINING TO THE ESTIMATE AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  REVENUE CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF TUITION AND FEES DERIVED FROM COURSES TAUGHT BY ASPEN ONLINE AS WELL AS FROM RELATED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT ASPEN PROVIDES TO ITS STUDENTS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE MATERIALS AND LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. TUITION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED PRO-RATA OVER THE APPLICABLE PERIOD OF INSTRUCTION. ASPEN MAINTAINS AN INSTITUTIONAL TUITION REFUND POLICY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TUITION TO BE REFUNDED IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS DURING STATED REFUND PERIODS. CERTAIN STATES IN WHICH STUDENTS RESIDE IMPOSE SEPARATE, MANDATORY REFUND POLICIES, WHICH OVERRIDE ASPEN\u2019S POLICY TO THE EXTENT IN CONFLICT. IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS AT A TIME WHEN A PORTION OR NONE OF THE TUITION IS REFUNDABLE, THEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, ASPEN RECOGNIZES AS REVENUE THE TUITION THAT WAS NOT REFUNDED. SINCE ASPEN RECOGNIZES REVENUE PRO-RATA OVER THE TERM OF THE COURSE AND BECAUSE, UNDER ITS INSTITUTIONAL REFUND POLICY, THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO REFUND IS NEVER GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN DEFERRED, UNDER ASPEN\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REFUNDED. ASPEN\u2019S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAVE STARTING AND ENDING DATES THAT DIFFER FROM ITS FISCAL QUARTERS. THEREFORE, AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, A PORTION OF REVENUE FROM THESE PROGRAMS IS NOT YET EARNED AND IS THEREFORE DEFERRED. ASPEN ALSO CHARGES STUDENTS ANNUAL FEES FOR LIBRARY, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. DEFERRED REVENUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF TUITION, FEES, AND OTHER STUDENT PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THE PORTION RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AND IT IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OTHER REVENUE MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS SALES OCCUR OR SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SELECT BOTH A PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PAYMENT OPTION WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS DUE TO ASPEN FOR TUITION, FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE MOST COMMON PAYMENT OPTION FOR ASPEN\u2019S STUDENTS IS PERSONAL FUNDS OR PAYMENT MADE ON THEIR BEHALF BY AN EMPLOYER. IN INSTANCES WHERE A STUDENT SELECTS FINANCIAL AID AS THE PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION, HE OR SHE OFTEN SELECTS PERSONAL CASH AS THE SECONDARY OPTION. IF A STUDENT WHO HAS SELECTED FINANCIAL AID AS HIS OR HER PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION WITHDRAWS PRIOR TO THE END OF A COURSE BUT AFTER THE DATE THAT ASPEN\u2019S INSTITUTIONAL REFUND PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, THE STUDENT WILL HAVE INCURRED THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE FULL COST OF THE COURSE. IF THE WITHDRAWAL OCCURS BEFORE THE DATE AT WHICH THE STUDENT HAS EARNED 100% OF HIS OR HER FINANCIAL AID, ASPEN WILL HAVE TO RETURN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE TITLE IV FUNDS TO THE DOE AND THE STUDENT WILL OWE ASPEN ALL AMOUNTS INCURRED THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID THAT THE STUDENT EARNED AND THAT ASPEN IS ENTITLED TO RETAIN. IN THIS CASE, ASPEN MUST COLLECT THE RECEIVABLE USING THE STUDENT\u2019S SECOND PAYMENT OPTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM STUDENTS, ASPEN RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES. ASPEN DETERMINES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS USING A GENERAL RESERVE METHOD BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND THE AGING OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN APPLIES RESERVES TO ITS RECEIVABLES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF THE RISK PRESENTED BY THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN WRITES OFF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES AT THE TIME THE BALANCES ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. ASPEN CONTINUES TO REFLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH AN OFFSETTING ALLOWANCE AS LONG AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF COLLECTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PRIMARY PAYERS OTHER THAN STUDENTS, ASPEN ESTIMATES ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BY EVALUATING SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS WHERE INFORMATION INDICATES THE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE AN INABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEYOND CONTRACTUAL TERMS. IN THESE CASES, ASPEN USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENT, BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, TO RECORD A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS AGAINST AMOUNTS DUE TO REDUCE THE RECEIVABLE TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THESE SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES ARE RE-EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED. THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE. ASPEN MAY ALSO RECORD A GENERAL ALLOWANCE AS NECESSARY.  DIRECT WRITE-OFFS ARE TAKEN IN THE PERIOD WHEN ASPEN HAS EXHAUSTED ITS EFFORTS TO COLLECT OVERDUE AND UNPAID RECEIVABLES OR OTHERWISE EVALUATE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE THAT ASPEN SHOULD ABANDON SUCH EFFORTS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  WE INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE FROM THE DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION. WE ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE OF ACQUISITIONS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT FAIR VALUE. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OVER THE AMOUNT ASSIGNED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WE EXPENSE TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AS INCURRED.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL CURRENTLY REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM EDUCACION SIGNIFICATIVA, LLC. GOODWILL HAS AN INDEFINITE LIFE AND IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT BOTH INDEFINITE LIVED AND DEFINITE LIVED ASSETS. ACCREDITATION AND REGULATORY APPROVALS AND TRADE NAME AND TRADEMARKS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES AND ACCORDINGLY ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS AND CURRICULUMS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES AND ARE AMORTIZED ACCORDINGLY.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES INVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, OUR NET  SALES DECREASED 7% TO $288.6 MILLION FROM $308.8 MILLION, LOSS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED BY $14.2 MILLION FROM $26.8 MILLION TO  $12.5 MILLION, AND NET LOSS DECREASED $6.2 MILLION FROM $19.7 MILLION, OR $6.78 LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE, TO $13.5 MILLION, OR $4.64  LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE, OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE EXECUTED A WORKFORCE REDUCTION AT  BOTH OUR CORPORATE OFFICE AND FIELD MANAGEMENT AS PART OF OUR COST REDUCTION INITIATIVE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TURNAROUND PLAN  THAT COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES IN OCTOBER 2019. AS A RESULT, WE  EXPENSED $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES, EXCLUDING REVERSAL OF  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, DURING THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SEVERANCE BENEFITS ARE  INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON JULY 1, 2019, WE EFFECTED A 12-TO-1 STOCK SPLIT (THE \u201cREVERSE  STOCK SPLIT\u201d), REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THAT DATE FROM 35.4 MILLION TO 3.1 MILLION SHARES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND RESTRICTED  STOCK UNITS, THE EXERCISE PRICE OF ALL OUR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE PURSUANT  TO OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS WERE ADJUSTED PROPORTIONATELY IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE PAR VALUE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK  WERE UNCHANGED. ALL HISTORICAL SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS PRESENTED HEREIN HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THESE  CHANGES. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WAS EFFECTED IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO ENSURE WE  REGAINED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LLC\u2019S (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT AND  MAINTAINED ITS LISTING ON NASDAQ. NASDAQ INFORMED US ON JULY 17, 2019 THAT WE HAD REGAINED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ\u2019S  LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON JULY 31, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A LIMITED  DURATION STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN (THE \u201cRIGHTS PLAN\u201d) WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF AUGUST 1, 2022 AND AN OWNERSHIP  TRIGGER THRESHOLD OF 15%, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE RIGHTS PLAN, OUR BOARD OF  DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AND DECLARED A DIVIDEND TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 15, 2019 OF ONE  PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHT (A \u201cRIGHT\u201d) FOR EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  UPON  CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS  (NONE OF WHICH  HAVE OCCURRED AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019), EACH RIGHT WILL ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO PURCHASE FROM US ONE FIVE-THOUSANDTH (SUBJECT TO  ADJUSTMENT) OF ONE SHARE OF SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK, $0.01 PAR VALUE PER SHARE (THE  \u201cPREFERRED STOCK\u201d) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $18.00 (THE \u201cEXERCISE PRICE\u201d) PER ONE FIVE-THOUSANDTH OF A  SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, IF A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 15% OR MORE OF OUR COMMON STOCK  WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR IN THE CASE OF A PERSON OR GROUP THAT BENEFICIALLY OWNED MORE THAN 15%  OF OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE ADOPTION OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT ON AUGUST 2,  2019, SUCH PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF ANY ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL  OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EACH HOLDER OF A RIGHT (OTHER THAN THE ACQUIRING PERSON OR GROUP WHOSE RIGHTS WILL BECOME  VOID) WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE, UPON PAYMENT OF THE EXERCISE PRICE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE RIGHTS PLAN, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVING A MARKET VALUE OF TWICE THE EXERCISE PRICE  (AS ADJUSTED). THE COMPLETE TERMS OF THE RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN A RIGHTS AGREEMENT (THE \u201cRIGHTS  AGREEMENT\u201d), DATED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2019, BETWEEN FRANCESCA\u2019S HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND COMPUTERSHARE TRUST  COMPANY, N.A., AS RIGHTS AGENT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT 4.1 TO THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

ON AUGUST 13, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY  ANNOUNCED STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES REVIEW PROCESS AS WE INTEND TO FOCUS ON THE EXECUTION OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  OUR BOUTIQUE COUNT DECREASED TO 714 BOUTIQUES AS OF NOVEMBER  2, 2019 FROM 738 BOUTIQUES AS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2018. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, OUR CURRENT PRIORITY IS EXECUTING OUR TURNAROUND PLAN  WHICH IS AIMED AT IMPROVING COMPARABLE SALES AND PROFITABILITY. AS SUCH, WE PLAN TO CLOSE AT LEAST THREE EXISTING BOUTIQUES DURING  THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO OPTIMIZE OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUE FLEET. WE PLAN TO RESUME NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS  AND REMODELS IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, WHEN THE DESIRED RESULTS ARE ACHIEVED UNDER OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  16  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS OPERATING DATA FOR THE THIRTEEN AND  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 3, 2018.

IF A BOUTIQUE IS CLOSED FOR FOUR OR MORE DAYS WITHIN A GIVEN FISCAL WEEK FOR ANY REASON, WE EXCLUDE SALES FROM THAT BOUTIQUE FROM  COMPARABLE SALES FOR THAT FULL FISCAL WEEK. IF A BOUTIQUE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED, WE EXCLUDE SALES FROM THAT BOUTIQUE FROM COMPARABLE  SALES ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH THAT IT DID NOT REGISTER FULL MONTH OF SALES. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE OUR ECOMMERCE  SALES AND EXCLUDE GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME.  (2)  NET SALES PER AVERAGE SQUARE FOOT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET SALES FOR THE PERIOD BY THE AVERAGE SQUARE FEET DURING THE  PERIOD. FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING NET SALES PER SQUARE FOOT MEASURE, WE USE AVERAGE SQUARE FEET DURING THE PERIOD AS OPPOSED TO  TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. FOR INDIVIDUAL QUARTERLY PERIODS, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET IS CALCULATED AS (A) THE  SUM OF TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD DIVIDED BY (B) TWO. FOR PERIODS CONSISTING OF MORE THAN  ONE FISCAL QUARTER, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET IS CALCULATED AS (A) THE SUM OF TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD  AND TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER WITHIN THE PERIOD, DIVIDED BY (B) THE NUMBER OF FISCAL QUARTERS  WITHIN THE PERIOD PLUS ONE (WHICH, FOR A FISCAL YEAR, IS FIVE). THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS IN THE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS  AND OTHER RETAILERS CALCULATE SALES PER SQUARE FOOT OR SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES. AS A RESULT, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET AND NET SALES  PER AVERAGE SQUARE FOOT FOR THE PERIOD MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY OTHER RETAILERS.  (3)  AVERAGE SQUARE FEET PER BOUTIQUE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF THE PERIOD BY THE NUMBER OF  BOUTIQUES OPEN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.

COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 1%  PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN BOUTIQUE CONVERSION RATE AND AVERAGE UNITS SOLD PER TRANSACTION. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY  NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET DECREASE IN BOUTIQUE COUNT DURING THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO THE  SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WERE 705 COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES AND 9 NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED  TO 675 AND 63, RESPECTIVELY, AT NOVEMBER 3, 2018.

THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.6 MILLION DECREASE IN BOUTIQUE PAYROLL AND SUPPLIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COST  REDUCTION INITIATIVES UNDER OUR TURNAROUND PLAN AND $1.3 MILLION OF LOWER CORPORATE PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES MOSTLY DUE  TO THE HEADCOUNT REDUCTION BUT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN SHORT TERM INCENTIVE BONUS EXPENSES AS  NO AMOUNT WAS ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO A 6% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY WEAK SALES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN  TRAFFIC AND CONVERSION RATES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND LOWER AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL PRICES DUE TO DEEPER  MARKDOWNS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION  BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD  TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES AND WE TYPICALLY HAVE UP TO 45 DAYS TO PAY OUR INVENTORY VENDORS AND UP  TO 60 DAYS TO PAY OTHER VENDORS.  AT NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HAD $21.2 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  $20.0 MILLION OF COMBINED BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING, AND $24.0 MILLION OF COMBINED BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL  CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ANY AVAILABLE  BORROWINGS UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CASH FLOW  A SUMMARY OF OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED INVENTORY RECEIPTS IN ORDER TO ALIGN OUR INVENTORY LEVELS WITH  OUR HOLIDAY SEASON PLANS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS AND THE $8.5 MILLION INCOME TAX REFUND  RECEIVED IN APRIL 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR NEW BOUTIQUES, IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITY.

OUR SPENDING IN  THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAYMENT OF PRIOR YEAR ACCRUED CONSTRUCTIONS COSTS MOSTLY  ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUE REMODELS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO  SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW BOUTIQUES, REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 UNTIL THE DESIRED  RESULTS OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN ARE ACHIEVED. FOR THE THIRTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018, OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  MOSTLY RELATED TO EXISTING BOUTIQUE REMODELS AND NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY TENANT ALLOWANCES FOR NEW BOUTIQUES  OPENED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD AS WE CONTINUED OUR FOCUS ON LOWERING RENTAL RATES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT WILL BE SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS  TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES AND INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF BORROWINGS AND PAYMENTS UNDER  OUR ASSET BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AS WELL AS REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  21  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE THIRTY-NINE  WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS $8.6 MILLION, WHICH CONSISTED OF $15.0 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL  CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $10.0 MILLION PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE $10.0 MILLION PROCEEDS FROM  THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WERE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BORROWING UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT.

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1  TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  23  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, AS THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE DEPICTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY  UNCERTAIN. SUCH POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019. EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW,  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DISCLOSED  IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  LEASES  ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLEASES\u201d, USING THE ADDITIONAL, OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD WHICH ALLOWS  ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE NEW STANDARD BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS  AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED UNDER ASC 840, \u201cLEASES.\u201d  AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, WE RECORDED AN OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY OF $278.9 MILLION AND OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d)  ASSET OF $242.9 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 3, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECOGNIZED $1.8 MILLION CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BEGINNING  BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ROU ASSETS SUBJECTED TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING UNDER EXISTING ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE FOR WHICH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842. THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 DID NOT HAVE  A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE LEASE OUR BOUTIQUES, DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE,  AND CERTAIN BOUTIQUE AND CORPORATE OFFICE EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT  IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION AND RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON  THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FIXED LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM AND, FOR OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS, INCLUDE INITIAL DIRECT  COSTS AND EXCLUDE LEASE INCENTIVES. VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. LEASE TERMS MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND  OR TERMINATE THE LEASE WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL ELECT THAT OPTION. SUBSEQUENT TO THE RECOGNITION OF ITS OPERATING  LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES, WE RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE RELATED TO ITS OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE  BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED USING THE EFFECTIVE  INTEREST METHOD AND RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE REASONABLY CERTAIN  LEASE TERM. AS OUR LEASES GENERALLY DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE A COLLATERALIZED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE TO DETERMINE  THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE COLLATERALIZED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS BASED ON A SYNTHETIC CREDIT RATING THAT IS  EXTERNALLY PREPARED AT EACH MEASUREMENT.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASE  ROU ASSETS  WE EVALUATE LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE, INCLUDING OPERATING  LEASE ROU ASSETS, AND HELD FOR SALE WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THOSE ASSETS  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AND EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH  FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT A BOUTIQUE LEVEL. IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, WE CONSIDER BOTH QUALITATIVE  AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS.  THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE UNDISCOUNTED  FUTURE CASH FLOWS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ASSET AND COMPARING IT AGAINST ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET  IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET AND ITS FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED FUTURE  CASH FLOWS OR A MARKET PARTICIPANT\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS USING THE ASSET IN ITS HIGHEST AND BEST USE, WHICHEVER  IS APPROPRIATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ASSET\u2019S HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, CURRENT SALES TRENDS,  MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS DEEMED MATERIAL, AND DISCOUNTED USING A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. THE INPUTS  USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ARE CONSIDERED AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT  DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND ARE BASED ON OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  FOR INFORMATION REGARDING RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,  PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 1 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED  HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN DECEMBER 2017, WE ACQUIRED OUTWARD, INC., A  3-D  IMAGING AND AUGMENTED REALITY PLATFORM FOR THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND DE\u0301COR INDUSTRY.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2019 (\u201cTHIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018 (\u201cTHIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018\u201d) AND THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2019  (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE  FISCAL 2019\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018  (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE  FISCAL 2018\u201d), SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO. ALL EXPLANATIONS OF CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS  NET REVENUES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED BY $85,489,000, OR 6.3%, COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITH COMPARABLE BRAND REVENUE GROWTH OF 5.5%. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEST ELM AND POTTERY BARN. NET REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDED A 9.2% INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE ACROSS BOTH OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND FRANCHISE OPERATIONS.  WEST ELM\u2019S RESULTS THIS QUARTER WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH STRATEGIES AND EFFECTIVE EXECUTION. COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATED TO 14.1% THIS QUARTER WITH STRENGTH ACROSS ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND CHANNELS. THE POTTERY BARN BRANDS ALSO MAINTAINED THEIR STRONG MOMENTUM FROM LAST QUARTER. IN POTTERY BARN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 3.4% DRIVEN BY OUR INITIATIVES, INCLUDING OUR CURATED POTTERY BARN MARKETPLACE ASSORTMENT AND OUR APARTMENT ASSORTMENT OF SMALLER SPACE SOLUTIONS. THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY STRONG DIGITAL GROWTH INCLUDING DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES IN TRAFFIC AND PRODUCT ENGAGEMENT. IN POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 4.0%. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG GROWTH IN BOTH OUR BABY BUSINESS AND OUR HIGH QUALITY DORM ROOM BEDDING, FURNITURE AND  NO-NAILS  DECORATION SOLUTIONS. IN THE WILLIAMS SONOMA BRAND, THE 2.1% COMPARABLE REVENUE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SALES SHORTFALLS IN ELECTRICS, BAKEWARE, HOUSEWARES AND OUR HALLOWEEN ASSORTMENTS. DESPITE THIS, WE WERE ENCOURAGED THAT EXECUTION AGAINST OUR TRANSFORMATION PLAN HAS SHOWN IMPROVED PROFITABILITY, AND OUR WILLIAMS SONOMA BRANDED PRODUCTS CONTINUED TO GAIN MOMENTUM. OUR EMERGING BRANDS, REJUVENATION AND MARK & GRAHAM, DROVE ANOTHER QUARTER OF STRONG, PROFITABLE GROWTH AS THEY CONTINUE TO SCALE AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.  GROSS PROFIT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED TO 35.9% OF REVENUES VERSUS 36.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT FROM THE CHINA TARIFFS, AS WELL AS INCREASED SHIPPING COSTS DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF FURNITURE SALES. DESPITE THE TARIFF IMPACT ALMOST DOUBLING FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR MARGINS SEQUENTIALLY IMPROVED BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED SUCCESS WE ARE SEEING FROM ALL OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS.  WE HAVE BEEN EXECUTING AGAINST AN AGGRESSIVE TARIFF MITIGATION PLAN WHICH INCLUDES COST REDUCTIONS FROM VENDORS, MOVING PRODUCTION OUT OF CHINA TO SOUTH EAST ASIA AND TO THE UNITED STATES, COST SAVINGS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUSINESS, AS WELL AS SELECT PRICE INCREASES. THESE EFFORTS COMBINED WITH OUR HIGHER PRODUCT MARGINS,  ON-GOING  OCCUPANCY LEVERAGE, OVERALL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEVERAGE FROM HIGHER SALES AND THE CONTINUED BENEFITS OF OUR COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES ACROSS THE BUSINESS, OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FROM THESE INCREASED COSTS.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.94 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.07 IMPACT FROM ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUTWARD, INC.) VERSUS $1.00 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.06 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., A $0.02 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES, A $0.01 IMPACT RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT AND EARLY LEASE TERMINATION CHARGES, AND A $0.13 NET TAX BENEFIT FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT). WE ALSO RETURNED $78,289,000 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  OPERATIONALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ALSO MADE PROGRESS ACROSS OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES AND IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.  A KEY DRIVER OF OUR GROWTH THIS QUARTER WAS THE FOCUS ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS. THE KEY REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPACTFUL DRIVER OF REVENUES AND CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE QUARTER. OUR CROSS-BRAND  BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS  DIVISION ALSO DELIVERED ANOTHER STRONG QUARTER OF REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKED THE SUCCESSFUL RELAUNCH OF OUR  BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS  MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.  ALSO, DURING THE QUARTER, WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR PRODUCT INFORMATION PAGE, SITE SPEED, ENHANCED THE SEARCH EXPERIENCE, AND ADDED NEW CAPABILITIES TO DISPLAY LIFESTYLE ROOM IMAGERY AND PRODUCT INFORMATION, AS WELL AS  ADD-TO-CART  FUNCTIONALITY IN OUR SHOPPABLE ROOMS. IN OUR SUPPLY  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHAIN THIS QUARTER, TECHNOLOGY IS FACILITATING FASTER AND MORE STREAMLINED ORDER PROCESSING THROUGH A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS AND, TO FURTHER IMPROVE ORDER VISIBILITY, WE ARE CONTINUALLY BUILDING ON OUR FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE, DATA-DRIVEN DELIVERY ESTIMATES TO CUSTOMERS. FURTHER, WITHIN OUR  IN-HOME  FURNITURE DELIVERY NETWORK, WE\u2019VE EXPANDED THE ROLLOUT OF A SAME DAY DELIVERY ORDER TRACKING PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, OUR WEST ELM WEST COAST DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN FONTANA, CALIFORNIA IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL, FACILITATING GROWTH FOR OUR WEST ELM BRAND ON THE WEST COAST.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON EVOLUTION AND INNOVATION IS REFLECTED IN OUR BUSINESS RESULTS. OUR VALUE PROPOSITION OF HIGH QUALITY,  DESIGN-LED,  SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH OUR MULTI-BRAND, DIGITAL-FIRST OPERATING MODEL IS A STRONG COMBINATION.

STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN DECEMBER 2017 PROVIDED US WITH UP TO ONE YEAR TO FINALIZE OUR MEASUREMENT OF THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2018. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SAB 118 ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE  RE-MEASUREMENT  OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDENDS  SEE NOTE G TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDENDS,  WITHIN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OTHER THAN THOSE DISCUSSED IN NOTES H, I AND M TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019.  SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN DEMAND. HISTORICALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REALIZED DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER THROUGH JANUARY, AND LEVELS OF NET REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN LOWER DURING THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE GENERAL PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY EARNED A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $5,578,000 ON SALES OF $66,998,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $4,035,000 ON SALES OF $76,809,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $9,811,000 OR 12.8%, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY BEGAN THE QUARTER WITH AN ORDER BACKLOG THAT WAS MORE THAN $18 MILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO SLOW ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 14% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, INCREASING BY OVER 27% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCED BEGINNING BACKLOG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASED ORDER RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER.  ORDER BACKLOG AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS APPROXIMATELY $19.0 MILLION AND IS $3 MILLION GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS REFLECT CONTINUED SEASONALITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS.  SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE ACCELERATED THE BEGINNING OF BACK TO SCHOOL TO MID-AUGUST, IMPACTING THE SUMMER DELIVERY WINDOW.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED ITS PRODUCTION STOCKING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TIMELINESS AND COMPLETENESS OF ORDER FULFILLMENT DURING THE SUMMER.  THIS NEW PRODUCTION STOCKING PROGRAM WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TIMELINESS OF DELIVERIES AND A GREATER PORTION OF ORDERS FILLED IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  IN THE PRIOR YEAR THE COMPANY WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED COST OF COMMODITIES, PARTICULARLY STEEL AND COMPONENTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED COSTS FOR LABOR, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND FREIGHT.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THESE COSTS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL TARIFF RELATED COSTS INCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020.  TO COMPENSATE FOR THESE INCREASED COSTS, THE COMPANY RAISED SELLING PRICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  THE AMOUNT OF PRICE INCREASE VARIED BASED UPON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND COMPETITIVE CONSIDERATIONS, BUT NO PRODUCT INCREASED BY LESS THAN 10%.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS 40.1% COMPARED TO 34.4% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE PRICE INCREASE DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD VARIANCES INCURRED WHEN PRODUCTION RATES DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $993,000 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 30.6% FROM 28.0%. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED FREIGHT EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY $27,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED LESS MONEY TO FINANCE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL IN THE THIRD QUARTER.  NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY EARNED A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $10,177,000 ON NET SALES OF $164,250,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $6,594,000 ON NET SALES OF $174,180,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9,930,000 OR 5.7% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THIS NET DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN UNIT VOLUME OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING PRICES.  THE COMPANY BEGAN THE YEAR WITH A BACKLOG OF ORDERS THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 14% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, INCREASING BY OVER 27% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  BECAUSE THE THIRD QUARTER IS TRADITIONALLY A SLOW PERIOD FOR ORDERS, STRONG THIRD QUARTER ORDER RATES MITIGATED THE REDUCTION FOR THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS, BUT AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019 ORDERS TRAILED THE PRIOR YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION, A 7.3% REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE THE COMPANY INCREASED SELLING PRICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO RECOVER INCREASED COMMODITY AND OTHER COSTS INCURRED DURING 2018.  THE IMPACT OF THE PRICE INCREASE WAS NOT FULLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE SECOND QUARTER AS THE BEGINNING BACKLOG AT JANUARY 31, 2019 REFLECTED SELLING PRICES IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE PRICE INCREASE.  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IMPROVED TO 39.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 35.2% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE PRICE INCREASE DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD VARIANCES INCURRED WHEN PRODUCTION RATES DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME.  22  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $186,000 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES BY 1.7%.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY $312,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED SLIGHTLY MORE MONEY TO FINANCE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL SALES VOLUME IS SHIPPED IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE THROUGH AUGUST OF EACH YEAR.  THE COMPANY TRADITIONALLY MANUFACTURES LARGE QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF SEASONALLY HIGH SUMMER SHIPMENTS.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY FINANCES A LARGE BALANCE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DURING THE PEAK SEASON.  DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF THE THIRD QUARTER, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY REPAYS SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL BORROWED TO FINANCE THE SUMMER ACTIVITY.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY $4,504,000 FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO OCTOBER 31, 2019.  THIS COMPARES TO PRIOR YEAR WHEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GREW BY $12,896,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $6.6 MILLION LOWER AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 THAN AT OCTOBER 31, 2018 DUE TO LOWER THIRD QUARTER SALES.  THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS OFFSET IN PART BY A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNT PAYABLE.  FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS, THE COMPANY DECREASED INVENTORY BY APPROXIMATELY $4,382,000 AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2019.  THIS COMPARES TO AN INCREASE OF $613,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  INVENTORY AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS $238,000 GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE AN INCREASE IN VALUATION DUE TO INCREASED COMMODITY AND TARIFFS COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC BANK WERE HIGHER IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  CAPITAL SPENDING FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS $2,963,000 COMPARED TO $3,319,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE BEING FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC BANK AND OPERATING CASH FLOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY'S UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY WITH PNC BANK WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE OUTLINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU NO. 2016-02-  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND APPLYING THE TRANSITIONAL RELIEF ALLOWING ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS AT THE ADOPTION DATE BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS, OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION. AS MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE THE INTEREST RATE  23  ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS WITH SIMILAR TERMS AND PAYMENTS USING COMPANY SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREADS. THE COMPANY USES THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN READILY DETERMINABLE. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE USED IS 6.39%.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION AND $25.6 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019.

(THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cWE\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON JULY 16, 2009 AND HAS A FISCAL  YEAR END OF JANUARY 31. IT IS AN EXPLORATION-STAGE COMPANY.  GOING  CONCERN  TO  DATE THE COMPANY HAS NO OPERATIONS OR REVENUES AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. NO REVENUES ARE  ANTICIPATED UNTIL WE COMPLETE THE PLAN OF OPERATION DESCRIBED IN THIS FORM 10-Q AND IMPLEMENT OUR INITIAL BUSINESS PLAN. THE ABILITY  OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT ON RAISING CAPITAL TO FUND OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND ULTIMATELY TO ATTAIN  PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  OUR  ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN FINANCED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROCEEDS OF SHARE SUBSCRIPTIONS. FROM OUR INCEPTION TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE RAISED  A TOTAL OF $31,500 FROM PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE  COMPANY PLANS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY OFFERINGS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE  TO RAISE ANY CAPITAL THROUGH THIS OR ANY OTHER OFFERINGS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cUS  GAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT  ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING  VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES  UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TO  THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  BASIS  OF PRESENTATION  THE  COMPANY REPORTS REVENUES AND EXPENSES USING THE ACCRUAL METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY  ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) FOR FINANCIAL AND TAX REPORTING PURPOSES.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENT  THE  COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSLATION  THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION \u201cASC 830\u201d,  \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\u201d, FOREIGN DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO THEIR UNITED  STATES DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES WHICH PREVAILED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. NON-MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE TRANSLATED AT EXCHANGE RATES PREVAILING AT THE TRANSACTION DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE  DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. RELATED TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT,  WHEREAS GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  9  BASIC  AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE  BASIC  LOSS PER SHARE INCLUDES NO DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE  NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE LOSS PER SHARE REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF SECURITIES THAT  COULD SHARE IN THE LOSSES OF THE COMPANY.  BECAUSE  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES, THE ACCOMPANYING PRESENTATION IS ONLY OF BASIC LOSS PER SHARE.  PLAN  OF OPERATION  WE  ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS THROUGHOUT ASIA, EXPLORING FOR  COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES OF MINERALS, AND EXPLOITING ANY MINERAL DEPOSITS WE DISCOVER THAT DEMONSTRATE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY.  SINCE WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT COMMERCIALLY EXPLOITABLE RESERVES OF VALUABLE MINERALS EXIST  ON ANY PROPERTY THAT WE NOW OWN OR MAY OWN IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL NEED TO DO FURTHER EXPLORATION BEFORE A FINAL EVALUATION OF  THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR FUTURE EXPLORATION IS DETERMINED.  WE  ARE PRESENTLY SEEKING TO ACQUIRE MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS. SUCH RIGHTS WILL LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF AN OPTION ON PATENTED OR  UNPATENTED MINERAL CLAIMS PROSPECTIVE FOR PRECIOUS METALS OR ORE MINERALS IN ASIA. UPON ACQUIRING SUCH MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS,  WE WILL REQUIRE FINANCING TO EXPLORE THE UNDERLYING CLAIMS TO DETERMINE IF THEY CONTAIN COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES OF  PRECIOUS METALS OR ORE MINERALS. WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF SUCH EXPLORATION UNTIL WE KNOW THE SIZE AND LOCATION  OF THE PROPERTY LAND WITH UNDERLYING MINERAL RIGHTS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPLORATION COSTS WILL TYPICALLY CONSIST OF FEES TO BE  PAID FOR CONSULTING SERVICES CONNECTED WITH EXPLORATION, THE COST OF ROCK SAMPLING (THE COLLECTION OF A SERIES OF SMALL CHIPS  OVER A MEASURED DISTANCE, WHICH IS THEN SUBMITTED FOR A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, USUALLY TO DETERMINE THE METALLIC CONTENT OVER THE  SAMPLED INTERVAL, A PRE-DETERMINED LOCATION(S) ON THE PROPERTY), AND COST OF ANALYZING THESE SAMPLES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE A SUITABLE EXPLORATION PROPERTY, OR THAT IF WE DO, IT WILL CONTAIN COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES  OF MINERALS.  IF  WE DISCOVER SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF PRECIOUS METALS OR MINERAL ORES ON ANY PROPERTY UNDERLYING OUR MINERAL RIGHTS, WE WILL BEGIN  TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO DETERMINE IF WE HAVE RESERVES. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF SUCH  FEASIBILITY STUDIES UNTIL WE KNOW THE SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE PROPERTY. WE WILL ONLY CONSIDER DEVELOPING A PROPERTY IF WE HAVE  PROVEN RESERVES OF PRECIOUS METALS OR MINERAL ORES THAT CAN BE PROFITABLY EXTRACTED.  ANY  WORK THAT WOULD BE CONDUCTED ON A PROPERTY WOULD BE CONDUCTED BY UNAFFILIATED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT WE WILL HIRE. THE INDEPENDENT  CONTRACTORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, ENGINEERING, EXPLORATION, AND EXCAVATION. THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AND  GEOLOGISTS WE ENGAGE WILL EVALUATE THE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE EXPLORATION AND EXCAVATION, AND WILL ADVISE US ON THE ECONOMIC  FEASIBILITY OF REMOVING THE MINERALIZED MATERIAL.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  WE  RECORDED NO REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. FROM THE PERIOD OF JULY 16, 2009 (INCEPTION)  TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE RECORDED NO REVENUES.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $3,534, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $1,696. FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $10,870, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $5,088.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $4,843, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $1,500. FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $10,129, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $4,600.  FROM  THE PERIOD OF JULY 16, 2009 (INCEPTION) TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE INCURRED OPERATING EXPENSES OF $255,123.  10  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE HAD NO CASH BALANCE. WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH ON HAND TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND  12 MONTHS. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE FUNDS TO COMMENCE OUR EXPLORATION PROGRAM AND FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. ADDITIONAL  FUNDING WILL LIKELY COME FROM EQUITY FINANCING FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR SALE OF PART OF OUR INTEREST IN OUR MINERAL  CLAIMS. IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING AN EQUITY FINANCING, EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF THEIR INTEREST  IN OUR COMPANY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE  TO RAISE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO FUND OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES AND ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.  IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH FINANCING, OUR BUSINESS WILL LIKELY FAIL. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FURTHER  SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O  F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES LISTED BELOW INVOLVE OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) UNDER PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AS FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MAY 1, 2019, AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING AREAS.  \u2022  REVENUE RECOGNITION;  \u2022  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS;  \u2022  INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS;  \u2022  PATENT LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES; AND  \u2022  DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR COMPANY  WE ARE A TELEMATICS PIONEER LEADING TRANSFORMATION IN A MOBILE CONNECTED ECONOMY. WE HELP REINVENT BUSINESSES AND IMPROVE LIVES AROUND THE GLOBE WITH TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT STREAMLINE COMPLEX INTERNET OF THINGS (\u201cIOT\u201d) DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS AND DERIVED DATA INTELLIGENCE. OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, SCALABLE CLOUD SERVICES, AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES COLLECT AND ASSESS BUSINESS-CRITICAL DATA FROM MOBILE ASSETS AND THEIR CONTENTS. OUR BUSINESS IS ORGANIZED INTO TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TELEMATICS SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT OUR CEO, THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\u201cCODM\u201d), USES TO EVALUATE AND OPERATE THE BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CUSTOMER BASE, HOMOGENEITY OF PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THESE TWO SEGMENTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW.  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF TRACKER NETWORK (UK) LIMITED (\u201cTRACKER UK\u201d), A LOJACK LICENSEE AND A MARKET LEADER IN  STOLEN VEHICLE RECOVERY  (\u201cSVR\u201d) TELEMATICS SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM, FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $13.1 MILLION. ON MARCH 19, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CAR TRACK, S.A. DE C.V. (\u201cLOJACK MEXICO\u201d), THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE OF LOJACK TECHNOLOGY FOR THE MEXICAN MARKET. WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 87.5% OF THE LOJACK MEXICO SHARES THAT WE DID NOT OWN FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $14.3 MILLION. ON APRIL 12, 2019, WE ACQUIRED SYNOVIA SOLUTIONS LLC (\u201cSYNOVIA\u201d), A NORTH AMERICAN MARKET LEADER IN FLEET SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT FOR K-12 SCHOOL BUS AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FLEETS FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $49.8 MILLION. COMBINED WITH THE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK AND LOJACK MEXICO, THE SYNOVIA ACQUISITION EXPANDS OUR FLEET MANAGEMENT AND VEHICLE SAFETY SERVICES PORTFOLIO AND ACCELERATES OUR TRANSFORMATION TO HIGH-VALUE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICES. SEE NOTE 2 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.  TELEMATICS SYSTEMS  OUR TELEMATICS SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS A SERIES OF ADVANCED TELEMATICS AND SVR PRODUCTS FOR THE BROADER CONNECTED VEHICLE MARKETPLACE, WHICH ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO OPTIMIZE THEIR OPERATIONS BY COLLECTING, MONITORING AND EFFECTIVELY REPORTING BUSINESS-CRITICAL INFORMATION AND DESIRED INTELLIGENCE FROM HIGH-VALUE REMOTE AND MOBILE ASSETS. OUR TELEMATICS PRODUCTS INCLUDE ASSET TRACKING UNITS, MOBILE TELEMATICS DEVICES, MOBILE GATEWAYS, AND ROUTERS. THESE WIRELESS NETWORKING DEVICES UNDERPIN A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS, AND ARE IDEAL FOR APPLICATIONS DEMANDING SECURE, RELIABLE AND BUSINESS-CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT OFFERS CLOUD-BASED APPLICATION ENABLEMENT AND TELEMATICS SERVICE PLATFORMS THAT FACILITATE INTEGRATION OF OUR OWN APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (\u201cAPIS\u201d) TO DELIVER FULL-FEATURED MOBILE IOT SOLUTIONS TO A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS. OUR SCALABLE PROPRIETARY APPLICATIONS AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ENABLE RAPID AND COST-EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE  . EFFECTIVE AS OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANSACTION DATES, OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, BECAME COMPONENTS OF THIS SEGMENT (SEE NOTE 2).  26  ADJUSTED EBITDA  IN ADDITION TO OUR U.S. GAAP RESULTS, WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), BALANCE SHEETS OR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS EARNINGS BEFORE INVESTMENT INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSES, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, NON-CASH COSTS AND EXPENSES ARISING FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, LITIGATION PROVISION, GAIN FROM LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. OUR CEO, THE CODM, USES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO EVALUATE AND MONITOR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE AND HAVE THEREFORE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO INVESTORS FOR A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS OF COMPARISON TO HELP INVESTORS EVALUATE OUR RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS AND ENABLE MORE MEANINGFUL PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. PURSUANT TO THE RULE AND REGULATIONS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.  SEE NOTE 17 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND RECONCILIATION TO NET INCOME (LOSS).

THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SALE VOLUME IN THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES INCLUDING MRM TELEMATICS, OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS AND LEGACY LOJACK SVR PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE IN MRM TELEMATICS PRODUCTS SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES VOLUME TO A FEW LARGER CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR LARGEST OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS CUSTOMER WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRODUCT LINE TRANSITION AND ALSO COMMENCING THE ROLLOUT OF THE INITIAL PHASE OF A 3G-TO-4G LTE RETROFIT PROGRAM. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO BE TEMPORARY AND TO BE OFFSET BY DEMANDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AS THE 3G NETWORK SUNSET BECOMES MORE IMMINENT. LEGACY LOJACK US SVR REVENUE CONTINUES TO DECLINE DUE TO A TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION FROM PROPRIETARY RADIO FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY TO GPS-BASED TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO CONTINUE BUT BE OFFSET TO A DEGREE OVER TIME BY REVENUES FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS SUREDRIVE AND LOTSMART WITHIN OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED BY $13.5 MILLION OR 67.5% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE THREE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, COUPLED WITH GROWTH IN LOJACK ITALY.

THE INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR TERMS WAS DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE AND GROSS PROFITS IN THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  27  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN  DECREASED BY  29  0  BASIS  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  GROSS MARGIN FOR TELEMATIC  S  SYSTEMS  DECREASED TO  33.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  , 2019  FROM 38.3% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2018.  GROSS MARGIN  WAS IMPACTED  PRINCIPALLY BY PRODUCT MIX COUPLED WITH  INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR EXCESS  AND  OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND UNFAVORABLE  MANUFACTURING VARIANCES AS WE PROCEED WITH THE CLOSURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY  IN OXNARD, CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS.  GROSS MARGIN FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  WAS  47.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  , 2019  COMPARED TO  50.6%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS THE GROSS  PROFIT  WAS  IMPACTED  BY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST OF REVENUES ABOVE EXCLUDES THE RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS, WHICH IS SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATION STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SOLD THROUGH THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES CHANNELS.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSE INCREASED BY $1.9 MILLION OR 15.2% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $2.6 MILLION OR 21.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-RECURRING LEGAL MATTERS. WE BEGAN PARTIAL OPERATIONS ON OUR NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\u201cERP\u201d) SYSTEM IN JUNE 2019, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ON OUR NEW ERP SYSTEM WERE CAPITALIZED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WE COMMENCED A PLAN TO CAPTURE CERTAIN SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS RELATED TO STREAMLINING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND SALES ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS RATIONALIZE CERTAIN LEASED PROPERTIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY VACANT. WE INCURRED ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR THIS INITIATIVE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. TOTAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS DECREASED $0.4 MILLION OR 32% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO PERSONNEL CHARGES. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION OR 14.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO THE ADDITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED BY $0.3 MILLION TO $1.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $1.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME ON RABBI TRUST ASSETS THAT SERVE TO INFORMALLY FUND OUR NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN DURING THE PERIOD.  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY $0.1 MILLION TO $5.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $5.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER STATED INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS THAT RESULTED FROM THE REPURCHASE OF THE 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNT OF DUE TO FACTORS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A $2.5 MILLION GAIN FROM THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH A FORMER SUPPLIER OF LOJACK. THE FINAL PAYMENT ON THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WAS RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  28  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.4 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $94.9 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2019.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.2 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  OVERALL PROFITABILITY MEASURES  NET INCOME (LOSS).  GAAP-BASIS NET LOSS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $7.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $0.5 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE $6.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IS DUE TO THE OPERATING LOSS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND A $2.4 MILLION LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.

THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SALE VOLUME IN THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES INCLUDING MRM TELEMATICS, OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS AND LEGACY LOJACK SVR PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE IN MRM TELEMATICS PRODUCTS SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES VOLUME TO A FEW LARGER CUSTOMERS INCLUDING SYNOVIA SOLUTIONS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN IN APRIL 2019, AND IS NOW CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT. THE DECREASE IN OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR LARGEST OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS CUSTOMER WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRODUCT LINE TRANSITION AND ALSO COMMENCING THE ROLLOUT OF THE INITIAL PHASE OF A 3G-TO-4G LTE RETROFIT PROGRAM. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO BE TEMPORARY AND TO BE OFFSET BY DEMANDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AS THE 3G NETWORK SUNSET BECOMES MORE IMMINENT. LEGACY LOJACK SVR REVENUE CONTINUED ITS SECULAR DECLINE DUE TO A TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION FROM PROPRIETARY RADIO FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY TO GPS-BASED TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO CONTINUE BUT BE OFFSET TO A DEGREE OVER TIME BY REVENUES FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS SUREDRIVE AND LOTSMART WITHIN OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED BY $32.7 MILLION OR 57.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE THREE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, COUPLED WITH GROWTH IN LOJACK ITALY.  29  GROSS PROFIT BY SEGMENT  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  $% OF REVENUE  $% OF REVENUE  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  SEGMENT  TELEMATICS SYSTEMS  $70,277  37.2%  $86,189  38.8%  $(15,912  )  (18.5%)  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  39,688  44.0%  28,104  48.9%  11,584  41.2%  GROSS PROFIT  $109,965  39.4%  $114,293  40.9%  $(4,328  )  (3.8%)  CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT DECREASED BY $4.3 MILLION OR 3.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR TERMS WAS DUE TO LOWER REVENUE IN THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN DECREASED BY 150 BASIS POINTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 40.9% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FROM THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS. OUR GROSS MARGIN PERFORMANCE WAS IMPACTED PRINCIPALLY BY PRODUCT MIX COUPLED WITH INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING VARIANCES AS WE PROCEED WITH THE CLOSURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN OXNARD, CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS. GROSS MARGIN FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES DECREASED TO 44.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 48.9% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AS GROSS PROFIT IS IMPACTED BY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST OF REVENUES ABOVE EXCLUDES THE RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS, WHICH IS SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATION STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SOLD THROUGH THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES CHANNELS.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSE INCREASED BY $7.4 MILLION OR 19.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED BY $7.5 MILLION OR 20.2% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND INCREASES IN LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS AND CERTAIN NON-RECURRING LEGAL MATTERS. WE BEGAN PARTIAL OPERATIONS ON THE NEW ERP SYSTEM IN JUNE 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ON OUR NEW ERP SYSTEM WERE CAPITALIZED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE INCURRED AN ADDITIONAL $3.1 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO THE COST SAVINGS PLAN THAT COMMENCED IN MAY 2018. TOTAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS DECREASED $2.1 MILLION OR 40% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO VACANT OFFICE AND MANUFACTURING PLANT FACILITIES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE PARTIALLY VACATED THESE FACILITIES AND RECORDED A COST OF $2.7 MILLION. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE FULLY VACATED CERTAIN OFFICES, WHICH RESULTED IN A COST OF $1.2 MILLION. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  30  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  INCREASED  BY  $1.1 MILLION  OR  13.5%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO  THE  ADDITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO DIVIDEND INCOME WE RECEIVED FROM LOJACK MEXICO AND A GAIN AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 FROM THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF OUR PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN LOJACK MEXICO.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $16.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $11.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2025 CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED IN JULY 2018 AND AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNT OF DUE TO FACTORS.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A $15.8 MILLION GAIN FROM THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH A FORMER SUPPLIER OF LOJACK. THE FINAL PAYMENT ON THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WAS RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.4 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $94.9 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2019.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.0 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $53.8 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN JULY 2018.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $26 THOUSAND AND INCREASED FROM AN EXPENSE OF $0.7 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN FAVORABLE SHIFT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES INCREASED BY $3.7 MILLION OR 37.0% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  SEE NOTE 17 FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND A RECONCILIATION TO GAAP-BASIS NET INCOME (LOSS).  INCOME TAX PROVISION  WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (\u201cETR\u201d) ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BASED ON CURRENT AND FORECASTED OPERATING RESULTS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT AND OUR PRETAX BOOK INCOME OR LOSS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL LEVEL OF PRETAX BOOK INCOME OR LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BLEND OF JURISDICTIONAL INCOME OR LOSS THAT IS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR ETR MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY MAKE QUARTERLY COMPARISONS LESS THAN MEANINGFUL.  31  AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  $6.2  MILLION WAS RECORDED FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  ,  COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $0.5 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY  A PRE-TAX LOSS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND A REVERSAL OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME DISCRETE TAX CHARGE RELATED TO NET EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION \u201cSHORTFALLS\u201d AND A RESTRUCTURING OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS DURIN  G THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 21.4% AND 5.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $25.8 MILLION IN U.S. NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. THE NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $7.8 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION OF FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND APPROXIMATELY $11.3 MILLION AND $7.4 MILLION FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDITS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS CAN BE USED TO REDUCE OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE IN FUTURE PERIODS. MANY OF THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TAX CREDITS WILL EXPIRE IF THEY ARE NOT USED WITHIN CERTAIN PERIODS. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE INCOME AND CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT OUR NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE UTILIZED BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT IS REQUIRED ON OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CONSISTENT WITH FISCAL 2019, OUR PRIMARY RECURRING CASH NEEDS HAVE BEEN FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR REVENUES, THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. OUR IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE $103.6 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $50 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REPURCHASED $95 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. WE EXPECT TO SETTLE THE $27.6 MILLION REMAINING 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE MAY 2020 WITH CASH. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS WITH CASH ON HAND AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  ON MARCH 30, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THAT PROVIDES FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION. THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES ON MARCH 30, 2020 AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSION WITH J.P. MORGAN TO EXTEND THE TERM FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS. AT OUR ELECTION, THE BORROWINGS UNDER THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A LIBOR-BASED VARIABLE RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN, OR AT THE GREATER OF THE PRIME RATE, THE NYFRB RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE AND A ONE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED VARIABLE RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), IN EACH CASE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR SENIOR LEVERAGE RATIO FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LEVEL OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NONCASH CHARGES (EBITDA) AND MINIMUM DEBT COVERAGE RATIOS. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ACQUIRED TRACKER UK FOR $13.1 MILLION. IN MARCH 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF 87.5% LOJACK MEXICO SHARES FOR $14.3 MILLION. IN APRIL 2019, WE ACQUIRED SYNOVIA FOR $49.8 MILLION. WE FUNDED THESE ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND. AS PART OF THE SYNOVIA ACQUISITION, WE ASSUMED THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS FROM THE SYNOVIA REVENUE ASSIGNMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7. THE REVENUES RECOGNIZED FROM THIS ARRANGEMENT OF $5.0 MILLION WERE CONSIDERED A NON-CASH FINANCING ACTIVITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THE OMEGA PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM, INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND CONTRACT DISPUTES IN WHICH THE FINAL RESOLUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MATTERS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER SETTLEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 18, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OF THE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR NET INCOME (LOSS) AS WELL AS HOW WELL WE MANAGE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH IS DICTATED BY THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS WE PURCHASE FROM OUR MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS AND THEN SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS ALONG WITH THE PAYMENT AND COLLECTION TERMS THAT WE NEGOTIATE WITH THEM.  WE PURCHASE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS LOCATED IN ASIA, THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE US 60-DAY PAYMENT TERMS FOR PRODUCTS PURCHASED. WE ARE CURRENTLY RELIANT UPON THESE SUPPLIERS FOR PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN OBTAIN PRODUCTS FROM OTHER SOURCES, THE LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PURCHASED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON SIMILAR TERMS FROM ANOTHER SUPPLIER.  OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMERS ARE VERY GOOD AND THAT THESE CUSTOMERS ARE IN GOOD FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE GENERALLY GRANT CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND OUR HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. WE TYPICALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT FROM THEM WITHIN 30 TO 45 DAYS OF OUR INVOICE DATE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT EXTEND THE CREDIT TERMS UPTO 90 DAYS.  32  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.3 MILLION AND NET LOSS WAS $23.5 MILLION. OUR NON-CASH EXPENSES, COMPRISED PRINCIPALLY OF DEPRECIATION, INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS, AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES TOTALED $44.4 MILLION. THESE NON-CASH EXPENSES ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH REVENUES OF $5.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE SYNOVIA REVENUE ASSIGNMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND $2.4 MILLION LOSSES INCURRED FROM REPURCHASE OF THE 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, RESULTED IN A $15.0 MILLION CASH OUTFLOW, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, AND DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $48.1 MILLION.

CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED A $5.6 MILLION SOURCE OF CASH, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND DECREASE IN INVENTORY BUT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSE AND DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THE INCREASES IN OUR WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $62.3 MILLION AND $17.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IS ONE OF THE LEADING U.S. MANUFACTURERS WITH A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF RECREATION VEHICLES (\"RV\"S) AND MARINE PRODUCTS USED PRIMARILY IN LEISURE TRAVEL AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITIES. WE PRODUCE OUR MOTORHOME UNITS IN IOWA AND INDIANA; OUR TOWABLE UNITS IN INDIANA; AND OUR MARINE UNITS IN FLORIDA. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RV AND MARINE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER. WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR MARINE PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER.  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION  THIS MD&A INCLUDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (\"GAAP\"), AS WELL AS CERTAIN ADJUSTED OR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN ORDER TO PRESENT COMPARABLE RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  FOR A DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF ITEMS THAT IMPACTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECT OF NON-RECURRING TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE REPORTED PERIODS AND TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS WHEN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED FAIR-VALUE INVENTORY STEP-UP, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND NON-OPERATING INCOME.  MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (A) TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS AND PEERS; (B) TO MEASURE OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS; (C) IN PRESENTATIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ENABLE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT BASIS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS ASSESSMENTS OF PERFORMANCE AND IN FORECASTING AND BUDGETING FOR OUR COMPANY; (D) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (E) TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS AND RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  NEWMAR CORPORATION  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR CORPORATION, DUTCH REAL ESTATE CORP, NEW-WAY TRANSPORT, AND NEW-SERV (COLLECTIVELY \"NEWMAR\") FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $360.3 MILLION  , WHICH CONSISTED OF  $267.7 MILLION  IN CASH, SUBJECT TO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS STIPULATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND  2.0 MILLION  SHARES OF WINNEBAGO COMMON STOCK THAT WERE VALUED AT  $92.6 MILLION  (  $46.29  PER SHARE DISCOUNTED AT  7.0%  DUE TO LACK OF MARKETABILITY BECAUSE OF ONE YEAR LOCK-UP RESTRICTIONS). THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\")  (AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9  ,  LONG-TERM DEBT  ) AND CASH ON HAND. NEWMAR IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF CLASS A AND SUPER C  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MOTORIZED RECREATION VEHICLES THAT ARE SOLD THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AUTHORIZED DEALERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  WE HAVE SIX OPERATING SEGMENTS: 1) GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES, 2) WINNEBAGO TOWABLES, 3) WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES, 4) NEWMAR MOTORHOMES, 5) CHRIS-CRAFT MARINE, AND 6) WINNEBAGO SPECIALTY VEHICLES. WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE BASED ON EACH OPERATING SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BELOW, WHICH EXCLUDES CERTAIN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OUR  TWO  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS INCLUDE: 1) TOWABLE (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WHICH ARE NOT MOTORIZED AND ARE GENERALLY TOWED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES AND THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES OPERATING SEGMENTS AND 2) MOTORHOME (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE A MOTORIZED CHASSIS AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES AND NEWMAR MOTORHOMES OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS SHIPMENTS FOR  2019  AND  2018  REFLECT A CONTRACTION IN SHIPMENTS AS DEALERS HAVE RATIONALIZED INVENTORY DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS RETAIL INFORMATION FOR  2019  AND  2018  ILLUSTRATES THAT RETAIL SALES REMAIN AT HEALTHY LEVELS. WE BELIEVE RETAIL DEMAND IS THE KEY DRIVER TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY.

THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES EXPANSION PROJECT CONSISTED OF THREE NEW PRODUCTION FACILITIES--TWO WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2018 AND THE REMAINING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED MID-FISCAL 2020. THE FACILITY EXPANSION IN THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES DIVISION WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\"ERP\") SYSTEM TO REPLACE OUR LEGACY BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. THE NEW ERP PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR OUR CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. OUR INITIAL COST ESTIMATES HAVE GROWN FOR ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE ERP SYSTEM WITH ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, EXTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE, AND INCREASED INTERNAL STAFFING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE COST WILL BE EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD INCURRED AND 60% WILL BE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS PURSUANT TO PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY IS TO FIRST FUND OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, MAINTAIN A DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN OUR TARGETED ZONE, MAINTAIN REASONABLE LIQUIDITY, AND THEN RETURN EXCESS CASH OVER TIME TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  ON  OCTOBER 18, 2017  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF  $70.0 MILLION  . THERE IS NO TIME RESTRICTION ON THE AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE IF SHARE REPURCHASES REFLECT A PRUDENT USE OF OUR CAPITAL AND, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES IN THE FUTURE. AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAVE  $58.9 MILLION  REMAINING ON OUR BOARD REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM (\u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON MAY 7, 1975, UNDER THE NAME VITA PLUS, INC. THE NAME WAS LATER CHANGED TO VITA PLUS INDUSTRIES, INC. AND IN 2000 THE COMPANY\u2019S NAME WAS CHANGED TO ITS CURRENT NAME PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM.  EFFECTIVE JUNE 28, 2019 (\u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), A FURTHER CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY, METROWORK EQUITY SDN. BHD (\u201cSELLER\u201d), AND COPPER HILL ASSETS INC., A BRITISH VIRGIN ISLAND CORPORATION (\u201cBUYER\u201d) (THE \u201cPURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d), SELLER ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED AND CONVEYED TO BUYER (I) 1,563,809 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF COMPANY (\u201cCOMMON STOCK\u201d) AND (II) A PROMISSORY NOTE OF THE COMPANY TOTALING $355,323.48 (\u201cPROMISSORY NOTE\u201d). THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID BY BUYER WAS $375,000, AND SELLER ASSUMED ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE CLOSING DATE.  ON THE CLOSING OF THE ABOVE TRANSACTION, MR. CHEE CHAU NG, THE SOLE OFFICER OF SELLER, RESIGNED IN ALL OFFICER CAPACITIES FROM THE COMPANY AND ANTHONY LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE UPON THE 10TH DAY AFTER THE MAILING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INFORMATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14F-1 (THE \u201cSCHEDULE 14F-1\u201d) TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS (THE \u201cAPPOINTMENT DATE\u201d), MR. NG RESIGNED AS A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. ON THAT SAME DATE, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY.  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 33.33% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF AUSTRALIAN GOLD COMMODITIES LTD (\u201cACG\u201d), AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY, FOR $100. THE REMAINING 66.67% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF ACG ARE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER, COPPER HILL ASSETS, INC. MR. ANTHONY LOCOCO, OUR SOLE DIRECTOR, WAS APPOINTED AS A DIRECTOR OF ACG. ACG HAS NOT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AS OF THIS DATE.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2019, THE COMPANY FORMED A NEW SUBSIDIARY, PARAMOUNT CAPITAL, INC (\u201cPARAMOUNT\u201d), A WYOMING CORPORATION. PARAMOUNT HAS NOT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AS OF THIS DATE.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN CONVERSION AGREEMENT WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER, COPPER HILL, UNDER WHICH COPPER HILL CONVERTED ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF $372,823 WITH THE COMPANY INTO 5,000,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)  FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)  INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS $100 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED. CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE. IT IS MANAGEMENT\u2019 S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $38,999, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING CONSULTING FEES TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

REVENUES  RECORDED IN THE CURRENT  PERIOD FOR LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (\u201cPROJECT(S)\u201d) WERE 10% LESS THAN THE LEVEL  RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WE HAD 33 PROJECTS IN PROCESS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED WITH 34 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST  YEAR. REVENUES RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR OTHER-THAN LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (NON-PROJECTS) WERE 32% LESS THAN  THE LEVEL RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL SALES WITHIN THE U.S. DECREASED 20% FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. TOTAL SALES TO  ASIA DECREASED 39% FROM THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SALES DECREASES WERE RECORDED OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR TO CUSTOMERS  INVOLVED IN CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES (20%), AS WELL AS IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE (25%). THERE WAS  AN INCREASE IN SALES TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS (12%). THE NEGATIVE FLUCTUATION IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE SALES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ALL  OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND IS DUE TO THE NATURAL DELIVERY CYCLE OF MATURE MILITARY AND AEROSPACE PRODUCTS THAT INHERENTLY  HAVE TEMPORARY GAPS IN THEIR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AS WELL AS ACCOMMODATING CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR EARLIER DELIVERIES PRIOR TO LAST  QUARTER. THIS YTD DECREASE ACCOUNTED FOR HALF OF THE DROP IN DOMESTIC SALES. RECENTLY DEVELOPED OPPORTUNITIES IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE  ASSISTED IN MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT. SHIPMENTS ON CURRENT SALES ORDERS FOR CUSTOMERS IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE RESUMED, AS  SCHEDULED, IN THE SECOND QUARTER. DECREASES IN REVENUE FROM SALES TO CONSTRUCTION CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR THE YTD DROP IN SALES  TO ASIA, ALL OCCURRING IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AS WELL AS HALF OF THE YTD DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES, NEARLY ALL OCCURRING IN THE  SECOND QUARTER. ASIAN SALES ARE HINDERED BY TARIFFS AS WELL AS STRONG COMPETITION FROM LOCAL MANUFACTURERS. THE DECREASE IN SALES  TO DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED DELAYS IN THE START OF VARIOUS PROJECTS. COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES  USED IN DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION WITH LOWER INITIAL-COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS  IN NEW BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS CONTINUE TO ENACT PERFORMANCE BASED DESIGN LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE A BUILDING TO BE ABLE TO BE  OCCUPIED FOLLOWING A SIGNIFICANT SEISMIC EVENT. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND DEMAND FOR THEM  WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE FOLLOWING SUCH AN UPGRADE IN DOMESTIC BUILDING CODES.  THE GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE  OF 32% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 27% RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN GROSS  PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED MARGINS REALIZED ON DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MADE  TO THREE GENERAL GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS: INDUSTRIAL, CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE / DEFENSE.

STOCK OPTIONS  THE COMPANY HAS A STOCK OPTION PLAN WHICH PROVIDES  FOR THE GRANTING OF NONQUALIFIED OR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS TO OFFICERS, KEY EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. OPTIONS GRANTED  UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXERCISABLE OVER A TEN YEAR TERM. OPTIONS NOT EXERCISED AT THE END OF THE TERM EXPIRE.  -  12  -  THE  COMPANY EXPENSES STOCK OPTIONS USING THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF THE FASB ASC. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $55,000 AND  $57,000 OF COMPENSATION COST FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND  2018.  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT HAS  BEEN DETERMINED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO EXERCISE PRICE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY,  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED  IN THE MODEL WERE BASED ON VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE FOR THE THIRTY MONTH PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS DERIVED FROM THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD. THE COMPANY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM.  THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN THE  BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

APPROXIMATELY 82% OF THE CURRENT INVENTORY IS WORK  IN PROCESS, 2% IS FINISHED GOODS, AND 16% IS RAW MATERIALS.  MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INVENTORY REPRESENT STOCK  THAT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MONTHS. THIS STOCK REPRESENTS CERTAIN ITEMS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED  TO MAINTAIN FOR SERVICE OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ITEMS THAT ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS ORDERING. THIS INVENTORY IS PARTICULARLY  SENSITIVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO ITS USE IN INDUSTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION  OF NEW PRODUCT LINES, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE  FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE. THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE WAS $90,000 AND $85,000 FOR THE SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REWORK SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY, WHERE APPLICABLE, TO CONVERT IT  TO PRODUCT TO BE USED ON CUSTOMER ORDERS.

AS THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FIGURE RISES IN RELATION TO THE OTHER TWO FIGURES, THE COMPANY CAN ANTICIPATE  INCREASED CASH RECEIPTS WITHIN THE ENSUING 30-60 DAYS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $6,348,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2019 INCLUDES $110,000 OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (\u201cALLOWANCE\u201d). THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE AS  OF MAY 31, 2019 OF $5,279,000 INCLUDED AN ALLOWANCE OF $110,000.  -  14  -  THE  NUMBER OF AN AVERAGE DAY'S SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cDSO\u201d) INCREASED FROM 53 DAYS AT MAY 31, 2019  TO 74 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  THE DSO IS A FUNCTION OF 1.) THE LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY (FOR EXAMPLE, TOTAL SALES  FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS DIVIDED BY 90 DAYS) AND 2.) THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE LEVEL OF  SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS 15% LESS THAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER IS 20% MORE THAN THE LEVEL AT THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMBINED WITH THE DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF AN AVERAGE DAY\u2019S SALES CAUSED  THE DSO TO INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BILLINGS FOR PROJECTS IN NOVEMBER 2019 ($4.4 MILLION) COMPARED  TO MAY 2019 ($2.6 MILLION). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, CIEB REPRESENTS REVENUES RECOGNIZED  IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS BILLED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATES A PROVISION IN SALES CONTRACTS TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BILL,  AND COLLECT FROM THE CUSTOMER, PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF SHIPMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN NOT POSSIBLE. THE $3,050,000  BALANCE IN THIS ACCOUNT AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019 IS 60% LESS THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END BALANCE. THIS DECREASE IS THE RESULT OF NORMAL  FLOW OF THE PROJECTS THROUGH PRODUCTION WITH BILLINGS TO THE CUSTOMERS AS PERMITTED IN THE RELATED CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. 71% OF THE CIEB BALANCE AS OF THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL QUARTER, AUGUST  31, 2019, WAS BILLED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. THE REMAINDER WILL BE BILLED AS  THE PROJECTS PROGRESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS.  THE BALANCES IN THIS ACCOUNT ARE COMPRISED  OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AT $1,931,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2019, IS 38% MORE THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MATERIAL PURCHASES  IN NOVEMBER 2019 OVER MAY 2019 IN ORDER TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS. COMMISSION EXPENSE ON APPLICABLE SALES ORDERS  IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMMISSION IS PAID FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FROM THE CUSTOMERS.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SUMMARIZES THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THE CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CASH FLOWS OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE DATES AND FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED BELOW. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT. THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON THE BELIEFS OF OUR MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY, AND INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO, OUR MANAGEMENT. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN OR IMPLIED BY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. SEE \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\u201d  OVERVIEW  EXPRESS IS A LEADING FASHION BRAND FOR WOMEN AND MEN. SINCE 1980, EXPRESS HAS PROVIDED THE LATEST APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD A WARDROBE FOR EVERY OCCASION, OFFERING FASHION AND QUALITY AT AN ATTRACTIVE VALUE. THE COMPANY OPERATES MORE THAN 600 RETAIL AND FACTORY OUTLET STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND PUERTO RICO, AS WELL AS AN ONLINE DESTINATION.  Q3 2019 VS. Q3 2018  \u2022  NET SALES DECREASED 5.1% TO $488.5 MILLION  \u2022  COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 5%  \u2022  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES (INCLUDES BOTH RETAIL STORES AND E-COMMERCE SALES) DECREASED 5%  \u2022  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES DECREASED 5%  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE DECREASED 250 BASIS POINTS TO 28.2%  \u2022  OPERATING (LOSS)/INCOME DECREASED $16.9 MILLION TO A LOSS OF $6.7 MILLION  \u2022  NET (LOSS)/INCOME DECREASED $11.1 MILLION TO A LOSS OF  $3.1 MILLION  \u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) DECREASED $0.16 TO A LOSS OF $0.05  THE FOLLOWING CHARTS SHOW KEY PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUTLOOK & THIRD QUARTER UPDATE  AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE WILL BE FOCUSED ON FOUR FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS: PRODUCT, BRAND, CUSTOMER AND EXECUTION. WHILE WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS TO REMAIN CHALLENGING IN THE NEAR-TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT BY FOCUSING ON THESE FOUNDATIONAL ELEMENTS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE TREND OF THE BUSINESS AND RETURN THE BUSINESS TO LONG TERM PROFITABLE GROWTH. THE FOLLOWING DEFINES EACH AREA AND PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON EACH PRIORITY FOR THE THIRD QUARTER.  PRODUCT  EXPRESS WAS ONCE SEEN AS A FASHION AUTHORITY AND A TRUSTED RESOURCE TO HELP CUSTOMERS BUILD THEIR WARDROBE. WE\u2019VE LOST SOME OF THAT CREDIBILITY DUE TO PRODUCT MISSES. WHILE THERE ARE AREAS OF STRENGTH IN OUR WOMEN\u2019S AND MEN\u2019S ASSORTMENT, WE NEED TO BE WINNING IN KEY CATEGORIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED AND TAKEN ACTION IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS DURING THE QUARTER.  \u2022  WOMEN\u2019S TOP  S. WE\u2019VE HAD TOO MUCH DEPTH IN OLDER KEY ITEMS AND NOT ENOUGH BREADTH AND STYLE DIVERSITY. WE ARE CONDUCTING TESTS TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF OPTIMIZING OUR TOPS ASSORTMENT BY ADDING DIFFERENT COLORS, FABRICS, PRINTS AND SILHOUETTES AND WILL APPLY THESE LEARNINGS GOING FORWARD.  \u2022  SPEED TO MARKET.  IN ORDER TO MOVE FASTER AND GET MORE NEWNESS IN OUR ASSORTMENT, WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED A NEW INSTABUY PROCESS FOR BOTH WOMEN\u2019S AND MEN\u2019S. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE RE-ENGINEERED OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CALENDAR TO ENSURE WE CAN DELIVER MORE NEWNESS, MORE OFTEN.  \u2022  PRODUCT CATEGORIZATION.  WE ARE RETHINKING THE BRAND\u2019S TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO CATEGORIZING OUR PRODUCT INTO FOUR LIFESTYLES BASED ON WEARING OCCASIONS. OUR FLOORSETS NOW REFLECT A MORE EDITED, INTEGRATED, MODERN APPROACH AND PROVIDE MORE INSPIRATION FOR THE CUSTOMER. MOVING FORWARD WE WILL OFFER MORE VERSATILITY TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN BUILDING THEIR WARDROBES.  BRAND  WE BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY OUR BRAND PURPOSE AND MESSAGE AND MORE CLOSELY CONNECT IT TO OUR PRODUCT STRATEGY TO TELL OUR STORY IN A MORE POWERFUL AND CONSISTENT WAY. WE HAVE BEGUN WORK AROUND THE ARTICULATION OF OUR BRAND AS WELL AS ENGAGING OUR CUSTOMERS IN DIFFERENT AND MORE IMPACTFUL WAYS.  CUSTOMER  WE NEED TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE AT RETAINING EXISTING CUSTOMERS AND ATTRACTING NEW ONES. WE ARE USING A MARKETING MIX MODEL TOOL TO ASSESS WHERE WE ARE SPENDING OUR MARKETING DOLLARS AND WHICH CHANNELS DELIVER THE BEST RETURN ON INVESTMENT AND WE ARE ALSO USING MULTI-TOUCH ATTRIBUTION TOOL TO EVALUATE THE REAL-TIME PERFORMANCE OF OUR IN-MARKET MESSAGES AND TRACK THE CUSTOMER\u2019S JOURNEY TO PURCHASE, BOTH ONLINE AND OFFLINE. IN ADDITION, WE ARE ENHANCING OUR CUSTOMER CONTACT STRATEGY WITH A MORE PERSONALIZED APPROACH TO EMAIL AND UTILIZING ADVANCED ANALYTICS TO HELP DRIVE CUSTOMER RETENTION.  EXECUTION  WE NEED TO DELIVER A BETTER AND MORE CONSISTENT EXPERIENCE ACROSS CHANNELS, AND WE MUST REDUCE OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES, RIGHT SIZING OUR EXPENSES AND FINALIZING OUR FLEET RATIONALIZATION PLANS. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BRICK AND MORTAR STORES BY REDUCING TIME SPENT ON NON-SELLING ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVING CONVERSION AND OTHER METRICS THROUGH IMPROVED MERCHANDISE FLOW AND A BETTER CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE THOROUGHLY ASSESSED OUR GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY AND IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT THAT WE PLAN TO IMPLEMENT GOING FORWARD, AS WELL AS WORKING TO RIGHT SIZE OUR INVENTORY AND IMPROVE TURNS.  HOW WE ASSESS THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS  IN ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS, WE CONSIDER A VARIETY OF PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL MEASURES. THESE KEY MEASURES INCLUDE NET SALES, COMPARABLE SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN, AND SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE DESCRIBES AND DISCUSSES THESE MEASURES.  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  NET SALES  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF MERCHANDISE, LESS RETURNS AND DISCOUNTS, AS WELL AS SHIPPING AND HANDLING REVENUE RELATED TO E-COMMERCE, REVENUE FROM THE RENTAL OF OUR LED SIGN IN TIMES SQUARE, GIFT CARD BREAKAGE, REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT, AND REVENUE EARNED FROM OUR FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS.  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL, AND WE HAVE HISTORICALLY REALIZED A HIGHER PORTION OF OUR NET SALES IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS, DUE PRIMARILY TO THE IMPACT OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON. GENERALLY, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR ANNUAL NET SALES OCCUR IN THE SPRING SEASON (FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS) AND 55% OCCUR IN THE FALL SEASON (THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS).  COMPARABLE SALES  COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN A PERIOD RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WERE CALCULATED USING THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018.  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES INCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM RETAIL STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD  \u2022  E-COMMERCE SALES  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES INCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM OUTLET STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS  COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS CHANGED BY MORE THAN 20% DUE TO REMODEL OR RELOCATION ACTIVITY  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES IN A PHASED REMODEL WHERE A PORTION OF THE STORE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THEREFORE NOT PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE STORE CANNOT OPEN DUE TO WEATHER DAMAGE OR OTHER CATASTROPHE  OUR BUSINESS AND OUR COMPARABLE SALES ARE SUBJECT, AT CERTAIN TIMES, TO CALENDAR SHIFTS, WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING KEY SELLING PERIODS CLOSE TO HOLIDAYS SUCH AS EASTER, THANKSGIVING, AND CHRISTMAS, AND REGIONAL FLUCTUATIONS FOR EVENTS SUCH AS SALES TAX HOLIDAYS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE  \u2022  INVENTORY SHRINK AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS  \u2022  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND FREIGHT  \u2022  MERCHANDISING, DESIGN, PLANNING AND ALLOCATION, AND MANUFACTURING/PRODUCTION COSTS  \u2022  OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORE OPERATIONS (SUCH AS RENT AND COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, AND DEPRECIATION ON ASSETS)  \u2022  LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD TYPICALLY INCREASES IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS BECAUSE THE DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE IS TIED TO SALES.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE COSTS OF INDIVIDUAL GOODS ARE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MERCHANDISE IS SOURCED, AND LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING OUR MERCHANDISE.  BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORES ARE LARGELY FIXED AND DO NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE AS VOLUME INCREASES.  CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY TYPE OF PRODUCT OR BY CHANNEL MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR OVERALL COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IS NET SALES MINUS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS. GROSS MARGIN MEASURES GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN IS IMPACTED BY THE PRICE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO SELL OUR MERCHANDISE AND THE COST OF OUR PRODUCT.  WE REVIEW OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE AND GENERALLY USE MARKDOWNS TO CLEAR SUCH MERCHANDISE. THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF MARKDOWNS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SEASONALITY AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MERCHANDISE AND HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  ANY MARKED DOWN MERCHANDISE THAT IS NOT SOLD IS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK. WE USE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS TO DISPOSE OF THIS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK MERCHANDISE.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCLUDES OPERATING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS SUCH AS.  \u2022  PAYROLL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OPERATIONS AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES  \u2022  STORE EXPENSES OTHER THAN OCCUPANCY COSTS  \u2022  MARKETING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION, MAILING, PRINT, AND DIGITAL ADVERTISING COSTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF STORE PAYROLL, CERTAIN MARKETING EXPENSES, AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES GENERALLY DO NOT VARY PROPORTIONALLY WITH NET SALES. AS A RESULT, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN LOWER VOLUME QUARTERS AND LOWER IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018  NET SALES  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES (IN THOUSANDS)  $488,483  $514,961  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES  (5)%  1%  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES  (5)%  (1)%  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGE CHANGE  (5)%  \u2014%  GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  5,319  5,400  NUMBER OF.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN RETAIL AND OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES. THE DECREASE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AT OUR RETAIL STORES AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, OUR RETAIL SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OUR DECISION TO STRATEGICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STORE-WIDE AND SITE-WIDE PROMOTIONS. THE DECREASE IN OUR OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AND A LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICE.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS PROFIT  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT IN DOLLARS, AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  $350,810  $356,812  GROSS PROFIT  $137,673  $158,149  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  28.2%  30.7%  THE 250 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 WAS COMPRISED OF A 140 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND A 110 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ACTIONS TO MOVE THROUGH CLEARANCE INVENTORY AND PRODUCT THAT DID NOT FIT WITH OUR EVOLVING PRODUCT STRATEGY. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BEING MORE STRATEGIC WITH OUR PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY DURING THE QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $144,301  $148,294  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  29.5%  28.8%  THE $4.0 MILLION DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED STORE PAYROLL OF $2.1 MILLION, MARKETING EXPENSES OF $2.0 MILLION AND HOME OFFICE PAYROLL, INCLUDING INCENTIVE AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, OF $1.2 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.8 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES.  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE IN DOLLARS FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  $(2,880)  $2,203  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 48.1% FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 21.7% FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 REFLECTS A $1.4 MILLION CHANGE IN ESTIMATE FROM THE SECOND QUARTER PROVISION DUE TO AN INCREASE FROM THE PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS 44.0% AND 28.1% FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 3, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 WAS HIGHER THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CHANGE IN ESTIMATE FROM THE SECOND QUARTER PROVISION. REFER TO NOTE 6 IN OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES (IN THOUSANDS)  $1,412,469  $1,487,918  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES  (7)%  1%  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES  (3)%  1%  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGE CHANGE  (6)%  1%  GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  5,319  5,400  NUMBER OF.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN RETAIL AND OUTLET COMPARABLE SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN NON-COMPARABLE SALES AND OTHER REVENUE IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE DECREASE IN RETAIL COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AT OUR RETAIL AND OUTLET STORES, AS WELL AS INCREASED PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY AT OUR STORES AND ON OUR WEBSITE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS PROFIT  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT IN DOLLARS, AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  $1,025,795  $1,046,204  GROSS PROFIT  $386,674  $441,714  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  27.4%  29.7%  THE 230 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018 WAS COMPRISED OF A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND A 130 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VALUATION RESERVES ON SLOW MOVING INVENTORY AND THE ACTIONS WE TOOK DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS TO SELL THROUGH CLEARANCE INVENTORY AND INVENTORY NOT ALIGNED WITH OUR PRODUCT STRATEGY GOING FORWARD. THE REDUCTION IN STORE-WIDE AND SITE-WIDE PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 THAT CONTINUED THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER PARTIALLY OFFSET THIS DECREASE. THE INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $415,391  $426,583  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  29.4%  28.7%  THE $11.2 MILLION DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018 WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED HOME OFFICE PAYROLL, INCLUDING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, OF $7.5 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECREASE IN MARKETING COSTS OF $5.3 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.6 MILLION INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES.  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE IN DOLLARS FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  $(3,062)  $5,268  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 11.9% FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 33.0% FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 REFLECTS A TAX BENEFIT FROM A PRE-TAX LOSS OFFSET BY $2.6 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018 REFLECTS $1.3 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS 20.5% AND 28.4% FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 3, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR IS LOWER THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. REFER TO NOTE 6 IN OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE SUPPLEMENT THE REPORTING OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION DETERMINED UNDER UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) WITH CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: ADJUSTED NET LOSS, ADJUSTED OPERATING LOSS, AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION TO ASSIST STOCKHOLDERS IN UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND ASSESSING OUR PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE PERFORMANCE. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ADJUSTED NET LOSS, ADJUSTED OPERATING LOSS, AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THEY EXCLUDE ITEMS THAT MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF, OR ARE UNRELATED TO, OUR UNDERLYING OPERATING RESULTS, AND PROVIDE A BETTER BASELINE FOR ANALYZING TRENDS IN OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS USED AS A PERFORMANCE MEASURE IN OUR LONG-TERM EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF EQUITY AWARDS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY EARNED AND ADJUSTED OPERATING LOSS IS A METRIC USED IN OUR SHORT-TERM CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN. BECAUSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED, IT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES WITH OTHER COMPANIES' NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVING THE SAME OR SIMILAR NAMES. THESE ADJUSTED FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR REPORTED NET LOSS, OPERATING LOSS OR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES REFLECT AN ADDITIONAL WAY OF VIEWING OUR OPERATIONS THAT, WHEN VIEWED WITH THE GAAP RESULTS AND THE BELOW RECONCILIATIONS TO THE CORRESPONDING GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR BUSINESS. MANAGEMENT STRONGLY ENCOURAGES INVESTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PUBLICLY-FILED REPORTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.  THE TABLES BELOW RECONCILE THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, ADJUSTED NET LOSS, ADJUSTED OPERATING LOSS, AND ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, WITH THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, NET LOSS, OPERATING LOSS, AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.

THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $32,834  $18,315  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (20,503)  (32,402)  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (16,086)  (60,946)  DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (3,755)  (75,033)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  $167,915  $161,189  OUR BUSINESS RELIES ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE CASH FLOWS BEING GENERATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, PAYROLL, STORE RENT AND MARKETING. FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, OUR CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE $32.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $18.3 MILLION PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THIS $14.5 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER INVENTORY PURCHASES IN 2019 AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $33.5 MILLION LOWER NET INCOME FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, IF NEEDED, THROUGH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HAD $247.3 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ON MAY 24, 2019, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE FACILITY REMAINS AT $250.0 MILLION BUT THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE FACILITY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO MAY 24, 2024. REFER TO NOTE 8 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE ALSO USE CASH FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HAD CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY $20.5 MILLION. THESE RELATE PRIMARILY TO STORE REMODELS, NEW OUTLET STORES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019 TO BE APPROXIMATELY $15.0 MILLION TO $18.0 MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STORE REMODELS AND INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DO NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $0.4 MILLION FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017, THE BOARD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES US TO REPURCHASE UP TO $150.0 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK USING AVAILABLE CASH. DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018, WE REPURCHASED 3.7 MILLION SHARES AND 6.5 MILLION SHARES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY, FOR AGGREGATE AMOUNTS EQUAL TO $13.6 MILLION AND $56.2 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $36.2 MILLION REMAINING UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 2, 2019 THROUGH DECEMBER 10, 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 0.6 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER THE 2017 REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT EQUAL TO $2.0 MILLION, INCLUDING COMMISSIONS.  OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE SAME DAY OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN THREE TO FIVE DAYS OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE HAVE UP TO 75 DAYS TO PAY CERTAIN MERCHANDISE VENDORS AND 45 DAYS TO PAY THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-MERCHANDISE VENDORS.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS DID NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 2, 2019. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, SEE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT OUR MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, MERCHANDISE INVENTORY VALUATION, LONG-LIVED ASSET VALUATION, CLAIMS AND CONTINGENCIES, AND INCOME TAXES.

UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR THE CONTEXT REQUIRES OTHERWISE, THE WORDS \u201cWE\u201d, \u201cUS\u201d, \u201cOUR\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cOUR COMPANY\u201d REFER TO DAIS CORPORATION, A NEW YORK CORPORATION, AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.  OVERVIEW  DAIS CORPORATION (\u201cDAIS\u201d, \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cWE,\u201d, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) IS A NANOMATERIAL TECHNOLOGY COMPANY DEVELOPING AND COMMERCIALIZING PRODUCTS USING THE NANOMATERIAL CALLED AQUALYTE. THE FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS THE AQUALYTE NANOMATERIAL ITSELF. IT IS USEFUL IN MANAGING MOISTURE AND KEY GASES IN A VARIETY OF CROSS-INDUSTRY PRODUCTS. THE SECOND COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS CALLED CONSERV, A FIXED PLATE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATOR WHICH IS USEFUL IN MEETING BUILDING INDOOR FRESH AIR REQUIREMENTS WHILE SAVING ENERGY AND LOWERING EMISSIONS FOR MOST FORMS OF HEATING, VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING (HVAC) EQUIPMENT. THE THIRD COMMERCIAL PRODUCT IS NANOCLEAR, A WATER CLEAN-UP PROCESS USEFUL IN THE CREATION OF POTABLE WATER FROM MOST FORMS OF CONTAMINATED WATER INCLUDING INDUSTRIAL PROCESS WASTEWATER (PETROCHEMICAL, STEEL, ETC.) SEA, BRACKISH, OR WASTEWATER. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OTHER AQUALYTE USES IN CROSS-INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS, HVAC/REFRIGERATION, ENERGY, AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT.  CORPORATE HISTORY  WE WERE INCORPORATED AS A NEW YORK CORPORATION ON APRIL 8, 1993 AS DAIS CORPORATION. THE COMPANY WAS FORMED TO DEVELOP NEW, COST-EFFECTIVE POLYMER MATERIALS FOR VARIOUS APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING PROVIDING A LOWER COST MEMBRANE MATERIAL FOR POLYMER ELECTROLYTE MEMBRANE FUEL CELLS. WE BELIEVE OUR RESEARCH ON MATERIALS SCIENCE HAS YIELDED TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN THE FIELD OF SELECTIVE ION TRANSPORT POLYMER MATERIALS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN DECEMBER 1999, THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE ASSETS OF ANALYTIC POWER CORPORATION, A CORPORATION FOUNDED IN 1984 TO PROVIDE DESIGN, ANALYSIS, AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION SERVICES IN THE FIELD OF FUEL CELLS, FUEL PROCESSORS, AND INTEGRATED FUEL CELL POWER SYSTEMS. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON DECEMBER 13, 1999, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME TO DAIS ANALYTIC CORPORATION.  IN MARCH 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ITS FUEL CELL ASSETS TO CHEVRON, A LARGE U.S. OIL COMPANY FOR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION BY SUCH COMPANY OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S OBLIGATIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY FOCUSED ON EXPANDING ITS NANO-STRUCTURED POLYMER PLATFORM, HAVING ALREADY IDENTIFIED THE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATOR (\u201cERV\u201d) APPLICATION AS OUR FIRST COMMERCIAL PRODUCT.  IN NOVEMBER OF 2018 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE COMPANY FROM DAIS ANALYTIC CORPORATION TO DAIS CORPORATION (THE \u201cNAME CHANGE\u201d). THE NAME CHANGE TOOK EFFECT WITH FINRA ON FEBRUARY 27, 2019.  OUR TECHNOLOGY  WE USE PROPRIETARY NANOTECHNOLOGY TO REFORMULATE THERMOPLASTIC MATERIALS CALLED POLYMERS. NANOTECHNOLOGY INVOLVES STUDYING AND WORKING WITH MATTER ON AN ULTRA-SMALL SCALE. POLYMERS ARE CHEMICAL, PLASTIC-LIKE COMPOUNDS USED IN DIVERSE PRODUCTS SUCH AS DACRON, TEFLON, AND POLYURETHANE. A THERMOPLASTIC IS A MATERIAL THAT IS PLASTIC OR DEFORMABLE, MELTS TO A LIQUID WHEN HEATED AND TO A BRITTLE, GLASSY STATE WHEN COOLED SUFFICIENTLY. THESE REFORMULATED POLYMERS HAVE PROPERTIES THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE USED IN UNIQUE WAYS. WE TRANSFORM POLYMERS FROM A HARD, WATER IMPERMEABLE SUBSTANCE INTO A MATERIAL WHICH WATER AND SIMILAR LIQUIDS CAN, UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, PERMEATE AT A MOLECULAR LEVEL AS OPPOSED TO FLOWING IN BULK AS LIQUID WATER THROUGH A PORE. WATER AND SIMILAR MOLECULES PERMEATE READILY THROUGH THE THERMOPLASTIC MATERIAL WHILE OXYGEN AND MOST CHEMICALS SHOW SEVERELY LIMITED PERMEABILITY. IT IS BELIEVED THIS SELECTIVITY DEPENDS ON THE SIZE AND CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MOLECULES. WE CALL THIS SPECIALIZED MATERIAL AQUALYTE.  AQUALYTE  TM  THE COMPANY INVENTED AND PATENTED A DISRUPTIVE PLATFORM PLASTIC MATERIAL TECHNOLOGY CALLED AQUALYTE WITH CAREFULLY TAILORED PROPERTIES FOR USE IN AIR, ENERGY AND WATER APPLICATIONS. IT IS MADE FROM COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE POLYMER RESIN IN FLAKE FORM AND INDUSTRIAL GRADE SOLVENTS WHICH ARE MIXED USING A PROPRIETARY PROCESS INVOLVING HEAT, INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT, AND SOLVENTS. THE RESIN AND THE SOLVENTS ARE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE FROM ANY NUMBER OF CHEMICAL SUPPLY HOUSES, OR FIRMS SUCH AS DOW. OUR PROCESS CHANGES THE MOLECULAR PROPERTIES OF THE STARTING POLYMER RESINS SUCH THAT IN THEIR FINAL FORM THEY SELECTIVELY ALLOW MOLECULES THROUGH THE PLASTIC, INCLUDING WATER MOLECULES.  THE COMPANY USES PATENT-PROTECTED AND TRADE SECRET RECIPES AND PROCESSES TO FORMULATE THE AQUALYTE RESIN INTO THIN FILM MEMBRANES WITH CAREFULLY CONTROLLED COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURE. THIS MODIFIED BLOCK CO-POLYMER MEMBRANE WITH A NANOSCALE ORGANIZATION SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION OF THE DAIS PRODUCT LINE. IT IS A NON-POROUS NANOMATERIAL THAT SELECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY TRANSPORTS MOISTURE THROUGH A SOLID MEMBRANE AND BLOCKS PASSAGE OF MOST GASES AND VOLATILE COMPOUNDS. THE MEMBRANE IS ROBUST AND DURABLE WITH NO PORES TO CLOG AND NO BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL GROWTH. WE BEGAN SELLING AQUALYTE IN 2018 TO STRATEGIC CUSTOMERS AND CONTINUE TO HAVE GROWING SALES OF AQUALYTE. WE PROJECT EVEN FURTHER GROWTH IN THIS AREA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2019 AND BEYOND.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEXT GENERATION VERSIONS OF OUR AQUALYTE MATERIAL BY ADDING NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVING THE MANUFACTURABILITY OF THE NANOMATERIAL. THESE AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS ALLOW AQUALYTE TO SERVE A WIDER VARIETY OF USES IN THE CONSERV AND NANOCLEAR TARGET MARKETS. AQUALYTE IS THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY FOR OUR FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONSERV, FIXED-PLATE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATORS (ERVS), AND NANOCLEAR, A HIGH-PERFORMANCE CONTAMINATED WATER CLEANING PROCESS. AQUALYTE REPRESENTS THE BASIS FOR A BROAD CLASS OF MATERIALS WITH UNIQUE FEATURES PRECISELY MANAGED BY ENGINEERED PROCESSES. FEATURES OF THE AQUALYTE TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE THE ABILITY TO CREATE HERMETIC COMPOSITE MEMBRANES POSSESSING ION CONDUCTION, HIGH MOISTURE TRANSFER AND HIGH MOLECULAR SELECTIVITY. OUR ENGINEERING PROCESS MANAGES THESE FEATURES TO OFFER DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS LIKE CONSERV AND NANOCLEAR THAT ARE TARGETING WORLDWIDE NEEDS IN THE CLEAN AIR, ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND CLEAN WATER MARKETS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN JULY OF 2017, DAIS FIRST ENTERED INTO A MULTI-YEAR, EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE HAIER GROUP TO PROVIDE ITS AQUALYTE  NANOMATERIALS FOR USE IN SELECT REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS. THIS FIRST AGREEMENT CONTINUES TO GENERATE QUARTERLY REVENUE FOR DAIS. WE PROJECT THESE REVENUES SHOULD INCREASE AS HAIER CONTINUES ITS FULL ROLLOUT WHICH IS EXPECTED TO COMPLETE DURING 2020. DAIS PROJECTS THIS FIRST AGREEMENT FOR TARGETED REFRIGERATION PRODUCTS SHOULD ULTIMATELY GENERATE OVER $5 MILLION IN ANNUAL REVENUES. HAIER\u2019S USE OF DAIS\u2019S AQUALYTE MATERIAL FOLLOWS A GROWING WORLD-WIDE TREND REPORTED  BY MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS  (JULY 18, 2018) THAT STATES GLOBAL ADOPTION OF MATURE NANOTECHNOLOGY MATERIALS CONTINUES TO GROW AND IS ON TRACK TO REACH $90.5 BILLION BY 2021 FROM $39.2 BILLION IN 2016 AT A COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE (CAGR) OF 18.2%, FROM 2016 TO 2021. DAIS WAS LISTED AS ONE OF THE COMPANIES BY  MARKET INSIGHT REPORTS  ALONG WITH BASF, BAYER AG, DOW CHEMICAL, AND OTHERS.  IN ADDITION, DURING 2019 AND IN THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 2019, DAIS SOLD AQUALYTE TO MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS FOR USE IN VENTILATION AND WASTEWATER CLEANING USES. THESE SALES ARE CONTINUING IN 2019 AND WE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO 2020 AS WELL.  CONSERV  TM  WE CONTINUE WIDENING SALES CHANNELS FOR OUR CONSERV PRODUCT, AN HVAC ENERGY CONSERVATION PRODUCT WHICH SHOULD SAVE AN AVERAGE OF 30% ON HVAC VENTILATION AIR OPERATING COSTS. THESE SAVINGS TYPICALLY ALLOW THE REMAINDER OF THE SYSTEM TO BE SMALLER AND LESS EXPENSIVE, REDUCING CARBON DIOXIDE (CO  2  ) EMISSIONS FROM ELECTRICAL POWER GENERATION. CONSERV GENERALLY ATTACHES ONTO EXISTING HVAC SYSTEMS, TYPICALLY IN COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, TO PROVIDE IMPROVED VENTILATION AIR WITHIN THE STRUCTURE. CONSERV SEPARATES INCOMING FRESH VENTILATION AIR FROM OUTGOING EXHAUST AIR WITH OUR AQUALYTE NANOTECHNOLOGY POLYMER IN AN ENTHALPY HEAT EXCHANGER REFERRED TO AS A \u201cCORE\u201d. WHILE AQUALYTE PHYSICALLY ISOLATES THE AIR STREAMS SO THEY DON\u2019T MIX, HEAT AND MOISTURE ARE FREELY EXCHANGED THROUGH THE MATERIAL. FOR SUMMER AIR CONDITIONING, THE CORE REMOVES SOME OF THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY FROM THE INCOMING AIR AND TRANSFERS IT TO THE EXHAUST AIR STREAM, THEREBY SAVING ENERGY UNDER MANY CONDITIONS. FOR WINTER HEATING, THE CORE TYPICALLY RECOVERS A PORTION OF THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY IN THE EXHAUST AIR AND TRANSFERS IT INTO THE INCOMING AIR TO REDUCE HEARING REQUIREMENTS.  CONSERV SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AT THE BEGINNING OF 2017 FROM THE DECEMBER 2016 TERMINATION OF A FAILED LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH A NORTH AMERICAN COMPANY. IN 2018, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING ITS CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING THIS EFFORT TO EXPAND ITS NORTH AMERICAN SALES CHANNELS TO GROW CONSERV SALES WITH INITIATIVES AIMED AT TARGETED PROFESSIONALS AND COMPANIES SPECIALIZING IN THE SALE OF HVAC COMPONENTS AND SYSTEMS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BEGAN SELLING NANOMATERIAL TO COMPANIES IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND CONTINUES DISCUSSIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES TO EXPAND THE MARKET FOR AQUALYTE SALES. IN THE THIRD QUARTER THE COMPANY BEGAN DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERESTED PARTIES OUTSIDE OF CHINA IN SOUTHEAST ASIA TO SPECIFY OR DISTRIBUTE CONSERV NANOMATERIAL, CORES AND SYSTEMS. IT IS BELIEVED OUR CONTINUING EFFORTS IN THESE AREAS WILL SEE REVENUES GROW THROUGHOUT 2019 INTO 2020, AND BEYOND.  IN DECEMBER 2017 JULY 2017, WE SIGNED A 7-YEAR EXCLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE ZHEJIANG MENRED ENVIRONMENTAL TECH CO., LTD, ZHEJIANG PROVINCE , CHINA, TO PROVIDE OUR AQUALYTE MOISTURE TRANSFER NANOMATERIAL IN A NEW LINE OF MENRED ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATORS (ERV) TO BE SOLD IN THE GROWING CHINESE HVAC MARKET, AND FOR POSSIBLE EXPORT USE BY DAIS TO MEET ITS GROWING NEEDS. THIS ARRANGEMENT GENERATED ITS FIRST REVENUES IN THE QUARTER REPRESENTED BY THIS FILING, AND IT IS PROJECTED TO YIELD INCREASING REVENUES THROUGHOUT 2019 INTO 2020, AND BEYOND.  WHEN COMPARED TO SIMILAR COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, WE BELIEVE, BASED ON TEST RESULTS CONDUCTED BY THE AIR-CONDITIONING, HEATING AND REFRIGERATION INSTITUTE (AHRI), A LEADING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION, CONSERV MAINTAINS AN INDUSTRY-LEADING POSITION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LATENT HEAT. THE COMPANY INTRODUCED AN UPDATED LINE OF CONSERV PRODUCTS IN JANUARY 2019 MARKETED AS VITALITY  TM  , PURITY  TM  AND CLARITY  TM  WITH FURTHER UPGRADES PROJECTED TO BE INTRODUCED IN 1Q 2020. SALES FROM THESE PRODUCTS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE REVENUE DURING 2019 AND BEYOND.  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NANOCLEAR  TM  WE HAVE COMMERCIALLY INTRODUCED THE FIRST NANOCLEAR MEMBRANE EVAPORATORS FOR PILOT TESTING, WHICH REMOVE QUANTITIES OF METALS, ACIDS, SALT AND OTHER IMPURITIES FROM VARIOUS CONTAMINATED WATER SOURCES, PRODUCING POTABLE WATER USING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, LOW MAINTENANCE DESIGN THAT IS COMPETITIVE WITH INDUSTRY LEADERS IN TERMS OF ELECTRICAL CONSUMPTION. WE CONSTRUCTED AND OPERATE A PILOT PLANT INSTALLED AT A LOCAL COUNTY WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY THAT WAS COMMISSIONED IN MAY 2013 AND UPDATED TO THE CURRENT GENERATION OF MEMBRANE EVAPORATOR IN NOVEMBER 2016. THIS SITE HAS SERVED AS A SHOWCASE FOR POTENTIAL COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS WELL AS A TEST BED FOR NEWER MATERIALS AND HARDWARE READYING FOR COMMERCIALIZATION. THE ACCUMULATED TEST DATA, ANALYZED BY AN INDEPENDENT 3RD PARTY FIRM, SHOWS THE QUALITY OF THE WATER BEING PRODUCED HAS NOT DIMINISHED SINCE SYSTEM START-UP. THE EVOLVING NANOCLEAR PRODUCT LINE PURIFIES CONTAMINATED WATER, CREATED LARGELY DURING COOLING OF KEY MANUFACTURING AND UTILITY PROCESSES. THESE SORTS OF APPLICATIONS ARE THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY FOCUS. THIS INCLUDES HIGHER SALT CONCENTRATIONS AND LOW PH WASTE STREAMS.  DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON A U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, $1,000,000, PHASE II SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH (SBIR) AWARD CONTINUED THROUGHOUT 2019 TO DEVELOP NANOCLEAR WATER CLEANING TECHNOLOGY FOR MILITARY USE. THE NANOCLEAR FUNDING PROJECT TITLED \"NON-FOULING WATER REUSE TECHNOLOGIES\" USES OUR PATENTED AQUALYTE MEMBRANE TO PRODUCE POTABLE WATER FROM GREY-WATER SOURCES. THE POTENTIAL PRODUCT IMPROVEMENTS FROM THIS AWARD WILL WIDEN NANOCLEAR\u2019S APPLICATIONS IN SEPARATING CLEAN WATER FROM CONTAMINATED WASTE STREAMS.  WE RECEIVED ORDERS FOR DELIVERY OF OUR NANOCLEAR INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER CLEANING PRODUCT FOR PILOT EVALUATIONS IN MULTIPLE INDUSTRIES THROUGHOUT 2018 AND THUS FAR IN 2019. THE PRODUCT\u2019S CORE STRENGTH, SUPPORTED BY COMPANY, CUSTOMER, AND THIRD PARTY GENERATED INFORMATION, IS ITS ABILITY TO CLEAN CONTAMINATED WASTEWATER CREATED BY A VARIETY OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE DELIVERED OUR LARGEST COMMERCIAL PROJECT TO DATE IN THE QUARTER ENDING IN JUNE 2019, WITH NANOCLEAR EVAPORATOR MODULES FOR INSTALLATION IN MULTIPLE COGENERATION POWER PLANT TEST SITES IN CHINA.  POLYCOOL  TM  POLYCOOL IS A PRODUCT IN DEVELOPMENT AND IS BELIEVED TO OFFER STRATEGIC ADVANTAGES OVER EXISTING COOLING TOWER SYSTEMS. IN EFFECT, THE PROCESS WATER IS ISOLATED IN A LARGELY CLOSED SYSTEM (LIKE DRY COOLING TECHNOLOGY) AND INITIAL TESTING SHOWS IT REDUCES THE LIKELIHOOD OF DANGEROUS GERMS AND VIRUSES SUCH AS LEGIONELLA BECOMING AIRBORNE. IN-HOUSE TESTING HAS SHOWN THE ABILITY TO GENERATE COOLING EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO TODAY\u2019S EXISTING COOLING TOWERS WHILE LARGELY ISOLATING THE PROCESS WATER FROM THE AIR STREAM.  POLYCOOL SYSTEMS ARE EXPECTED TO USE UP TO 32% LESS ENERGY THAN A CONVENTIONAL COOLING TOWER WHILE REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR EXPENSIVE CHEMICAL BIOCIDE APPLICATION PROGRAMS TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF RISK OF SPREADING DANGEROUS DISEASES. WE BELIEVE THESE SAVINGS CAN REDUCE THE OPERATING EXPENSES OF A COOLING TOWER BY UP 74% VERSUS CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY. THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY OF AQUALYTE TO RESIST FOULING AND OPERATE WITH DISSOLVED SOLIDS LEVELS UP TO 25% SALINITY ALLOWS POLYCOOL TECHNOLOGY TO OPERATE WITH SEAWATER, BRINE, OR OTHER FORMS OF WASTEWATER INSTEAD OF CONSUMING POTABLE WATER AS WITH CONVENTIONAL EVAPORATIVE COOLING TECHNOLOGIES. THIS ADVANTAGE EXPANDS THE APPLICABILITY OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING INTO GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM WATER SCARCITY OR STRESS. IN ADDITION, THE DRAMATIC REDUCTION IN MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY ISSUES ALLOWS USE OF POLYCOOL IN SMALLER INSTALLATIONS WITH CORRESPONDINGLY SMALLER MAINTENANCE BUDGETS AND LESS RISK TOLERANCE, WHICH CONVENTIONALLY USE LESS EFFICIENT DRY COOLING INSTEAD OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN THE QUARTER ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, THE COMPANY (SEPTEMBER 2018) ANNOUNCED THAT WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND DEFINITIVE TWO-PART, LICENSE AGREEMENT WITH THE HAIER GROUP OF QINGDAO, CHINA FOR A NEW PRODUCT FOR HAIER\u2019S HVAC COOLING SYSTEMS. PROTOTYPE TESTING CONTINUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019; ONCE COMPLETE, THE PRODUCT WILL MOVE INTO FIELD TESTING PRIOR TO DEPLOYMENT INTO HAIER\u2019S SALES CHANNELS THROUGHOUT GREATER CHINA. ONCE SUCCESSFUL FIELD TESTING IS COMPLETE, THE NEW PRODUCT IS ANTICIPATED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REVENUE IMPACT FOR DAIS, PROJECTED TO BE AS MUCH AS $73 MILLION ANNUALLY. THESE REVENUES COULD BEGIN AS EARLY AS THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2020. THE PRODUCT IS AN INNOVATIVE POLYCOOL CONDENSING UNIT DESIGNED FOR INCORPORATION INTO COMMERCIAL HAIER COOLING UNITS TO BE DEPLOYED INTO HAIER\u2019S GREATER CHINA SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.  PRODUCT SUMMARY  DAIS\u2019S ADVANCED MATERIAL HAS MANY DEMONSTRATED USES IN THE DESCRIBED PRODUCTS. MANAGEMENT IS PLACING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S RESOURCES BEHIND THE TWO MOST MATURE PRODUCTS IN TWO MAJOR REVENUE GENERATING PATHS: CONSERV CORES, AND SYSTEMS, AND THE SALE OF AQUALYTE NANOMATERIALS AND ENGINEERING SUPPORT IN AREAS WHERE AQUALYTE HAS SHOWN PROVEN RESULTS YET DAIS\u2019S PRODUCT IN THESE AREAS OVER COMMITS THE COMPANY\u2019S RESOURCES AND PRODUCT MATURITY.  MANAGEMENT PROJECTS THIS NARROWER FOCUS WILL INCREASE REVENUES ALLOWING PROFITABILITY TO OCCUR FASTER BY LEVERAGING ITS DEPTH IN MARKETING, BUILDING AND SELLING CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS MAINLY IN N. AMERICA, AND IN SELLING HIGH PERFORMING AQUALYTE NANOMATERIAL WHERE AQUALYTE HAS SHOWN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OVER CURRENT INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS.  THE ADVANCE MATERIALS-ONLY SALES ACTIVITIES ARE BEING DONE WITH SELECT, SUCCESSFUL COMPANIES LOCATED IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOUTH EAST ASIA (INCLUDING CHINA) WHICH TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF DAIS\u2019S PAST AND CONTINUING MARKET PENETRATION EFFORTS. THE USES INCLUDE ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATION AND OTHER KNOWN HVAC AND SELECT CROSS-INDUSTRY USES.  TO HELP US SUPPORT OUR CAPABILITIES TO DELIVER CONSERV CORES AND SYSTEMS, AND AQUALYTE ADVANCED NANOMATERIAL, WE HAVE QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING COMPANIES TO JOIN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN TO PRODUCE MATERIALS AND COMPONENTS FOR US, GUIDED BY DAIS-QUALIFIED MANUFACTURING PRACTICES TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR PRODUCT IN N. AMERICA, IN THE EUROPEAN UNION AND SOUTH EAST ASIA (INCLUDING CHINA). WE PROJECT THIS EXPANSION OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN WILL RESULT IN LOWER COSTS AND QUICKER ORDER FULFILLMENT, GENERATING REVENUES FASTER.  ORDERS ARE ALREADY BEING GENERATED FROM THESE AGREEMENTS, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO INCREASE AS WE EXPAND AND ADD NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS ALONG THE WAY. THE NEW ORDERS INCLUDE SALES OF AQUALYTE NANOMATERIALS, COMPONENTS FOR ENERGY RECOVERY VENTILATION, AND OTHER KNOWN HVAC AND SELECT CROSS INDUSTRY PRODUCTS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, CERTAIN DATA DERIVED FROM OUR STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE GROSS MARGIN INCREASE RESULTED FROM FOCUSED EFFORTS TO REDUCE MANUFACTURING COSTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE INCURRED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $214,292 AND $246,499 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, A DECREASE OF $32,207 OR 13%. WE ACCOUNT FOR PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENT FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS A REDUCTION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. WE RECORDED PROCEEDS AGAINST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ON THE STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OF $55,849 AND $49,304 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, AN INCREASE OF $6,545 OR 13%. VARIANCES IN GRANT EXPENDITURES AND REIMBURSEMENTS ARE DUE TO AN EMPHASIS ON COMPLETING AN EXISTING SMALL BUSINESS INNOVATIVE RESEARCH PHASE II GRANT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PAYROLL AND RELATED BENEFITS, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, PROFESSIONAL FEES, MARKETING AND CHANNEL SUPPORT COSTS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS SUCH AS INSURANCE, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $1,025,043 AND $1,492,330 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, A DECREASE OF $467,287 OR 31%  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES MAY FLUCTUATE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.  \u00b7  ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR CONSERV  AND AQUALYTE  PRODUCTS AND/OR NEW PRODUCT APPLICATIONS OF OUR POLYMER TECHNOLOGY FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL, PHYSICAL SPACE, MARKETING AND CHANNEL SUPPORT AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY;  \u00b7  THE ISSUANCE AND RECOGNITION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO FAIR VALUE OF NEW SHARE-BASED AWARDS, WHICH IS BASED ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE VOLATILITY OF OUR STOCK PRICE; AND  \u00b7  ADDITIONAL EXPENSES AS A RESULT OF BEING AN SEC REPORTING COMPANY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DIRECTOR AND OFFICER INSURANCE, DIRECTOR FEES, SEC COMPLIANCE EXPENSES, TRANSFER AGENT FEES, ADDITIONAL STAFFING, PROFESSIONAL FEES AND SIMILAR EXPENSES.  THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018 IS THE RESULT OF DECREASED PAYROLL COSTS AND MARKETING EXPENSE.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER EXPENSES WERE $1,766,798 AND $643,709 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE OF $1,123,089 OR 174.5%. THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE IS DUE TO ADDITIONAL DEBT DISCOUNT, FINANCE COST, CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES (PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE), AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF DEBT AT TIME OF EXTINGUISHMENT, AND ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS.  NET LOSS  NET LOSS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $2,623,838 COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $2,024,561 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. THE HIGHER LOSS IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ASSUMING THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE GENERATED A NET LOSS OF $2,623,838 AND HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES SINCE INCEPTION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD AN ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $52,761,028, A STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $8,285,957 AND CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $13,774. WE USED $474,624 AND $637,076 OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS FUNDED PRIMARILY BY PROCEEDS FROM NOTE PAYABLES AND GROSS MARGIN. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED. WE ARE CURRENTLY PURSUING THE FOLLOWING SOURCES OF SHORT AND LONG-TERM WORKING CAPITAL.  1.  WE ARE HOLDING PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS WITH PARTIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN LICENSING, PURCHASING THE RIGHTS TO OR ESTABLISHING A JOINT VENTURE TO COMMERCIALIZE APPLICATIONS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY.  2.  WE ARE SEEKING GROWTH CAPITAL FROM CERTAIN STRATEGIC AND/OR GOVERNMENT (GRANT) RELATED SOURCES. THESE SOURCES MAY, PURSUANT TO ANY AGREEMENTS THAT MAY BE DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SUCH FUNDING, ASSIST IN THE PRODUCT DEFINITION AND DESIGN, ROLL-OUT AND CHANNEL PENETRATION OF PRODUCTS.  3.  THE COMPANY IS HOLDING DISCUSSIONS WITH INVESTORS, POTENTIAL STRATEGIC PARTNERS, AND INVESTMENT BANKS TO OBTAIN DEBT AND/OR EQUITY FINANCING.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT OUR CURRENT CASH POSITION AND OUR PROJECTED ABILITY TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS, GIVEN THE GROWTH IN 2019 IN MANUFACTURING AND SALES OF PRODUCTS BOTH IN CONSERV AND AQUALYTE IS SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE BALANCE OF 2019. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN OUR EFFORTS TO SECURE SUCH ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF PRODUCT REVENUE OR CAPITAL.  ANY FAILURE BY US TO TIMELY PROCURE ADDITIONAL FINANCING OR INVESTMENT ADEQUATE TO FUND THE ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING PLANNED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES AND COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS, WILL HAVE MATERIAL ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS AS COULD ANY UNFAVORABLE TERMS. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES WE WILL BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE FINANCING AND PLANNED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COMMERCIALIZATION. ACCORDINGLY, WE MAY NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSETS, OR THE AMOUNTS AND CLASSIFICATIONS OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT IN JUNE 2016 PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED A SENIOR SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE THAT GRANTS THE HOLDER A SECURED INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY.  STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $13,774 COMPARED TO $29,300 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2018. CASH IS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $474,624 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $637,076 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018. THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING LOSS, CHANGE IN CUSTOMER DEPOSIT AND AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $5,222 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $47,032 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN PATENT COSTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $464,320 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $766,336 FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018, RESULTING FROM LOANS FROM A RELATED PARTY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTES.  FINANCING AND CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS  ON JUNE 24, 2016, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT (\u201cSECURITY AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH PATRICIA TANGREDI (THE \u201cHOLDER\u201d) PURSUANT TO WHICH THE COMPANY ISSUED A SENIOR SECURED PROMISSORY NOTE FOR $150,000 (THE \u201cNOTE\u201d). THE INTEREST RATE IS 12% PER ANNUM COMPOUNDED DAILY WITH A MINIMUM INTEREST PAYMENT OF $2,000. THE NOTE GRANTS THE HOLDER A SECURED INTEREST IN THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. MS. TANGREDI IS THE WIFE OF TIMOTHY N. TANGREDI, THE COMPANY\u2019S CEO AND STOCKHOLDER, AND THEREFORE IS A RELATED PARTY OF THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THE NOTE, THE COMPANY IS TO PAY THE HOLDER THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $150,000 PLUS ALL INTEREST DUE THEREON IN ACCORDANCE WITH TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE SECURITY AGREEMENT ON THE EARLIER OF: (I) THE DATE UPON WHICH THE COMPANY SECURES FUNDS, REGARDLESS OF SOURCE, EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING, IN THE AGGREGATE, $1,000,000 OR (II) OCTOBER 31, 2016.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING 2016 THROUGH THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, THE HOLDER EXTENDED THE NOTE PURSUANT TO VARIOUS AMENDMENTS. PURSUANT TO THE AMENDMENTS, THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT DUE WAS INCREASED TO $1,592,500 WITH AN EXTENDED MATURITY DATE OF NOVEMBER 21, 2019. AS CONSIDERATION FOR THE ADDITIONAL PROCEEDS AND MODIFICATION OF THE MATURITY DATE, THE COMPANY ISSUED TO THE RELATED PARTY WARRANTS TO PURCHASE AN AGGREGATE OF 78,250,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $0.01 WITH A TEN-YEAR EXERCISE PERIOD AND 480,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE THIRTEEN WEEKS (THIRD QUARTER) AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS (NINE MONTHS) ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  COMPARED TO  THE THIRTEEN WEEKS (THIRD QUARTER) AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS (NINE MONTHS) ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018  OVERVIEW  WE ARE THE LEADING OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS RETAILER IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. WE SELL A RAPIDLY CHANGING ASSORTMENT OF APPAREL, HOME FASHIONS AND OTHER MERCHANDISE AT PRICES GENERALLY 20% TO 60% BELOW FULL-PRICE RETAILERS\u2019 (INCLUDING DEPARTMENT, SPECIALTY AND MAJOR ONLINE RETAILERS) REGULAR PRICES ON COMPARABLE MERCHANDISE, EVERY DAY. WE OPERATE OVER 4,500 STORES THROUGH OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS: IN THE U.S., MARMAXX (WHICH OPERATES T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS, TJMAXX.COM AND MARSHALLS.COM) AND HOMEGOODS (WHICH OPERATES HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE); TJX CANADA (WHICH OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA); AND TJX INTERNATIONAL (WHICH OPERATES T.K. MAXX, HOMESENSE AND TKMAXX.COM IN EUROPE, AND T.K. MAXX IN AUSTRALIA). IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW OF OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  \u2013  NET SALES INCREASED 6% TO $10.5 BILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER SALES OF $9.8 BILLION. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE NUMBER OF STORES IN OPERATION INCREASED 5% AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE END OF THE FISCAL 2019 THIRD QUARTER.  \u2013  COMP SALES INCREASED 4% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OVER AN INCREASE OF 7% FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC WAS THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE COMP SALES INCREASE AT ALL FOUR MAJOR SEGMENTS.  \u2013  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $0.68 VERSUS $0.61 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  PRE-TAX MARGIN (THE RATIO OF PRE-TAX INCOME TO NET SALES) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 10.7%, FLAT COMPARED WITH 10.7% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, RATIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 71.2%, A 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH 71.1% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSE RATIO FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS 18.0%, A 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE COMPARED WITH 17.9% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES, INCLUDING INVENTORY ON HAND AT OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS (WHICH EXCLUDES INVENTORY IN TRANSIT) AND EXCLUDING OUR E-COMMERCE SITES AND SIERRA STORES, WERE UP 9% ON A REPORTED BASIS AND CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AS COMPARED TO A 9% INCREASE IN AVERAGE PER STORE INVENTORIES ON A REPORTED BASIS AND A 10% INCREASE ON A CONSTANT CURRENCY BASIS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  \u2013  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE RETURNED $778 MILLION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  INVESTMENT IN FAMILIA  ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY, THROUGH A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, COMPLETED AN INVESTMENT OF $225 MILLION FOR A 25% OWNERSHIP STAKE IN PRIVATELY HELD FAMILIA, AN ESTABLISHED, OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS RETAILER WITH MORE THAN 275 STORES THROUGHOUT RUSSIA. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT REPRESENTS A NON-CONTROLLING, MINORITY POSITION. AS PART OF THIS INVESTMENT, TJX HAS THE RIGHT TO APPOINT ONE MEMBER TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF FAMILIA.  THE INVESTMENT WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FROM THE DATE OF INVESTMENT FORWARD. TJX WILL REPORT ITS SHARE OF FAMILIA\u2019S RESULTS ON A ONE-QUARTER LAG AS THEIR RESULTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN TIME TO BE RECORDED IN THE CONCURRENT PERIOD.  IMPACT OF BREXIT  THE U.K\u2019S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION (\u201cEU\u201d), COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS \u201cBREXIT\u201d, REMAINS UNSETTLED. SHOULD THE U.K. EXIT THE EU, THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE OUTCOMES EACH OF WHICH CREATES RISKS FOR TJX, ESPECIALLY IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. CURRENT U.K. LAW STATES THAT THE U.K. WILL LEAVE THE EU ON JANUARY 31, 2020 WITH OR WITHOUT A COMPREHENSIVE WITHDRAWAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU, THE LATTER COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS A \"HARD BREXIT\". OUR TJX EUROPE MANAGEMENT TEAM HAS EVALUATED A RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES, IDENTIFIED AREAS OF CONCERN AND IMPLEMENTED STRATEGIES TO HELP MITIGATE THEM.  24  OUR CURRENT EUROPEAN OPERATIONS BENEFIT FROM THE FREE MOVEMENT OF GOODS AND LABOR BETWEEN THE U.K. AND EU. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE BREXIT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY MOVE MERCHANDISE BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. BREXIT COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR TALENT IN THE REGION, BOTH BY IMPACTING CURRENT ASSOCIATES, WHO ARE EITHER EU CITIZENS WORKING IN THE U.K. OR U.K. CITIZENS WORKING IN THE EU, AND POTENTIALLY IMPACTING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION FOR OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  IF THE U.K. DOES EXIT THE EU, WE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL REGULATORY AND COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS FOR MERCHANDISE THAT FLOWS BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU. WE HAVE REALIGNED OUR EUROPEAN DIVISION\u2019S SUPPLY CHAIN TO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF MERCHANDISE FLOWING BETWEEN THE U.K. AND THE EU AND HAVE ESTABLISHED RESOURCES AND SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT THIS PLAN. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OUR ASSOCIATES ABOUT BREXIT INCLUDING PROVIDING RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES THAT MAY BE REQUIRED POST-BREXIT. IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONAL IMPACTS MENTIONED ABOVE, FACTORS INCLUDING CHANGES IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND BEHAVIOR, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES, CUSTOMS DUTIES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPACT TO OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH A HARD BREXIT.  WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE DEVELOPMENTS. WE BELIEVE THE STEPS WE HAVE TAKEN, AND PLAN TO TAKE IN THE EVENT OF A HARD BREXIT, WILL HELP US MITIGATE THE RISKS THAT WE EXPECT COULD RESULT FROM BREXIT THAT COULD IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO TRADE EFFECTIVELY IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  TARIFFS  TO DATE, THE CURRENT U.S. ADMINISTRATION HAS IMPOSED, AND CONTINUES TO PROPOSE ADDITIONAL TARIFFS ON IMPORTS FROM CHINA. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE DEVELOPMENTS VERY CLOSELY AND HAVE STARTED TO SEE MARGIN PRESSURE BASED ON THE TARIFFS CURRENTLY IN PLACE ON THE GOODS SOURCED DIRECTLY FROM CHINA. THE IMPACT ON VENDOR AND COMPETITOR PRICING, CONSUMER DEMAND, POTENTIAL TARIFF PASS-THROUGHS AND THE FLUCTUATION OF THE CHINESE CURRENCY IS UNCERTAIN.  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 TOTALED $10.5 BILLION, A 6% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER NET SALES OF $9.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 3% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INCREASE COMPARES TO SALES GROWTH OF 12% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH REFLECTS A 7% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 6% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  NET SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 TOTALED $29.5 BILLION, A 6% INCREASE OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S NINE-MONTH NET SALES OF $27.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 3% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 1% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THIS INCREASE COMPARES TO A SALES GROWTH OF 12% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WHICH REFLECTS A 6% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES, A 5% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 1% POSITIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, OUR STORE COUNT INCREASED 5% AND SELLING SQUARE FOOTAGE INCREASED 4% COMPARED TO THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER LAST YEAR.  COMP SALES FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 REFLECT AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC ACROSS ALL MAJOR SEGMENTS. ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, APPAREL AND HOME FASHIONS' PERFORMANCE WAS COMPARABLE FOR THE QUARTER AND APPAREL OUTPERFORMED HOME FASHIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  FOR BOTH THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMP SALES GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. COMP SALES GROWTH FOR TJX INTERNATIONAL WAS ABOVE THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE AND TJX CANADA WAS BELOW THE CONSOLIDATED AVERAGE.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES, OR COMP SALES, TO BE SALES OF STORES THAT HAVE BEEN IN OPERATION FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TWO CONSECUTIVE FISCAL YEARS, OR IN OTHER WORDS, STORES THAT ARE STARTING THEIR THIRD FISCAL YEAR OF OPERATION. WE CALCULATE COMP SALES ON A 52-WEEK BASIS BY COMPARING THE CURRENT AND PRIOR YEAR WEEKLY PERIODS THAT ARE MOST CLOSELY ALIGNED. RELOCATED STORES AND STORES THAT HAVE CHANGED IN SIZE ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE ORIGINAL STORE, AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE STORES ON THE CONSOLIDATED COMP PERCENTAGE IS IMMATERIAL.  WE DEFINE CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO BE THE NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS IN STORES INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AND AVERAGE TICKET TO BE THE AVERAGE RETAIL PRICE OF THE UNITS SOLD. WE DEFINE AVERAGE TRANSACTION OR AVERAGE BASKET TO BE THE AVERAGE DOLLAR VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION.  25  SALES EXCLUDED FROM COMP SALES (\u201cNON-COMP SALES\u201d) CONSIST OF SALES FROM.  \u2013  NEW STORES - STORES THAT HAVE NOT YET MET THE COMP SALES CRITERIA, WHICH REPRESENTS A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF NON-COMP SALES  \u2013  STORES THAT ARE CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME  \u2013  SALES FROM OUR E-COMMERCE SITES, MEANING SIERRA.COM, TJMAXX.COM, MARSHALLS.COM AND TKMAXX.COM  WE DETERMINE WHICH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMP SALES CALCULATION AT THE BEGINNING OF A FISCAL YEAR AND THE CLASSIFICATION REMAINS CONSTANT THROUGHOUT THAT YEAR UNLESS A STORE IS CLOSED PERMANENTLY OR FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD DURING THAT FISCAL YEAR. STARTING IN FISCAL 2020, SIERRA STORES THAT OTHERWISE FIT THE COMP STORE DEFINITION ARE INCLUDED IN COMP STORES IN OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT.  COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS ARE CALCULATED BY TRANSLATING THE CURRENT YEAR\u2019S COMP SALES OF OUR FOREIGN SEGMENTS AT THE SAME EXCHANGE RATES USED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THIS REMOVES THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE ACCURATE MEASURE OF SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  COMP SALES MAY BE REFERRED TO AS \u201cSAME STORE\u201d SALES BY OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES. THE METHOD FOR CALCULATING COMP SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY, THEREFORE OUR MEASURE OF COMP SALES MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAIL COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE FOLLOWING PERIODS.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES  OUR OPERATING RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR OR A DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY IN RELATION TO OTHER CURRENCIES. TWO WAYS IN WHICH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2013  TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN OPERATING RESULTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE TRANSLATE THE OPERATIONS OF TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING CURRENCY RATES IN EFFECT AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN TIME. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS CAN RESULT IN MEANINGFUL VARIATIONS IN NET SALES, NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH AS WELL AS THE NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THESE SEGMENTS. CURRENCY TRANSLATION GENERALLY DOES NOT AFFECT OPERATING MARGINS, OR AFFECTS THEM ONLY SLIGHTLY, AS SALES AND EXPENSES OF THE FOREIGN OPERATIONS ARE TRANSLATED AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME RATES WITHIN A GIVEN PERIOD.  \u2013  INVENTORY-RELATED DERIVATIVES.  WE ROUTINELY ENTER INTO INVENTORY-RELATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT ON EARNINGS OF CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON MERCHANDISE PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE LOCAL CURRENCIES OF OUR DIVISIONS, PRINCIPALLY TJX CANADA AND TJX INTERNATIONAL. AS WE HAVE NOT ELECTED \u201cHEDGE ACCOUNTING\u201d FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS, AS DEFINED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d), WE RECORD A MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD. IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE INCOME STATEMENT IMPACT OF THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT IS EFFECTIVELY OFFSET WHEN THE INVENTORY BEING HEDGED IS RECEIVED AND PAID FOR. WHILE THESE EFFECTS OCCUR EVERY REPORTING PERIOD, THEY ARE OF MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE WHEN THERE ARE SUDDEN AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT ON THESE DERIVATIVES DOES NOT AFFECT NET SALES, BUT IT DOES AFFECT THE COST OF SALES, OPERATING MARGINS AND EARNINGS WE REPORT.  26  WE REFER TO THE IMPACT OF THE ABOVE TWO ITEMS THROUGHOUT OUR DISCUSSION AS \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY.\u201d THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CAN HAVE ON VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE DENOMINATED IN A CURRENCY OTHER THAN AN OPERATING DIVISION\u2019S LOCAL CURRENCY. WHEN DISCUSSING THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF THE EFFECT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ON SUCH TRANSACTIONS WE REFER TO IT AS \u201cTRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE.\u201d  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 71.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 71.1% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 71.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, AN INCREASE OF 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 71.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES GROWTH. MERCHANDISE MARGIN REFLECTS INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE 18.0% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, AN INCREASE OF 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS OVER LAST YEAR\u2019S THIRD QUARTER RATIO OF 17.9%. THE INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WAGE INCREASES AND CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TJX FOUNDATION.  SG&A EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, WERE 18.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND FLAT TO LAST YEAR'S RATIO FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE EXPENSE RATIO REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON OF THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS AND A BENEFIT FROM INSURANCE CLAIM SETTLEMENTS RECEIVED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS AND WAGE INCREASES OFFSET THESE FAVORABLE IMPACTS.  PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, TJX ANNUITIZED AND TRANSFERRED CURRENT PENSION OBLIGATIONS FOR CERTAIN U.S. RETIREES AND BENEFICIARIES UNDER THE FUNDED PLAN THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF A GROUP ANNUITY CONTRACT WITH AN INSURANCE COMPANY. TJX TRANSFERRED $207.4 MILLION OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY, THEREBY REDUCING ITS PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE TRANSACTION HAD NO CASH IMPACT ON TJX BUT DID RESULT IN A NON-CASH PRE-TAX PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE OF $36.1 MILLION.  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  THE COMPONENTS OF INTEREST EXPENSE, NET ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO THE ELIMINATION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT ACCOUNTING AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE A\u2014BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 26.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 27.2% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 25.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 25.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCED IMPACT OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND JURISDICTIONAL MIX OF INCOME.  27  NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE  NET INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $828 MILLION, OR $0.68 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO $762 MILLION, OR $0.61 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE HAD A $0.02 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A $0.01 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND A NEUTRAL IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS $2.3 BILLION, OR $1.86 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO $2.2 BILLION, OR $1.75 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE THIRD QUARTER PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGE HAD A $0.02 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. FOREIGN CURRENCY HAD A $0.01 NEGATIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO A $0.01 POSITIVE IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018.  OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WHICH REDUCE OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING, BENEFITED OUR EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 3% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND 3% FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  SEGMENT INFORMATION  WE OPERATE FOUR MAIN BUSINESS SEGMENTS. OUR MARMAXX SEGMENT (T.J. MAXX, MARSHALLS, TJMAXX.COM AND MARSHALLS.COM) AND THE HOMEGOODS SEGMENT (HOMEGOODS AND HOMESENSE) BOTH OPERATE IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR TJX CANADA SEGMENT OPERATES WINNERS, HOMESENSE AND MARSHALLS IN CANADA, AND OUR TJX INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT OPERATES T.K. MAXX, HOMESENSE AND TKMAXX.COM IN EUROPE AND T.K. MAXX IN AUSTRALIA. IN ADDITION TO OUR FOUR MAIN SEGMENTS, SIERRA OPERATES SIERRA.COM AND RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THE RESULTS OF SIERRA ARE INCLUDED IN THE MARMAXX SEGMENT.  WE EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SEGMENTS BASED ON \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d WHICH WE DEFINE AS PRE-TAX INCOME OR LOSS BEFORE GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS,\u201d AS WE DEFINE THE TERM, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER ENTITIES. THE TERMS \u201cSEGMENT MARGIN\u201d OR \u201cSEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN\u201d ARE USED TO DESCRIBE SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.

THE INCREASE FOR BOTH THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE-MONTH PERIOD REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES AND A 2% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. GEOGRAPHICALLY, COMP SALES GROWTH FOR THE QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS STRONGEST IN THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST REGIONS. HOME FASHIONS OUTPERFORMED APPAREL FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN INCREASED TO 12.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 12.8% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS DRIVEN BY STORE EXPENSE SAVINGS, LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020 AND EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET THE HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS. MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS FLAT TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES WERE OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON AND REDUCED MARKDOWNS.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 13.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 13.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. THESE ITEMS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020, EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG COMP SALES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION CLAIMS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE HURRICANE DAMAGE IN PUERTO RICO. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DUE TO INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES WHICH WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON AND REDUCED MARKDOWNS.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, MARMAXX MADE ONLINE SHOPPING AVAILABLE AT WWW.MARSHALLS.COM, ITS NEW E-COMMERCE WEBSITE. OUR U.S. E-COMMERCE BUSINESSES, WHICH REPRESENT LESS THAN 3% OF MARMAXX\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019, DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR SEGMENT MARGIN COMPARISONS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020.  29  HOMEGOODS  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,582  $1,464  $4,404  $4,061  SEGMENT PROFIT  $173  $166  $439  $456  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  10.9%  11.3%  10.0%  11.2%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  1%  7%  \u2014%  4%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE THIRD QUARTER REPRESENTS A 7% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND 1% COMP SALES. THE NINE-MONTH INCREASE IN NET SALES REPRESENTS AN INCREASE OF 8% FROM NON-COMP SALES AND FLAT COMP SALES. THE 1% COMP SALES INCREASE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 10.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 11.3% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE COMP SALES AND THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN. THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS DUE TO STRONG MARKON AND LOWER MARKDOWNS WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET FREIGHT COSTS AND TARIFF PRESSURES.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 10.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 11.2% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE DECLINE IN SEGMENT MARGIN FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE COMP SALES, THE INVESTMENT IN STORE GROWTH AND HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS.  30  FOREIGN SEGMENTS  TJX CANADA  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,082  $1,037  $2,897  $2,828  SEGMENT PROFIT  $170  $182  $386  $446  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  15.7%  17.6%  13.3%  15.8%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  2%  5%  1%  5%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE THIRD QUARTER REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 2% INCREASE IN COMP SALES GROWTH, OFFSET BY A 2% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE NINE-MONTH INCREASE IN NET SALES REPRESENTS A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES AND A 1% INCREASE FROM COMP SALES GROWTH, OFFSET BY A 3% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE AVERAGE BASKET.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 15.7% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 17.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSSES, HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN STORE PAYROLL, DUE TO WAGE INCREASES, COLLECTIVELY REDUCED SEGMENT MARGIN BY 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION A DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE 2% COMP SALES GROWTH, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE FISCAL 2020 SEGMENT MARGIN AS COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. THE HIGHER COST OF MERCHANDISE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS PUT PRESSURE ON THE THIRD QUARTER MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE MARKON.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 13.3% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 15.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. MERCHANDISE MARGIN DECREASED BY 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE COST OF MERCHANDISE. CURRENCY EXCHANGE LOSSES, HIGHER SUPPLY CHAIN COSTS AND AN INCREASE IN STORE PAYROLL COLLECTIVELY REDUCED SEGMENT MARGIN BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION, SEGMENT MARGIN REFLECTS AN UNFAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON RELATED TO A LEASE BUYOUT GAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND EXPENSE DELEVERAGE ON THE 1% COMP SALES GROWTH.  31  TJX INTERNATIONAL  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED  U.S. DOLLARS IN MILLIONS  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET SALES  $1,433  $1,352  $3,947  $3,754  SEGMENT PROFIT  $99  $102  $178  $192  SEGMENT PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  6.9%  7.6%  4.5%  5.1%  INCREASE IN COMP SALES  6%  3%  7%  3%  STORES IN OPERATION AT END OF PERIOD.

THE INCREASE IN THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD REPRESENTS A 7% INCREASE IN COMP SALES GROWTH AND A 4% INCREASE FROM NON-COMP SALES, OFFSET BY A 6% NEGATIVE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE INCREASE IN COMP SALES FOR BOTH PERIODS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN CUSTOMER TRAFFIC. E-COMMERCE SALES REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 3% OF TJX INTERNATIONAL\u2019S NET SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 6.9% FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO 7.6% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THIS DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020, A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES, OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE GAINS AND EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG 6% COMP SALES GROWTH. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE ON THE COST OF MERCHANDISE.  SEGMENT PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 4.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO 5.1% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THIS DECREASE IN SEGMENT MARGIN WAS DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR MARK-TO-MARKET IMPACT OF THE INVENTORY DERIVATIVES, HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS IN FISCAL 2020 AND A DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN OFFSET BY THE EXPENSE LEVERAGE ON THE STRONG 7% COMP SALES GROWTH. THE DECLINE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN IS DUE TO THE SAME FACTORS IMPACTING THE QUARTER AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES. THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT OF OUR FUEL HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES, INCLUDING BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TJX FOUNDATION MADE DURING THE QUARTER.  GENERAL CORPORATE EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON FROM THE CORPORATE IT RESTRUCTURING COSTS MADE IN FISCAL 2019. THE IMPACT OF THIS ITEM WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY COSTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  32  ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN FUNDED THROUGH CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SUPPLEMENTED, AS NEEDED, BY SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BANK BORROWINGS OR COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING.  WE BELIEVE OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS AND OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, DESCRIBED IN NOTE I \u2013LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT LINES OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ARE MORE THAN ADEQUATE TO MEET OUR OPERATING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR.  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HELD $2.1 BILLION IN CASH AND NO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY $0.8 BILLION OF OUR CASH WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WITH $0.4 BILLION HELD IN COUNTRIES WHERE WE PROVISIONALLY INTEND TO INDEFINITELY REINVEST ANY UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS. TJX PROVIDED FOR ALL APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON ALL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES IN CANADA, PUERTO RICO, ITALY, INDIA, HONG KONG AND VIETNAM THROUGH NOVEMBER 2, 2019. IF WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM SUCH SUBSIDIARIES, WE SHOULD NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL TAX EXPENSE AND OUR CASH WOULD BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF WITHHOLDING TAXES PAID.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.9 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND $2.5 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN EACH OF THESE FISCAL PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING EARNINGS.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR THE  FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED  BY $0.6 BILLION COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE  DECREASE  IN OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, NET OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE OF $0.4 BILLION.  IN ADDITION, LAST YEAR'S FIRST QUARTER CASH FLOWS WERE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PREFUNDING OF CERTAIN SERVICE CONTRACTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF $1.0 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND $0.4 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018. THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR BOTH PERIODS WERE DRIVEN BY CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY REFLECTED PROPERTY ADDITIONS FOR NEW STORES, STORE IMPROVEMENTS AND RENOVATIONS AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN OUR OFFICES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING BUYING AND MERCHANDISING SYSTEMS AND OTHER INFORMATION SYSTEMS. CASH OUTFLOWS FOR PROPERTY ADDITIONS WERE $1.0 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.9 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. WE ANTICIPATE THAT CAPITAL SPENDING FOR FISCAL 2020 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION. WE PLAN TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS.  WE PURCHASED $0.2 BILLION OF INVESTMENTS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, AND THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY $0.6 BILLION OF INFLOWS RELATED TO INVESTMENTS THAT WERE SOLD OR MATURED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. THE FISCAL 2019 INVESTING ACTIVITY PRIMARILY RELATED TO SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WHICH HAD INITIAL MATURITIES IN EXCESS OF 90 DAYS AND ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS CASH ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS PRESENTED.  ON NOVEMBER 18, 2019, THE COMPANY INVESTED $0.2 BILLION IN FAMILIA, AN ESTABLISHED OFF-PRICE APPAREL AND HOME FASHION RETAIL CHAIN IN RUSSIA.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES RESULTED IN NET CASH OUTFLOWS OF $1.8 BILLION IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  AND $2.1 BILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018.  THESE CASH OUTFLOWS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY EQUITY REPURCHASES AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  EQUITY  UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS, WE PAID $1.2 BILLION TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE 22.2 MILLION SHARES OF OUR STOCK ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. THESE OUTFLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, NET OF SHARES WITHHELD FOR TAXES IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020. WE PAID $1.6 BILLION TO REPURCHASE AND RETIRE 33.9 MILLION SHARES ON A SETTLEMENT BASIS IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING EQUITY REPURCHASES, SEE NOTE D \u2013 CAPITAL STOCK AND EARNINGS PER SHARE OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  33  IN FEBRUARY 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $3.0 BILLION OF TJX COMMON STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. IN FEBRUARY 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $1.5 BILLION OF TJX STOCK FROM TIME TO TIME. AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PLANS. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION TO $1.75 BILLION OF STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN FISCAL 2020. WE DETERMINE THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REPURCHASES BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING EXCESS CASH FLOW, LIQUIDITY, ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR ASSESSMENT OF PROSPECTS FOR OUR BUSINESS, LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS.  AS SUCH, WE MAY ADJUST THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF THESE PURCHASES.  DIVIDENDS  WE DECLARED QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WHICH TOTALED $0.69 PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.585 PER SHARE IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019. CASH PAYMENTS FOR DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK TOTALED $0.8 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 AND $0.7 BILLION FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (DOLLAR AND SHARE AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  OVERVIEW  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, NET EARNINGS OF $126, OR $0.81 PER DILUTED SHARE, EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS, DEMONSTRATING SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR STRATEGY AND STRENGTH OF OUR OPERATING DISCIPLINE. OUR NET SALES DECREASE OF 2.2% WAS IN-LINE WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, REFLECTING IMPROVED SALES TRENDS ACROSS OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THE CONSISTENT STRENGTH OF OUR INVENTORY AND EXPENSE EXECUTION CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED PROFITABILITY FOR THE QUARTER. WE MAINTAINED A POSITIVE SPREAD BETWEEN SALES AND INVENTORY FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE QUARTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE REALIZED $170 IN EXPENSE SAVINGS YEAR-TO-DATE, EXPECTING TO EXCEED OUR PLAN OF $150 TO $200 FOR THE YEAR.  THE FOLLOWING ACHIEVEMENTS DEMONSTRATE OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE CUSTOMER AND EXECUTION.  KEY EVENTS  \u2014 TO DRIVE OUR TOP AND BOTTOM-LINE RESULTS, WE MADE NOTABLE CHANGES TO TWO KEY EVENTS: ANNIVERSARY SALE AND HOLIDAY. WE IMPROVED THE ECONOMICS OF OUR ANNIVERSARY SALE EVENT, WHICH POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTED TO MERCHANDISE MARGINS IN THE THIRD QUARTER. FOR THE HOLIDAYS, WE ARE MEANINGFULLY EXPANDING OUR GIFTING OFFER ACROSS FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE, MAKING IT EASIER FOR CUSTOMERS TO FIND GIFTS BY RECIPIENT AND PRICE POINT.  OFF-PRICE  \u2014 WE IMPROVED INVENTORY FLOW, REFINED PRODUCT ALLOCATION AND EMPHASIZED SEASONALLY RELEVANT MERCHANDISE. AS A RESULT, WE DELIVERED POSITIVE SALES GROWTH ON LESS INVENTORY AND INCREASED INVENTORY TURN FOR THE EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER. COMBINED WITH OUR STRONG EXPENSE EXECUTION, WE EXCEEDED OUR BOTTOM-LINE EXPECTATIONS.  MARKET STRATEGY  \u2014 OUR MARKET STRATEGY LEVERAGES INVENTORY TO SERVE CUSTOMERS ON THEIR TERMS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN DIGITAL CAPABILITIES AND IN PEOPLE, PRODUCT AND PLACE. OUR GOAL IS TO GAIN MARKET SHARE WHILE DRIVING CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT AND INVENTORY EFFICIENCIES. THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS TO THIS STRATEGY: FIRST, WE ARE PROVIDING CUSTOMERS A GREATER SELECTION OF PRODUCT AVAILABLE FOR NEXT-DAY PICKUP OR DELIVERY, WITHOUT INCREASING INVENTORY LEVELS. SECOND, WE ARE INCREASING ENGAGEMENT WITH CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING EXPRESS SERVICES SUCH AS ORDER PICKUP, RETURNS AND ALTERATIONS AT ADDITIONAL LOCATIONS.  SINCE SCALING OUR MARKET STRATEGY IN LOS ANGELES, THIRD QUARTER SALES GROWTH OUTPACED OTHER MARKETS BY APPROXIMATELY 100 BASIS POINTS. WE RECENTLY ACCELERATED OUR MARKET STRATEGY TO NEW YORK, SAN FRANCISCO, CHICAGO AND DALLAS AND WILL EXPAND TO OUR REMAINING TOP TEN MARKETS BY THE END OF 2020.  NEW YORK  \u2014 WE ACHIEVED AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE WITH THE OPENING OF OUR NEW YORK CITY FLAGSHIP STORE, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING OUR PRESENCE IN THE WORLD\u2019S TOP RETAIL MARKET. WE SAW A STRONG CUSTOMER RESPONSE WITH 85,000 VISITS DURING THE OPENING WEEKEND ALONE. IN THE BROADER NEW YORK CITY MARKET, CUSTOMERS HAVE FASTER ACCESS TO INVENTORY ACROSS EIGHT FLS STORES, INCLUDING OUR FLAGSHIP AND FULFILLMENT CENTER. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE ENGAGING WITH CUSTOMERS BY OFFERING EXPRESS SERVICES AT NORDSTROM LOCAL AND NORDSTROM RACK LOCATIONS.  WE MADE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND CONTINUING OUR OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE. WE ARE ENCOURAGED BY THE MOMENTUM IN OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES AS WE EXECUTE OUR HOLIDAY STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH NORDSTROM AS A GIFTING DESTINATION FOR CUSTOMERS.  17  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  IN OUR ONGOING EFFORT TO ENHANCE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE ACROSS OUR CHANNELS. WE INVESTED EARLY IN OUR OMNI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES, INTEGRATING OUR OPERATIONS, MERCHANDISING AND TECHNOLOGY ACROSS OUR STORES AND ONLINE, IN BOTH OUR FULL-PRICE AND OFF-PRICE BUSINESSES. WHILE OUR CUSTOMERS MAY ENGAGE WITH US THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS, WE KNOW THEY VALUE THE OVERALL NORDSTROM BRAND EXPERIENCE AND VIEW US SIMPLY AS NORDSTROM, WHICH IS ULTIMATELY HOW WE VIEW OUR BUSINESS. WE HAVE ONE RETAIL REPORTABLE SEGMENT AND ANALYZE OUR RESULTS ON A TOTAL COMPANY BASIS.  WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE THROUGH MARKET SHARE, OPERATIONAL AND NET SALES METRICS. AS THIS IS HOW WE MEASURE OUR PERFORMANCE, AND AS COMPARABLE SALES GROWTH IS EXPECTED TO APPROXIMATE NET SALES GROWTH IN  2019  , WE ONLY REPORT CHANGES IN NET SALES.

SALES TRENDS IMPROVED BY MORE THAN 200 BASIS POINTS FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, DRIVEN BY AGGRESSIVE ACTION TAKEN RELATED TO LOYALTY, DIGITAL MARKETING AND MERCHANDISE ASSORTMENT. DIGITAL SALES INCREASED  7%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  AND  6%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018. WE SAW SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN DIGITAL TRENDS THROUGHOUT THE QUARTER. IN OCTOBER 2019, WE EXPANDED NORDSTROM NYC WITH THE OPENING OF OUR FLAGSHIP STORE. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE OPENED ONE FLS STORE, FIVE NORDSTROM RACK STORES AND TWO NORDSTROM LOCALS AND CLOSED SIX FLS STORES.  FULL-PRICE NET SALES  DECREASED  4.1%  AND  5.3%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN  2018  . FULL-PRICE SALES REFLECTED A DECREASE IN NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER ITEM SOLD FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  . THE TOP-PERFORMING MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES WERE ACCESSORIES AND SHOES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND SHOES AND ACCESSORIES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  OFF-PRICE NET SALES  INCREASED  1.2%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  AND  DECREASED  0.4%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIODS IN  2018  . OFF-PRICE SALES REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE SELLING PRICE PER ITEM SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ITEMS SOLD FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF 2019  . MEN\u2019S AND WOMEN\u2019S WERE THE TOP-PERFORMING MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER  AND FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019.

THE  INCREASE  S OF  $6  AND  $13  FOR THE QUARTER AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019  WERE PRIMARILY A RESULT OF GROWING THE RELATED RECEIVABLES AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE.  18  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  ADJUSTED ROIC (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  WE BELIEVE THAT ADJUSTED ROIC IS A USEFUL FINANCIAL MEASURE FOR INVESTORS AND CREDIT AGENCIES IN EVALUATING THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CAPITAL WE HAVE INVESTED IN OUR BUSINESS TO GENERATE RETURNS OVER TIME. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE INCORPORATED IT IN OUR EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE MEASURES AND WE BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 RETURN OVER THE LONG TERM.  FOR 2019, INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY FOR ADJUSTED NET OPERATING PROFIT AND BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS FOR AVERAGE INVESTED CAPITAL ARE COMPRISED OF THREE QUARTERS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE  LEASE STANDARD  FOR 2019, AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD. UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD, WE ESTIMATED THE VALUE OF OUR OPERATING LEASES AS IF THEY MET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL LEASES OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES. THIS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT ESTIMATED THE INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING LEASES. ESTIMATED DEPRECIATION ON CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES AND AVERAGE ESTIMATED ASSET BASE OF CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES ARE NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, NOR AN ALTERNATIVE FOR,  GAAP  AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP.  ADJUSTED ROIC IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, RETURN ON ASSETS, NET EARNINGS, TOTAL ASSETS OR OTHER GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED UNDER GAAP WHICH IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED ROIC IS RETURN ON ASSETS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS TO ADJUSTED ROIC.

OPERATING LEASE INTEREST IS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING LEASE COST RECORDED IN OCCUPANCY COSTS AND IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEASE STANDARD.  2  CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES IS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE ASSET BASE WE WOULD RECORD FOR OUR LEASES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD IF THEY HAD MET THE CRITERIA FOR A FINANCE LEASE OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTY. THE ASSET BASE FOR EACH QUARTER IS CALCULATED AS THE TRAILING FOUR QUARTERS OF RENT EXPENSE MULTIPLIED BY EIGHT, A COMMONLY USED METHOD TO ESTIMATE THE ASSET BASE WE WOULD RECORD FOR OUR CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASES.  3  FOR LEASES WITH PROPERTY INCENTIVES THAT EXCEED THE  ROU ASSETS  , WE RECLASSIFY THE AMOUNT FROM ASSETS TO OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD, WE REDUCE AVERAGE TOTAL ASSETS, AS THIS BETTER REFLECTS HOW WE MANAGE OUR BUSINESS.  4  RESULTS FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018 INCLUDED THE $72 IMPACT RELATED TO THE  ESTIMATED NON-RECURRING CHARGE  , WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RETURN ON ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY 60 BASIS POINTS AND ADJUSTED ROIC BY APPROXIMATELY 80 BASIS POINTS. FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD NEGATIVELY IMPACTED RETURN ON ASSETS BY APPROXIMATELY 90 BASIS POINTS AND ADJUSTED ROIC BY APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS.  21  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS, AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY AND POTENTIAL FUTURE BORROWINGS ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND.  OVER THE LONG TERM, WE MANAGE OUR CASH AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE TO MAXIMIZE SHAREHOLDER RETURN, MAINTAIN OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, MANAGE REFINANCING RISK AND ALLOW FLEXIBILITY FOR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES. WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR DEBT AND LEVERAGE LEVELS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS, DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS, DIVIDEND PAYOUTS, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES AND OTHER FUTURE INVESTMENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , OUR EXISTING CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON-HAND OF  $487  , AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITY OF  $800  AND POTENTIAL FUTURE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THESE SCHEDULED FUTURE PAYMENTS AND POTENTIAL LONG-TERM INITIATIVES.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $269  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO NORDSTROM NYC AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK, INCLUDING OUR OMNI-CHANNEL CENTER.  THE OPENING OF OUR FIRST LARGE-SCALE OMNI-CHANNEL CENTER IN RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA, WHICH WILL INITIALLY SUPPORT OUR FULL-PRICE CUSTOMERS IN THE WEST COAST REGION AND OFF-PRICE CUSTOMERS IN THE FUTURE, IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN THE SPRING OF 2020. WE ALSO PLAN TO OPEN A SMALLER LOCAL OMNI-CHANNEL HUB IN TORRANCE, CALIFORNIA BY THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WHICH WILL SUPPORT THE GREATER LOS ANGELES MARKET AS PART OF OUR MARKET STRATEGY.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $74  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY EXECUTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  22  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  (CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  FREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  FREE CASH FLOW IS ONE OF OUR KEY LIQUIDITY MEASURES, AND WHEN USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAAP MEASURES, WE BELIEVE IT PROVIDES INVESTORS WITH A MEANINGFUL ANALYSIS OF OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OUR BUSINESS.  FREE CASH FLOW IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OPERATING CASH FLOWS OR OTHER FINANCIAL MEASURES PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

ADJUSTED EBITDA EXCLUDES SIGNIFICANT ITEMS WHICH ARE NON-OPERATING IN NATURE IN ORDER TO EVALUATE OUR CORE OPERATING PERFORMANCE AGAINST PRIOR PERIODS. THE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED UNDER GAAP WHICH IS MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE TO ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NET EARNINGS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET EARNINGS, OVERALL CHANGE IN CASH OR LIQUIDITY OF THE BUSINESS AS A WHOLE. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

PROVIDED THAT WE OBTAIN WRITTEN CONSENT FROM OUR LENDERS, WE HAVE THE OPTION TO INCREASE THE REVOLVER BY UP TO  $200  , TO A TOTAL OF  $1,000  , AND  TWO  OPTIONS TO EXTEND THE REVOLVER BY ONE YEAR. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE HAD  NO  BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVER. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CREDIT FACILITIES, SEE  NOTE 5: DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES  IN  ITEM 1.  IMPACT OF CREDIT RATINGS  CHANGES IN OUR CREDIT RATINGS MAY IMPACT OUR COSTS TO BORROW AND MAY REQUIRE WE HOLD COLLATERAL.  FOR OUR REVOLVER, THE INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO ANY BORROWINGS WE MAY ENTER INTO DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF BORROWING INCURRED PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN, WHICH IS DETERMINED BASED ON OUR CREDIT RATINGS. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND OUTLOOK WERE AS FOLLOWS.

(CONTINUED)  (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  SHOULD THE RATINGS ASSIGNED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT IMPROVE, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER MAY DECREASE, RESULTING IN A LOWER BORROWING COST UNDER THIS FACILITY. CONVERSELY, SHOULD THE RATINGS ASSIGNED TO OUR LONG-TERM DEBT WORSEN, THE APPLICABLE MARGIN ASSOCIATED WITH ANY BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVER MAY INCREASE, RESULTING IN A HIGHER BORROWING COST UNDER THIS FACILITY.  DEBT COVENANTS  THE REVOLVER REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR LEVERAGE RATIO OF NO MORE THAN FOUR TIMES. THE REVOLVER\u2019S RATIO CALCULATION METHODOLOGY HAS NOT BEEN IMPACTED BY THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS COVENANT.  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR  IS ONE OF OUR KEY FINANCIAL METRICS AND WE BELIEVE THAT OUR DEBT LEVELS ARE BEST ANALYZED USING THIS MEASURE, AS IT PROVIDES A REFLECTION OF OUR CREDIT WORTHINESS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR CREDIT RATING AND BORROWING COSTS. OUR GOAL IS TO MANAGE DEBT LEVELS TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT RATING WHILE OPERATING WITH AN EFFICIENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE.  FOR 2019, INCOME STATEMENT ACTIVITY FOR ADJUSTED EBITDAR IS COMPRISED OF THREE QUARTERS OF ACTIVITY UNDER THE LEASE STANDARD FOR 2019 AND THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD. BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS ARE AS OF THE END OF THE QUARTER, AND UNDER THE NEW LEASE STANDARD FOR 2019 AND THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD FOR 2018. UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE STANDARD, WE ESTIMATED THE VALUE OF OUR OPERATING LEASES AS IF THEY MET THE CRITERIA FOR CAPITAL LEASES OR WE HAD PURCHASED THE PROPERTIES. THIS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION THAT ESTIMATED THE INVESTMENT IN OUR OPERATING LEASES. ESTIMATED CAPITALIZED OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY IS NOT CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, NOR AN ALTERNATIVE FOR, GAAP AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTION FOR OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP.  ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR IS NOT A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, DEBT TO NET EARNINGS, NET EARNINGS, DEBT OR OTHER GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. OUR METHOD OF DETERMINING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER COMPANIES\u2019 METHODS AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

FOR THE FOUR QUARTERS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE STANDARD HAD NO IMPACT ON DEBT TO NET EARNINGS NOR ADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR.  24  OF 28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES REFERRED TO IN OUR  2018  ANNUAL REPORT HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. OUR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT AND SELECTION OF THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT & FINANCE COMMITTEE OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

NON-GAAP MEASURES  SIGNET PROVIDES CERTAIN NON-GAAP INFORMATION IN REPORTING ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS TO GIVE INVESTORS ADDITIONAL DATA TO EVALUATE ITS OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHEN REVIEWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, CAN PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION TO ASSIST INVESTORS IN EVALUATING HISTORICAL TRENDS AND CURRENT PERIOD PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE REASONS, INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING ALSO INCLUDES NON-GAAP MEASURES. ITEMS MAY BE EXCLUDED FROM GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WHEN THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS PROVIDES GREATER CLARITY TO MANAGEMENT AND INVESTORS.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, AND NOT SUPERIOR TO OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER PUBLICLY FILED REPORTS. IN ADDITION, OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY NOT BE THE SAME AS OR COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR NON-GAAP MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  1. NET DEBT  NET DEBT IS THE TOTAL OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS LESS LOANS, OVERDRAFTS AND LONG-TERM DEBT. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS METRIC TO BE HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THE TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS OF THE COMPANY AFTER CONSIDERATION OF LIQUIDITY AVAILABLE FROM CASH BALANCES ON-HAND.

FREE CASH FLOW  FREE CASH FLOW IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED AS THE NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING HOW THE BUSINESS IS GENERATING CASH FROM ITS OPERATING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES THAT CAN BE USED TO MEET THE FINANCING NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS. FREE CASH FLOW IS AN INDICATOR FREQUENTLY USED BY MANAGEMENT IN EVALUATING ITS OVERALL LIQUIDITY AND DETERMINING APPROPRIATE CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGIES. FREE CASH FLOW DOES NOT REPRESENT THE RESIDUAL CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR DISCRETIONARY EXPENDITURES.

EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) AND ADJUSTED EBITDA  EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE DEFINED AS EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND INCOME TAXES (OPERATING INCOME), DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. EBITDA IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IT EXCLUDES THE EFFECTS OF FINANCING AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES BY ELIMINATING THE EFFECTS OF INTEREST, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION COSTS. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS A NON-GAAP MEASURE WHICH FURTHER EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT AND UNUSUAL ITEMS WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE DURING A PERIOD. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE FINANCIAL MEASURES ENHANCE INVESTORS\u2019 ABILITY TO ANALYZE TRENDS IN THE BUSINESS AND EVALUATE PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO OTHER COMPANIES. MANAGEMENT ALSO UTILIZES THESE METRICS TO EVALUATE ITS CURRENT CREDIT PROFILE, WHICH IS A VIEW CONSISTENT WITH RATING AGENCY METHODOLOGIES.  13 WEEKS ENDED  39 WEEKS ENDED  (IN MILLIONS)  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  NET INCOME (LOSS)  $(35.5  )  $(29.9  )  $(81.6  )  $(549.5  )  INCOME TAX BENEFIT  (6.0  )  (29.2  )  (3.7  )  (159.1  )  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME  (7.0  )  (0.3  )  (7.5  )  (1.4  )  INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  8.6  10.6  27.9  28.9  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  43.7  44.7  129.5  138.4  AMORTIZATION OF UNFAVORABLE LEASES AND CONTRACTS  (1.4  )  (1.8  )  (4.1  )  (5.9  )  EBITDA  $2.4  $(5.9  )  $60.5  $(548.6  )  CREDIT TRANSACTION, NET  \u2014  0.4  \u2014  167.4  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES - COST OF SALES  1.4  \u2014  5.8  63.2  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  9.2  9.5  59.4  35.6  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS  \u2014  \u2014  47.7  448.7  ADJUSTED EBITDA  $13.0  $4.0  $173.4  $166.3  4.

MANAGEMENT FINDS THE INFORMATION USEFUL WHEN ANALYZING FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATELY EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT AND UNUSUAL ITEMS.

INTEREST EXPENSE, NET  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER, NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $8.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $10.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR  THIRD  QUARTER. THIS REDUCTION RESULTED FROM LOWER AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE QUARTER COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES DUE TO THE DEBT REFINANCING DURING THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR. SEE NOTE 17 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  IN THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD, NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $27.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $28.9 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE CURRENT QUARTER ETR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY PRE-TAX EARNINGS MIX BY JURISDICTION. THE PRIOR YEAR TAX BENEFIT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY: 1) RESTRUCTURING CHARGES RELATED TO THE TRANSFORMATION PLAN; 2) A LOSS RECOGNIZED IN THE U.S. ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE NON-PRIME RECEIVABLES; AND 3) PRE-TAX EARNINGS MIX BY JURISDICTION.  IN THE YEAR TO DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020, THE INCOME TAX BENEFIT WAS  $3.7 MILLION  , AN ETR OF  4.3%  , COMPARED TO INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  $159.1 MILLION  , AN ETR OF  22.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.

SEE NOTE  14  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED IN EACH PERIOD.  \u2022  NON-CASH RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $17.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $80.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, A DECREASE OF $62.3 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $63.2 MILLION INVENTORY CHARGE RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DECREASED  $8.9 MILLION  TO  $129.5 MILLION  FROM  $138.4 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  \u2022  CASH PROVIDED BY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TOTALED  $2.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $55.1 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OUTSOURCING OF THE NORTH AMERICA PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. SEE NOTE  11  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE OUTSOURCING OF THIS CREDIT PROGRAM AND PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD ALSO INCLUDED CASH PROCEEDS OF $445.5 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF ELIGIBLE NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE FINANCE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS A NON-CASH LOSS OF $160.4 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE CREDIT TRANSACTION.  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THE PAYMENT PLANS PARTICIPATION RATE WAS  51.5%  COMPARED TO  52.5%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. THESE RATES REFLECT ACTIVITY FOR CREDIT PROGRAM CUSTOMERS IN NORTH AMERICA, INCLUDING LEASE PURCHASE CUSTOMERS. THE DECLINE IN PARTICIPATION RATE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY A CONTINUED TREND OF LOWER CREDIT APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS TRANSITION TO AN OUTSOURCED CREDIT STRUCTURE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  TOTAL NORTH AMERICA SALES (EXCLUDING JAMES ALLEN)  (1)  (MILLIONS)  $3,445.6  $3,538.6  CREDIT AND LEASE PURCHASE SALES (MILLIONS)  $1,773.5  $1,857.6  CREDIT AND LEASE PURCHASE SALES AS % OF TOTAL NORTH AMERICA SALES  (1)  51.5%  52.5%  (1)  EXCLUDES JAMES ALLEN SALES TOTALING  $166.4 MILLION  AND  $160.2 MILLION  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  AND  NOVEMBER 3, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY, AS IN-HOUSE CREDIT WAS NOT AVAILABLE TO JAMES ALLEN CUSTOMERS DURING THE PERIOD.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR INVENTORY WAS  $133.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH USED OF  $456.6 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD. TOTAL INVENTORY AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  WAS  $2.52 BILLION  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE QUARTER BALANCE OF  $2.65 BILLION  , REFLECTING THE COMPANY\u2019S STRATEGY TO EXIT LOW-PRICED OWNED BRANDED BEADS AND THE DISPOSITION OF SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENTS IN BRIDAL AND CERTAIN FASHION COLLECTIONS. CASH USED FOR INVENTORY DECREASED BY  $323.6 MILLION  FROM PRIOR YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES AND LIQUIDATION OF DISCONTINUED BRANDS AND COLLECTIONS.  DURING THE  39 WEEKS ENDED  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , THE COMPANY CONTINUED THE PROCESS TO LIQUIDATE THE INVENTORY OF DISCONTINUED BRANDS AND COLLECTIONS IDENTIFIED AS PART OF THE PLAN. THE PROCEEDS RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY FOR THE ITEMS LIQUIDATED TO DATE  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  APPROXIMATED THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE MANAGEMENT ESTIMATED WHEN RECORDING THE CHARGE DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AS OF  NOVEMBER 2, 2019  , INVENTORY REPRESENTING $30.9 MILLION OF THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 REMAINS ON HAND.  \u2022  CASH PROVIDED BY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WAS  $183.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $106.5 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH INVENTORY PURCHASES IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES WAS  $30.5 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $7.3 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH PAYROLL-RELATED ITEMS INCLUDING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND ADVERTISING.  \u2022  CASH USED FOR INCOME TAXES WAS  $7.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED FROM INCOME TAXES OF  $2.0 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER STATE AND FOREIGN PAYMENTS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.  FORWARD-FLOW RECEIVABLES OUTSOURCING AGREEMENT WITH INVESTORS  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SALE OF THE MAJORITY OF SIGNET\u2019S NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO CARVAL AND CASTLELAKE (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cINVESTORS\u201d), BEGINNING IN JUNE 2018, THE INVESTORS BEGAN PURCHASING THE MAJORITY OF FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES OF SIGNET\u2019S NON-PRIME CREDIT FROM SIGNET FOR A FIVE-YEAR TERM. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN OUR FORM 8-K ON MARCH 12, 2018, THE INVESTORS WILL HAVE A RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE PURCHASE OF THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES IF THE REALIZED YIELD FALLS BELOW AN AGREED UPON THRESHOLD MEASURED AT CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATES. WHILE THE BACK BOOK RECEIVABLES CONTINUE TO PERFORM AT OR ABOVE THE EXPECTED LEVELS, AND WHILE SIGNET BELIEVES THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES HAVE A LIFETIME PROJECTED CUMULATIVE NET YIELD THAT IS IN-LINE WITH THE MARKET RATE EXPECTATIONS SET FORTH IN THE AGREEMENT, SIGNET EXPECTS THAT ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE NEXT CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATE, THE REALIZED YIELD FOR THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES WILL TEMPORARILY BE BELOW THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD, WHICH WILL TECHNICALLY GIVE THE INVESTORS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INVESTORS WILL NOT TERMINATE THE FORWARD FLOW AGREEMENT ON A GO FORWARD BASIS BASED ON THE SHORT TERM REALIZED YIELD AT THE DECEMBER 31, 2019 MEASUREMENT, THE INVESTORS HAVE INFORMED SIGNET THAT, SUBJECT TO THEIR RESERVATION OF RIGHTS, THEY DO NOT INTEND TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON DECEMBER 31, 2019. SIGNET FURTHER BELIEVES THAT THE INVESTORS ARE RECEIVING AN ATTRACTIVE RETURN ON THEIR INVESTMENT SUCH THAT A TERMINATION BY ONE OR BOTH OF THE INVESTORS IS UNLIKELY.  THIS TERMINATION RIGHT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AT LEAST JUNE 30, 2020, THE NEXT SUBSEQUENT CONTRACTUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. THE CUMULATIVE NET YIELD IS EXPECTED TO RISE THROUGHOUT THE SPRING AND MAY EXCEED THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD BY THIS DATE. THIS SHORTFALL TO THE AGREED UPON CUMULATIVE NET YIELD THRESHOLD, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE TEMPORARY, IS PRIMARILY CAUSED BY VINTAGES THAT WERE ORIGINATED NEAR THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM EXPERIENCING HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED CHARGE OFF RATES AND LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED COLLECTION RATES. THE UNDERLYING ISSUES DRIVING THOSE SUBOPTIMAL CHARGE OFF AND COLLECTION RATES WERE ADDRESSED AND THE NON-PRIME MDR WAS INCREASED IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020. SUBSEQUENT VINTAGES, INCLUDING ALL VINTAGES SOLD IN THIS FISCAL YEAR, ARE EXPECTED TO PERFORM ABOVE THE AGREED UPON THRESHOLD.  THIS TERMINATION RIGHT HAS NO IMPACT ON THE SALE OF THE NON-PRIME IN-HOUSE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMPLETED IN JUNE 2018 AND ONLY APPLIES TO FUTURE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES ON A GO-FORWARD BASIS, WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 7% OF SIGNET\u2019S ANNUAL REVENUE. IF ONE BUT NOT BOTH INVESTORS TERMINATE, THE NON-TERMINATING INVESTOR HAS THE OPTION TO BEGIN PURCHASING 100% OF THE FORWARD FLOW RECEIVABLES OR SOME OTHER PERCENTAGE AS NEGOTIATED BETWEEN SIGNET AND THE NON-TERMINATING INVESTOR. EVEN IF THE INVESTORS WERE TO TERMINATE THE FORWARD FLOW AGREEMENT, SIGNET BELIEVES SUCH TERMINATION WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BECAUSE OTHER POTENTIAL PROVIDERS CAN SUPPLY A SIMILAR THIRD-PARTY CREDIT PROGRAM AND ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT OPTIONS SUCH AS LEASING ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.

PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CASEY\u2019S GENERAL STORES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE \"COMPANY\" OR \"CASEY\u2019S\") OPERATE  2,181  CONVENIENCE STORES IN  16  MIDWEST STATES. THE STORES ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES, MANY WITH POPULATIONS OF LESS THAN  5,000.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS OF CASEY'S GENERAL STORES, INC. AND ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. ALL MATERIAL INTER-COMPANY BALANCES AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  2.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. CERTAIN INFORMATION AND FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES NORMALLY INCLUDED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) HAVE BEEN CONDENSED OR OMITTED PURSUANT TO SUCH RULES AND REGULATIONS.  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAIN ALL ADJUSTMENTS (INCLUDING NORMAL RECURRING ACCRUALS) NECESSARY TO PRESENT FAIRLY THE FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  .  ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE DISCLOSURES ARE ADEQUATE TO MAKE THE INFORMATION PRESENTED NOT MISLEADING, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST RECENT AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO.  OTHER THAN MENTIONED BELOW, SEE THE FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  FOR OUR CONSIDERATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  THE COMPANY IS A LESSEE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE LEASE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST COMMONLY LAND OR BUILDING, FROM A LESSOR. THE COMPANY IS A LESSOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS LAND OR BUILDING AND LEASES A PORTION OR ALL OF THE PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT TO A TENANT. IN BOTH SITUATIONS, LEASES ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC TOPIC 842-LEASES  . WE ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE AS OF MAY 1, 2019, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND ELECTED THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSITION METHOD SELECTED, THE COMPANY DID NOT RESTATE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED COMPARABLE PERIODS.  PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 6 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S ADOPTION OF ASC 842 AND THE OUTSTANDING LEASES.  CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN PRIOR YEAR HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  3.  REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD  THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES RETAIL SALES OF FUEL, GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE, PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN AND OTHER REVENUE AT THE TIME OF THE SALE TO THE CUSTOMER.  REVENUE FROM SALES OF PIZZA THAT INCLUDE A REDEEMABLE BOX TOP COUPON ARE DEFERRED UNTIL REDEMPTION FOR THE PORTION OF THE SALE THAT REPRESENTS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE REDEMPTION OF THE BOX TOP COUPON.  REVENUE RELATED TO THE BOX TOP COUPONS IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM THE ORIGINAL SALE TO THE CUSTOMER. AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A CONTRACT LIABILITY OF  $8,329  AND $6,931  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE OUTSTANDING BOX TOP COUPONS, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN ACCRUED EXPENSES ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  GIFT CARD RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE GIFT CARDS ARE USED BY THE CUSTOMER. GIFT CARD BREAKAGE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED GIFT CARD BREAKAGE RATE OVER THE PRO RATA USAGE OF THE CARD.  RENEWABLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (RINS) ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY COMMITS TO A PRICE AND AGREES TO SELL THE RIN. VENDOR REBATES ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND ARE RECOGNIZED PRO RATA OVER THE PERIOD COVERED BY THE APPLICABLE REBATE AGREEMENT. VENDOR REBATES IN THE FORM OF BILLBACKS  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ARE TREATED AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD AND ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SOLD. WAREHOUSING COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN OPERATING EXPENSES ON THE INCOME STATEMENT.  SALES TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT ARE RECORDED ON A NET BASIS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  4.  LONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, LINES OF CREDIT, AND FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE  THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE CURRENT RATES OFFERED TO THE COMPANY FOR DEBT OF THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUANCES. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LONG-TERM DEBT WAS APPROXIMATELY  $1,327,000  AND  $1,272,000  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS A CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT PROVIDES FOR A $300  MILLION  UNSECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WHICH INCLUDES A $30  MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $30  MILLION  SUBLIMIT FOR SWINGLINE LOANS (THE \"CREDIT FACILITY\").  THE MATURITY DATE IS JANUARY 11, 2024.  AMOUNTS BORROWED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT VARIABLE RATES BASED UPON, AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION, EITHER (A) LIBOR PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN OR (B) AN ALTERNATE BASE RATE.  THE CREDIT FACILITY ALSO CARRIES A FACILITY FEE BETWEEN  0.2%  AND  0.4%  PER ANNUM BASED ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE COMPANY HAD  $25,000  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  $75,000  OUTSTANDING AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS AN UNSECURED REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT OF  $25,000  (THE \"BANK LINE\"), UNDER WHICH THERE WAS  $0  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  APRIL 30, 2019.  WITHIN CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IS A  $569,000  5.22%  SENIOR NOTE THAT IS DUE ON AUGUST 9, 2020.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REFINANCE THIS NOTE.  5.  COMPENSATION RELATED COSTS AND SHARE BASED PAYMENTS  THE 2018 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE \u201c2018 PLAN\u201d), WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD IN JUNE 2018 AND APPROVED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2018 (\"THE \"2018 PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE\"). THE 2018 PLAN REPLACED THE 2009 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN (THE \"2009 PLAN\")  UNDER WHICH NO NEW AWARDS ARE ALLOWED TO BE GRANTED AS OF THE 2018 PLAN EFFECTIVE DATE. THE 2009 PLAN PREVIOUSLY REPLACED AND SUPERSEDED THE 2000 STOCK OPTION PLAN AND THE NON-EMPLOYEES DIRECTORS\u2019 STOCK OPTION PLAN (COLLECTIVELY WITH THE 2009 PLAN, THE \u201cPRIOR PLANS\u201d).  AWARDS UNDER THE 2018 PLAN MAY TAKE THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AND EQUITY-RELATED AWARDS. EACH SHARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO A STOCK OPTION AND EACH SHARE WITH RESPECT TO WHICH A STOCK-SETTLED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHT IS EXERCISED (REGARDLESS OF THE NUMBER OF SHARES ACTUALLY DELIVERED) IS COUNTED AS  ONE  SHARE AGAINST THE MAXIMUM LIMIT UNDER THE 2018 PLAN, AND EACH SHARE ISSUED PURSUANT TO AN AWARD OF RESTRICTED STOCK OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS COUNTED AS  TWO  SHARES AGAINST THE MAXIMUM LIMIT. AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  2,635,034  SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2018 PLAN.  WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION BY ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS USING THE BLACK SCHOLES MODEL, AND VALUE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN USING THE MARKET PRICE OF A SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. FOR MARKET BASED AWARDS WE USE THE \"MONTE CARLO\" APPROACH TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE AWARDS, WHICH SIMULATES THE PRICES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S AND EACH MEMBER OF THE PERFORMANCE PEER GROUPS' COMMON STOCK PRICE AT THE END OF THE RELEVANT PERFORMANCE PERIOD, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT VOLATILITY AND THE SPECIFICS SURROUNDING EACH TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN METRIC UNDER THE RELEVANT PLAN.  WE RECOGNIZE THESE AMOUNTS AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME RATABLY OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD, AS ADJUSTED FOR CERTAIN RETIREMENT PROVISIONS, AND UPDATED ESTIMATES OF PERFORMANCE BASED AWARDS. ALL AWARDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED AT NO COST TO THE GRANTEE AND/OR NON-EMPLOYEE MEMBER OF THE BOARD.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE 2018 PLAN IS PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S  2019  DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT.  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , OPTIONS FOR  57,866  SHARES (WHICH EXPIRE IN JUNE 2021) WERE OUTSTANDING FOR THE PRIOR PLANS (NO STOCK OPTION AWARDS HAVE BEEN GRANTED UNDER THE 2018 PLAN).  INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE PRIOR PLANS IS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  NUMBER OF  OPTION SHARES  WEIGHTED  AVERAGE OPTION  EXERCISE PRICE  OUTSTANDING AT APRIL 30, 2019  109,827  $44.39  GRANTED  \u2014  \u2014  EXERCISED  51,961  44.39  FORFEITED  \u2014  \u2014  OUTSTANDING AT OCTOBER 31, 2019  57,866  $44.39  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , ALL  57,866  OUTSTANDING OPTIONS WERE VESTED, AND HAD AN AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF  $7,315  AND A WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF  1.67  YEARS  .  THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE FOR THE TOTAL OF ALL OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , WAS  $5,643.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INFORMATION CONCERNING THE UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS UNDER THE 2009 PLAN AND THE 2018 PLAN IS PRESENTED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  UNVESTED AT APRIL 30, 2019  388,800  GRANTED  178,268  VESTED  (  108,484  )  FORFEITED  (  17,448  )  UNVESTED AT OCTOBER 31, 2019  441,136  TOTAL COMPENSATION COSTS RECORDED FOR EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE BOARD MEMBERS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY, WERE  $9,922  AND  $12,151  , RELATED ENTIRELY TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE  NO  UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO THE PLAN AND PRIOR PLANS FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND  $18,981  OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COSTS RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED THROUGH FISCAL 2023.  CERTAIN AWARDS IN THE 2017 THROUGH 2019 LONG TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM GRANTS HAVE PERFORMANCE-BASED CONDITIONS BASED ON THE  THREE  -YEAR AVERAGE RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC) CALCULATION.  6.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  FROM TIME TO TIME WE MAY BE INVOLVED IN LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS OR INVESTIGATIONS ARISING FROM THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CONTRACTUAL DISPUTES; EMPLOYMENT, PERSONNEL, OR ACCESSIBILITY MATTERS; PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS; AND CLAIMS BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES RELATING TO THE SALE OF PRODUCTS PURSUANT TO LICENSES AND PERMITS ISSUED BY THOSE AUTHORITIES. CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN THOSE ACTIONS MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. WHILE THE OUTCOME OF SUCH LITIGATION, PROCEEDINGS, INVESTIGATIONS, OR CLAIMS IS NEVER CERTAIN, IT IS OUR OPINION, AFTER TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LEGAL COUNSEL\u2019S ASSESSMENT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND OTHER COLLATERAL SOURCES TO COVER POTENTIAL LOSSES, THAT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF SUCH MATTERS CURRENTLY PENDING OR THREATENED, INDIVIDUALLY OR CUMULATIVELY, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY IS A LESSEE IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE LEASE PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, MOST COMMONLY LAND OR BUILDING, FROM A LESSOR. THE COMPANY IS A LESSOR IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE COMPANY OWNS LAND OR BUILDING AND LEASES A PORTION OR ALL OF THE PROPERTY OR EQUIPMENT TO A TENANT. IN BOTH SITUATIONS, LEASES ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC TOPIC 842-LEASES  . AS A LESSEE, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET REPRESENTING ITS RIGHT TO USE THE UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND A LEASE LIABILITY FOR THE OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS. BOTH THE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY ARE INITIALLY MEASURED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS, WITH SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT DEPENDENT ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE LEASE AS EITHER A FINANCE OR AN OPERATING LEASE. FOR LEASES WITH A TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS, WE HAVE ELECTED TO NOT RECOGNIZE LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES AND WILL RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY RECORDS THE OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY IN 'ACCRUED EXPENSES' AND OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES AND RECORDS THE FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY WITHIN CURRENT MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND LONG TERM DEBT AND FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WE HAVE ELECTED TO ADOPT THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, AS WELL AS THE LAND EASEMENT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT.  AS A LESSOR, THE COMPANY HAS DIRECT FINANCING LEASES AND RECORDS THE ASSETS WITHIN PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND RECOGNIZES THE LEASE PAYMENTS THROUGH OTHER INCOME. ALL LESSOR RELATED ACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE LEASES INITIALLY RECORDED UNDER ASC 842 WERE RECOGNIZED, AT THE TIME OF ADOPTION, AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE OF DEBT BASED UPON THE REMAINING TERM OF THE LEASE. NEW LEASES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE LEASE PAYMENTS USING THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN IT IS READILY DETERMINABLE. IN THE CASE THE IMPLICIT RATE IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE, THE COMPANY USES THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE OF DEBT BASED ON THE TERM OF THE LEASE.  SEVERAL LEASES HAVE VARIABLE PAYMENT COMPONENTS OF THE LEASE SUCH AS PAYMENTS FOR PROPERTY TAXES AND INSURANCE. FOR THESE LEASES, THE COMPANY HAS NOT INCLUDED THOSE VARIABLE PAYMENTS IN THE CALCULATION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY AS THE PAYMENTS ARE NOT IN-SUBSTANCE FIXED AND DO NOT DEPEND ON AN INDEX OR RATE. THESE VARIABLE PAYMENTS WILL BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS OPTIONS TO RENEW OR EXTEND THE CURRENT LEASE ARRANGEMENT ON MANY OF OUR LEASES. IN  11  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THESE SITUATIONS, IF IT WAS REASONABLY CERTAIN THE LEASE WOULD BE EXTENDED, WE HAVE INCLUDED THOSE EXTENSIONS WITHIN THE REMAINING LEASE PAYMENTS AT THE TIME OF MEASUREMENT.

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS  $7,287  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WERE  $9,355  .  IF THIS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT WERE ULTIMATELY RECOGNIZED, $7,412  IS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD IMPACT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES FOR SUCH UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $361  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AND $242  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  .  NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCLUDED IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  AND  2018  , WAS A NET  EXPENSE  OF $119  AND $77  , RESPECTIVELY.  A NUMBER OF YEARS MAY ELAPSE BEFORE AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION IS AUDITED AND ULTIMATELY SETTLED.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OR THE TIMING OF RESOLUTION FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  THESE CHANGES COULD RESULT FROM THE EXPIRATION OF THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS, EXAMINATIONS OR OTHER UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES.  THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING TAX YEARS 2012, 2016, AND 2017.  THE COMPANY HAS NO OTHER ONGOING FEDERAL OR STATE INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS.  AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY'S BEST ESTIMATE OF THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE CHANGE IN THE AMOUNT OF THE GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS A  DECREASE  OF $1,100  DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS MAINLY DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF CERTAIN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.  THE FEDERAL STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS REMAINS OPEN FOR THE TAX YEARS  2012  AND FORWARD.  TAX YEARS  2012  AND FORWARD ARE SUBJECT TO AUDIT BY STATE TAX AUTHORITIES DEPENDING ON OPEN STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS WAIVERS AND THE TAX CODE OF EACH STATE.  8.  SEGMENT REPORTING  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , WE OPERATED  2,181  STORES IN  16  STATES. OUR CONVENIENCE STORES OFFER A BROAD SELECTION OF MERCHANDISE, FUEL AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO THE CONVENIENCE NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MANAGE THE BUSINESS ON THE BASIS OF  ONE  OPERATING SEGMENT. OUR STORES SELL SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND USE SIMILAR PROCESSES TO SELL THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DIRECTLY TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. WE MAKE SPECIFIC DISCLOSURES CONCERNING THE  THREE  BROAD MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES OF FUEL, GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE, AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DISCUSS TRENDS AND OPERATIONAL PROGRAMS WITHIN OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH WE CAN SEPARATE REVENUES AND COST OF GOODS SOLD WITHIN THESE CATEGORIES (AND FURTHER SUB-CATEGORIES), THE OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING A STORE THAT SELLS THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT SEPARABLE BY THESE  THREE  CATEGORIES.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS).  OVERVIEW  CASEY\u2019S AND ITS DIRECT AND INDIRECT WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE CONVENIENCE STORES UNDER THE NAMES \"CASEY'S\" AND \u201cCASEY\u2019S GENERAL STORE\u201d (HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AS THE \"COMPANY\", \"CASEY\u2019S STORE\u201d OR \u201cSTORES\u201d) IN 16 MIDWESTERN STATES, PRIMARILY IOWA, MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS. THE COMPANY ALSO OPERATES TWO STORES SELLING PRIMARILY TOBACCO PRODUCTS, ONE GROCERY STORE, AND ONE LIQUOR STORE.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THERE WERE A TOTAL OF  2,181  STORES IN OPERATION. ALL CONVENIENCE STORES OFFER FUEL FOR SALE ON A SELF-SERVE BASIS AND MOST STORES CARRY A BROAD SELECTION OF FOOD (INCLUDING FRESHLY PREPARED FOODS SUCH AS PIZZA, DONUTS AND SANDWICHES), BEVERAGES, TOBACCO PRODUCTS, HEALTH AND BEAUTY AIDS, AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS AND OTHER NON-FOOD ITEMS. THE COMPANY DERIVES ITS REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM THE RETAIL SALE OF FUEL AND THE PRODUCTS OFFERED IN ITS STORES.  APPROXIMATELY  56%  OF OUR STORES WERE OPENED IN AREAS WITH POPULATIONS OF FEWER THAN 5,000 PERSONS, WHILE APPROXIMATELY  19%  OF ALL STORES WERE OPENED IN COMMUNITIES WITH POPULATIONS EXCEEDING 20,000 PERSONS. TWO DISTRIBUTION CENTERS ARE IN OPERATION, WHICH SUPPLY GROCERY AND GENERAL MERCHANDISE ITEMS TO STORES. ONE IS ADJACENT TO THE STORE SUPPORT CENTER FACILITY IN ANKENY, IOWA, AND THE OTHER IS LOCATED IN TERRE HAUTE, INDIANA.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY OWNED THE LAND AT  2,155  LOCATIONS AND THE BUILDINGS AT  2,160  LOCATIONS, AND LEASED THE LAND AT  26  LOCATIONS AND THE BUILDINGS AT  21  LOCATIONS.  THE COMPANY REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF  $2.21  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  . FOR THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR-AGO, DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE WAS  $1.80.

SAME-STORE SALES IS A COMMON METRIC USED IN THE CONVENIENCE STORE INDUSTRY.  WE DEFINE SAME-STORE SALES AS THE TOTAL SALES INCREASE (OR DECREASE) FOR STORES OPEN DURING THE FULL TIME OF BOTH PERIODS BEING PRESENTED.  WE EXCLUDE FROM THE CALCULATION ANY ACQUIRED STORES AND ANY STORES THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH A NEW STORE, UNTIL SUCH STORES HAVE BEEN OPEN DURING THE FULL TIME OF BOTH PERIODS BEING PRESENTED.  STORES THAT HAVE UNDERGONE A MAJOR REMODEL, HAD ADJUSTMENTS IN HOURS OF OPERATION, ADDED PIZZA DELIVERY, OR HAD OTHER REVISIONS TO THEIR OPERATING FORMAT REMAIN IN THE CALCULATION.  THE  SECOND  QUARTER RESULTS REFLECTED A  1.8%  DECREASE IN SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD, WITH AN AVERAGE FUEL REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) OF  22.9  CENTS PER GALLON, COMPARED TO  20.0  CENTS PER GALLON IN THE SAME QUARTER A YEAR AGO.  HISTORICALLY, OUR RETAIL FUEL STRATEGY HAS BEEN TO PRICE TO THE COMPETITION, WHERE THE TIMING OF RETAIL PRICE CHANGES WAS DRIVEN BY LOCAL COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS.  OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY, AS PART OF ITS EVOLVING STRATEGY AROUND FUEL PRICE OPTIMIZATION, HAS BEEN MORE PROACTIVE AND BALANCED TO GROW PROFITABILITY, WHICH HAS IN-PART CONTRIBUTED TO A HIGHER FUEL MARGIN AND LOWER SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD.  IN ADDITION, SOFTER DEMAND IN THE MIDWEST ADVERSELY IMPACTED SAME-STORE FUEL GALLONS SOLD IN THE QUARTER.  THE COMPANY SOLD  18.7  MILLION RENEWABLE FUEL CREDITS FOR $3.8  MILLION DURING THE QUARTER, COMPARED TO  16.6  MILLION RENEWABLE FUEL CREDITS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH GENERATED $3.4  MILLION.  SAME-STORE SALES OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE INCREASED  3.2%  AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN INCREASED  1.9%  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER. OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED  8.5%  IN THE QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD A YEAR AGO.  14  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  THREE MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  (DOLLARS AND AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2019  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER  MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $1,514,474  $660,562  $297,846  $14,704  $2,487,586  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $140,798  $220,134  $181,452  $14,681  $557,065  9.3%  33.3%  60.9%  99.8%  22.4%  FUEL GALLONS  614,071  THREE MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2018  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER  MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $1,621,868  $618,250  $283,062  $14,825  $2,538,005  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $118,656  $200,193  $176,675  $14,797  $510,321  7.3%  32.4%  62.4%  99.8%  20.1%  FUEL GALLONS  593,750  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  BY  $50,419  (  2.0%  ) OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  .

DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, RETAIL SALES OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE  INCREASED  BY  $42,312  (  6.8%  ), AND PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN SALES  INCREASED  BY  $14,784  (  5.2%  ), BOTH PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  THE OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF LOTTERY, CAR WASH, AND PREPAID PHONE CARDS, WHICH ARE PRESENTED NET OF APPLICABLE COSTS. THESE REVENUES  DECREASED  $121  (  0.8%  ) FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020.  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  22.4%  OF REVENUE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  , COMPARED TO  20.1%  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FUEL REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  9.3%  OF FUEL REVENUE DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  7.3%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. REVENUE PER GALLON LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD PER GALLON (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) WAS  22.9  CENTS IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  20.0  CENTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) INCREASED TO  33.3%  OF GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE REVENUE, COMPARED TO  32.4%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY DUE TO A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO HIGHER MARGIN ITEMS. PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) DECREASED TO  60.9%  OF REVENUE, FROM A  62.4%  RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  $29,197  (  8.5%  ) IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  SAME STORE OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD FEES WERE  UP  3.4%  FOR THE QUARTER.  OPERATING EXPENSES FOR THE QUARTER WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY ADVANCEMENTS IN STORE LABOR MANAGEMENT AND LOWER INSURANCE COSTS.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  INCREASED  2.5%  TO  $62,888  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  FROM  $61,356  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  INCREASE  WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  DECREASED  TO  24.2%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO  26.5%  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  .  THE  DECREASE  IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN UNFAVORABLE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES.  NET INCOME  INCREASED  BY  $15,366  (  23.1%  ) TO  $81,981  FROM  $66,615  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  15  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  COMPARED TO  SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018  SIX MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2019  FUEL  GROCERY &  OTHER MERCHANDISE  PREPARED  FOOD &  FOUNTAIN  OTHER  TOTAL  REVENUE  $3,142,042  $1,348,480  $593,723  $29,970  $5,114,215  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $291,787  $435,587  $365,464  $29,913  $1,122,751  9.3%  32.3%  61.6%  99.8%  22.0%  FUEL GALLONS  1,233,155  SIX MONTHS ENDED 10/31/2018  REVENUE  $3,269,285  $1,263,050  $564,065  $30,037  $5,126,437  REVENUE LESS COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  $242,132  $409,119  $350,859  $29,979  $1,032,089  7.4%  32.4%  62.2%  99.8%  20.1%  FUEL GALLONS  1,195,545  TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  DECREASED  BY  $12,222  (  0.2%  ) OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN FISCAL  2019  .

PREPARED FOOD AND FOUNTAIN REVENUE LESS RELATED COST OF GOODS SOLD (EXCLUSIVE OF DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) DECREASED TO  61.6%  OF REVENUE, COMPARED TO  62.2%  IN THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE TO HIGHER COMMODITY COSTS.  OPERATING EXPENSES  INCREASED  $49,646  (  7.1%  ) IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO.  SAME STORE OPERATING EXPENSES EXCLUDING CREDIT CARD FEES WERE  UP  3.0%  FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  .

THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS.   THE EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  WAS LOWER THAN EXPECTED, DUE TO AN APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLON ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO THE USEFUL LIVES OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS.

THE  INCREASE  IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  16  TABLE OF CONTENTS  USE OF NON-GAAP MEASURES  WE DEFINE EBITDA AS NET INCOME BEFORE NET INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA FURTHER ADJUSTS EBITDA BY EXCLUDING THE GAIN OR LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS AS WELL AS IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. NEITHER EBITDA NOR ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE CONSIDERED GAAP MEASURES, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OR OTHER INCOME OR CASH FLOW STATEMENT DATA. THESE MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE INVESTORS TO REVIEW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PUBLICLY FILED REPORTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY AND NOT TO RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.  WE BELIEVE EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA ARE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN EVALUATING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE SECURITIES ANALYSTS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES USE SUCH CALCULATIONS AS A MEASURE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND DEBT SERVICE CAPABILITIES, AND THEY ARE REGULARLY USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR INTERNAL PURPOSES INCLUDING OUR CAPITAL BUDGETING PROCESS, EVALUATING ACQUISITION TARGETS, AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE.  BECAUSE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE NOT STANDARDIZED, EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BY US, MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES REPORTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. IT THEREFORE MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE TO COMPARE OUR USE OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WITH THOSE USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

THE INCREASES ARE PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN FUEL GROSS PROFIT DOLLARS, OPERATING  84  MORE  STORES THAN A YEAR AGO, AND AN ONGOING FOCUS ON OPERATING EFFICIENCIES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE THOSE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN THE FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , AND SUCH DISCUSSION IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO THESE POLICIES IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS, CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS IS THE COMPANY\u2019S PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY. THE COMPANY FINANCES ITS INVENTORY PURCHASES PRIMARILY FROM NORMAL TRADE CREDIT AIDED BY THE RELATIVELY RAPID TURNOVER OF INVENTORY. THIS TURNOVER ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO CONDUCT ITS OPERATIONS WITHOUT LARGE AMOUNTS OF CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL. AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY\u2019S RATIO OF CURRENT ASSETS TO CURRENT LIABILITIES WAS  0.36  TO 1. THE RATIO AT  OCTOBER 31, 2018  AND  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS  0.81  TO 1 AND  0.69  TO 1, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN THE RATIO IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF  $569,000  5.22% SENIOR NOTES TO CURRENT LIABILITIES AS THEY ARE DUE ON AUGUST 9, 2020. MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO REFINANCE THE 5.22% SENIOR NOTES.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY\u2019S CURRENT BANK LINE OF  $25,000  , ITS CREDIT FACILITY OF  $300,000  , COMBINED WITH THE CURRENT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND THE FUTURE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY THE WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS INCREASED  $7,120  (  2.3%  ) IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. CASH USED IN INVESTING IN THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  INCREASED  $47,580  (  24.0%  ) OVER PRIOR YEAR, IN LINE WITH PROJECTED ANNUAL EXPENDITURES. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED  $22,932  (  21.2%  ), PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN SHARE BUYBACK ACTIVITY.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES REPRESENT THE SINGLE LARGEST USE OF COMPANY FUNDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT BY ACQUIRING, BUILDING, AND REINVESTING IN STORES, THE COMPANY WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO RESPOND TO COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES AND INCREASE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES. DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  , THE COMPANY EXPENDED  $248,364  , PRIMARILY FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, RESULTING FROM THE CONSTRUCTION, REMODELING, AND ACQUISITION OF STORES, COMPARED TO  $200,999  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES SPENDING $516 MILLION IN FISCAL  2020  , PRIMARILY FOR CONSTRUCTION, ACQUISITION AND REMODELING OF STORES, SOURCED PRIMARILY FROM EXISTING CASH, FUNDS GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, AND THE PRIOR YEAR ISSUANCE OF SENIOR NOTES.  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD LONG-TERM DEBT OF  $715,060  , (NET OF CURRENT MATURITIES AND DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF  $577,698  ), $150,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.67% SENIOR NOTES, SERIES A, $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.75% SENIOR NOTES SERIES B,  $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.65% SENIOR NOTES SERIES C,  $50,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.72% SENIOR NOTES SERIES D,  $150,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.51% SENIOR NOTES SERIES E,  $250,000  IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.77% SENIOR NOTES SERIES F, AND $15,060  OF FINANCE LEASE OBLIGATIONS.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A  $25,000  BANK LINE OF CREDIT WITH  $0  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , AND A  $300,000  CREDIT FACILITY WITH  $25,000  OUTSTANDING AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  .

TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS FUNDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PRIMARILY FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK, ISSUANCE OF DEBT, EXISTING CASH, AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS REQUIRED TO FINANCE OPERATIONS, IMPROVEMENTS AND THE ANTICIPATED GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF STORES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MET FROM CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, THE BANK LINE AND THE CREDIT FACILITY, AND ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM DEBT OR OTHER SECURITIES AS CIRCUMSTANCES MAY DICTATE, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO ADVERSELY AFFECT LIQUIDITY.  CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THIS FORM 10-Q, INCLUDING THE FOREGOING MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CONTAINS VARIOUS \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS REPRESENT THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPECTATIONS OR BELIEFS CONCERNING FUTURE EVENTS, INCLUDING (I) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING FUTURE SALES AND GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGES, (II) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING THE CONTINUATION OF HISTORICAL TRENDS AND (III) ANY STATEMENTS REGARDING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CASH BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE NEEDS. THE WORDS \u201cBELIEVE,\u201d \u201cEXPECT,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATE,\u201d \u201cINTEND,\u201d \u201cESTIMATE,\u201d \u201cPROJECT\u201d AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAUTIONS THAT THESE STATEMENTS ARE FURTHER QUALIFIED BY IMPORTANT FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATIONS, THE FOLLOWING FACTORS DESCRIBED MORE COMPLETELY IN THE FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  .  COMPETITION  . THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND MARKED BY EASE OF ENTRY AND CONSTANT CHANGE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS AND TYPE OF RETAILERS OFFERING THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOUND IN STORES. MANY OF THE FOOD (INCLUDING PREPARED FOODS) AND NON-FOOD ITEMS SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL TO THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM A VARIETY OF COMPETITORS IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY STORES, AND THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH OTHER CONVENIENCE STORE CHAINS, GASOLINE STATIONS, SUPERMARKETS, DRUG STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, CLUB STORES, MASS MERCHANTS AND \u201cFAST-FOOD\u201d OUTLETS (WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF PREPARED FOODS). SALES OF SUCH NON-FUEL ITEMS (PARTICULARLY PREPARED FOOD ITEMS) HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO THE COMPANY\u2019S GROSS PROFITS FROM RETAIL SALES IN RECENT YEARS. FUEL SALES ARE ALSO INTENSELY COMPETITIVE. THE COMPANY COMPETES WITH BOTH INDEPENDENT AND NATIONAL BRAND GASOLINE STATIONS IN THE SALE OF FUEL, OTHER CONVENIENCE STORE CHAINS AND SEVERAL NON-TRADITIONAL FUEL RETAILERS SUCH AS SUPERMARKETS IN SPECIFIC MARKETS. SOME OF THESE OTHER FUEL RETAILERS MAY HAVE ACCESS TO MORE FAVORABLE ARRANGEMENTS FOR FUEL SUPPLY THEN DO THE COMPANY OR THE FIRMS THAT SUPPLY ITS STORES. SOME OF THE COMPANY\u2019S  COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN THE COMPANY, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE ABLE TO RESPOND BETTER TO CHANGES IN THE ECONOMY AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE INDUSTRY.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FUEL OPERATIONS  . FUEL SALES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SALES AND EARNINGS, AND RETAIL FUEL PROFIT MARGINS HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S NET EARNINGS. PROFIT MARGINS ON FUEL SALES CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FACTORS BEYOND THE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY OF FUEL AVAILABLE IN THE RETAIL FUEL MARKET, UNCERTAINTY OR VOLATILITY IN THE WHOLESALE FUEL MARKET, INCREASES IN WHOLESALE FUEL COSTS GENERALLY DURING A PERIOD, AND PRICE COMPETITION FROM OTHER FUEL MARKETERS. THE MARKET FOR CRUDE OIL AND DOMESTIC WHOLESALE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS IS MARKED BY SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY, AND IS AFFECTED BY GENERAL POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND INSTABILITY IN OIL PRODUCING REGIONS SUCH AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE VOLATILITY OF THE WHOLESALE FUEL MARKET MAKES IT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE IMPACT OF FUTURE WHOLESALE COST FLUCTUATION ON THE COMPANY\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S FUEL GALLON VOLUME, FUEL GROSS PROFIT, AND OVERALL CUSTOMER TRAFFIC LEVELS AT STORES. ANY SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN PROFIT MARGINS ON FUEL SALES OR IN THE NUMBER OF GALLONS SOLD BY STORES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS.  FUEL IS PURCHASED FROM A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PETROLEUM DISTRIBUTORS AND THE FUEL IS LOADED ONTO BOTH CASEY'S FUEL TRUCKS AND 3RD PARTY FUEL TRUCKS.  PURCHASE AGREEMENTS EXIST FOR A PORTION OF OUR FUEL WHICH INCLUDES VARYING PRICING STRUCTURES AND VOLUME COMMITMENTS.  ALTHOUGH IN RECENT YEARS SUPPLIERS HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF FUEL TO MEET THE COMPANY\u2019S NEEDS, UNANTICIPATED NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, SUCH AS THREATENED OR ACTUAL ACTS OF WAR OR TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, AND INSTABILITY IN OIL PRODUCING REGIONS COULD RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF FUEL SUPPLIES AVAILABLE FOR DISTRIBUTION. ANY SUBSTANTIAL CURTAILMENT IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FUEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY BY REDUCING ITS FUEL SALES. FURTHER, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS RESULTS FROM THE PATRONAGE OF CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY DESIRING TO PURCHASE FUEL AND, ACCORDINGLY, REDUCED FUEL SUPPLIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE SALE OF NON-FUEL ITEMS. SUCH FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS AND OPERATIONS.  TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS  . SALES OF TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VAPOR PRODUCTS AND E-CIGARETTES, REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE CATEGORY. SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN WHOLESALE CIGARETTE COSTS AND TAX INCREASES ON TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS NATIONAL AND LOCAL CAMPAIGNS TO FURTHER REGULATE AND DISCOURAGE SMOKING AND THE USE OF OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE HAD, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE HAVING, AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS SOLD IN OUR STORES. ALSO, INCREASING REGULATIONS RELATED TO, AND RESTRICTING THE SALE OF, VAPOR PRODUCTS AND E-CIGARETTES, MAY OFFSET SOME OF THE RECENT GAINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED FROM SELLING THESE TYPES OF PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO PASS PRICE INCREASES THROUGH TO ITS CUSTOMERS, BUT COMPETITIVE PRESSURES IN SPECIFIC MARKETS MAY PREVENT IT FROM DOING SO. THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE PRODUCT MIX OF TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, THE RETAIL PRICE AND MARGINS OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS, THE VOLUME OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO AND NICOTINE PRODUCTS SOLD BY STORES AND OVERALL CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, ANY OF WHICH MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE GROCERY AND OTHER MERCHANDISE CATEGORY AND THE COMPANY\u2019S EARNINGS AND PROFITS.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS  . THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AND SEVERAL STATES, INCLUDING IOWA, HAVE ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS FOR OWNERS AND OPERATORS OF UNDERGROUND GASOLINE STORAGE TANKS (USTS) WITH REGARD TO (I) MAINTENANCE OF LEAK DETECTION, CORROSION PROTECTION AND OVERFILL/SPILL PROTECTION SYSTEMS; (II) UPGRADE OF EXISTING TANKS; (III) ACTIONS REQUIRED IN THE EVENT OF A DETECTED LEAK; (IV) PREVENTION OF LEAKAGE THROUGH TANK CLOSINGS; AND (V) REQUIRED GASOLINE INVENTORY RECORDKEEPING. SINCE 1984, NEW COMPANY STORES HAVE BEEN EQUIPPED WITH NON-CORRODING FIBERGLASS USTS, INCLUDING MANY WITH DOUBLE-WALL CONSTRUCTION, OVER-FILL PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC TANK MONITORING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS  4,953  USTS, OF WHICH  4,076  ARE FIBERGLASS AND  877  ARE STEEL. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ITS EXISTING FUEL PROCEDURES AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE COMPANY IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL CURRENT FEDERAL AND STATE UST REGULATIONS.  SEVERAL OF THE STATES IN WHICH THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS HAVE TRUST FUND PROGRAMS WITH PROVISIONS FOR SHARING OR REIMBURSING CORRECTIVE ACTION OR REMEDIATION COSTS INCURRED BY UST OWNERS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. IN THE YEARS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , THE COMPANY SPENT APPROXIMATELY  $774  AND  $1,255  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR ASSESSMENTS AND REMEDIATION. DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , THE COMPANY EXPENDED APPROXIMATELY  $359  FOR SUCH PURPOSES. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE EXPENDITURES HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED FOR REIMBURSEMENT FROM STATE-SPONSORED TRUST FUND PROGRAMS AND AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2019  , APPROXIMATELY  $23,417  HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM SUCH PROGRAMS SINCE THEIR INCEPTION. SUCH AMOUNTS ARE TYPICALLY SUBJECT TO STATUTORY PROVISIONS REQUIRING REPAYMENT OF THE REIMBURSED FUNDS FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH UPGRADE PROVISIONS OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAWS. NO AMOUNTS ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE REPAID. THE COMPANY HAS AN ACCRUED LIABILITY AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019  OF APPROXIMATELY  $376  FOR ESTIMATED EXPENSES RELATED TO ANTICIPATED CORRECTIVE ACTIONS OR REMEDIATION EFFORTS, INCLUDING RELEVANT LEGAL AND CONSULTING COSTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY HAS NO MATERIAL JOINT AND SEVERAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY WITH OTHER PARTIES.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY REGULARLY ACCRUES EXPENSES FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO ITS FUTURE CORRECTIVE ACTION OR REMEDIATION EFFORTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH ACCRUED AMOUNTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PAY SUCH COSTS, OR THAT THE  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED ALL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AT ALL OF ITS CURRENT STORE LOCATIONS. IN ADDITION, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FUTURE FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION OR RELATED CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DISCOVERED OR ASSERTED WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING STORE LOCATIONS OR LOCATIONS THAT THE COMPANY MAY ACQUIRE IN THE FUTURE, OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ANY CLAIMS FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF FUNDS DISBURSED TO THE COMPANY UNDER THE VARIOUS STATE PROGRAMS OR THAT ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS, OR AMENDMENTS TO EXISTING REGULATIONS, WILL NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EXPENDITURES BEYOND THOSE PRESENTLY ANTICIPATED.  OTHER FACTORS.  OTHER FACTORS AND RISKS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISK THAT OUR CASH BALANCES AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCE NEEDS, TAX INCREASES, POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND EXPENDITURES RELATED TO COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE SEASONALITY OF DEMAND PATTERNS, AND WEATHER CONDITIONS; AND THE OTHER RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WITH THE SEC. WE FURTHER CAUTION YOU THAT OTHER FACTORS WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED MAY IN THE FUTURE PROVE TO BE IMPORTANT IN AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. WE ASK YOU NOT TO PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BECAUSE THEY SPEAK ONLY OF OUR VIEWS AS OF THE STATEMENT DATES.

YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-Q. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT REFLECT OUR PLANS, ESTIMATES, AND BELIEFS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE OR CONTRIBUTE TO THESE DIFFERENCES INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE RISK FACTORS CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND THE QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED JULY 31, 2019 EACH AS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE \u201cSEC\u201d).  COMPANY OVERVIEW  ASPEN GROUP, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cAGI\u201d) IS AN EDUCATION TECHNOLOGY HOLDING COMPANY. AGI HAS THREE SUBSIDIARIES, ASPEN UNIVERSITY INC. ORGANIZED IN 1987, UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY, INC. ORGANIZED IN MAY 2017 FOR THE PURPOSES OF ACQUIRING UNITED STATES UNIVERSITY IN DECEMBER 2017, AND ASPEN NURSING, INC. (\u201cANI\u201d) ORGANIZED IN 2018.

AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, 8,904 OF 10,718 OR 83% OF ALL STUDENTS ACROSS BOTH UNIVERSITIES ARE DEGREE-SEEKING NURSING STUDENTS.  IN MARCH 2014, ASPEN UNIVERSITY UNVEILED A MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN AVAILABLE TO ALL STUDENTS ACROSS EVERY ONLINE DEGREE PROGRAM OFFERED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IS DESIGNED SO THAT STUDENTS WILL MAKE ONE PAYMENT PER MONTH, AND THAT MONTHLY PAYMENT IS APPLIED TOWARDS THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE (TUITION AND FEES, EXCLUDING TEXTBOOKS). ASPEN UNIVERSITY'S  MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN OFFERS ONLINE ASSOCIATE AND BACHELOR STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PAY THEIR TUITION AND FEES AT $250/MONTH, ONLINE MASTER\u2019S STUDENTS $325/MONTH, AND ONLINE DOCTORAL STUDENTS $375/MONTH, INTEREST FREE, THEREBY GIVING STUDENTS A MONTHLY PAYMENT OPTION VERSUS TAKING OUT A FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID LOAN.

SINCE 1993, ASPEN UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN NATIONALLY ACCREDITED BY THE DEAC, A NATIONAL ACCREDITING AGENCY RECOGNIZED BY THE DOE. IN FEBRUARY 2019, THE DEAC INFORMED ASPEN UNIVERSITY THAT IT HAD RENEWED ITS ACCREDITATION FOR FIVE YEARS TO JANUARY 2024.  SINCE 2009, USU HAS BEEN REGIONALLY ACCREDITED BY WSCUC.  BOTH UNIVERSITIES ARE QUALIFIED TO PARTICIPATE UNDER THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT AND THE FEDERAL STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS (TITLE IV, HEA PROGRAMS).  MONTHLY PAYMENT PROGRAMS OVERVIEW  AGI OFFERS TWO MONTHLY PAYMENT PROGRAMS.  \u2022  A MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IN WHICH STUDENTS MAKE PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH OVER A FIXED PERIOD DEPENDING ON THE DEGREE PROGRAM; AND  \u2022  A MONTHLY INSTALLMENT PLAN IN WHICH STUDENTS PAY THREE MONTHLY INSTALLMENTS (DAY 1, DAY 31 AND DAY 61 AFTER THE START OF EACH COURSE).  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ASPEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW BY 17% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FROM 5,074 TO 5,927. THOSE 5,927 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 66% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.

AGI NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS  AGI DELIVERED A COMPANY RECORD 2,217 NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 (THE \u201cFISCAL 2020 Q2\u201d), A 15% SEQUENTIAL ENROLLMENT INCREASE AND AN INCREASE OF 42% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY ACCOUNTED FOR 1,823 NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS (INCLUDING 190 DOCTORAL ENROLLMENTS AND 437 PRE-LICENSURE BSN AZ CAMPUS ENROLLMENTS), DELIVERING OVERALL ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT ASPEN UNIVERSITY OF 41% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ENROLLMENT GROWTH AT ASPEN UNIVERSITY WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY THE DOCTORAL UNIT INCREASING BY 43% AND THE PRE-LICENSURE BSN UNIT INCREASING BY 667% YEAR-OVER-YEAR. ENROLLMENT EFFORTS REMAINED FOCUSED ON THE HIGHEST EXPECTED RETURN BUSINESSES AS MANAGEMENT INCREASED THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENT ADVISORS (THE \u201cEA\u201d)DEDICATED TO ASPEN\u2019S DOCTORAL AND PRE-LICENSURE UNITS DURING THE QUARTER.  IN  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITION, OUR ASPEN NURSING + OTHER UNIT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENTS PER EA AND COST PER ENROLLMENT DECLINED.  AS A RESULT OF THIS INCREASED EFFICIENCY, ASPEN\u2019S NURSING + OTHER UNIT GREW ENROLLMENTS BY 8% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.

MARKETING EFFICIENCY RATIO (MER) =  REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (RPE)  COST PER ENROLLMENT (CPE)  COST PER ENROLLMENT (CPE)  THE COST PER ENROLLMENT MEASURES THE ADVERTISING INVESTMENT SPENT IN A GIVEN SIX MONTH PERIOD, DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS ACHIEVED IN THAT GIVEN SIX MONTH PERIOD, IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN AVERAGE CPE FOR THE PERIOD MEASURED.  REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (RPE)  THE REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT TAKES EACH QUARTERLY COHORT OF NEW DEGREE-SEEKING STUDENT ENROLLMENTS, AND MEASURES THE AMOUNT OF EARNED REVENUE INCLUDING TUITION AND FEES TO DETERMINE THE AVERAGE RPE FOR THE COHORT MEASURED. FOR THE LATER PERIODS OF A COHORT, WE HAVE USED REASONABLE PROJECTIONS BASED OFF OF HISTORICAL RESULTS TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE WE WILL EARN IN LATER PERIODS OF THE COHORT.  THE CURRENT MARKETING EFFICIENCY RATIO (MER = REVENUE-PER-ENROLLMENT OR LTV/COST-PER-ENROLLMENT OR CAC) FOR OUR FOUR DEGREE UNITS IS REFLECTED IN THE BELOW TABLE.

ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN HYBRID (ONLINE/ON-CAMPUS) DEGREE PROGRAM  IN JULY 2018, ASPEN UNIVERSITY THROUGH ANI BEGAN OFFERING ITS PRE-LICENSURE BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING (BSN) DEGREE PROGRAM AT ITS INITIAL CAMPUS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA. AS A RESULT OF OVERWHELMING DEMAND IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA, IN JANUARY 2019 ASPEN UNIVERSITY BEGAN OFFERING BOTH DAY (JULY, NOVEMBER, MARCH SEMESTERS) AND EVENING/WEEKEND (JANUARY, MAY, SEPTEMBER SEMESTERS) PROGRAMS, EQUALING SIX SEMESTER STARTS PER YEAR. MOREOVER, IN SEPTEMBER 2018, AGI ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO OPEN A SECOND CAMPUS IN THE PHOENIX METRO AREA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HONORHEALTH. THE INITIAL SEMESTER AT HONORHEALTH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2019.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S INNOVATIVE HYBRID (ONLINE/ON-CAMPUS) PROGRAM ALLOWS MOST OF THE CREDITS TO BE COMPLETED ONLINE (83 OF 120 CREDITS OR 69%), WITH PRICING OFFERED AT CURRENT LOW TUITION RATES OF $150/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES AND $325/CREDIT HOUR FOR ONLINE CORE NURSING COURSES. FOR STUDENTS WITH NO PRIOR COLLEGE CREDITS, THE TOTAL COST OF ATTENDANCE IS LESS THAN $50,000.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM IS OFFERED AS A FULL-TIME, THREE-YEAR (NINE SEMESTER) PROGRAM THAT IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR STUDENTS WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY HOLD A STATE NURSING LICENSE AND HAVE NO PRIOR NURSING EXPERIENCE. ASPEN IS ADMITTING STUDENTS INTO ONE OF TWO PROGRAM COMPONENTS: (1) A PRE-PROFESSIONAL NURSING COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT HAVE LESS THAN THE REQUIRED 41 GENERAL EDUCATION CREDITS COMPLETED (YEAR 1), AND (2) THE NURSING CORE COMPONENT FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE READY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPETITIVE EVALUATION PROCESS FOR ENTRY (YEARS 2-3).  NEW STUDENT ENROLLMENTS FOR ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM INCREASED FROM 276 TO 437, OR 58% SEQUENTIALLY.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY ENDED THE FISCAL SECOND QUARTER WITH 1,051 ACTIVE STUDENTS IN ITS PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM.  PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM CAMPUS EXPANSION PLAN  ASPEN UNIVERSITY PLANS TO LAUNCH A STAND-ALONE CAMPUS IN TAMPA, FLORIDA IN THE SUMMER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020. A CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXECUTED WITH BAYFRONT HEALTH, A REGIONAL NETWORK OF SEVEN HOSPITALS AND OVER 1,900 MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS ON STAFF SERVING THE RESIDENTS OF FLORIDA\u2019S GULF COAST.  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADDITIONALLY, ASPEN UNIVERSITY PLANS TO LAUNCH A STAND-ALONE CAMPUS IN AUSTIN, TEXAS IN THE WINTER OF CALENDAR YEAR 2020. A CLINICAL AFFILIATION AGREEMENT HAS BEEN EXECUTED WITH BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH \u2013 CENTRAL DIVISION. AS THE LARGEST NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN TEXAS AND ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED STATES, BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH WAS BORN FROM THE 2013 COMBINATION OF BAYLOR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND SCOTT & WHITE HEALTHCARE. TODAY, BAYLOR SCOTT & WHITE INCLUDES 48 HOSPITALS, MORE THAN 800 PATIENT CARE SITES, MORE THAN 7,800 ACTIVE PHYSICIANS, OVER 47,000 EMPLOYEES AND THE SCOTT & WHITE HEALTH PLAN.  THE COMPANY HAS STRATEGICALLY TARGETED EXISTING CAMPUS LOCATIONS IN AUSTIN AND TAMPA THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY BUILT-OUT INCLUDING FF&E (FURNITURE, FIXTURES, AND EQUIPMENT) IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CAPEX) REQUIRED TO LAUNCH THESE CAMPUSES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THIS WILL ALLOW THE CAPEX FOR EACH NEW CAMPUS TO BE IN THE SAME RANGE AS THE COST OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S EMBEDDED CAMPUS AT HONORHEALTH LOCATED IN NORTH PHOENIX.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN  SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN IN THE SPRING OF 2014, THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM, HAS GROWN FROM A NET NUMBER OF $649,890 AT APRIL 30, 2014 TO A NET NUMBER OF $18,304,250 AT OCTOBER 31, 2019. THIS GROWTH COULD BE PORTRAYED AS THE ENGINE OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE ATTRACTIVE ASPECT OF BEING ABLE TO PAY FOR A DEGREE OVER A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME HAS FUELED THE GROWTH OF THIS PLAN AND, AS A RESULT, THE INCREASE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE.  EACH STUDENT\u2019S RECEIVABLE ACCOUNT IS DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON HOW MANY CLASSES A STUDENT TAKES EACH PERIOD. IF A STUDENT TAKES TWO CLASSES EACH EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD WHILE PAYING $250, $325 OR $375 A MONTH AS AN EXAMPLE, THAT STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE BALANCE WILL RISE ACCORDINGLY. THE CONVERSE IS TRUE ALSO. A STUDENT WHO TAKES COURSES AT A SLOWER PACE, EVEN TAKING TIME OFF BETWEEN EIGHT-WEEK TERMS, COULD HAVE A BALANCE DUE TO THEM. IT IS MUCH MORE LIKELY HOWEVER THAT A STUDENT PARTICIPATING IN THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN WILL HAVE AN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE, AS THE MAJORITY OF STUDENTS COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE PROGRAM OF STUDY PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE FIXED MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN.  THE COMMON THREAD IS THE ACTUAL MONTHLY PAYMENT, WHICH FUNCTIONS AS A RETAIL INSTALLMENT CONTRACT WITH NO INTEREST THAT EACH STUDENT COMMITS TO PAY OVER A FIXED NUMBER OF MONTHS. IF A STUDENT STOPS PAYING, THAT PERSON CAN NO LONGER REGISTER FOR A CLASS. IF A STUDENT DECIDES TO WITHDRAW FROM THE UNIVERSITY, THEIR ACCOUNT WILL BE SETTLED, EITHER THROUGH COLLECTION OF THEIR BALANCE OR DISBURSEMENT OF THE AMOUNT OWED THEM. ASPEN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW BY 17% YEAR-OVER-YEAR, FROM 5,074 TO 5,927. THOSE 5,927 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 66% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  USU STUDENTS PAYING TUITION AND FEES THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD GREW FROM 1,053 TO 1,101 STUDENTS SEQUENTIALLY. THOSE 1,101 STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH A MONTHLY PAYMENT METHOD REPRESENT 65% OF USU\u2019S TOTAL ACTIVE STUDENT BODY.  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE  THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE FOR ANY PERIOD IS THE NET EFFECT OF THE FOLLOWING THREE FACTORS.  1.  REVENUE;  2.  CASH RECEIPTS; AND  3.  THE NET CHANGE IN DEFERRED REVENUE.  ALL THREE FACTORS EQUALLY DETERMINE THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. IF ONE QUARTER EXPERIENCES PARTICULARLY HIGH CASH RECEIPTS, THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL GO DOWN. THE SAME EFFECT IF CASH RECEIPTS ARE LOWER OR IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EITHER OF THE OTHER FACTORS.  SIMPLY LOOKING AT THE CHANGE IN REVENUE DOES NOT TRANSLATE INTO AN EQUALLY SIMILAR CHANGE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE RELATIVE CHANGE IN CASH AND THE DEFERRAL MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. FOR NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE CHANGES IN THE RESERVE MUST ALSO BE CONSIDERED. ANY ADDITIONAL RESERVE OR WRITE-OFFS WILL INFLUENCE THE BALANCE.  AS IT IS A STRAIGHT MATHEMATICAL FORMULA FOR BOTH GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AND MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS PUBLIC, ONE CAN REASONABLY CALCULATE THE TWO NON-PUBLIC PIECES OF INFORMATION, NAMELY THE CASH RECEIPTS IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND THE WRITE-OFFS IN NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  FOR REVENUE, THE QUARTERLY CHANGE IS PRIMARILY BILLINGS AND THE NET IMPACT OF DEFERRED REVENUE. THE DEFERRAL FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER OR YEAR IS ADDED TO THE BILLINGS AND THE DEFERRAL AT THE END OF THE PERIOD IS SUBTRACTED FROM THE AMOUNT BILLED. THE TOTAL  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEFERRED REVENUE AT THE END OF EVERY PERIOD IS REFLECTED IN THE LIABILITY SECTION OF THE BALANCE SHEET. DEFERRED REVENUE CAN VARY FOR MANY REASONS, BUT SEASONALITY AND THE TIMING OF THE CLASS STARTS IN RELATION TO THE END OF THE QUARTER WILL CAUSE CHANGES IN THE BALANCE.  AS MENTIONED IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE SECTION, THE CHANGE IN REVENUE CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. REVENUE DOES NOT HAVE THE IMPACT OF CASH RECEIVED WHEREAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DOES. DEPENDING ON THE MONTH AND THE AMOUNT OF CASH RECEIVED, IT IS LIKELY THAT REVENUE OR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WILL INCREASE AT A RATE DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER. THE IMPACT OF CASH IS EASY TO SUBSTANTIATE AS IT AGREES TO DEPOSITS IN OUR BANK ACCOUNTS.  AGI RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES.  AT OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS $1,892,318 WHICH REPRESENTS 9% OF THE GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE OF $20,196,568, THE SUM OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES.  THE INTRODUCTION OF LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  WHEN A STUDENT SIGNS UP FOR THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN, THERE IS A CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT THAT THE COMPANY CAN EXPECT TO EARN OVER THE LIFE OF THE STUDENT\u2019S PROGRAM. THIS CONTRACTUAL AMOUNT CANNOT BE RECORDED AS AN ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE AS THE STUDENT DOES HAVE THE OPTION TO STOP ATTENDING. AS A STUDENT TAKES A CLASS, REVENUE IS EARNED OVER THAT EIGHT-WEEK CLASS. SOME STUDENTS ACCELERATE THEIR PROGRAM, TAKING TWO CLASSES EVERY EIGHT-WEEK PERIOD, AND AS WE DISCUSSED, THAT INCREASES THE STUDENT\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. IF ANY PORTION OF THAT BALANCE WILL BE PAID IN A PERIOD GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS, THAT PORTION IS REFLECTED AS LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  AS A RESULT OF THE GROWING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MONTHLY PAYMENT PLANS, OUR LONG-TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE HAS GROWN FROM $3,085,243 AT APRIL 30, 2019 TO $5,490,733  AT OCTOBER 31, 2019. THE PRIMARY COMPONENT CONSIST OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE MONTHLY PAYMENTS OVER 36 AND 39 MONTHS. THE AVERAGE STUDENT COMPLETES THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAM IN 24 MONTHS, THEREFORE MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE SHORT-TERM.  INCLUDED BELOW IS A GRAPHIC OF BOTH SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS CONTRACTUAL VALUE.  A  B  C  CLASSES TAKEN  LESS MONTHLY  PAYMENTS RECEIVED  PAYMENTS FOR CLASSES  TAKEN THAT ARE GREATER  THAN 12 MONTHS  EXPECTED CLASSES  TO BE TAKEN OVER  BALANCE OF PROGRAM.  SHORT-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  LONG-TERM  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  NOT RECORDED IN  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  THE SUM OF A, B AND C WILL EQUAL THE TOTAL COST OF THE PROGRAM.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FOR THE QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 (FISCAL 2020 Q2) COMPARED WITH THE QUARTER ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 (FISCAL 2019 Q2)  REVENUES  REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED TO $12,085,965 FROM $8,095,344 FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, AN INCREASE OF $3,990,621 OR 49%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LIFETIME VALUE (LTV). BY FOCUSING OUR MARKETING SPEND ON DELIVERING ENROLLMENT GROWTH IN THE DEGREE PROGRAMS WITH THE HIGHEST LIFETIME VALUE (LTV), WE INCREASED OUR AVERAGE REVENUE PER ENROLLMENT (OR ARPU) BY 35%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS REVENUE GROWTH TO CONTINUE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS WE CONTINUE PRIORITIZING OUR HIGHEST LTV DEGREE PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH PLANS.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED 35% YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY'S TRADITIONAL POST-LICENSURE ONLINE NURSING + OTHER BUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTED 61% OF TOTAL COMPANY REVENUE IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE ASPEN UNIVERSITY\u2019S PRE-LICENSURE BSN PROGRAM DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY 12% OF THE COMPANY\u2019S REVENUES IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2. FINALLY, USU CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 27% OF THE TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY NOW EXPECTS ANNUAL REVENUE GROWTH TO MEET OR EXCEED 41% FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR 2020.  COST OF REVENUES (EXCLUSIVE OF AMORTIZATION)  THE COMPANY\u2019S COST OF REVENUES CONSISTS OF INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES AND MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS.  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES  INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES FOR FISCAL 2020 Q2 INCREASED TO $2,181,067 OR 18% OF REVENUES FROM $1,586,904 OR 20% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, AN INCREASE OF $594,163 OR 37%. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER  OF CLASS STARTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES REPRESENTED 16% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE USU INSTRUCTIONAL COSTS AND SERVICES EQUALED 23% OF USU REVENUES DURING THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL  MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 WERE $2,006,989 OR 17% OF REVENUES COMPARED TO $2,248,611 OR 28% OF REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2019 Q2, A DECREASE OF $241,622 OR (11%).

THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR LONG TERM EXPECTATIONS THAT GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WILL GROW AT APPROXIMATELY HALF THE RATE OF REVENUES. THERE IS A PORTION OF THESE COSTS THAT ARE VARIABLE WHICH INCREASED AS OUR REVENUES INCREASED; BUT THERE ALSO IS A FIXED COST COMPONENT THAT TENDS TO GROW AT A SLOWER RATE.  ASPEN UNIVERSITY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE AMOUNT REPRESENTED 44% OF ASPEN UNIVERSITY REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2, WHILE USU GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS EQUALED 56% OF USU REVENUES FOR THE FISCAL 2020 Q2.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE IS MAINLY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE. MOREOVER, AGI HAS MADE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN THE PHOENIX CAMPUSES AND WILL INVEST IN OTHER CAMPUS LOCATIONS THAT WILL CAUSE DEPRECIATION EXPENSE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

INVESTORS SHOULD NOT CONSIDER NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN ISOLATION OR AS SUBSTITUTES FOR PERFORMANCE MEASURES CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  OUR MANAGEMENT USES AND RELIES ON EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT BOTH MANAGEMENT AND SHAREHOLDERS BENEFIT FROM REFERRING TO THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN PLANNING, FORECASTING AND ANALYZING FUTURE PERIODS. OUR MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION MAKING AND AS A MEANS TO EVALUATE PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISON. OUR MANAGEMENT RECOGNIZES THAT THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE INHERENT LIMITATIONS BECAUSE OF THE DESCRIBED EXCLUDED ITEMS.  ASPEN GROUP DEFINES ADJUSTED EBITDA AS EARNINGS (OR LOSS) FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE THE ITEMS IN THE TABLE BELOW INCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $0 IN THE FISCAL 2020 Q2 AND APPROXIMATELY $118,872 IN THE FISCAL 2019 Q2. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE IT ALLOWS MANAGEMENT, INVESTORS AND ANALYSTS TO EVALUATE AND ASSESS OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS FROM PERIOD-TO-PERIOD AFTER REMOVING THE IMPACT OF ITEMS OF A NON-OPERATIONAL NATURE THAT AFFECT COMPARABILITY.  WE HAVE INCLUDED A RECONCILIATION OF OUR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, TOGETHER WITH THE RECONCILIATION TO GAAP, HELPS INVESTORS MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND OTHER COMPANIES. IN MAKING ANY COMPARISONS TO OTHER COMPANIES, INVESTORS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT COMPANIES USE DIFFERENT NON-GAAP MEASURES TO EVALUATE THEIR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. INVESTORS SHOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SPECIFIC DEFINITION BEING USED AND TO THE RECONCILIATION BETWEEN SUCH MEASURE AND THE CORRESPONDING GAAP MEASURE PROVIDED BY EACH COMPANY UNDER APPLICABLE SEC RULES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS A RECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ALLOCABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A SUMMARY OF OUR CASH FLOWS IS AS FOLLOWS.  SIX MONTHS ENDED  OCTOBER 31,  2019  2018  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(  2,025,107  )  $(  5,487,423  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (  1,253,653  )  (  1,431,598  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  237,713  30,270  NET DECREASE IN CASH  $(  3,041,047  )  $(  6,888,751  )  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $(  2,025,107  ) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(  2,713,450  ) AND A NET CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $(2,365,984), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3,054,327 IN NON-CASH ITEMS.  THE NET LOSS INCLUDED $852,649  FOR INTEREST EXPENSE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN GROSS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, BEFORE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS) OF APPROXIMATELY $5.2 MILLION WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION.  CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IS ALSO AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS A FAVORABLE TREND IN WORKING CAPITAL OVER TIME, BUT THERE MAY BE VOLATILITY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER.  SO, IN AGGREGATE THE COMPANY EXPECTS A GENERAL TREND TOWARD LOWER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS IN FUTURE QUARTERS; HOWEVER, SOME QUARTERS COULD HAVE HIGHER CASH USED IN OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF MORE CASH USED TO SUPPORT CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL. PROGRAM START TIMINGS AND THE RELATED FEDERAL FINANCIAL AID DRAWDOWNS ALSO IMPACT CASH TIMING.  FOR EXAMPLE, THIS QUARTER THE TIMING OF THE DRAWDOWN FOR OUR USU MSN-FNP PROGRAM RESULTED IN OVER $500,000 OF CASH JUST BEFORE QUARTER END. IN THE FUTURE, THE OPPOSITE EFFECT MAY OCCUR DEPENDING ON PROGRAM START TIMING DURING THE YEAR.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $(  5,487,423  ) AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE NET LOSS OF $(  5,312,354  ), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1,838,637 IN NON-CASH ITEMS AND $2,013,706 DECREASE IN OPERATING ASSETS  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND LIABILITIES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEM CHANGE IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $4,028,143  WHICH IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUES FROM STUDENTS PAYING THROUGH THE MONTHLY PAYMENT PLAN. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH ITEMS WERE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $1,022,172  AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $515,291.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $(  1,253,653  ) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN COMPANY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $(  1,431,598  ) MOSTLY ATTRIBUTED TO INVESTMENTS IN COURSEWARE AND THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AS WE WERE BUILDING UP OUR CAMPUS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 TOTALED $237,713  WHICH REFLECTS PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND WARRANTS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 TOTALED $30,270  , WHICH REFLECTS STOCK OPTION EXERCISE PROCEEDS NET OF PAYMENT OF OFFERING COSTS.  LIQUIDITY  THE COMPANY HAD CASH DEPOSITS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.3 MILLION ON DECEMBER 6, 2019, INCLUDING $454,288  OF RESTRICTED CASH. IN ADDITION TO ITS CASH, THE COMPANY ALSO HAD ACCESS TO THE $5 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH IS UNUSED. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT ITS CASH RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  OUR CASH BALANCES ARE KEPT LIQUID TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH IS CONCENTRATED IN LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  IN RESPONSE TO FINANCIAL REPORTING RELEASE FR-60, CAUTIONARY ADVICE REGARDING DISCLOSURE ABOUT CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, FROM THE SEC, WE HAVE SELECTED OUR MORE SUBJECTIVE ACCOUNTING ESTIMATION PROCESSES FOR PURPOSES OF EXPLAINING THE METHODOLOGY USED IN CALCULATING THE ESTIMATE, IN ADDITION TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES PERTAINING TO THE ESTIMATE AND THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION AND DEFERRED REVENUE  REVENUE CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF TUITION AND FEES DERIVED FROM COURSES TAUGHT BY ASPEN ONLINE AS WELL AS FROM RELATED EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES THAT ASPEN PROVIDES TO ITS STUDENTS, SUCH AS ACCESS TO OUR ONLINE MATERIALS AND LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. TUITION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED PRO-RATA OVER THE APPLICABLE PERIOD OF INSTRUCTION. ASPEN MAINTAINS AN INSTITUTIONAL TUITION REFUND POLICY, WHICH PROVIDES FOR ALL OR A PORTION OF TUITION TO BE REFUNDED IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS DURING STATED REFUND PERIODS. CERTAIN STATES IN WHICH STUDENTS RESIDE IMPOSE SEPARATE, MANDATORY REFUND POLICIES, WHICH OVERRIDE ASPEN\u2019S POLICY TO THE EXTENT IN CONFLICT. IF A STUDENT WITHDRAWS AT A TIME WHEN A PORTION OR NONE OF THE TUITION IS REFUNDABLE, THEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY, ASPEN RECOGNIZES AS REVENUE THE TUITION THAT WAS NOT REFUNDED. SINCE ASPEN RECOGNIZES REVENUE PRO-RATA OVER THE TERM OF THE COURSE AND BECAUSE, UNDER ITS INSTITUTIONAL REFUND POLICY, THE AMOUNT SUBJECT TO REFUND IS NEVER GREATER THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE REVENUE THAT HAS BEEN DEFERRED, UNDER ASPEN\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE REFUNDED. ASPEN\u2019S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HAVE STARTING AND ENDING DATES THAT DIFFER FROM ITS FISCAL QUARTERS. THEREFORE, AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER, A PORTION OF REVENUE FROM THESE PROGRAMS IS NOT YET EARNED AND IS THEREFORE DEFERRED. ASPEN ALSO CHARGES STUDENTS ANNUAL FEES FOR LIBRARY, TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER SERVICES, WHICH ARE RECOGNIZED OVER THE RELATED SERVICE PERIOD. DEFERRED REVENUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF TUITION, FEES, AND OTHER STUDENT PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN EXCESS OF THE PORTION RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AND IT IS INCLUDED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OTHER REVENUE MAY BE RECOGNIZED AS SALES OCCUR OR SERVICES ARE PERFORMED.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ALL STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SELECT BOTH A PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PAYMENT OPTION WITH RESPECT TO AMOUNTS DUE TO ASPEN FOR TUITION, FEES AND OTHER EXPENSES. THE MOST COMMON PAYMENT OPTION FOR ASPEN\u2019S STUDENTS IS PERSONAL FUNDS OR PAYMENT MADE ON THEIR BEHALF BY AN EMPLOYER. IN INSTANCES WHERE A STUDENT SELECTS FINANCIAL AID AS THE PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION, HE OR SHE OFTEN SELECTS PERSONAL CASH AS THE SECONDARY OPTION. IF A STUDENT WHO HAS SELECTED FINANCIAL AID AS HIS OR HER PRIMARY PAYMENT OPTION WITHDRAWS PRIOR TO THE END OF A COURSE BUT AFTER THE DATE THAT ASPEN\u2019S INSTITUTIONAL REFUND PERIOD HAS EXPIRED, THE STUDENT WILL HAVE INCURRED THE OBLIGATION TO PAY THE FULL COST OF THE COURSE. IF THE WITHDRAWAL OCCURS BEFORE THE DATE AT WHICH THE STUDENT HAS EARNED 100% OF HIS OR HER FINANCIAL AID, ASPEN WILL HAVE TO RETURN ALL OR A PORTION OF THE TITLE IV FUNDS TO THE DOE AND THE STUDENT WILL OWE ASPEN ALL AMOUNTS INCURRED THAT ARE IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL AID THAT THE STUDENT EARNED AND THAT ASPEN IS ENTITLED TO RETAIN. IN THIS CASE, ASPEN MUST COLLECT THE RECEIVABLE USING THE STUDENT\u2019S SECOND PAYMENT OPTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM STUDENTS, ASPEN RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE INABILITY, FAILURE OR REFUSAL OF ITS STUDENTS TO MAKE REQUIRED PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOVERY OF FINANCIAL AID FUNDS ADVANCED TO A STUDENT FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF THE STUDENT\u2019S COST OF TUITION AND RELATED FEES. ASPEN DETERMINES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS USING A GENERAL RESERVE METHOD BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND THE AGING OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN APPLIES RESERVES TO ITS RECEIVABLES BASED UPON AN ESTIMATE OF THE RISK PRESENTED BY THE AGE OF THE RECEIVABLES AND STUDENT STATUS. ASPEN WRITES OFF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES AT THE TIME THE BALANCES ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. ASPEN CONTINUES TO REFLECT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH AN OFFSETTING ALLOWANCE AS LONG AS MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THERE IS A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY OF COLLECTION.  FOR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PRIMARY PAYERS OTHER THAN STUDENTS, ASPEN ESTIMATES ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BY EVALUATING SPECIFIC ACCOUNTS WHERE INFORMATION INDICATES THE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE AN INABILITY TO MEET FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND RECEIVABLE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEYOND CONTRACTUAL TERMS. IN THESE CASES, ASPEN USES ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENT, BASED ON THE BEST AVAILABLE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, TO RECORD A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE FOR THOSE CUSTOMERS AGAINST AMOUNTS DUE TO REDUCE THE RECEIVABLE TO THE AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THESE SPECIFIC ALLOWANCES ARE RE-EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS RECEIVED. THE AMOUNTS CALCULATED ARE ANALYZED TO DETERMINE THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE ALLOWANCE. ASPEN MAY ALSO RECORD A GENERAL ALLOWANCE AS NECESSARY.  DIRECT WRITE-OFFS ARE TAKEN IN THE PERIOD WHEN ASPEN HAS EXHAUSTED ITS EFFORTS TO COLLECT OVERDUE AND UNPAID RECEIVABLES OR OTHERWISE EVALUATE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INDICATE THAT ASPEN SHOULD ABANDON SUCH EFFORTS.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  WE INCLUDE THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF BUSINESSES WE ACQUIRE FROM THE DATE OF THE RESPECTIVE ACQUISITION. WE ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE OF ACQUISITIONS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED AT FAIR VALUE. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS OVER THE AMOUNT ASSIGNED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL. WE EXPENSE TRANSACTION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AS INCURRED.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES  GOODWILL CURRENTLY REPRESENTS THE EXCESS OF PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED FROM EDUCACION SIGNIFICATIVA, LLC. GOODWILL HAS AN INDEFINITE LIFE AND IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS REPRESENT BOTH INDEFINITE LIVED AND DEFINITE LIVED ASSETS. ACCREDITATION AND REGULATORY APPROVALS AND TRADE NAME AND TRADEMARKS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES AND ACCORDINGLY ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE TESTED ANNUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT. STUDENT RELATIONSHIPS AND CURRICULUMS ARE DEEMED TO HAVE DEFINITE LIVES AND ARE AMORTIZED ACCORDINGLY.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ACTIVITIES INVOLVING VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.

DURING THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, OUR NET  SALES DECREASED 7% TO $288.6 MILLION FROM $308.8 MILLION, LOSS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED BY $14.2 MILLION FROM $26.8 MILLION TO  $12.5 MILLION, AND NET LOSS DECREASED $6.2 MILLION FROM $19.7 MILLION, OR $6.78 LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE, TO $13.5 MILLION, OR $4.64  LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE, OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE EXECUTED A WORKFORCE REDUCTION AT  BOTH OUR CORPORATE OFFICE AND FIELD MANAGEMENT AS PART OF OUR COST REDUCTION INITIATIVE ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TURNAROUND PLAN  THAT COMMENCED IN JANUARY 2019. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES IN OCTOBER 2019. AS A RESULT, WE  EXPENSED $0.5 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS RELATED TO CERTAIN EMPLOYEE DEPARTURES, EXCLUDING REVERSAL OF  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, DURING THE THIRTEEN AND THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SEVERANCE BENEFITS ARE  INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  ON JULY 1, 2019, WE EFFECTED A 12-TO-1 STOCK SPLIT (THE \u201cREVERSE  STOCK SPLIT\u201d), REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING ON THAT DATE FROM 35.4 MILLION TO 3.1 MILLION SHARES.  ADDITIONALLY, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK SUBJECT TO OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND RESTRICTED  STOCK UNITS, THE EXERCISE PRICE OF ALL OUR OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, AND THE NUMBER OF SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE ISSUANCE PURSUANT  TO OUR EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS WERE ADJUSTED PROPORTIONATELY IN CONNECTION WITH THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. THE NUMBER OF AUTHORIZED  SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION AND THE PAR VALUE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK  WERE UNCHANGED. ALL HISTORICAL SHARE AND PER SHARE AMOUNTS PRESENTED HEREIN HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED RETROSPECTIVELY TO REFLECT THESE  CHANGES. THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT WAS EFFECTED IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE MARKET PRICE PER SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO ENSURE WE  REGAINED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET LLC\u2019S (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) MINIMUM BID PRICE REQUIREMENT AND  MAINTAINED ITS LISTING ON NASDAQ. NASDAQ INFORMED US ON JULY 17, 2019 THAT WE HAD REGAINED FULL COMPLIANCE WITH NASDAQ\u2019S  LISTING REQUIREMENTS.  ON JULY 31, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A LIMITED  DURATION STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN (THE \u201cRIGHTS PLAN\u201d) WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF AUGUST 1, 2022 AND AN OWNERSHIP  TRIGGER THRESHOLD OF 15%, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.  IN CONNECTION WITH THE RIGHTS PLAN, OUR BOARD OF  DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AND DECLARED A DIVIDEND TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON AUGUST 15, 2019 OF ONE  PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHT (A \u201cRIGHT\u201d) FOR EACH OUTSTANDING SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  UPON  CERTAIN TRIGGERING EVENTS  (NONE OF WHICH  HAVE OCCURRED AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019), EACH RIGHT WILL ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO PURCHASE FROM US ONE FIVE-THOUSANDTH (SUBJECT TO  ADJUSTMENT) OF ONE SHARE OF SERIES A JUNIOR PARTICIPATING PREFERRED STOCK, $0.01 PAR VALUE PER SHARE (THE  \u201cPREFERRED STOCK\u201d) AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $18.00 (THE \u201cEXERCISE PRICE\u201d) PER ONE FIVE-THOUSANDTH OF A  SHARE OF PREFERRED STOCK. IN ADDITION, IF A PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF 15% OR MORE OF OUR COMMON STOCK  WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OR IN THE CASE OF A PERSON OR GROUP THAT BENEFICIALLY OWNED MORE THAN 15%  OF OUR COMMON STOCK PRIOR TO THE ISSUANCE OF THE PRESS RELEASE ANNOUNCING THE ADOPTION OF THE RIGHTS AGREEMENT ON AUGUST 2,  2019, SUCH PERSON OR GROUP ACQUIRES BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF ANY ADDITIONAL SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVAL  OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, EACH HOLDER OF A RIGHT (OTHER THAN THE ACQUIRING PERSON OR GROUP WHOSE RIGHTS WILL BECOME  VOID) WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE, UPON PAYMENT OF THE EXERCISE PRICE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE RIGHTS PLAN, A NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVING A MARKET VALUE OF TWICE THE EXERCISE PRICE  (AS ADJUSTED). THE COMPLETE TERMS OF THE RIGHTS ARE SET FORTH IN A RIGHTS AGREEMENT (THE \u201cRIGHTS  AGREEMENT\u201d), DATED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2019, BETWEEN FRANCESCA\u2019S HOLDINGS CORPORATION AND COMPUTERSHARE TRUST  COMPANY, N.A., AS RIGHTS AGENT, WHICH IS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT 4.1 TO THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.

ON AUGUST 13, 2019, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF OUR PREVIOUSLY  ANNOUNCED STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES REVIEW PROCESS AS WE INTEND TO FOCUS ON THE EXECUTION OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  OUR BOUTIQUE COUNT DECREASED TO 714 BOUTIQUES AS OF NOVEMBER  2, 2019 FROM 738 BOUTIQUES AS OF NOVEMBER 3, 2018. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, OUR CURRENT PRIORITY IS EXECUTING OUR TURNAROUND PLAN  WHICH IS AIMED AT IMPROVING COMPARABLE SALES AND PROFITABILITY. AS SUCH, WE PLAN TO CLOSE AT LEAST THREE EXISTING BOUTIQUES DURING  THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR AS WE CONTINUE TO OPTIMIZE OUR EXISTING BOUTIQUE FLEET. WE PLAN TO RESUME NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS  AND REMODELS IN THE FUTURE, AS APPROPRIATE, WHEN THE DESIRED RESULTS ARE ACHIEVED UNDER OUR TURNAROUND PLAN.  16  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING REPRESENTS OPERATING DATA FOR THE THIRTEEN AND  THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 3, 2018.

IF A BOUTIQUE IS CLOSED FOR FOUR OR MORE DAYS WITHIN A GIVEN FISCAL WEEK FOR ANY REASON, WE EXCLUDE SALES FROM THAT BOUTIQUE FROM  COMPARABLE SALES FOR THAT FULL FISCAL WEEK. IF A BOUTIQUE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED, WE EXCLUDE SALES FROM THAT BOUTIQUE FROM COMPARABLE  SALES ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH THAT IT DID NOT REGISTER FULL MONTH OF SALES. COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE OUR ECOMMERCE  SALES AND EXCLUDE GIFT CARD BREAKAGE INCOME.  (2)  NET SALES PER AVERAGE SQUARE FOOT IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET SALES FOR THE PERIOD BY THE AVERAGE SQUARE FEET DURING THE  PERIOD. FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING NET SALES PER SQUARE FOOT MEASURE, WE USE AVERAGE SQUARE FEET DURING THE PERIOD AS OPPOSED TO  TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. FOR INDIVIDUAL QUARTERLY PERIODS, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET IS CALCULATED AS (A) THE  SUM OF TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD DIVIDED BY (B) TWO. FOR PERIODS CONSISTING OF MORE THAN  ONE FISCAL QUARTER, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET IS CALCULATED AS (A) THE SUM OF TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD  AND TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER WITHIN THE PERIOD, DIVIDED BY (B) THE NUMBER OF FISCAL QUARTERS  WITHIN THE PERIOD PLUS ONE (WHICH, FOR A FISCAL YEAR, IS FIVE). THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS IN THE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS  AND OTHER RETAILERS CALCULATE SALES PER SQUARE FOOT OR SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES. AS A RESULT, AVERAGE SQUARE FEET AND NET SALES  PER AVERAGE SQUARE FOOT FOR THE PERIOD MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR DATA MADE AVAILABLE BY OTHER RETAILERS.  (3)  AVERAGE SQUARE FEET PER BOUTIQUE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET AT THE END OF THE PERIOD BY THE NUMBER OF  BOUTIQUES OPEN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD.

COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 1%  PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN BOUTIQUE CONVERSION RATE AND AVERAGE UNITS SOLD PER TRANSACTION. THIS INCREASE WAS OFFSET BY  NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NET DECREASE IN BOUTIQUE COUNT DURING THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED TO THE  SAME PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THERE WERE 705 COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES AND 9 NON-COMPARABLE BOUTIQUES OPEN AT NOVEMBER 2, 2019 COMPARED  TO 675 AND 63, RESPECTIVELY, AT NOVEMBER 3, 2018.

THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.6 MILLION DECREASE IN BOUTIQUE PAYROLL AND SUPPLIES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COST  REDUCTION INITIATIVES UNDER OUR TURNAROUND PLAN AND $1.3 MILLION OF LOWER CORPORATE PAYROLL AND RELATED EXPENSES MOSTLY DUE  TO THE HEADCOUNT REDUCTION BUT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.2 MILLION INCREASE IN SHORT TERM INCENTIVE BONUS EXPENSES AS  NO AMOUNT WAS ACCRUED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO A 6% DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES DRIVEN BY WEAK SALES IN THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AS A RESULT OF A DECLINE IN  TRAFFIC AND CONVERSION RATES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND LOWER AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL PRICES DUE TO DEEPER  MARKDOWNS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES. OUR WORKING CAPITAL POSITION  BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE DAY OF OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD  TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN SEVERAL DAYS OF THE RELATED SALES AND WE TYPICALLY HAVE UP TO 45 DAYS TO PAY OUR INVENTORY VENDORS AND UP  TO 60 DAYS TO PAY OTHER VENDORS.  AT NOVEMBER 2, 2019, WE HAD $21.2 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,  $20.0 MILLION OF COMBINED BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING, AND $24.0 MILLION OF COMBINED BORROWING BASE AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL  CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF OUR DEBT COVENANTS AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ANY AVAILABLE  BORROWINGS UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CASH FLOW  A SUMMARY OF OUR OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD AS COMPARED TO THE  SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO ACCELERATED INVENTORY RECEIPTS IN ORDER TO ALIGN OUR INVENTORY LEVELS WITH  OUR HOLIDAY SEASON PLANS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS AND THE $8.5 MILLION INCOME TAX REFUND  RECEIVED IN APRIL 2019.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR NEW BOUTIQUES, IMPROVEMENTS TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES, AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OUR DISTRIBUTION FACILITY.

OUR SPENDING IN  THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 2, 2019 WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PAYMENT OF PRIOR YEAR ACCRUED CONSTRUCTIONS COSTS MOSTLY  ASSOCIATED WITH BOUTIQUE REMODELS. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO  SUBSTANTIALLY DECREASE, OUR INVESTMENTS IN NEW BOUTIQUES, REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 UNTIL THE DESIRED  RESULTS OF OUR TURNAROUND PLAN ARE ACHIEVED. FOR THE THIRTY-SIX WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2018, OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE  MOSTLY RELATED TO EXISTING BOUTIQUE REMODELS AND NEW BOUTIQUE OPENINGS.

ADDITIONALLY, WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY TENANT ALLOWANCES FOR NEW BOUTIQUES  OPENED DURING THE CURRENT YEAR PERIOD AS WE CONTINUED OUR FOCUS ON LOWERING RENTAL RATES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION. THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT WILL BE SPENT ON IMPROVEMENTS  TO EXISTING BOUTIQUES AND INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY.

THE $10.0 MILLION PROCEEDS FROM  THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WERE USED TO PAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BORROWING UNDER OUR AMENDED ABL CREDIT AGREEMENT.

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1  TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR  THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  23  CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY\u2019S ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  ARE CONSIDERED CRITICAL, AS THESE POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO THE DEPICTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT, DIFFICULT, OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY  UNCERTAIN. SUCH POLICIES ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019. EXCEPT AS NOTED BELOW,  AS OF NOVEMBER 2, 2019, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ANY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DISCLOSED  IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  LEASES  ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) 842, \u201cLEASES\u201d, USING THE ADDITIONAL, OPTIONAL TRANSITION METHOD WHICH ALLOWS  ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE NEW STANDARD BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS  AT THE DATE OF ADOPTION. PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES WERE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED UNDER ASC 840, \u201cLEASES.\u201d  AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION, WE RECORDED AN OPERATING LEASE LIABILITY OF $278.9 MILLION AND OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d)  ASSET OF $242.9 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 3, 2019. ADDITIONALLY, WE RECOGNIZED $1.8 MILLION CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE BEGINNING  BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ROU ASSETS SUBJECTED TO IMPAIRMENT TESTING UNDER EXISTING ACCOUNTING  GUIDANCE FOR WHICH INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842. THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 DID NOT HAVE  A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WE LEASE OUR BOUTIQUES, DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OFFICE SPACE,  AND CERTAIN BOUTIQUE AND CORPORATE OFFICE EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, WE DETERMINE IF AN ARRANGEMENT  IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION AND RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON  THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FIXED LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM AND, FOR OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS, INCLUDE INITIAL DIRECT  COSTS AND EXCLUDE LEASE INCENTIVES. VARIABLE LEASE PAYMENTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. LEASE TERMS MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND  OR TERMINATE THE LEASE WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL ELECT THAT OPTION. SUBSEQUENT TO THE RECOGNITION OF ITS OPERATING  LEASE ROU ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES, WE RECOGNIZE LEASE EXPENSE RELATED TO ITS OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE  BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED USING THE EFFECTIVE  INTEREST METHOD AND RECOGNIZED AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE REASONABLY CERTAIN  LEASE TERM. AS OUR LEASES GENERALLY DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE A COLLATERALIZED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE TO DETERMINE  THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. THE COLLATERALIZED INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS BASED ON A SYNTHETIC CREDIT RATING THAT IS  EXTERNALLY PREPARED AT EACH MEASUREMENT.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING OPERATING LEASE  ROU ASSETS  WE EVALUATE LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE, INCLUDING OPERATING  LEASE ROU ASSETS, AND HELD FOR SALE WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THOSE ASSETS  MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ASSETS ARE GROUPED AND EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL FOR WHICH THERE ARE IDENTIFIABLE CASH  FLOWS, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT A BOUTIQUE LEVEL. IN DETERMINING WHETHER AN IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, WE CONSIDER BOTH QUALITATIVE  AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS.  THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS INVOLVES ESTIMATING THE UNDISCOUNTED  FUTURE CASH FLOWS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THAT ASSET AND COMPARING IT AGAINST ITS CARRYING VALUE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET  IS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE  CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET AND ITS FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING DISCOUNTED FUTURE  CASH FLOWS OR A MARKET PARTICIPANT\u2019S ABILITY TO GENERATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS USING THE ASSET IN ITS HIGHEST AND BEST USE, WHICHEVER  IS APPROPRIATE. THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE ASSET\u2019S HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE, CURRENT SALES TRENDS,  MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS DEEMED MATERIAL, AND DISCOUNTED USING A RATE COMMENSURATE WITH THE RISK. THE INPUTS  USED IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE ARE CONSIDERED AS LEVEL 3 INPUTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT  DEGREE OF JUDGMENT AND ARE BASED ON OUR OWN ASSUMPTIONS.  RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  FOR INFORMATION REGARDING RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS,  PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 1 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I OF THIS REPORT, WHICH IS INCORPORATED  HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

IN DECEMBER 2017, WE ACQUIRED OUTWARD, INC., A  3-D  IMAGING AND AUGMENTED REALITY PLATFORM FOR THE HOME FURNISHINGS AND DE\u0301COR INDUSTRY.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2019 (\u201cTHIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018 (\u201cTHIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018\u201d) AND THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 3, 2019  (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE  FISCAL 2019\u201d), AS COMPARED TO THE THIRTY-NINE WEEKS ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018  (\u201cYEAR-TO-DATE  FISCAL 2018\u201d), SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO. ALL EXPLANATIONS OF CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE.  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FINANCIAL RESULTS  NET REVENUES IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED BY $85,489,000, OR 6.3%, COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WITH COMPARABLE BRAND REVENUE GROWTH OF 5.5%. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEST ELM AND POTTERY BARN. NET REVENUE GROWTH INCLUDED A 9.2% INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL REVENUE ACROSS BOTH OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND FRANCHISE OPERATIONS.  WEST ELM\u2019S RESULTS THIS QUARTER WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH STRATEGIES AND EFFECTIVE EXECUTION. COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH ACCELERATED TO 14.1% THIS QUARTER WITH STRENGTH ACROSS ALL PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND CHANNELS. THE POTTERY BARN BRANDS ALSO MAINTAINED THEIR STRONG MOMENTUM FROM LAST QUARTER. IN POTTERY BARN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 3.4% DRIVEN BY OUR INITIATIVES, INCLUDING OUR CURATED POTTERY BARN MARKETPLACE ASSORTMENT AND OUR APARTMENT ASSORTMENT OF SMALLER SPACE SOLUTIONS. THEIR PERFORMANCE WAS ALSO DRIVEN BY STRONG DIGITAL GROWTH INCLUDING DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASES IN TRAFFIC AND PRODUCT ENGAGEMENT. IN POTTERY BARN KIDS AND TEEN, COMPARABLE REVENUE GROWTH WAS 4.0%. WE CONTINUE TO SEE STRONG GROWTH IN BOTH OUR BABY BUSINESS AND OUR HIGH QUALITY DORM ROOM BEDDING, FURNITURE AND  NO-NAILS  DECORATION SOLUTIONS. IN THE WILLIAMS SONOMA BRAND, THE 2.1% COMPARABLE REVENUE DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SALES SHORTFALLS IN ELECTRICS, BAKEWARE, HOUSEWARES AND OUR HALLOWEEN ASSORTMENTS. DESPITE THIS, WE WERE ENCOURAGED THAT EXECUTION AGAINST OUR TRANSFORMATION PLAN HAS SHOWN IMPROVED PROFITABILITY, AND OUR WILLIAMS SONOMA BRANDED PRODUCTS CONTINUED TO GAIN MOMENTUM. OUR EMERGING BRANDS, REJUVENATION AND MARK & GRAHAM, DROVE ANOTHER QUARTER OF STRONG, PROFITABLE GROWTH AS THEY CONTINUE TO SCALE AND ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS.  GROSS PROFIT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED TO 35.9% OF REVENUES VERSUS 36.5% IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREMENTAL IMPACT FROM THE CHINA TARIFFS, AS WELL AS INCREASED SHIPPING COSTS DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF FURNITURE SALES. DESPITE THE TARIFF IMPACT ALMOST DOUBLING FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR MARGINS SEQUENTIALLY IMPROVED BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED SUCCESS WE ARE SEEING FROM ALL OF OUR MITIGATION EFFORTS.  WE HAVE BEEN EXECUTING AGAINST AN AGGRESSIVE TARIFF MITIGATION PLAN WHICH INCLUDES COST REDUCTIONS FROM VENDORS, MOVING PRODUCTION OUT OF CHINA TO SOUTH EAST ASIA AND TO THE UNITED STATES, COST SAVINGS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE BUSINESS, AS WELL AS SELECT PRICE INCREASES. THESE EFFORTS COMBINED WITH OUR HIGHER PRODUCT MARGINS,  ON-GOING  OCCUPANCY LEVERAGE, OVERALL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE LEVERAGE FROM HIGHER SALES AND THE CONTINUED BENEFITS OF OUR COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES ACROSS THE BUSINESS, OFFSET THE FINANCIAL IMPACT FROM THESE INCREASED COSTS.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.94 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.07 IMPACT FROM ACQUISITION-RELATED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND THE OPERATIONS OF OUTWARD, INC.) VERSUS $1.00 IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 (WHICH INCLUDED A $0.06 IMPACT RELATED TO OUTWARD, INC., A $0.02 IMPACT FROM EMPLOYMENT-RELATED EXPENSES, A $0.01 IMPACT RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT AND EARLY LEASE TERMINATION CHARGES, AND A $0.13 NET TAX BENEFIT FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT). WE ALSO RETURNED $78,289,000 TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND STOCK REPURCHASES.  OPERATIONALLY DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ALSO MADE PROGRESS ACROSS OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OF DRIVING GROWTH THROUGH CROSS-BRAND INITIATIVES AND IMPROVING THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENTS.  A KEY DRIVER OF OUR GROWTH THIS QUARTER WAS THE FOCUS ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF BRANDS. THE KEY REWARDS CONTINUES TO BE AN IMPACTFUL DRIVER OF REVENUES AND CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AS TOTAL MEMBERSHIP CONTINUED TO GROW DURING THE QUARTER. OUR CROSS-BRAND  BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS  DIVISION ALSO DELIVERED ANOTHER STRONG QUARTER OF REVENUE GROWTH AND MARKED THE SUCCESSFUL RELAUNCH OF OUR  BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS  MEMBERSHIP PROGRAM.  ALSO, DURING THE QUARTER, WE MADE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS ON OUR ONGOING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. IN TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR PRODUCT INFORMATION PAGE, SITE SPEED, ENHANCED THE SEARCH EXPERIENCE, AND ADDED NEW CAPABILITIES TO DISPLAY LIFESTYLE ROOM IMAGERY AND PRODUCT INFORMATION, AS WELL AS  ADD-TO-CART  FUNCTIONALITY IN OUR SHOPPABLE ROOMS. IN OUR SUPPLY  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHAIN THIS QUARTER, TECHNOLOGY IS FACILITATING FASTER AND MORE STREAMLINED ORDER PROCESSING THROUGH A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS AND, TO FURTHER IMPROVE ORDER VISIBILITY, WE ARE CONTINUALLY BUILDING ON OUR FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE MORE ACCURATE, DATA-DRIVEN DELIVERY ESTIMATES TO CUSTOMERS. FURTHER, WITHIN OUR  IN-HOME  FURNITURE DELIVERY NETWORK, WE\u2019VE EXPANDED THE ROLLOUT OF A SAME DAY DELIVERY ORDER TRACKING PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, OUR WEST ELM WEST COAST DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN FONTANA, CALIFORNIA IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL, FACILITATING GROWTH FOR OUR WEST ELM BRAND ON THE WEST COAST.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONTINUED FOCUS ON EVOLUTION AND INNOVATION IS REFLECTED IN OUR BUSINESS RESULTS. OUR VALUE PROPOSITION OF HIGH QUALITY,  DESIGN-LED,  SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH OUR MULTI-BRAND, DIGITAL-FIRST OPERATING MODEL IS A STRONG COMBINATION.

STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 118 (\u201cSAB 118\u201d) ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IN DECEMBER 2017 PROVIDED US WITH UP TO ONE YEAR TO FINALIZE OUR MEASUREMENT OF THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE 2017 TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON OUR FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 28, 2018. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SAB 118 ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE  RE-MEASUREMENT  OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018.

STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDENDS  SEE NOTE G TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND DIVIDENDS,  WITHIN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM  10-Q  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE EVALUATED ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OTHER THAN THOSE DISCUSSED IN NOTES H, I AND M TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM  10-K  FOR THE YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 3, 2019.  SEASONALITY  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL SEASONAL VARIATIONS IN DEMAND. HISTORICALLY, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE BEEN REALIZED DURING THE PERIOD FROM OCTOBER THROUGH JANUARY, AND LEVELS OF NET REVENUES AND NET EARNINGS HAVE TYPICALLY BEEN LOWER DURING THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY THROUGH SEPTEMBER. WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE GENERAL PATTERN ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL INDUSTRY.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY EARNED A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $5,578,000 ON SALES OF $66,998,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $4,035,000 ON SALES OF $76,809,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $9,811,000 OR 12.8%, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY BEGAN THE QUARTER WITH AN ORDER BACKLOG THAT WAS MORE THAN $18 MILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO SLOW ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 14% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, INCREASING BY OVER 27% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE DECREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE QUARTER WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCED BEGINNING BACKLOG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASED ORDER RATE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER.  ORDER BACKLOG AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS APPROXIMATELY $19.0 MILLION AND IS $3 MILLION GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS REFLECT CONTINUED SEASONALITY OF THE COMPANY\u2019S BUSINESS.  SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MANY PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HAVE ACCELERATED THE BEGINNING OF BACK TO SCHOOL TO MID-AUGUST, IMPACTING THE SUMMER DELIVERY WINDOW.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIALLY REVISED ITS PRODUCTION STOCKING PROGRAM IN ORDER TO FACILITATE THE TIMELINESS AND COMPLETENESS OF ORDER FULFILLMENT DURING THE SUMMER.  THIS NEW PRODUCTION STOCKING PROGRAM WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE TIMELINESS OF DELIVERIES AND A GREATER PORTION OF ORDERS FILLED IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  IN THE PRIOR YEAR THE COMPANY WAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INCREASED COST OF COMMODITIES, PARTICULARLY STEEL AND COMPONENTS IMPORTED FROM CHINA.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY INCREASED COSTS FOR LABOR, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, AND FREIGHT.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THESE COSTS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020, INCLUDING ADDITIONAL TARIFF RELATED COSTS INCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020.  TO COMPENSATE FOR THESE INCREASED COSTS, THE COMPANY RAISED SELLING PRICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR.  THE AMOUNT OF PRICE INCREASE VARIED BASED UPON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND COMPETITIVE CONSIDERATIONS, BUT NO PRODUCT INCREASED BY LESS THAN 10%.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER WAS 40.1% COMPARED TO 34.4% IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE PRICE INCREASE DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD VARIANCES INCURRED WHEN PRODUCTION RATES DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $993,000 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 30.6% FROM 28.0%. THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASED FREIGHT EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY $27,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED LESS MONEY TO FINANCE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL IN THE THIRD QUARTER.  NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY EARNED A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $10,177,000 ON NET SALES OF $164,250,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX PROFIT OF $6,594,000 ON NET SALES OF $174,180,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9,930,000 OR 5.7% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THIS NET DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN UNIT VOLUME OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING PRICES.  THE COMPANY BEGAN THE YEAR WITH A BACKLOG OF ORDERS THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 14% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, INCREASING BY OVER 27% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  BECAUSE THE THIRD QUARTER IS TRADITIONALLY A SLOW PERIOD FOR ORDERS, STRONG THIRD QUARTER ORDER RATES MITIGATED THE REDUCTION FOR THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS, BUT AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019 ORDERS TRAILED THE PRIOR YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION, A 7.3% REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  AS DESCRIBED ABOVE THE COMPANY INCREASED SELLING PRICES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR TO RECOVER INCREASED COMMODITY AND OTHER COSTS INCURRED DURING 2018.  THE IMPACT OF THE PRICE INCREASE WAS NOT FULLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE SECOND QUARTER AS THE BEGINNING BACKLOG AT JANUARY 31, 2019 REFLECTED SELLING PRICES IN EFFECT PRIOR TO THE PRICE INCREASE.  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES IMPROVED TO 39.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO 35.2% IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN WAS FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE PRICE INCREASE DESCRIBED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD VARIANCES INCURRED WHEN PRODUCTION RATES DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO THE DECREASE IN UNIT VOLUME.  22  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $186,000 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR AND INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES BY 1.7%.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED BY $312,000 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED SLIGHTLY MORE MONEY TO FINANCE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN PRE-TAX INCOME.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL SALES VOLUME IS SHIPPED IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE THROUGH AUGUST OF EACH YEAR.  THE COMPANY TRADITIONALLY MANUFACTURES LARGE QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF SEASONALLY HIGH SUMMER SHIPMENTS.  IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY FINANCES A LARGE BALANCE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DURING THE PEAK SEASON.  DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF THE THIRD QUARTER, THE COMPANY TYPICALLY REPAYS SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE SEASONAL WORKING CAPITAL BORROWED TO FINANCE THE SUMMER ACTIVITY.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASED BY $4,504,000 FROM JANUARY 31, 2019 TO OCTOBER 31, 2019.  THIS COMPARES TO PRIOR YEAR WHEN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE GREW BY $12,896,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD.  THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE WAS APPROXIMATELY $6.6 MILLION LOWER AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 THAN AT OCTOBER 31, 2018 DUE TO LOWER THIRD QUARTER SALES.  THE DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE JANUARY 31, 2019, WAS OFFSET IN PART BY A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNT PAYABLE.  FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS, THE COMPANY DECREASED INVENTORY BY APPROXIMATELY $4,382,000 AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2019.  THIS COMPARES TO AN INCREASE OF $613,000 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  INVENTORY AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS $238,000 GREATER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE AN INCREASE IN VALUATION DUE TO INCREASED COMMODITY AND TARIFFS COSTS.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC BANK WERE HIGHER IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THE YEAR.  CAPITAL SPENDING FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS $2,963,000 COMPARED TO $3,319,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE BEING FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC BANK AND OPERATING CASH FLOW.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY'S UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY WITH PNC BANK WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE OUTLINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU NO. 2016-02-  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND APPLYING THE TRANSITIONAL RELIEF ALLOWING ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS AT THE ADOPTION DATE BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 842, THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS, OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION. AS MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE THE INTEREST RATE  23  ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS WITH SIMILAR TERMS AND PAYMENTS USING COMPANY SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREADS. THE COMPANY USES THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN READILY DETERMINABLE. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE USED IS 6.39%.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION AND $25.6 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019.

(THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d OR \u201cWE\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON JULY 16, 2009 AND HAS A FISCAL  YEAR END OF JANUARY 31. IT IS AN EXPLORATION-STAGE COMPANY.  GOING  CONCERN  TO  DATE THE COMPANY HAS NO OPERATIONS OR REVENUES AND CONSEQUENTLY HAS INCURRED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. NO REVENUES ARE  ANTICIPATED UNTIL WE COMPLETE THE PLAN OF OPERATION DESCRIBED IN THIS FORM 10-Q AND IMPLEMENT OUR INITIAL BUSINESS PLAN. THE ABILITY  OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT ON RAISING CAPITAL TO FUND OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND ULTIMATELY TO ATTAIN  PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT AS TO THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.  OUR  ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN FINANCED PRIMARILY FROM THE PROCEEDS OF SHARE SUBSCRIPTIONS. FROM OUR INCEPTION TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE RAISED  A TOTAL OF $31,500 FROM PRIVATE OFFERINGS OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  THE  COMPANY PLANS TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY OFFERINGS. THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE  TO RAISE ANY CAPITAL THROUGH THIS OR ANY OTHER OFFERINGS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cUS  GAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT  ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING  VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES  UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE POLICIES BELOW AS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND TO  THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  BASIS  OF PRESENTATION  THE  COMPANY REPORTS REVENUES AND EXPENSES USING THE ACCRUAL METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY  ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d) FOR FINANCIAL AND TAX REPORTING PURPOSES.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENT  THE  COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS PURCHASED WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS.  FOREIGN  CURRENCY TRANSLATION  THE  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PRESENTED IN UNITED STATES DOLLARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION \u201cASC 830\u201d,  \u201cFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\u201d, FOREIGN DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED TO THEIR UNITED  STATES DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES WHICH PREVAILED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. NON-MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE TRANSLATED AT EXCHANGE RATES PREVAILING AT THE TRANSACTION DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE  DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED. RELATED TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT,  WHEREAS GAINS OR LOSSES RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  9  BASIC  AND DILUTED NET LOSS PER SHARE  BASIC  LOSS PER SHARE INCLUDES NO DILUTION AND IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE  NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR THE PERIOD. DILUTIVE LOSS PER SHARE REFLECTS THE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF SECURITIES THAT  COULD SHARE IN THE LOSSES OF THE COMPANY.  BECAUSE  THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES, THE ACCOMPANYING PRESENTATION IS ONLY OF BASIC LOSS PER SHARE.  PLAN  OF OPERATION  WE  ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY ENGAGED IN THE BUSINESS OF ACQUIRING MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS THROUGHOUT ASIA, EXPLORING FOR  COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES OF MINERALS, AND EXPLOITING ANY MINERAL DEPOSITS WE DISCOVER THAT DEMONSTRATE ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY.  SINCE WE ARE AN EXPLORATION STAGE COMPANY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT COMMERCIALLY EXPLOITABLE RESERVES OF VALUABLE MINERALS EXIST  ON ANY PROPERTY THAT WE NOW OWN OR MAY OWN IN THE FUTURE. WE WILL NEED TO DO FURTHER EXPLORATION BEFORE A FINAL EVALUATION OF  THE ECONOMIC AND LEGAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR FUTURE EXPLORATION IS DETERMINED.  WE  ARE PRESENTLY SEEKING TO ACQUIRE MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS. SUCH RIGHTS WILL LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF AN OPTION ON PATENTED OR  UNPATENTED MINERAL CLAIMS PROSPECTIVE FOR PRECIOUS METALS OR ORE MINERALS IN ASIA. UPON ACQUIRING SUCH MINERAL EXPLORATION RIGHTS,  WE WILL REQUIRE FINANCING TO EXPLORE THE UNDERLYING CLAIMS TO DETERMINE IF THEY CONTAIN COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES OF  PRECIOUS METALS OR ORE MINERALS. WE WILL BE UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF SUCH EXPLORATION UNTIL WE KNOW THE SIZE AND LOCATION  OF THE PROPERTY LAND WITH UNDERLYING MINERAL RIGHTS. WE EXPECT THAT SUCH EXPLORATION COSTS WILL TYPICALLY CONSIST OF FEES TO BE  PAID FOR CONSULTING SERVICES CONNECTED WITH EXPLORATION, THE COST OF ROCK SAMPLING (THE COLLECTION OF A SERIES OF SMALL CHIPS  OVER A MEASURED DISTANCE, WHICH IS THEN SUBMITTED FOR A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS, USUALLY TO DETERMINE THE METALLIC CONTENT OVER THE  SAMPLED INTERVAL, A PRE-DETERMINED LOCATION(S) ON THE PROPERTY), AND COST OF ANALYZING THESE SAMPLES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT  WE WILL BE ABLE TO LOCATE A SUITABLE EXPLORATION PROPERTY, OR THAT IF WE DO, IT WILL CONTAIN COMMERCIALLY PRODUCIBLE QUANTITIES  OF MINERALS.  IF  WE DISCOVER SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES OF PRECIOUS METALS OR MINERAL ORES ON ANY PROPERTY UNDERLYING OUR MINERAL RIGHTS, WE WILL BEGIN  TECHNICAL AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY STUDIES TO DETERMINE IF WE HAVE RESERVES. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF SUCH  FEASIBILITY STUDIES UNTIL WE KNOW THE SIZE AND LOCATION OF THE PROPERTY. WE WILL ONLY CONSIDER DEVELOPING A PROPERTY IF WE HAVE  PROVEN RESERVES OF PRECIOUS METALS OR MINERAL ORES THAT CAN BE PROFITABLY EXTRACTED.  ANY  WORK THAT WOULD BE CONDUCTED ON A PROPERTY WOULD BE CONDUCTED BY UNAFFILIATED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT WE WILL HIRE. THE INDEPENDENT  CONTRACTORS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, ENGINEERING, EXPLORATION, AND EXCAVATION. THE PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERS AND  GEOLOGISTS WE ENGAGE WILL EVALUATE THE INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THE EXPLORATION AND EXCAVATION, AND WILL ADVISE US ON THE ECONOMIC  FEASIBILITY OF REMOVING THE MINERALIZED MATERIAL.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  THREE  AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  WE  RECORDED NO REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. FROM THE PERIOD OF JULY 16, 2009 (INCEPTION)  TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE RECORDED NO REVENUES.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $3,534, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $1,696. FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $10,870, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $5,088.  FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $4,843, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $1,500. FOR THE NINE  MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, OFFICE AND GENERAL EXPENSES WERE $10,129, AND PROFESSIONAL FEES WERE $4,600.  FROM  THE PERIOD OF JULY 16, 2009 (INCEPTION) TO OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE INCURRED OPERATING EXPENSES OF $255,123.  10  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AT  OCTOBER 31, 2019, WE HAD NO CASH BALANCE. WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH ON HAND TO FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES BEYOND  12 MONTHS. WE WILL NEED TO RAISE FUNDS TO COMMENCE OUR EXPLORATION PROGRAM AND FUND OUR ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES. ADDITIONAL  FUNDING WILL LIKELY COME FROM EQUITY FINANCING FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR SALE OF PART OF OUR INTEREST IN OUR MINERAL  CLAIMS. IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETING AN EQUITY FINANCING, EXISTING SHAREHOLDERS WILL EXPERIENCE DILUTION OF THEIR INTEREST  IN OUR COMPANY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY FINANCING ARRANGEMENT AND WE CANNOT PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH ANY ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE  TO RAISE SUFFICIENT FUNDING FROM THE SALE OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO FUND OUR EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES AND ONGOING OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.  IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH FINANCING, OUR BUSINESS WILL LIKELY FAIL. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE FURTHER  SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR ANY OTHER FORM OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O  F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT MAY AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES, COSTS AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES LISTED BELOW INVOLVE OUR MORE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE POLICIES ARE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (\u201cMD&A\u201d) UNDER PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2019, AS FILED WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ON MAY 1, 2019, AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING AREAS.  \u2022  REVENUE RECOGNITION;  \u2022  ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS;  \u2022  INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS;  \u2022  PATENT LITIGATION AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES; AND  \u2022  DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OUR COMPANY  WE ARE A TELEMATICS PIONEER LEADING TRANSFORMATION IN A MOBILE CONNECTED ECONOMY. WE HELP REINVENT BUSINESSES AND IMPROVE LIVES AROUND THE GLOBE WITH TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS THAT STREAMLINE COMPLEX INTERNET OF THINGS (\u201cIOT\u201d) DEVELOPMENTS THROUGH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY SOLUTIONS AND DERIVED DATA INTELLIGENCE. OUR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, SCALABLE CLOUD SERVICES, AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES COLLECT AND ASSESS BUSINESS-CRITICAL DATA FROM MOBILE ASSETS AND THEIR CONTENTS. OUR BUSINESS IS ORGANIZED INTO TWO REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: TELEMATICS SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT OUR CEO, THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER (\u201cCODM\u201d), USES TO EVALUATE AND OPERATE THE BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, CUSTOMER BASE, HOMOGENEITY OF PRODUCTS, AND TECHNOLOGY WITHIN THESE TWO SEGMENTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS IS PROVIDED BELOW.  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF TRACKER NETWORK (UK) LIMITED (\u201cTRACKER UK\u201d), A LOJACK LICENSEE AND A MARKET LEADER IN  STOLEN VEHICLE RECOVERY  (\u201cSVR\u201d) TELEMATICS SERVICES ACROSS THE UNITED KINGDOM, FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $13.1 MILLION. ON MARCH 19, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CAR TRACK, S.A. DE C.V. (\u201cLOJACK MEXICO\u201d), THE EXCLUSIVE LICENSEE OF LOJACK TECHNOLOGY FOR THE MEXICAN MARKET. WE PURCHASED THE REMAINING 87.5% OF THE LOJACK MEXICO SHARES THAT WE DID NOT OWN FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $14.3 MILLION. ON APRIL 12, 2019, WE ACQUIRED SYNOVIA SOLUTIONS LLC (\u201cSYNOVIA\u201d), A NORTH AMERICAN MARKET LEADER IN FLEET SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT FOR K-12 SCHOOL BUS AND STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FLEETS FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF $49.8 MILLION. COMBINED WITH THE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK AND LOJACK MEXICO, THE SYNOVIA ACQUISITION EXPANDS OUR FLEET MANAGEMENT AND VEHICLE SAFETY SERVICES PORTFOLIO AND ACCELERATES OUR TRANSFORMATION TO HIGH-VALUE SUBSCRIPTION-BASED SERVICES. SEE NOTE 2 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THESE ACQUISITIONS.  TELEMATICS SYSTEMS  OUR TELEMATICS SYSTEMS SEGMENT OFFERS A SERIES OF ADVANCED TELEMATICS AND SVR PRODUCTS FOR THE BROADER CONNECTED VEHICLE MARKETPLACE, WHICH ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO OPTIMIZE THEIR OPERATIONS BY COLLECTING, MONITORING AND EFFECTIVELY REPORTING BUSINESS-CRITICAL INFORMATION AND DESIRED INTELLIGENCE FROM HIGH-VALUE REMOTE AND MOBILE ASSETS. OUR TELEMATICS PRODUCTS INCLUDE ASSET TRACKING UNITS, MOBILE TELEMATICS DEVICES, MOBILE GATEWAYS, AND ROUTERS. THESE WIRELESS NETWORKING DEVICES UNDERPIN A WIDE RANGE OF SOLUTIONS, AND ARE IDEAL FOR APPLICATIONS DEMANDING SECURE, RELIABLE AND BUSINESS-CRITICAL COMMUNICATIONS.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT OFFERS CLOUD-BASED APPLICATION ENABLEMENT AND TELEMATICS SERVICE PLATFORMS THAT FACILITATE INTEGRATION OF OUR OWN APPLICATIONS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF THIRD PARTIES, THROUGH OPEN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES (\u201cAPIS\u201d) TO DELIVER FULL-FEATURED MOBILE IOT SOLUTIONS TO A WIDE RANGE OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS. OUR SCALABLE PROPRIETARY APPLICATIONS AND OTHER SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ENABLE RAPID AND COST-EFFECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS ALL AROUND THE GLOBE  . EFFECTIVE AS OF THE RESPECTIVE TRANSACTION DATES, OUR RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, BECAME COMPONENTS OF THIS SEGMENT (SEE NOTE 2).  26  ADJUSTED EBITDA  IN ADDITION TO OUR U.S. GAAP RESULTS, WE PRESENT ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP MEASURE OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS DEFINED AS A NUMERICAL MEASURE OF A COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THAT EXCLUDES OR INCLUDES AMOUNTS TO BE DIFFERENT THAN THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS), BALANCE SHEETS OR STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS EARNINGS BEFORE INVESTMENT INCOME, INTEREST EXPENSES, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, ACQUISITION AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES, NON-CASH COSTS AND EXPENSES ARISING FROM PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, LITIGATION PROVISION, GAIN FROM LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND CERTAIN OTHER ADJUSTMENTS. OUR CEO, THE CODM, USES ADJUSTED EBITDA TO EVALUATE AND MONITOR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE BELIEVE THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO OUR ONGOING PERFORMANCE AND HAVE THEREFORE CHOSEN TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TO INVESTORS FOR A MORE CONSISTENT BASIS OF COMPARISON TO HELP INVESTORS EVALUATE OUR RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS AND ENABLE MORE MEANINGFUL PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS. PURSUANT TO THE RULE AND REGULATIONS OF THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION REGARDING THE USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WE HAVE PROVIDED A RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE.  SEE NOTE 17 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND RECONCILIATION TO NET INCOME (LOSS).

THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SALE VOLUME IN THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES INCLUDING MRM TELEMATICS, OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS AND LEGACY LOJACK SVR PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE IN MRM TELEMATICS PRODUCTS SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES VOLUME TO A FEW LARGER CUSTOMERS. THE DECREASE IN OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR LARGEST OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS CUSTOMER WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRODUCT LINE TRANSITION AND ALSO COMMENCING THE ROLLOUT OF THE INITIAL PHASE OF A 3G-TO-4G LTE RETROFIT PROGRAM. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO BE TEMPORARY AND TO BE OFFSET BY DEMANDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AS THE 3G NETWORK SUNSET BECOMES MORE IMMINENT. LEGACY LOJACK US SVR REVENUE CONTINUES TO DECLINE DUE TO A TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION FROM PROPRIETARY RADIO FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY TO GPS-BASED TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO CONTINUE BUT BE OFFSET TO A DEGREE OVER TIME BY REVENUES FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS SUREDRIVE AND LOTSMART WITHIN OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED BY $13.5 MILLION OR 67.5% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE THREE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, COUPLED WITH GROWTH IN LOJACK ITALY.

THE INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR TERMS WAS DUE TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE AND GROSS PROFITS IN THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  27  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN  DECREASED BY  29  0  BASIS  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  GROSS MARGIN FOR TELEMATIC  S  SYSTEMS  DECREASED TO  33.2%  FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  , 2019  FROM 38.3% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2018.  GROSS MARGIN  WAS IMPACTED  PRINCIPALLY BY PRODUCT MIX COUPLED WITH  INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR EXCESS  AND  OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND UNFAVORABLE  MANUFACTURING VARIANCES AS WE PROCEED WITH THE CLOSURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY  IN OXNARD, CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS.  GROSS MARGIN FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  WAS  47.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  NOVEMBER 30  , 2019  COMPARED TO  50.6%  FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AS THE GROSS  PROFIT  WAS  IMPACTED  BY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST OF REVENUES ABOVE EXCLUDES THE RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS, WHICH IS SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATION STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SOLD THROUGH THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES CHANNELS.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSE INCREASED BY $1.9 MILLION OR 15.2% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY $2.6 MILLION OR 21.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-RECURRING LEGAL MATTERS. WE BEGAN PARTIAL OPERATIONS ON OUR NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\u201cERP\u201d) SYSTEM IN JUNE 2019, WHICH ALSO RESULTED IN INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ON OUR NEW ERP SYSTEM WERE CAPITALIZED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WE COMMENCED A PLAN TO CAPTURE CERTAIN SYNERGIES AND COST SAVINGS RELATED TO STREAMLINING OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND SALES ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS RATIONALIZE CERTAIN LEASED PROPERTIES THAT ARE PARTIALLY VACANT. WE INCURRED ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR THIS INITIATIVE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. TOTAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS DECREASED $0.4 MILLION OR 32% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO PERSONNEL CHARGES. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES INCREASED BY $0.4 MILLION OR 14.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO THE ADDITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.  NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  INVESTMENT INCOME DECREASED BY $0.3 MILLION TO $1.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $1.4 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INVESTMENT INCOME ON RABBI TRUST ASSETS THAT SERVE TO INFORMALLY FUND OUR NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN DURING THE PERIOD.  INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED BY $0.1 MILLION TO $5.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $5.1 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER STATED INTEREST EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS THAT RESULTED FROM THE REPURCHASE OF THE 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNT OF DUE TO FACTORS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A $2.5 MILLION GAIN FROM THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH A FORMER SUPPLIER OF LOJACK. THE FINAL PAYMENT ON THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WAS RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  28  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.4 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $94.9 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2019.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.2 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $0.2 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  OVERALL PROFITABILITY MEASURES  NET INCOME (LOSS).  GAAP-BASIS NET LOSS IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $7.4 MILLION AS COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $0.5 MILLION IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018. THE $6.9 MILLION INCREASE IN THE NET LOSS IS DUE TO THE OPERATING LOSS RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND A $2.4 MILLION LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT.

THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED SALE VOLUME IN THREE PRODUCT CATEGORIES INCLUDING MRM TELEMATICS, OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS AND LEGACY LOJACK SVR PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE IN MRM TELEMATICS PRODUCTS SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES VOLUME TO A FEW LARGER CUSTOMERS INCLUDING SYNOVIA SOLUTIONS, WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN IN APRIL 2019, AND IS NOW CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT. THE DECREASE IN OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN SALES TO OUR LARGEST OEM/NETWORK PRODUCTS CUSTOMER WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A PRODUCT LINE TRANSITION AND ALSO COMMENCING THE ROLLOUT OF THE INITIAL PHASE OF A 3G-TO-4G LTE RETROFIT PROGRAM. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO BE TEMPORARY AND TO BE OFFSET BY DEMANDS FROM OUR CUSTOMERS AS THE 3G NETWORK SUNSET BECOMES MORE IMMINENT. LEGACY LOJACK SVR REVENUE CONTINUED ITS SECULAR DECLINE DUE TO A TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION FROM PROPRIETARY RADIO FREQUENCY TECHNOLOGY TO GPS-BASED TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS. WE EXPECT THIS DECLINE TO CONTINUE BUT BE OFFSET TO A DEGREE OVER TIME BY REVENUES FROM OUR RECENT ACQUISITIONS AND FUTURE GROWTH IN OUR TELEMATICS SOLUTIONS, SUCH AS SUREDRIVE AND LOTSMART WITHIN OUR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES SEGMENT.  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED BY $32.7 MILLION OR 57.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE THREE RECENT ACQUISITIONS OF TRACKER UK, LOJACK MEXICO AND SYNOVIA, COUPLED WITH GROWTH IN LOJACK ITALY.  29  GROSS PROFIT BY SEGMENT  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  2019  2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  $% OF REVENUE  $% OF REVENUE  $ CHANGE% CHANGE  SEGMENT  TELEMATICS SYSTEMS  $70,277  37.2%  $86,189  38.8%  $(15,912  )  (18.5%)  SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES  39,688  44.0%  28,104  48.9%  11,584  41.2%  GROSS PROFIT  $109,965  39.4%  $114,293  40.9%  $(4,328  )  (3.8%)  CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT DECREASED BY $4.3 MILLION OR 3.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLAR TERMS WAS DUE TO LOWER REVENUE IN THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED GROWTH IN SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  CONSOLIDATED GROSS MARGIN DECREASED BY 150 BASIS POINTS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 40.9% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FROM THE TELEMATICS SYSTEMS BUSINESS. OUR GROSS MARGIN PERFORMANCE WAS IMPACTED PRINCIPALLY BY PRODUCT MIX COUPLED WITH INCREMENTAL CHARGES FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND UNFAVORABLE MANUFACTURING VARIANCES AS WE PROCEED WITH THE CLOSURE OF OUR MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN OXNARD, CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS. GROSS MARGIN FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES DECREASED TO 44.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM 48.9% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES, AS GROSS PROFIT IS IMPACTED BY PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO DEFERRED REVENUE.  COST OF REVENUES ABOVE EXCLUDES THE RESTRUCTURING RELATED COSTS, WHICH IS SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATION STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO BE SOLD THROUGH THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES CHANNELS.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING AND MARKETING EXPENSE INCREASED BY $7.4 MILLION OR 19.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.

CONSOLIDATED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED BY $7.5 MILLION OR 20.2% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSES RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DUE TO ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND INCREASES IN LEGAL AND PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITIONS AND CERTAIN NON-RECURRING LEGAL MATTERS. WE BEGAN PARTIAL OPERATIONS ON THE NEW ERP SYSTEM IN JUNE 2019, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. CERTAIN IMPLEMENTATION COSTS ON OUR NEW ERP SYSTEM WERE CAPITALIZED AS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 8 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE INCURRED AN ADDITIONAL $3.1 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO THE COST SAVINGS PLAN THAT COMMENCED IN MAY 2018. TOTAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS DECREASED $2.1 MILLION OR 40% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER RESTRUCTURING COSTS RELATED TO VACANT OFFICE AND MANUFACTURING PLANT FACILITIES. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE PARTIALLY VACATED THESE FACILITIES AND RECORDED A COST OF $2.7 MILLION. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE FULLY VACATED CERTAIN OFFICES, WHICH RESULTED IN A COST OF $1.2 MILLION. RESTRUCTURING COSTS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY IN THE OPERATING EXPENSES IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS).  30  AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES  INCREASED  BY  $1.1 MILLION  OR  13.5%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO  THE  ADDITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM RECENT BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS.

THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO DIVIDEND INCOME WE RECEIVED FROM LOJACK MEXICO AND A GAIN AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 FROM THE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENT OF OUR PREVIOUSLY HELD INTEREST IN LOJACK MEXICO.  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $16.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 FROM $11.6 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST AND AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS RELATED TO THE 2025 CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUED IN JULY 2018 AND AMORTIZATION OF DISCOUNT OF DUE TO FACTORS.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A $15.8 MILLION GAIN FROM THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH A FORMER SUPPLIER OF LOJACK. THE FINAL PAYMENT ON THE LEGAL SETTLEMENT WAS RECEIVED IN FEBRUARY 2019.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.4 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $94.9 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2019.  DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $2.0 MILLION ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT ON THE REPURCHASE OF $53.8 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN JULY 2018.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $26 THOUSAND AND INCREASED FROM AN EXPENSE OF $0.7 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO AN FAVORABLE SHIFT IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR SOFTWARE & SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES INCREASED BY $3.7 MILLION OR 37.0% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO RECENTLY ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  SEE NOTE 17 FOR INFORMATION RELATED TO ADJUSTED EBITDA BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND A RECONCILIATION TO GAAP-BASIS NET INCOME (LOSS).  INCOME TAX PROVISION  WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (\u201cETR\u201d) ON A QUARTERLY BASIS BASED ON CURRENT AND FORECASTED OPERATING RESULTS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION OR BENEFIT AND OUR PRETAX BOOK INCOME OR LOSS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD CONSIDERING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE OVERALL LEVEL OF PRETAX BOOK INCOME OR LOSS AND CHANGES IN THE BLEND OF JURISDICTIONAL INCOME OR LOSS THAT IS TAXED AT DIFFERENT RATES. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR ETR MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY PERIOD TO PERIOD AND MAY MAKE QUARTERLY COMPARISONS LESS THAN MEANINGFUL.  31  AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF  $6.2  MILLION WAS RECORDED FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  ,  COMPARED TO AN INCOME TAX PROVISION OF $0.5 MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY  A PRE-TAX LOSS IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND A REVERSAL OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A ONE-TIME DISCRETE TAX CHARGE RELATED TO NET EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION \u201cSHORTFALLS\u201d AND A RESTRUCTURING OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS DURIN  G THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 21.4% AND 5.5% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD APPROXIMATELY $25.8 MILLION IN U.S. NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS. THE NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $7.8 MILLION AND $2.4 MILLION OF FEDERAL AND STATE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND APPROXIMATELY $11.3 MILLION AND $7.4 MILLION FEDERAL AND STATE TAX CREDITS, RESPECTIVELY. THESE DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS CAN BE USED TO REDUCE OUR TAXABLE INCOME AND INCOME TAXES PAYABLE IN FUTURE PERIODS. MANY OF THESE NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND TAX CREDITS WILL EXPIRE IF THEY ARE NOT USED WITHIN CERTAIN PERIODS. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL THREE-YEAR CUMULATIVE INCOME AND CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT OUR NET DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE UTILIZED BEFORE THEIR EXPIRATION. WE CONTINUE TO CLOSELY MONITOR ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT IS REQUIRED ON OUR U.S. NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CONSISTENT WITH FISCAL 2019, OUR PRIMARY RECURRING CASH NEEDS HAVE BEEN FOR WORKING CAPITAL PURPOSES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY FUNDED OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THROUGH CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS. AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR REVENUES, THERE WILL BE A NEED FOR WORKING CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. OUR IMMEDIATE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE $103.6 MILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $50 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE REPURCHASED $95 MILLION OF OUR 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. WE EXPECT TO SETTLE THE $27.6 MILLION REMAINING 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES DUE MAY 2020 WITH CASH. ADDITIONALLY, WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS WITH CASH ON HAND AND CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  ON MARCH 30, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH J.P. MORGAN CHASE BANK, N.A. THAT PROVIDES FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO $50.0 MILLION. THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES ON MARCH 30, 2020 AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN DISCUSSION WITH J.P. MORGAN TO EXTEND THE TERM FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS. AT OUR ELECTION, THE BORROWINGS UNDER THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT EITHER A LIBOR-BASED VARIABLE RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN, OR AT THE GREATER OF THE PRIME RATE, THE NYFRB RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE AND A ONE-MONTH LIBOR-BASED VARIABLE RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN RATE (EACH AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), IN EACH CASE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR SENIOR LEVERAGE RATIO FROM TIME TO TIME. THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS FINANCIAL COVENANTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LEVEL OF EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER NONCASH CHARGES (EBITDA) AND MINIMUM DEBT COVERAGE RATIOS. THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING ON THIS REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN FEBRUARY 2019, WE ACQUIRED TRACKER UK FOR $13.1 MILLION. IN MARCH 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF 87.5% LOJACK MEXICO SHARES FOR $14.3 MILLION. IN APRIL 2019, WE ACQUIRED SYNOVIA FOR $49.8 MILLION. WE FUNDED THESE ACQUISITIONS FROM CASH ON HAND. AS PART OF THE SYNOVIA ACQUISITION, WE ASSUMED THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS FROM THE SYNOVIA REVENUE ASSIGNMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 7. THE REVENUES RECOGNIZED FROM THIS ARRANGEMENT OF $5.0 MILLION WERE CONSIDERED A NON-CASH FINANCING ACTIVITY FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THE OMEGA PATENT INFRINGEMENT CLAIM, INVOLVING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND CONTRACT DISPUTES IN WHICH THE FINAL RESOLUTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN DETERMINED AT THIS TIME. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE MATTERS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ENTER INTO LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR OTHER SETTLEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT REQUIRE US TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WHILE IT IS NOT FEASIBLE TO PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION, WE BELIEVE THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND CASH FLOWS.  SEE NOTE 18, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OF THE NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

OUR CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR NET INCOME (LOSS) AS WELL AS HOW WELL WE MANAGE OUR WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH IS DICTATED BY THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTS WE PURCHASE FROM OUR MANUFACTURERS OR SUPPLIERS AND THEN SELL TO OUR CUSTOMERS ALONG WITH THE PAYMENT AND COLLECTION TERMS THAT WE NEGOTIATE WITH THEM.  WE PURCHASE A MAJORITY OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIERS LOCATED IN ASIA, THAT GENERALLY PROVIDE US 60-DAY PAYMENT TERMS FOR PRODUCTS PURCHASED. WE ARE CURRENTLY RELIANT UPON THESE SUPPLIERS FOR PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN OBTAIN PRODUCTS FROM OTHER SOURCES, THE LOSS OF A SIGNIFICANT SUPPLIER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING PURCHASED MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE ON SIMILAR TERMS FROM ANOTHER SUPPLIER.  OUR SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR KEY CUSTOMERS ARE VERY GOOD AND THAT THESE CUSTOMERS ARE IN GOOD FINANCIAL CONDITION. WE GENERALLY GRANT CREDIT TO OUR CUSTOMERS BASED ON THEIR FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND OUR HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE WITH THEM. WE TYPICALLY REQUIRE PAYMENT FROM THEM WITHIN 30 TO 45 DAYS OF OUR INVOICE DATE WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS THAT EXTEND THE CREDIT TERMS UPTO 90 DAYS.  32  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.3 MILLION AND NET LOSS WAS $23.5 MILLION. OUR NON-CASH EXPENSES, COMPRISED PRINCIPALLY OF DEPRECIATION, INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AMORTIZATION OF DEBT DISCOUNT AND ISSUE COSTS, AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES TOTALED $44.4 MILLION. THESE NON-CASH EXPENSES ARE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NON-CASH REVENUES OF $5.0 MILLION RELATED TO THE SYNOVIA REVENUE ASSIGNMENT ARRANGEMENTS AND $2.4 MILLION LOSSES INCURRED FROM REPURCHASE OF THE 2020 CONVERTIBLE NOTES. CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, NET OF THE EFFECTS OF OUR ACQUISITIONS, RESULTED IN A $15.0 MILLION CASH OUTFLOW, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY, AND DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $48.1 MILLION.

CHANGES IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CREATED A $5.6 MILLION SOURCE OF CASH, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDING AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED REVENUE AND DECREASE IN INVENTORY BUT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSE AND DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THE INCREASES IN OUR WORKING CAPITAL ACCOUNTS WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES VOLUME IN THE MOST RECENT QUARTER.  CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, OUR NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $62.3 MILLION AND $17.1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IS ONE OF THE LEADING U.S. MANUFACTURERS WITH A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO OF RECREATION VEHICLES (\"RV\"S) AND MARINE PRODUCTS USED PRIMARILY IN LEISURE TRAVEL AND OUTDOOR RECREATION ACTIVITIES. WE PRODUCE OUR MOTORHOME UNITS IN IOWA AND INDIANA; OUR TOWABLE UNITS IN INDIANA; AND OUR MARINE UNITS IN FLORIDA. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RV AND MARINE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER. WE ALSO DISTRIBUTE OUR MARINE PRODUCTS INTERNATIONALLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, WHO THEN RETAIL THE PRODUCTS TO THE END CONSUMER.  NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION  THIS MD&A INCLUDES FINANCIAL INFORMATION PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (\"GAAP\"), AS WELL AS CERTAIN ADJUSTED OR NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SUCH AS EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME BEFORE INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN ORDER TO PRESENT COMPARABLE RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  REFER TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2020  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  FOR A DETAILED RECONCILIATION OF ITEMS THAT IMPACTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA. WE HAVE INCLUDED THESE NON-GAAP PERFORMANCE MEASURES AS A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO ILLUSTRATE THE EFFECT OF NON-RECURRING TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING DURING THE REPORTED PERIODS AND TO IMPROVE COMPARABILITY OF OUR RESULTS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE BELIEVE ADJUSTED EBITDA PROVIDES MEANINGFUL SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THESE MEASURES EXCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT WE DO NOT CONSIDER PART OF OUR CORE OPERATING RESULTS WHEN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. EXAMPLES OF ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDE ACQUISITION-RELATED FAIR-VALUE INVENTORY STEP-UP, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, AND NON-OPERATING INCOME.  MANAGEMENT USES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (A) TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND PROSPECTIVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND TRENDS AS WELL AS OUR PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO COMPETITORS AND PEERS; (B) TO MEASURE OPERATIONAL PROFITABILITY ON A CONSISTENT BASIS; (C) IN PRESENTATIONS TO THE MEMBERS OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ENABLE OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO HAVE THE SAME MEASUREMENT BASIS OF OPERATING PERFORMANCE AS IS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN ITS ASSESSMENTS OF PERFORMANCE AND IN FORECASTING AND BUDGETING FOR OUR COMPANY; (D) TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS; AND (E) TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS AND RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES UNDER THE TERMS OF OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE FREQUENTLY USED BY SECURITIES ANALYSTS, INVESTORS, AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES TO EVALUATE COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  NEWMAR CORPORATION  ON NOVEMBER 8, 2019, WE COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF NEWMAR CORPORATION, DUTCH REAL ESTATE CORP, NEW-WAY TRANSPORT, AND NEW-SERV (COLLECTIVELY \"NEWMAR\") FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF  $360.3 MILLION  , WHICH CONSISTED OF  $267.7 MILLION  IN CASH, SUBJECT TO PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS AS STIPULATED IN THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AND  2.0 MILLION  SHARES OF WINNEBAGO COMMON STOCK THAT WERE VALUED AT  $92.6 MILLION  (  $46.29  PER SHARE DISCOUNTED AT  7.0%  DUE TO LACK OF MARKETABILITY BECAUSE OF ONE YEAR LOCK-UP RESTRICTIONS). THE CASH PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE ACQUISITION AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION EXPENSES WERE FUNDED THROUGH THE PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF $300.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 1.5% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE 2025 (\"CONVERTIBLE NOTES\")  (AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9  ,  LONG-TERM DEBT  ) AND CASH ON HAND. NEWMAR IS A LEADING MANUFACTURER OF CLASS A AND SUPER C  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MOTORIZED RECREATION VEHICLES THAT ARE SOLD THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AUTHORIZED DEALERS THROUGHOUT NORTH AMERICA.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  WE HAVE SIX OPERATING SEGMENTS: 1) GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES, 2) WINNEBAGO TOWABLES, 3) WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES, 4) NEWMAR MOTORHOMES, 5) CHRIS-CRAFT MARINE, AND 6) WINNEBAGO SPECIALTY VEHICLES. WE EVALUATE PERFORMANCE BASED ON EACH OPERATING SEGMENT'S ADJUSTED EBITDA, AS DEFINED BELOW, WHICH EXCLUDES CERTAIN CORPORATE ADMINISTRATION EXPENSES AND NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSE.  OUR  TWO  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS INCLUDE: 1) TOWABLE (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS WHICH ARE NOT MOTORIZED AND ARE GENERALLY TOWED BY ANOTHER VEHICLE AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES AND THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES OPERATING SEGMENTS AND 2) MOTORHOME (COMPRISED OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE A MOTORIZED CHASSIS AS WELL AS OTHER RELATED MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES), WHICH IS AN AGGREGATION OF THE WINNEBAGO MOTORHOMES AND NEWMAR MOTORHOMES OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS SHIPMENTS FOR  2019  AND  2018  REFLECT A CONTRACTION IN SHIPMENTS AS DEALERS HAVE RATIONALIZED INVENTORY DURING THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THE ROLLING TWELVE MONTHS RETAIL INFORMATION FOR  2019  AND  2018  ILLUSTRATES THAT RETAIL SALES REMAIN AT HEALTHY LEVELS. WE BELIEVE RETAIL DEMAND IS THE KEY DRIVER TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INDUSTRY.

THE GRAND DESIGN TOWABLES EXPANSION PROJECT CONSISTED OF THREE NEW PRODUCTION FACILITIES--TWO WERE COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2018 AND THE REMAINING IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED MID-FISCAL 2020. THE FACILITY EXPANSION IN THE WINNEBAGO TOWABLES DIVISION WAS COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE STRATEGIC INITIATIVE OF IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (\"ERP\") SYSTEM TO REPLACE OUR LEGACY BUSINESS APPLICATIONS. THE NEW ERP PLATFORM WILL PROVIDE BETTER SUPPORT FOR OUR CHANGING BUSINESS NEEDS AND PLANS FOR FUTURE GROWTH. OUR INITIAL COST ESTIMATES HAVE GROWN FOR ADDITIONAL NEEDS OF THE BUSINESS, SUCH AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE ERP SYSTEM WITH ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS. THE PROJECT INCLUDES SOFTWARE, EXTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION ASSISTANCE, AND INCREASED INTERNAL STAFFING DIRECTLY RELATED TO THIS INITIATIVE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE COST WILL BE EXPENSED IN THE PERIOD INCURRED AND 60% WILL BE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER ITS USEFUL LIFE.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  WE REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS PURSUANT TO PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR LONG-TERM CAPITAL ALLOCATION STRATEGY IS TO FIRST FUND OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, MAINTAIN A DEBT LEVERAGE RATIO WITHIN OUR TARGETED ZONE, MAINTAIN REASONABLE LIQUIDITY, AND THEN RETURN EXCESS CASH OVER TIME TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  ON  OCTOBER 18, 2017  , OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF  $70.0 MILLION  . THERE IS NO TIME RESTRICTION ON THE AUTHORIZATION. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE IF SHARE REPURCHASES REFLECT A PRUDENT USE OF OUR CAPITAL AND, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CREDIT AGREEMENTS, WE MAY PURCHASE SHARES IN THE FUTURE. AT  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAVE  $58.9 MILLION  REMAINING ON OUR BOARD REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM (\u201cWE,\u201d \u201cUS,\u201d \u201cOUR,\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF NEVADA ON MAY 7, 1975, UNDER THE NAME VITA PLUS, INC. THE NAME WAS LATER CHANGED TO VITA PLUS INDUSTRIES, INC. AND IN 2000 THE COMPANY\u2019S NAME WAS CHANGED TO ITS CURRENT NAME PREVENTION INSURANCE.COM.  EFFECTIVE JUNE 28, 2019 (\u201cCLOSING DATE\u201d), A FURTHER CHANGE OF CONTROL OCCURRED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANY. PURSUANT TO A SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BY AND AMONG THE COMPANY, METROWORK EQUITY SDN. BHD (\u201cSELLER\u201d), AND COPPER HILL ASSETS INC., A BRITISH VIRGIN ISLAND CORPORATION (\u201cBUYER\u201d) (THE \u201cPURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d), SELLER ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED AND CONVEYED TO BUYER (I) 1,563,809 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF COMPANY (\u201cCOMMON STOCK\u201d) AND (II) A PROMISSORY NOTE OF THE COMPANY TOTALING $355,323.48 (\u201cPROMISSORY NOTE\u201d). THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION PAID BY BUYER WAS $375,000, AND SELLER ASSUMED ALL OF THE LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY AS OF THE CLOSING DATE.  ON THE CLOSING OF THE ABOVE TRANSACTION, MR. CHEE CHAU NG, THE SOLE OFFICER OF SELLER, RESIGNED IN ALL OFFICER CAPACITIES FROM THE COMPANY AND ANTHONY LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE UPON THE 10TH DAY AFTER THE MAILING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S INFORMATION STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14F-1 (THE \u201cSCHEDULE 14F-1\u201d) TO THE COMPANY\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS (THE \u201cAPPOINTMENT DATE\u201d), MR. NG RESIGNED AS A DIRECTOR OF THE COMPANY. ON THAT SAME DATE, MR. LOCOCO WAS APPOINTED AS THE COMPANY\u2019S CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY.  ON AUGUST 26, 2019, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 33.33% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF AUSTRALIAN GOLD COMMODITIES LTD (\u201cACG\u201d), AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY, FOR $100. THE REMAINING 66.67% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES OF ACG ARE BENEFICIALLY OWNED BY OUR PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER, COPPER HILL ASSETS, INC. MR. ANTHONY LOCOCO, OUR SOLE DIRECTOR, WAS APPOINTED AS A DIRECTOR OF ACG. ACG HAS NOT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AS OF THIS DATE.  12  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ON SEPTEMBER 19, 2019, THE COMPANY FORMED A NEW SUBSIDIARY, PARAMOUNT CAPITAL, INC (\u201cPARAMOUNT\u201d), A WYOMING CORPORATION. PARAMOUNT HAS NOT COMMENCED OPERATIONS AS OF THIS DATE.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LOAN CONVERSION AGREEMENT WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDER, COPPER HILL, UNDER WHICH COPPER HILL CONVERTED ITS OUTSTANDING DEBT OF $372,823 WITH THE COMPANY INTO 5,000,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  THE COMPANY IS A SHELL COMPANY AS DEFINED IN RULE 12B-2 OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d). OUR PRINCIPAL BUSINESS OBJECTIVE FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND BEYOND SUCH TIME WILL BE TO ACHIEVE LONG-TERM GROWTH POTENTIAL THROUGH A COMBINATION WITH A BUSINESS RATHER THAN IMMEDIATE, SHORT-TERM EARNINGS. THE COMPANY WILL NOT RESTRICT OUR POTENTIAL CANDIDATE TARGET COMPANIES TO ANY SPECIFIC BUSINESS, INDUSTRY OR GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION AND, THUS, MAY ACQUIRE ANY TYPE OF BUSINESS.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY BUSINESS ACTIVITIES THAT PROVIDE CASH FLOW. DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS WE ANTICIPATE INCURRING COSTS RELATED TO.  (I)  FILING EXCHANGE ACT REPORTS, AND  (II)  INVESTIGATING, ANALYZING AND CONSUMMATING AN ACQUISITION.  WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THESE COSTS THROUGH DEFERRAL OF FEES BY CERTAIN SERVICE PROVIDERS AND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS, AS NECESSARY, TO BE LOANED TO OR INVESTED IN US BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS, MANAGEMENT OR OTHER INVESTORS. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAS $100 IN CASH. THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SECURE ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS NEEDED. CURRENTLY, OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE FUTURE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY FINANCING TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS AND REPAY OUR LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE. OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO FIND A SUITABLE TARGET COMPANY AND ENTER INTO A POSSIBLE REVERSE MERGER WITH SUCH COMPANY. MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN INCLUDES OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FUNDS BY EQUITY FINANCING THROUGH A REVERSE MERGER TRANSACTION AND/OR RELATED PARTY ADVANCES; HOWEVER THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OF ADDITIONAL FUNDING BEING AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER ACQUIRING A BUSINESS WHICH HAS RECENTLY COMMENCED OPERATIONS, IS A DEVELOPING COMPANY IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS FOR EXPANSION INTO NEW PRODUCTS OR MARKETS, IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE, OR IS AN ESTABLISHED BUSINESS WHICH MAY BE EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL OR OPERATING DIFFICULTIES AND IS IN NEED OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, A BUSINESS COMBINATION MAY INVOLVE THE ACQUISITION OF, OR MERGER WITH, A COMPANY WHICH DOES NOT NEED SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BUT WHICH DESIRES TO ESTABLISH A PUBLIC TRADING MARKET FOR ITS SHARES WHILE AVOIDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE TIME DELAYS, SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE, AND LOSS OF VOTING CONTROL WHICH MAY OCCUR IN A PUBLIC OFFERING.  OUR MANAGEMENT HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY AGREEMENTS WITH ANY PARTY REGARDING A BUSINESS COMBINATION. ANY TARGET BUSINESS THAT IS SELECTED MAY BE A FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE COMPANY OR AN ENTITY IN ITS EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT OR GROWTH, INCLUDING ENTITIES WITHOUT ESTABLISHED RECORDS OF SALES OR EARNINGS. IN THAT EVENT, WE WILL BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS INHERENT IN THE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS OF FINANCIALLY UNSTABLE AND EARLY STAGE OR POTENTIAL EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, WE MAY EFFECT A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH AN ENTITY IN AN INDUSTRY CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF RISK, AND, ALTHOUGH OUR MANAGEMENT WILL ENDEAVOR TO EVALUATE THE RISKS INHERENT IN A PARTICULAR TARGET BUSINESS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL PROPERLY ASCERTAIN OR ASSESS ALL SIGNIFICANT RISKS. OUR MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO EFFECT ONLY ONE BUSINESS COMBINATION, DUE PRIMARILY TO OUR LIMITED FINANCING AND THE DILUTION OF INTEREST FOR PRESENT AND PROSPECTIVE STOCKHOLDERS, WHICH IS LIKELY TO OCCUR AS A RESULT OF OUR MANAGEMENT\u2019S PLAN TO OFFER A CONTROLLING INTEREST TO A TARGET BUSINESS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A TAX-FREE REORGANIZATION. THIS LACK OF DIVERSIFICATION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTANTIAL RISK IN INVESTING IN US, BECAUSE IT WILL NOT PERMIT US TO OFFSET POTENTIAL LOSSES FROM ONE VENTURE AGAINST GAINS FROM ANOTHER.  13  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE WILL NOT ACQUIRE OR MERGE WITH ANY ENTITY WHICH CANNOT PROVIDE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT OR WITHIN A REASONABLE PERIOD OF TIME AFTER CLOSING OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION. WE ARE SUBJECT TO ALL THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS INCLUDED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT. INCLUDED IN THESE REQUIREMENTS IS OUR DUTY TO FILE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS PART OF OUR FORM 8-K TO BE FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UPON CONSUMMATION OF A MERGER OR ACQUISITION, AS WELL AS OUR AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. IF SUCH AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AT CLOSING, OR WITHIN TIME PARAMETERS NECESSARY TO INSURE OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EXCHANGE ACT, OR IF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDED DO NOT CONFORM TO THE REPRESENTATIONS MADE BY THE TARGET BUSINESS, THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS MAY PROVIDE THAT THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION WILL BE VOIDABLE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR PRESENT MANAGEMENT.  A BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH A TARGET BUSINESS WILL NORMALLY INVOLVE THE TRANSFER TO THE TARGET BUSINESS OF THE MAJORITY OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AND THE SUBSTITUTION BY THE TARGET BUSINESS OF ITS OWN MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE SELECTION OF A BUSINESS COMBINATION WILL BE COMPLEX AND EXTREMELY RISKY. BECAUSE OF GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES BEING MADE IN SOME INDUSTRIES AND SHORTAGES OF AVAILABLE CAPITAL, OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS FIRMS SEEKING THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION. SUCH PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF BECOMING A PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATION INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FACILITATING OR IMPROVING THE TERMS ON WHICH ADDITIONAL EQUITY FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, PROVIDING LIQUIDITY FOR THE PRINCIPALS OF AND INVESTORS IN A BUSINESS, CREATING A MEANS FOR PROVIDING INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS OR SIMILAR BENEFITS TO KEY EMPLOYEES, AND OFFERING GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN STRUCTURING ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND THE LIKE THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK. POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS MAY OCCUR IN MANY DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND AT VARIOUS STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF WHICH WILL MAKE THE TASK OF COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION AND ANALYSIS OF SUCH BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES EXTREMELY DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX.  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF CAPITAL, LOCATE AND COMPLETE A MERGER WITH ANOTHER COMPANY AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN LOCATING OR NEGOTIATING WITH ANY TARGET COMPANY.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  NO REVENUE HAS BEEN GENERATED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018. IT IS UNLIKELY THE COMPANY WILL HAVE ANY REVENUES UNLESS IT IS ABLE TO EFFECT AN ACQUISITION OR MERGER WITH AN OPERATING COMPANY, OF WHICH THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE. IT IS MANAGEMENT\u2019 S ASSERTION THAT THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY HINDER THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE COMPANY\u2019S PLAN OF OPERATION FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS SHALL BE TO CONTINUE ITS EFFORTS TO LOCATE SUITABLE ACQUISITION CANDIDATES.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $38,999, COMPRISED OF GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCLUDING CONSULTING FEES TO IMPLEMENT ITS BUSINESS PLAN, ACCOUNTING AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICE FEES INCURRED IN RELATION TO THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PERIODIC REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, FORM 10-Q AND OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

REVENUES  RECORDED IN THE CURRENT  PERIOD FOR LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (\u201cPROJECT(S)\u201d) WERE 10% LESS THAN THE LEVEL  RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. WE HAD 33 PROJECTS IN PROCESS DURING THE CURRENT PERIOD COMPARED WITH 34 DURING THE SAME PERIOD LAST  YEAR. REVENUES RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR OTHER-THAN LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS (NON-PROJECTS) WERE 32% LESS THAN  THE LEVEL RECORDED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TOTAL SALES WITHIN THE U.S. DECREASED 20% FROM THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. TOTAL SALES TO  ASIA DECREASED 39% FROM THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. SALES DECREASES WERE RECORDED OVER THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR TO CUSTOMERS  INVOLVED IN CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS AND BRIDGES (20%), AS WELL AS IN SALES TO CUSTOMERS IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE (25%). THERE WAS  AN INCREASE IN SALES TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS (12%). THE NEGATIVE FLUCTUATION IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE SALES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR ALL  OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND IS DUE TO THE NATURAL DELIVERY CYCLE OF MATURE MILITARY AND AEROSPACE PRODUCTS THAT INHERENTLY  HAVE TEMPORARY GAPS IN THEIR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AS WELL AS ACCOMMODATING CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR EARLIER DELIVERIES PRIOR TO LAST  QUARTER. THIS YTD DECREASE ACCOUNTED FOR HALF OF THE DROP IN DOMESTIC SALES. RECENTLY DEVELOPED OPPORTUNITIES IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE  ASSISTED IN MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE IMPACT. SHIPMENTS ON CURRENT SALES ORDERS FOR CUSTOMERS IN AEROSPACE / DEFENSE RESUMED, AS  SCHEDULED, IN THE SECOND QUARTER. DECREASES IN REVENUE FROM SALES TO CONSTRUCTION CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR THE YTD DROP IN SALES  TO ASIA, ALL OCCURRING IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AS WELL AS HALF OF THE YTD DECREASE IN DOMESTIC SALES, NEARLY ALL OCCURRING IN THE  SECOND QUARTER. ASIAN SALES ARE HINDERED BY TARIFFS AS WELL AS STRONG COMPETITION FROM LOCAL MANUFACTURERS. THE DECREASE IN SALES  TO DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION CUSTOMERS HAS BEEN AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED DELAYS IN THE START OF VARIOUS PROJECTS. COMPETING TECHNOLOGIES  USED IN DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION WITH LOWER INITIAL-COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS  IN NEW BUILDINGS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS CONTINUE TO ENACT PERFORMANCE BASED DESIGN LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE A BUILDING TO BE ABLE TO BE  OCCUPIED FOLLOWING A SIGNIFICANT SEISMIC EVENT. OUR PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THIS LEVEL OF PROTECTION AND DEMAND FOR THEM  WOULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE FOLLOWING SUCH AN UPGRADE IN DOMESTIC BUILDING CODES.  THE GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET REVENUE  OF 32% IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE 27% RECORDED IN THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN GROSS  PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED MARGINS REALIZED ON DOMESTIC CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS.  SALES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S PRODUCTS ARE MADE  TO THREE GENERAL GROUPS OF CUSTOMERS: INDUSTRIAL, CONSTRUCTION AND AEROSPACE / DEFENSE.

STOCK OPTIONS  THE COMPANY HAS A STOCK OPTION PLAN WHICH PROVIDES  FOR THE GRANTING OF NONQUALIFIED OR INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS TO OFFICERS, KEY EMPLOYEES AND NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. OPTIONS GRANTED  UNDER THE PLAN ARE EXERCISABLE OVER A TEN YEAR TERM. OPTIONS NOT EXERCISED AT THE END OF THE TERM EXPIRE.  -  12  -  THE  COMPANY EXPENSES STOCK OPTIONS USING THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF THE FASB ASC. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $55,000 AND  $57,000 OF COMPENSATION COST FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND  2018.  THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH STOCK OPTION GRANT HAS  BEEN DETERMINED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. THE MODEL CONSIDERS ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO EXERCISE PRICE, EXPECTED VOLATILITY,  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED  IN THE MODEL WERE BASED ON VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE FOR THE THIRTY MONTH PERIOD ENDING ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE  RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE IS DERIVED FROM THE U.S. TREASURY YIELD. THE COMPANY USED A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED TERM.  THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS WERE USED IN THE  BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

APPROXIMATELY 82% OF THE CURRENT INVENTORY IS WORK  IN PROCESS, 2% IS FINISHED GOODS, AND 16% IS RAW MATERIALS.  MAINTENANCE AND OTHER INVENTORY REPRESENT STOCK  THAT IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE IN EXCESS OF TWELVE MONTHS. THIS STOCK REPRESENTS CERTAIN ITEMS THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED  TO MAINTAIN FOR SERVICE OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ITEMS THAT ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO SPONTANEOUS ORDERING. THIS INVENTORY IS PARTICULARLY  SENSITIVE TO TECHNOLOGICAL OBSOLESCENCE IN THE NEAR TERM DUE TO ITS USE IN INDUSTRIES CHARACTERIZED BY THE CONTINUOUS INTRODUCTION  OF NEW PRODUCT LINES, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES AND PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE. MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ALLOWANCE  FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE. THE PROVISION FOR POTENTIAL INVENTORY OBSOLESCENCE WAS $90,000 AND $85,000 FOR THE SIX MONTH  PERIODS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REWORK SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY, WHERE APPLICABLE, TO CONVERT IT  TO PRODUCT TO BE USED ON CUSTOMER ORDERS.

AS THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FIGURE RISES IN RELATION TO THE OTHER TWO FIGURES, THE COMPANY CAN ANTICIPATE  INCREASED CASH RECEIPTS WITHIN THE ENSUING 30-60 DAYS.  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $6,348,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2019 INCLUDES $110,000 OF AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (\u201cALLOWANCE\u201d). THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE AS  OF MAY 31, 2019 OF $5,279,000 INCLUDED AN ALLOWANCE OF $110,000.  -  14  -  THE  NUMBER OF AN AVERAGE DAY'S SALES OUTSTANDING IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE (\u201cDSO\u201d) INCREASED FROM 53 DAYS AT MAY 31, 2019  TO 74 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  THE DSO IS A FUNCTION OF 1.) THE LEVEL OF SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY (FOR EXAMPLE, TOTAL SALES  FOR THE PAST THREE MONTHS DIVIDED BY 90 DAYS) AND 2.) THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE LEVEL OF  SALES FOR AN AVERAGE DAY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR IS 15% LESS THAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AT THE END OF THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER IS 20% MORE THAN THE LEVEL AT THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE COMBINED WITH THE DECREASE IN THE LEVEL OF AN AVERAGE DAY\u2019S SALES CAUSED  THE DSO TO INCREASE FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THE INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  FROM LAST YEAR END TO THIS QUARTER-END WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BILLINGS FOR PROJECTS IN NOVEMBER 2019 ($4.4 MILLION) COMPARED  TO MAY 2019 ($2.6 MILLION). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO COLLECT THE NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  AS NOTED ABOVE, CIEB REPRESENTS REVENUES RECOGNIZED  IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS BILLED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATES A PROVISION IN SALES CONTRACTS TO ALLOW THE COMPANY TO BILL,  AND COLLECT FROM THE CUSTOMER, PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF SHIPMENTS. UNFORTUNATELY, SUCH PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN NOT POSSIBLE. THE $3,050,000  BALANCE IN THIS ACCOUNT AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019 IS 60% LESS THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END BALANCE. THIS DECREASE IS THE RESULT OF NORMAL  FLOW OF THE PROJECTS THROUGH PRODUCTION WITH BILLINGS TO THE CUSTOMERS AS PERMITTED IN THE RELATED CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS  TO BILL THE ENTIRE AMOUNT DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. 71% OF THE CIEB BALANCE AS OF THE END OF THE LAST FISCAL QUARTER, AUGUST  31, 2019, WAS BILLED TO THOSE CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. THE REMAINDER WILL BE BILLED AS  THE PROJECTS PROGRESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THE VARIOUS CONTRACTS.  THE BALANCES IN THIS ACCOUNT ARE COMPRISED  OF THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS.

OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AT $1,931,000 AS OF NOVEMBER  30, 2019, IS 38% MORE THAN THE PRIOR YEAR-END. THIS SIGNIFICANT INCREASE REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MATERIAL PURCHASES  IN NOVEMBER 2019 OVER MAY 2019 IN ORDER TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT FOR CUSTOMER ORDERS. COMMISSION EXPENSE ON APPLICABLE SALES ORDERS  IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMMISSION IS PAID FOLLOWING RECEIPT OF PAYMENT FROM THE CUSTOMERS.
