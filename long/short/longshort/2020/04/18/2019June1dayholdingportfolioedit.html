FISCAL YEAR  FISCAL 2019 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 1, 2020. FISCAL 2018 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  STORE OPENINGS, CLOSINGS, AND RELOCATIONS  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE OPENED 17 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SIX RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED TWO STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF MAY 4, 2019 TO 684 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE.  20  ONGOING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2019  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON A NUMBER OF ONGOING INITIATIVES AIMED AT INCREASING OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY BY IMPROVING OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES TRENDS, INCREASING TOTAL SALES GROWTH AND REDUCING EXPENSES. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  DRIVING COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO ENHANCE EXECUTION OF THE OFF-PRICE MODEL.  WE PLAN TO DRIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY FOCUSING ON PRODUCT FRESHNESS TO ENSURE THAT WE CONSISTENTLY DELIVER NEWNESS TO THE SELLING FLOORS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN FASTER INVENTORY TURNOVER. WE MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR PACK-AND-HOLD PROGRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TERRIFIC BUYS OF EITHER HIGHLY DESIRABLE BRANDED PRODUCT OR KEY SEASONAL MERCHANDISE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE THE AMOUNT OF GOODS WE PURCHASE ON PACK-AND-HOLD IS PURELY BASED ON THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MARKETPLACE, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT AVENUE TO SOURCE PRODUCT. WE ALSO INTEND TO USE OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY SELL-THROUGH RATES BY PRODUCT, CAPITALIZE ON STRONG PERFORMING CATEGORIES, IDENTIFY AND BUY INTO NEW FASHION TRENDS AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  SHARPENING FOCUS ON OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER.  WE HAVE FOCUSED ON BETTER SERVING OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER, A BRAND-CONSCIOUS FASHION ENTHUSIAST, AGED 25-49, WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $25,000-$100,000, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, STORE MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING FOCUS ON WOMEN\u2019S READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER AND BECOME A DESTINATION FOR HER ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF HER VISITS AND HER AVERAGE SPEND, FURTHER IMPROVING THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES PERFORMANCE IN WOMEN\u2019S CATEGORIES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE STORE EXPERIENCE AND EASE OF SHOPPING AT ALL OF OUR STORES BY IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON OFFERING MORE BRANDS AND STYLES AND SIMPLIFYING STORE NAVIGATION. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY UTILIZING CLEAR WAY-FINDING SIGNS AND DISTINCT PRODUCT SIGNAGE, HIGHLIGHTING KEY BRANDS AND NEW ARRIVALS, IMPROVING ORGANIZATION OF THE FLOOR SPACE, REDUCING RACK DENSITY, FACILITATING QUICKER CHECKOUTS AND DELIVERING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT SIZE VISIBILITY, QUEUING AND FITTING ROOMS. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT EXECUTION OF OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PRIORITIES, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR STORE ASSOCIATE TRAINING AND REORGANIZED AND STRENGTHENED OUR FIELD MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. OUR MUCH IMPROVED STORE EXPERIENCE CONTINUES TO RESONATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMER SURVEY TO PROVIDE MORE ACTIONABLE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK TO STORES. STORES DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS. STORE MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS, AND REACT ACCORDINGLY.  \u2022  INCREASING OUR SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING TO OUR CUSTOMERS ONLINE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THIS HERITAGE AND CONTINUE TO UTILIZE E-COMMERCE STRATEGIES OFFERING MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE DRIVING INCREMENTAL TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES.  \u2022  ENHANCING EXISTING CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW CATEGORIES.  WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CERTAIN EXISTING CATEGORIES SUCH AS LADIES\u2019 APPAREL, CHILDREN\u2019S PRODUCTS, BATH AND COSMETIC MERCHANDISE, HOUSEWARES, DE\u0301COR FOR THE HOME AND BEAUTY AS WE CONTINUE TO DE-WEATHER OUR BUSINESS, AND MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW CATEGORIES.  \u2022  PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD.  WE HAVE PILOTED A NEW PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT TO 140 STORES, WITH PLANS TO BRING THE PROGRAM TO ALL STORES. WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN CUSTOMER LOYALTY, INFORM CUSTOMER CONTACT STRATEGIES, AND DRIVE INCREASES IN TRIP FREQUENCY AND TRANSACTION SIZE.  21  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR RETAIL STORE BASE.  WE INTEND TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR RETAIL STORE BASE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  ADHERING TO A MARKET FOCUSED AND FINANCIALLY DISCIPLINED REAL ESTATE STRATEGY.  WE HAVE GROWN OUR STORE BASE CONSISTENTLY SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1972, DEVELOPING MORE THAN 99% OF OUR STORES ORGANICALLY. WE BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO REACH 1,000 STORES OVER THE LONG-TERM. OUR GOAL IS TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  \u2022  MAINTAINING FOCUS ON UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED A MARKET FOCUSED APPROACH TO NEW STORE OPENINGS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING SALES WHILE ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS. BY FOCUSING ON OPENING STORES WITH ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS, WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS ON CAPITAL AND CONTINUE TO GROW OUR MARGINS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR STORES WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT.  \u2022  ENHANCING THE STORE EXPERIENCE THROUGH STORE REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STORE REMODELS ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGE, SALES AND PROFITABILITY OF A STORE, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. IN OUR REMODELED STORES, WE HAVE TYPICALLY INCORPORATED NEW FLOORING, PAINTING, LIGHTING AND GRAPHICS, RELOCATED OUR FITTING ROOMS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE, ADDED NEW DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND ACCESSORIES AND MADE VARIOUS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AS APPROPRIATE BY LOCATION.  \u2022  ENHANCING OPERATING MARGINS.  WE INTEND TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKDOWN SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE SALES AND GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS BASED ON FORWARD-LOOKING SALES FORECASTS, SELL-THROUGH TARGETS, AND EXIT DATES. THIS ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS AT THE STYLE AND COLOR LEVEL BY STORE CLUSTER.  \u2022  ENHANCE PURCHASING POWER.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INCREASING SIZE AND WEST COAST BUYING OFFICE PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL BUYING OPPORTUNITIES AND REALIZE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN OUR MERCHANDISING AND NON-MERCHANDISING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  DRIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR GROWING SALES OVER THE FIXED COSTS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CORPORATE AND IN-STORE OPERATIONS.  UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES  AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY THROUGH ACHIEVING POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND LEVERAGING PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, MORE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS FROM THE VENDORS TO THE SELLING FLOORS, AND MODIFYING OUR MARKETING PLANS TO INCREASE OUR CORE CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR SHARE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPENDING, THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS AN OFF-PRICE RETAILER OF APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HOME FURNISHINGS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES OR INCOME.  SEASONALITY OF SALES AND WEATHER CONDITIONS  . OUR SALES, LIKE MOST OTHER RETAILERS, ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES AND NET INCOME DERIVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SEASONS.  WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SALE OF OUR CLOTHING. GENERALLY, OUR SALES ARE HIGHER IF THE WEATHER IS COLD DURING THE FALL AND WARM DURING THE EARLY SPRING. SALES OF COLD WEATHER CLOTHING ARE INCREASED BY EARLY COLD WEATHER DURING THE FALL, WHILE SALES OF WARM WEATHER CLOTHING ARE IMPROVED BY EARLY WARM WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE BELIEVE TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES IS STILL DRIVEN, IN PART, BY WEATHER PATTERNS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, INCLUDING SPENDING FOR THE MERCHANDISE THAT WE SELL, ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVAILING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INFLATION, LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, SALARIES AND WAGE RATES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, HOUSING COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, COMMODITIES PRICING, INCOME TAX RATES AND POLICIES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER PURCHASING PATTERNS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CONSUMERS\u2019 DISPOSABLE INCOME, CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND DEBT LEVELS.  22  A SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OR A CREDIT CRISIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS RESULTING IN LOWER NET SALES AND PROFITS THAN EXPECTED ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AL  SO AFFECTED BY THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SITUATION. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TAXES AND HEALTHCARE. ONGOING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND T  ARIFF NEGOTIATIONS COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME AND AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRICES. THE OUTBREAK OR ESCALATION OF WAR, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF TERRORIST ACTS OR OTHER HOSTILITIES IN OR AFFECTING THE U.S., COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SPENDIN  G BY CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, NATURAL DISASTERS, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND ACTS OF WAR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISRUPTING SUPPLIES AND RAISING PRICES GLOBALLY WHICH, IN TURN, MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE WORLD AND U.S. ECONO  MIES AND LEAD TO A DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING.  WE CLOSELY MONITOR OUR NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN AND EXPENSES. WE HAVE PERFORMED SCENARIO PLANNING SUCH THAT IF OUR NET SALES DECLINE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE COSTS THAT COULD BE REDUCED TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DECLINES. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE ECONOMIC TRENDS AND/OR IF OUR EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE, THERE COULD BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND POSITION IN FUTURE FISCAL PERIODS.  COMPETITION AND MARGIN PRESSURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT A DISCOUNT TO PRICES OFFERED BY OTHER RETAILERS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT IS APPEALING TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE U.S. RETAIL APPAREL AND HOME FURNISHINGS MARKETS ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE FOR BUSINESS WITH DEPARTMENT STORES, OFF-PRICE RETAILERS, INTERNET RETAILERS, SPECIALTY STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, WHOLESALE CLUBS, AND OUTLET STORES AS WELL AS WITH C  ERTAIN TRADITIONAL, FULL-PRICE RETAIL CHAINS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OFF-PRICE CONCEPTS  . AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL FULL-PRICE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS AND SPECIALTY SHOPS OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWNS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN PRICES APPROXIMATING THOSE OFFERED BY US AT OUR BURLINGTON STORES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT COMPETITION WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR STORES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.  THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO FACE INCREASED PRESSURE ON MARGINS AS OVERALL CHALLENGING RETAIL CONDITIONS HAVE LED CONSUMERS TO BE MORE VALUE CONSCIOUS. OUR \u201cOPEN TO BUY\u201d PARADIGM, UNDER WHICH WE PURCHASE BOTH PRE-SEASON AND IN-SEASON MERCHANDISE, ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURCHASE LESS PRE-SEASON WITH THE BALANCE PURCHASED IN-SEASON AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY. IT ALSO PROVIDES US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT PURCHASES BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND CATEGORIES. THIS ENABLES US TO OBTAIN BETTER TERMS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO HELP OFFSET ANY RISING COSTS OF GOODS.  KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  WE CONSIDER NUMEROUS FACTORS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE NET INCOME, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBIT, COMPARABLE STORE SALES, GROSS MARGIN, INVENTORY, STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND LIQUIDITY.  NET INCOME  . WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $77.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $82.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT  : ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (II) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; AND (V) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TAX EFFECTED TO ARRIVE AT ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; (VI) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBIT AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VI) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR,  23  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MAY VARY SUBSTANTIAL  LY IN FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE FROM OPERATING INCOME ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ASSIST IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND LEVERAGE SALES, AND TO MORE READILY COMPARE THESE METRICS BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE PERIODS.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OTHER DATA PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. AMONG OTHER LIMITATIONS, ADJUSTED NET INCOME DOES NOT REFLECT THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, NET OF THEIR TAX EFFECT.  \u2022  FAVORABLE LEASE COSTS;  \u2022  COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS;  \u2022  LOSSES ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT;  \u2022  IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS; AND  \u2022  OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, ADJUSTED NET INCOME DECLINED $1.5 MILLION TO $85.5 MILLION. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.

THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF A STORE DURING THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD AGAINST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SAME STORE IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING COMPARABLE STORE SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS MERCHANDISE SALES OF THOSE STORES, INCLUDING OUR ONLINE STORE, COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH ONE YEAR AFTER THE END OF THEIR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES, WHICH NORMALLY CONCLUDE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. IF A STORE IS CLOSED FOR SEVEN OR MORE DAYS DURING A MONTH, OUR POLICY IS TO REMOVE THAT STORE FROM OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORES SALES FOR ANY SUCH MONTH, AS WELL AS DURING THE MONTH(S) OF THEIR GRAND RE-OPENING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WAS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  0.1%  MAY 5, 2018  4.8%  VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WEATHER CONDITIONS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES OF NEW MERCHANDISE AND PROMOTIONAL EVENTS, THE GENERAL RETAIL SALES ENVIRONMENT, CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BUYING TRENDS, CHANGES IN SALES MIX AMONG DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, COMPETITION, AND THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING PROGRAMS.  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET SALES AND THE COST OF SALES. OUR COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER ENTITIES, SINCE SOME ENTITIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, CERTAIN STORE-RELATED COSTS AND OTHER COSTS, IN COST OF SALES. WE INCLUDE CERTAIN OF THESE COSTS IN THE LINE ITEMS \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d AND \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE INCLUDE IN OUR \u201cCOST OF SALES\u201d LINE ITEM ALL COSTS OF MERCHANDISE (NET OF PURCHASE DISCOUNTS AND CERTAIN VENDOR ALLOWANCES), INBOUND FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTBOUND FREIGHT AND CERTAIN MERCHANDISE ACQUISITION COSTS, PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND IMPORT FEES. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS TO 41.0% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY AT MAY 4, 2019 INCREASED TO $895.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $786.6 MILLION AT MAY 5, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH WERE 28% OF TOTAL INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO 27% AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCREASE RELATED TO OUR 37 NET NEW STORES OPENED FROM MAY 5, 2018 THROUGH MAY 4, 2019. COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 5%.  26  INVENTORY AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  WAS $954.2  MILLION. THE  DECREASE  IN INVENTORY FROM  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  REFLECTS THE SEASONALITY OF OUR BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INVENTORY REQUIRED FOR OUR  NINE  NET NE  W STORES OPENED DURING  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019.  IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAXIMIZE SALES, WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MERCHANDISING MIX AND INVENTORY LEVELS WITHIN OUR STORES. BY APPROPRIATELY MANAGING OUR INVENTORIES, WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DELIVER A CONTINUAL FLOW OF FRESH MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD MORE PRODUCTIVE INVENTORIES BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT INVENTORY AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER ARE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT INDICATE HOW EFFICIENTLY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. THEY EACH MEASURE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE OWN OUR INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COST OF GOODS SOLD BY THE 13 MONTH AVERAGE COST VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  8% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY THE AVERAGE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. THE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SALES PRICE OF ITEMS ON HAND REDUCED BY RETAIL REDUCTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE SALES, MARKDOWNS, AN ESTIMATED SHORTAGE ADJUSTMENT AND EMPLOYEE DISCOUNTS) FOR OUR COMPARABLE STORES. THE CALCULATION IS BASED ON A ROLLING 13 MONTH AVERAGE OF INVENTORY (AT ESTIMATED RETAIL VALUE) AND THE LAST 12 MONTHS\u2019 COMPARABLE SALES. OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  4% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE LATTER NOT INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND WAREHOUSE INVENTORY OR INVENTORY AT NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES. INVENTORY HELD AT OUR WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS INCLUDES MERCHANDISE BEING READIED FOR SHIPMENT TO OUR STORES AND PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY ACQUIRED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR FUTURE STORE RELEASE. THE MAGNITUDE OF PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY, AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME, IS DEPENDENT ON THE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MARKETPLACE.  WE PRESENT INVENTORY TURNOVER, BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE AT MANAGING OUR INVENTORY. WE PRESENT COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER AS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL METRIC IN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MERCHANDISING EFFORTS, AS A FASTER COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER GENERALLY LEADS TO REDUCED MARKDOWNS AND MORE FRESH MERCHANDISE IN OUR STORES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR PAYROLL IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING STORE PAYROLL VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS. WE DEFINE STORE PAYROLL AS REGULAR AND OVERTIME PAYROLL FOR ALL STORE PERSONNEL AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND TERRITORY PERSONNEL, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYROLL CHARGES RELATED TO CORPORATE AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES. STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 8.7% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED WITH 8.5% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  LIQUIDITY.  LIQUIDITY MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH. MANAGEMENT MEASURES LIQUIDITY THROUGH CASH FLOW, WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF CASH GENERATED FROM OR USED IN OPERATING, FINANCING, AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED $7.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $56.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.

COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS TO 59.0% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN. PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. ON A DOLLAR BASIS, COST OF SALES INCREASED $68.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 100 BASIS POINTS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019. THE FOLLOWING TABLE DETAILS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.

ADDITIONALLY, PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS, STORE PAYROLL INCREASED 20 BASIS POINTS, AND STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 25 BASIS POINTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 20 BASIS POINTS OF LEVERAGE IN OUR NATIONAL TELE  VISION ADVERTISING AND DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS.  COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE RECORDED TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS OF $2.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY.  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE REVERSED $0.4 MILLION OF THIS ESTIMATED EXPENSE BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $50.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $50.5 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-02.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IMPROVED $1.2 MILLION TO $13.4 MILLION. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE $150 MILLION PAYDOWN AND REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  OUR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE BALANCES RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH PRIOR YEAR, ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4,  MAY 5,  2019  2018  AVERAGE INTEREST RATE \u2013 ABL LINE OF CREDIT  3.8%  3.3%  AVERAGE INTEREST RATE \u2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY  4.5%  4.2%  AVERAGE BALANCE \u2013 ABL LINE OF CREDIT (IN MILLIONS)  $147.4  $28.7  AVERAGE BALANCE \u2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY (IN MILLIONS) (A)  $961.4  $1,113.1  (A)  EXCLUDES ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $16.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $17.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WAS 17.2% COMPARED WITH 17.4% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  AT THE END OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THEN APPLY THAT RATE IN PROVIDING FOR INCOME TAXES ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE (INTERIM PERIOD) BASIS. USE OF THIS METHODOLOGY DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  25% (BEFORE DISCRETE ITEMS) AS OUR BEST ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $77.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $82.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WHICH, IN TURN, IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO SERVICE INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR  29  OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND IF WE CANNOT BORROW OR O  BTAIN EQUITY FINANCING TO SATISFY THOSE OBLIGATIONS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT ANY REPLACEMENT BORROWING OR EQUITY FINANCING COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON TERMS SIMILAR TO O  UR CURRENT FINANCING AGREEMENTS, OR AT ALL.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH OUR EXISTING CASH AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS WELL AS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFSET DECLINES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WITH SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN THE EVENT THAT THE ECONOMY DECLINES.  CASH FLOW FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018  WE USED $7.2 MILLION OF CASH FLOW DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $56.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $54.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $60.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OUR DECREASED OPERATING RESULTS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $83.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $57.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OUR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS, AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES).  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $22.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $58.5 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NET BORROWINGS ON OUR DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF SHARE REPURCHASES.  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ALSO IMPACT OUR CASH FLOWS. WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS (EXCLUSIVE OF RESTRICTED CASH) MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT MAY 4, 2019 OF $114.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH A $12.6 MILLION DEFICIT AT MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDING A PORTION OF THE NEW LEASE LIABILITY TO CURRENT LIABILITIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 OF $2.3 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, CASH SPEND FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF $12.2 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, AMOUNTED TO $71.6 MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY  $310  MILLION, NET OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION, NET OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, FOR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES). IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $60  MILLION TO SUPPORT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES, WITH THE REMAINING CAPITAL USED TO SUPPORT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER BUSINESS INITIATIVES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $300 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2020. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 841,460 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $122.8 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONS, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $175.6 MILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CORPORATE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS. OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED, MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE ANY AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  30  DIVIDENDS  WE CURRENTLY DO, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO, RETAIN ALL AVAILABLE FUNDS AND ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO FUND ALL OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS INITIATIVES, AND TO SUPPORT ANY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNISTIC CAPITAL STRUCTURE INITIATIVES. THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE NEAR TERM. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LIMITED BY RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF CURRENT AND ANY FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS. ANY FUTURE DETERMINATION TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND WILL DEPEND UPON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT.  IN ADDITION, SINCE WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER PAYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS TO US IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS.  OPERATIONAL GROWTH  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE OPENED 17 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SIX RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED TWO STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF MAY 4, 2019 TO 684 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH PLANS AND INVEST IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE PLAN TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES,  WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 75 GROSS NEW STORES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 25 STORE RELOCATIONS AND CLOSINGS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES BOTH WITHIN OUR CURRENT MARKET AREAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO FIND SATISFACTORY LOCATIONS FOR OUR STORES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OPENING OF STORES GENERALLY IS CONTINGENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS WITH SUITABLE STRUCTURES AND THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR NEW STORES OR THAT EVEN IF SUCH LOCATIONS ARE FOUND AND ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS ARE OBTAINED, WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES PRESENTLY PLANNED. ASSUMING THAT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR CURRENT STORES.  DEBT AND HEDGING  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, OUR OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE $956.9 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY. OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ALSO INCLUDE $32.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  TERM LOAN FACILITY  AT MAY 4, 2019, OUR BORROWING RATE RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS  4.5%.  ABL LINE OF CREDIT  AT MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $393.9 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL LINE OF CREDIT. THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $255.0  MILLION. AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $147.4  MILLION AT AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.8%.  HEDGING  WE ARE HEDGED ON $800 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY THROUGH MAY 2019. ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, WHICH WAS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THIS NEW INTEREST RATE SWAP, WHICH HEDGES $450 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY, BECOMES EFFECTIVE MAY 31, 2019 AND MATURES DECEMBER 29, 2023.  CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE COMPANY HAD $1,118.1 MILLION OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATED TO GOODS THAT WERE NOT RECEIVED AS OF MAY 4, 2019. THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT CONTRACTS FROM THOSE INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  31  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE AS THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT (I) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; (II) THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; AND (III) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORIES, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INSURANCE RESERVES AND INCOME TAXES. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE MEETS TWO CRITERIA: (1) IT REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS AND (2) THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM EITHER USING A DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH REASONABLE, AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OR FROM REASONABLY LIKELY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLEASES.\u201d THE STANDARD\u2019S CORE PRINCIPLE IS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS ASU AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019.  WE APPLIED THE CHANGES FROM THE NEW GUIDANCE AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION, AS ALLOWED UNDER ASU 2018-11, \u201cLEASES: TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d WE DID NOT ADJUST PRIOR PERIODS. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION NOT TO CAPITALIZE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS. WE ELECTED THE TRANSITION PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO CARRY FORWARD FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES: I) THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION AS EITHER OPERATING OR CAPITAL; II) ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES; AND III) CAPITALIZATION OF INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, TO NOT ASSESS WHETHER EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENTS CONTAIN A LEASE, AND TO EMPLOY HINDSIGHT WHEN DETERMINING LEASE TERMS FOR EXISTING LEASES ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CERTAIN EXPENSE RECOGNITION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST, AS WELL AS A RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d TO \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  OTHER THAN THE LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT US, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND OTHER MATTERS, AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT\u2019S BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN WE USE WORDS SUCH AS \u201cPROJECTS,\u201d \u201cEXPECTS,\u201d \u201cANTICIPATES,\u201d \u201cINTENDS,\u201d \u201cPLANS,\u201d \u201cBELIEVES,\u201d \u201cSEEKS,\u201d \u201cESTIMATES,\u201d \u201cSHOULD,\u201d \u201cWOULD,\u201d \u201cCOULD,\u201d \u201cWILL,\u201d \u201cOPPORTUNITY,\u201d \u201cPOTENTIAL\u201d OR \u201cMAY,\u201d VARIATIONS OF SUCH WORDS OR OTHER WORDS THAT CONVEY UNCERTAINTY OF FUTURE EVENTS OR OUTCOMES, WE ARE MAKING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (SECURITIES ACT) AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 (EXCHANGE ACT). OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. SUCH STATEMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, PROPOSED STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS, PROPOSED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PROJECTED FINANCING REQUIREMENTS, PROPOSED DEVELOPMENTAL PROJECTS, PROJECTED SALES AND EARNINGS, OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN SELLING MARGINS, AND THE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS. ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS. WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BY US INCLUDE: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ONE OR MORE OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND GROWTH PLANS; THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE STORE LOCATIONS ON SUITABLE TERMS; CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND; INDUSTRY TRENDS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUYING, INVENTORY AND OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES BY CUSTOMERS; COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES OF MAJOR COMPETITORS AND AN INCREASE IN COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE; THE AVAILABILITY, SELECTION AND PURCHASING OF ATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISE ON FAVORABLE TERMS; IMPORT RISKS, INCLUDING TAX AND TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR TEMPERATURES; OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY; OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS  32  AND EXPENSES; UNFORESEEN CYBER-RELATED PROBLEMS OR ATTACKS; ANY UNFO  RESEEN MATERIAL LOSS OR CASUALTY; THE EFFECT OF INFLATION; REGULATORY AND TAX CHANGES; OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES; THE IMPACT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH LAWS; TERRORIST ATTACKS, PARTICULARLY ATTACKS ON OR WITHIN MARKETS  IN WHICH WE OPERATE; NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INCLUDING FIRE, SNOW AND ICE STORMS, FLOOD, HAIL, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES; OUR SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS AND RELATED DEBT-SERVICE OBLIGATIONS; RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AG  REEMENTS; AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCING; OUR DEPENDENCE ON VENDORS FOR OUR MERCHANDISE; DOMESTIC EVENTS AFFECTING THE DELIVERY OF MERCHANDISE TO OUR STORES; EXISTENCE OF ADVERSE LITIGATION; AND OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WI  TH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).  MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT OR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, OUR PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSEQUENT WRITTEN OR ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED BY US OR PERSONS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

NET UNALLOCATED EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED DUE TO A ONE-TIME GAIN RESULTING FROM THE CYTOSPORT DIVESTITURE, THE BENEFIT FROM A LEGAL SETTLEMENT AND LOWER SELLING EXPENSES.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE INFORMATION REGARDING RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AS DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE  $639.3 MILLION  AT THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO $261.6 MILLION  AT THE END OF THE COMPARABLE FISCAL 2018 PERIOD.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $365.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  $443.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DECREASE IS DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY FROM INVENTORY IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $424.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $986.5 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $473.9 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF CYTOSPORT.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SPENT $857.6 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF COLUMBUS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 DECREASED TO  $87.6 MILLION  FROM  $141.2 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS FISCAL 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $310.0 MILLION.  KEY PROJECTS FOR THE FULL YEAR INCLUDE CAPACITY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S NEVADA, IOWA, PIZZA TOPPINGS FACILITY, AN EXPANSION AT THE FONTANINI FACILITY IN MCCOOK, ILL, AND MULTIPLE OTHER PROJECTS DESIGNED TO INCREASE VALUE-ADDED CAPACITY.  CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $610.5 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF  $355.9 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $374.8 MILLION OF DEBT RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF COLUMBUS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE HIGHER CASH PROVIDED IN FISCAL 2018 IS RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF COLUMBUS AS THE COMPANY BORROWED  $375.0 MILLION  UNDER A TERM LOAN FACILITY AND  $375.0 MILLION  UNDER A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE PURCHASE, WITH $190.0 MILLION PAID DOWN DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS.  THE COMPANY REPURCHASED  $67.6 MILLION  OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  $44.7 MILLION  REPURCHASED  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SHARE REPURCHASE PLANS OR PROGRAMS, SEE PART II, ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.  CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SHAREHOLDERS CONTINUE TO BE AN ONGOING FINANCING ACTIVITY FOR THE COMPANY.  DIVIDENDS PAID IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 WERE $212.3 MILLION  COMPARED TO $189.1 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  FOR FISCAL 2019, THE ANNUAL DIVIDEND RATE WAS INCREASED TO  $0.84  PER SHARE, REPRESENTING THE 53RD CONSECUTIVE ANNUAL DIVIDEND INCREASE.  THE COMPANY HAS PAID DIVIDENDS FOR 363 CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE DOING SO.  THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED BY CERTAIN COVENANTS IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF FINANCIAL RATIOS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  AT THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THESE DEBT COVENANTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO CASH FLOWS FROM THIS SOURCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A RELATIVELY STABLE INDUSTRY AND HAS STRONG BRANDS ACROSS MANY PRODUCT LINES.  THE COMPANY IS DEDICATED TO RETURNING EXCESS CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  GROWING THE BUSINESS THROUGH INNOVATION AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS REMAINS A FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY.  REINVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS TO ENSURE EMPLOYEE AND FOOD SAFETY ARE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMPANY.  CAPITAL SPENDING TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND CURRENT OPERATIONS WILL ALSO BE A SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTFLOW FOR FISCAL 2019.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  THE COMPANY RECORDS INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  .  THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO DETERMINE ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS BY YEAR RELATED TO THIS PRONOUNCEMENT, AS THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF SETTLEMENT OF ITS RESERVES FOR INCOME TAXES CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED.  THE TOTAL LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AT  APRIL 28, 2019  , WAS  $27.7 MILLION.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY\u2019S FUTURE CONTRACTUAL FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 28, 2018.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  APRIL 28, 2019  , AND  OCTOBER 28, 2018  , THE COMPANY HAD  $45.6 MILLION  AND  $45.5 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, OF STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ISSUED ON ITS BEHALF.  THE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S SELF-INSURED WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  HOWEVER, THAT AMOUNT INCLUDES  $2.4 MILLION  AS OF  APRIL 28, 2019  , AND  $2.4 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 28, 2018  , OF REVOCABLE STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT FOR OBLIGATIONS OF AN AFFILIATED PARTY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , AND FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  , INCLUDED ELSEWHERE HEREIN.  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING RISK FACTORS WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BEFORE INVESTING IN OUR COMMON STOCK, REFER TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018.  OUR BUSINESS  WE MANUFACTURE COMPONENTS FOR ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) IN THE BUILDING PRODUCTS INDUSTRY.  THESE COMPONENTS CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS WINDOW AND DOOR (FENESTRATION) COMPONENTS AND KITCHEN AND BATH CABINET COMPONENTS.  EXAMPLES OF FENESTRATION COMPONENTS INCLUDE (1) ENERGY-EFFICIENT FLEXIBLE INSULATING GLASS SPACERS, (2) EXTRUDED VINYL PROFILES, (3) WINDOW AND DOOR SCREENS, AND (4) PRECISION-FORMED METAL AND WOOD PRODUCTS.  WE ALSO MANUFACTURE CABINET DOORS AND OTHER COMPONENTS FOR OEMS IN THE KITCHEN AND BATHROOM CABINET INDUSTRY.  IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CERTAIN OTHER NON-FENESTRATION COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE SOLAR PANEL SEALANTS, TRIM MOLDINGS, VINYL DECKING, FENCING, WATER RETENTION BARRIERS, AND CONSERVATORY ROOF COMPONENTS. WE USE LOW-COST, SHORT LEAD-TIME PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND ENGINEERING EXPERTISE TO PROVIDE OUR CUSTOMERS WITH SPECIALIZED PRODUCTS FOR THEIR SPECIFIC WINDOW, DOOR, AND CABINET APPLICATIONS. WE BELIEVE THESE CAPABILITIES PROVIDE US WITH UNIQUE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES. WE SERVE A PRIMARY CUSTOMER BASE IN NORTH AMERICA AND THE U.K., AND ALSO SERVE CUSTOMERS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THROUGH OUR OPERATING PLANTS IN THE U.K. AND GERMANY, AS WELL AS THROUGH SALES AND MARKETING EFFORTS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE THREE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (1) NORTH AMERICAN FENESTRATION SEGMENT (NA FENESTRATION), COMPRISING FOUR OPERATING SEGMENTS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE FENESTRATION MARKET IN NORTH AMERICA MANUFACTURING VINYL PROFILES, INSULATING GLASS SPACERS, SCREENS & OTHER FENESTRATION COMPONENTS; (2) EUROPEAN FENESTRATION SEGMENT (EU FENESTRATION), COMPRISING OUR U.K.-BASED VINYL EXTRUSION BUSINESS, MANUFACTURING VINYL PROFILES AND CONSERVATORIES, AND THE EUROPEAN INSULATING GLASS BUSINESS MANUFACTURING INSULATING GLASS SPACERS; AND (3) NORTH AMERICAN CABINET COMPONENTS SEGMENT (NA CABINET COMPONENTS), COMPRISING OUR CABINET DOOR AND COMPONENTS OPERATIONS.  WE MAINTAIN A GROUPING CALLED UNALLOCATED CORPORATE & OTHER, WHICH INCLUDES TRANSACTION EXPENSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS BASED ON PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER FACTORS, CERTAIN SEVERANCE AND LEGAL COSTS NOT ALLOCABLE TO OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, DEPRECIATION OF CORPORATE ASSETS, INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER, NET, INCOME TAXES AND INTER-SEGMENT ELIMINATIONS, AND BEGINNING IN 2018, EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL EXPENSE FLUCTUATIONS RELATIVE TO PLANNED COSTS AS DETERMINED DURING THE ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS. OTHER CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BASED UPON A RELATIVE MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY IN ORDER TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT EACH REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE USED TO PREPARE OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AN EFFORT TO FOCUS ON PROTECTING MARGINS AND IMPROVING CASH FLOWS, WE IMPLEMENTED A STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR SALES VOLUME WITH CERTAIN LOW-MARGIN CUSTOMERS.  DURING 2017, WE RATIONALIZED CAPACITY AND CLOSED TWO U.S. VINYL PLANTS AND TWO CABINET DOOR PLANTS, RELOCATING ASSETS TO IMPROVE OVERALL OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.  PURSUANT TO THESE RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS, WE EXPENSED $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND $0.2 MILLION AND $0.6 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ORGANIC GROWTH INITIATIVES, ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PROVIDE NEW COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION WITHIN THE MARKETS WE SERVE, AND EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS OR SERVICE LINES.  WE HAVE DISPOSED OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES IN THE PAST, AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN MARKETS WHERE WE BELIEVE THERE IS POTENTIAL FUTURE GROWTH.  RECENT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW A SWEEPING TAX REFORM BILL WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WHICH IMPACT U.S. CORPORATIONS:  (1) REDUCTION OF THE STATUTORY FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%; (2) SHIFTING TO A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM IN WHICH FOREIGN EARNINGS COULD BE REPATRIATED THROUGH A 100% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION; (3) IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TAX ON UN-REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF 15.5% ON CASH AND 8% ON OTHER ASSETS; (4) DOUBLING BONUS DEPRECIATION TO 100% FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALLOWING USED PROPERTY TO QUALIFY; (5) LIMITING NET INTEREST EXPENSE DEDUCTIONS TO 30% OF ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME; (6) LIMITING NOL DEDUCTIONS TO 80% OF TAXABLE INCOME; AND (7) REPEALING THE CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.  WE MADE AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS NEW TAX LAW AND RECORDED A DISCRETE BENEFIT OF $6.5 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $1.2 MILLION FOR THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATION OF PREVIOUSLY TAX-DEFERRED AND UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE ACT AND RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $0.2 MILLION FOR THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX DURING SIX MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS CONTINUE TO BE NORTH AMERICAN NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION AND RESIDENTIAL REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT (R&R) ACTIVITY. WE BELIEVE THAT HOUSING STARTS AND WINDOW SHIPMENTS ARE INDICATORS OF ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE HOMEBUILDING AND WINDOW INDUSTRIES, AND WE USE THIS DATA, AS PUBLISHED BY OR DERIVED FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, TO EVALUATE THE MARKET. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EVALUATED THE MARKET USING DATA FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOMEBUILDERS (NAHB) WITH REGARD TO HOUSING STARTS, AND PUBLISHED REPORTS BY DUCKER WORLDWIDE, LLC (DUCKER), A CONSULTING AND RESEARCH FIRM, WITH REGARD TO WINDOW SHIPMENTS IN THE U.S.  WE OBTAIN MARKET DATA FROM FREEDONIA GROUP AND CATALINA RESEARCH AND KCMA, EACH A CONSULTING AND RESEARCH FIRM, FOR INSIGHT INTO THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL WOOD CABINET DEMAND.  REPORTS AND FORECASTS FROM THESE SOURCES INDICATE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE MARKETS WE SERVE.  THE NAHB HAS FORECASTED CALENDAR-YEAR HOUSING STARTS (EXCLUDING MANUFACTURED UNITS) TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY THROUGH 2021.  DUCKER INDICATED THAT WINDOW SHIPMENTS IN THE R&R MARKET ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE 1% THROUGH 2020 AND REMAIN FLAT DURING 2021.  DERIVED FROM REPORTS PUBLISHED BY DUCKER, THE OVERALL GROWTH IN WINDOW SHIPMENTS FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 0.9%, DURING THIS PERIOD, GROWTH IN R&R ACTIVITY AND NEW CONSTRUCTION INCREASED 0.9% AND 0.8%, RESPECTIVELY.  CATALINA RESEARCH ESTIMATES RESIDENTIAL SEMI-CUSTOM CABINET DEMAND IN THE U.S. TO GROW APPROXIMATELY 3% ANNUALLY THROUGH 2020.  WE UTILIZE SEVERAL COMMODITIES IN OUR BUSINESS FOR WHICH PRICING CAN FLUCTUATE, INCLUDING POLYVINYL RESIN (PVC), TITANIUM DIOXIDE (TIO2), PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, ALUMINUM AND WOOD.  FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND CRITICAL SUPPLIERS, WE HAVE PRICE ADJUSTERS IN PLACE WHICH EFFECTIVELY SHARE THE BASE PASS-THROUGH PRICE CHANGES FOR OUR PRIMARY COMMODITIES WITH OUR CUSTOMERS COMMENSURATE WITH THE MARKET AT LARGE.  OUR LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS IS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED DUE TO THE CONTRACTUAL COMPONENT OF THE ADJUSTER PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, THESE ADJUSTERS ARE NOT IN PLACE WITH ALL CUSTOMERS AND FOR ALL COMMODITIES, AND THERE IS A LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO SUCH VOLATILITY DUE TO THE LAG ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PRICE UPDATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO HARDWOODS.  IN ADDITION, SOME OF THESE COMMODITIES, SUCH AS SILICONE, ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, WHICH CAN AFFECT THE COST OF THE RAW MATERIALS, A PORTION OF WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY RECOVER.  ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS IN THE U.K. VOTED FOR THE U.K. TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.) (REFERRED TO AS BREXIT).  THE U.K. IS CURRENTLY DUE TO LEAVE THE E.U. ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BUT THE ACTUAL TIMING, TERMS OF ITS WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE WITH THE E.U. ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.  SINCE THE 2016 VOTE, THE PRIMARY IMPACT ON QUANEX\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF THE BRITISH POUND STERLING.  THIS FLUCTUATION HAS DRIVEN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS, AS WELL AS RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES FROM UPSTREAM SUPPLIERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.K.  GIVEN THE LACK OF COMPARABLE PRECEDENT, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IMPACTS ON OUR U.K. BASED OPERATIONS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL A MAJORITY OF OUR U.K. PRODUCTS WITHIN THE U.K., THERE IS MINIMAL RISK TO OUR ABILITY TO PHYSICALLY DELIVER GOODS AND COMPLETE SALES.  AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED WITHIN THE U.K. TO RESPOND TO POTENTIAL CHANGES TO UNDERLYING DEMAND AS A RESULT OF THE FINAL BREXIT OUTCOME.  THE PRIMARY FOCUS FOR OUR U.K. OPERATIONS CENTERS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING OF RAW MATERIALS.  WHILE WE SOURCE THE MAJORITY OF OUR RAW MATERIALS FROM WITHIN THE U.K., MANY OF THE PRIMARY UPSTREAM RAW MATERIALS OUR VENDORS UTILIZE ARE BEING SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF THE U.K., WHICH COULD EXPOSE US TO CROSS-BORDER ISSUES AND RAW MATERIAL PRICE IMPACTS DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITY.  IF THE U.K. EXITS THE E.U. WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT (REFERRED TO AS A HARD BREXIT), THERE COULD BE COMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE U.K. BORDER WHICH COULD HAVE WIDE-SPREAD NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE U.K.  WE DO NOT EXPECT A FULL CLOSURE TO OCCUR AND INSTEAD ASSUME AT A MINIMUM THAT TRADING WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED.  SINCE WE PURCHASE THE SAME RAW MATERIALS UTILIZED IN OUR U.K. FACILITIES AT OUR OTHER NON-U.K. FACILITIES AND SOURCE RAW MATERIALS FROM MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, WE ARE PREPARED TO UTILIZE OUR EXISTING QUANEX-WIDE SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  2018  CHANGE $% VARIANCE  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  NET SALES  $218.2  $214.2  $4.0  2%  COST OF SALES (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  171.4  169.0  2.4  (1  )%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  23.7  23.9  (0.2  )  1%  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  0.1  0.2  (0.1  )  50%  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  12.4  13.3  (0.9  )  7%  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  30.0  \u2014  30.0  (100  )%  OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME  $(19.4  )  $7.8  $(27.2  )  (349  )%  INTEREST EXPENSE  (2.6  )  (2.5  )  (0.1  )  (4  )%  OTHER, NET  \u2014  0.2  (0.2  )  (100  )%  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  (2.0  )  (1.4  )  (0.6  )  (43  )%  NET (LOSS) INCOME  $(24.0  )  $4.1  $(28.1  )  (685  )%  OUR PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD RESULTS BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOLLOW.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGES RELATED TO OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE PERCEIVED WITH CERTAINTY. ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR, AS MORE EXPERIENCE IS ACQUIRED, AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CHANGES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDE A BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE THROUGH OPEN MARKET QUOTES.  WE MUST USE OUR JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO UNCERTAINTIES IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE ESTIMATES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  .  DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE CHANGED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATED TO INVENTORY.  SPECIFICALLY, WE CHANGED THE METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING FOR CERTAIN INVENTORY TO THE FIRST-IN FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD FROM THE LAST-IN FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD.  FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THIS CHANGE, REFER TO \"PART I, FINANCIAL INFORMATION\" OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FROM TIME TO TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) OR OTHER STANDARDS SETTING BODIES THAT WE ADOPT AS OF THE SPECIFIED EFFECTIVE DATE. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED, WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF ANY RECENTLY ISSUED STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE ARE EITHER NOT APPLICABLE TO US AT THIS TIME OR WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842): AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION  . THESE AMENDMENTS REPLACE CURRENT GUIDANCE AND REQUIRE THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS U.S. GAAP.  THE AMENDMENTS APPLY TO ANY ENTITY THAT ENTERS INTO LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND, THEREFORE, WE WILL ADOPT THIS PRONOUNCEMENT IN FISCAL 2020 USING THE CURRENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENT METHOD APPROVED BY THE FASB IN MARCH 2018.  THIS METHOD ALLOWS US TO NOT RESTATE COMPARATIVE PERIODS AND INSTEAD APPLY THE NEW STANDARD ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. UNDER THIS METHOD, A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT IS RECORDED TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING AND REVIEWING OUR CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS REVIEWING OUR CURRENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTROLS, PROCESSES AND DISCLOSURES THAT WILL CHANGE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THIS NEW STANDARD.  WE ARE ALSO EVALUATING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AVAILABLE TO US WITHIN THE NEW GUIDANCE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHICH PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO ADOPT.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FISCAL 2018 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN OUR FISCAL 2018 FORM 10-K.  IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO.  THIS REPORT CONTAINS VARIOUS \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, WHICH REPRESENT OUR EXPECTATIONS OR BELIEFS CONCERNING FUTURE EVENTS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE PLANNED OPENING OF 15 TO 20 AMERICAN EAGLE STORES, 35 TO 40 AERIE STANDALONE STORES, AND THE OPENING OF 25 TO 35 AERIE SIDE-BY-SIDE FORMAT STORES WITH NEW OR EXISTING AMERICAN EAGLE STORES IN NORTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY, ENGAGE IN FUTURE FRANCHISE/LICENSE AGREEMENTS, AND/OR GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES;  \u2022  THE SELECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 50 AMERICAN EAGLE STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA FOR REMODELING AND REFURBISHING DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 AMERICAN EAGLE AND 5 TO 10 AERIE STORES, PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE PLANNED OPENING OF APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 NEW INTERNATIONAL THIRD-PARTY OPERATED AMERICAN EAGLE STORES DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR CORE AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRANDS THROUGH OUR OMNI-CHANNEL AND LICENSED OUTLETS WITHIN NORTH AMERICA AND INTERNATIONALLY;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES;  \u2022  THE CONTINUED VALIDITY OF OUR TRADEMARKS;  \u2022  OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR-END HOLIDAY SELLING SEASON;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT INVENTORY TURNOVER;  \u2022  THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE PURSUANT TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES;  \u2022  THE EXPECTED PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND IN FUTURE PERIODS;  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWINGS  \u2022  THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO FUND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS;  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT PRODUCT COSTS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN TRADE ISSUES (INCLUDING IMPORT TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS WITH CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES), CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, INCREASING PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY OR OTHER REASONS; AND  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STORE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO UNDERPERFORMING STORES.  WE CAUTION THAT THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND THOSE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INVOLVE MATERIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL AS DISCUSSED HEREIN AND ITEM 1A OF OUR FISCAL 2018 FORM 10-K. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  20  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE.  COMPARABLE SALES  \u2014 COMPARABLE SALES PROVIDE A MEASURE OF SALES GROWTH FOR STORES AND CHANNELS OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS FOLLOWING THOSE WITH 53 WEEKS, THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IS SHIFTED BY ONE WEEK TO COMPARE SIMILAR CALENDAR WEEKS. A STORE IS INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH OF OPERATION. HOWEVER, STORES THAT HAVE A GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE CHANGE OF 25% OR GREATER DUE TO A REMODEL ARE REMOVED FROM THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL SALES. THESE STORES ARE RETURNED TO THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH FOLLOWING THE REMODEL. SALES FROM AMERICAN EAGLE, AERIE, TAILGATE AND TODD SNYDER STORES, AS WELL AS SALES FROM AEO DIRECT AND OTHER DIGITAL CHANNELS, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES. SALES FROM LICENSED STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES. INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES DISCLOSURES REPRESENT SALES FROM STORES AND AEO DIRECT.  AEO DIRECT SALES ARE INCLUDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES METRIC FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  \u2022  OUR APPROACH TO CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT IS \u201cOMNI-CHANNEL\u201d, WHICH PROVIDES A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, INCLUDING FOUR WALL STORE LOCATIONS, WEB, MOBILE/TABLET DEVICES, SOCIAL NETWORKS, EMAIL, IN-STORE DISPLAYS AND KIOSKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE FULFILL ONLINE ORDERS AT STORES THROUGH OUR BUY ONLINE, SHIP FROM STORE CAPABILITY, MAXIMIZING STORE INVENTORY EXPOSURE TO DIGITAL TRAFFIC. WE ALSO OFFER RESERVE ONLINE, PICKUP IN STORE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO LOOK UP STORE INVENTORY FROM ALL DIGITAL CHANNELS; AND  \u2022  SHOPPING BEHAVIOR HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS THAT WORK IN TANDEM TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTING A BRAND LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRIC THAT INCLUDES ALL CHANNELS (I.E., STORES AND AEO DIRECT) IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE, GIVEN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR.  OUR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS COMPARABLE SALES TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR CURRENT PERFORMANCE. COMPARABLE SALES RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE LEVERAGING OF OUR COSTS, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL, STORE SUPPLIES, RENT, ETC. COMPARABLE SALES ALSO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE, CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL.  GROSS PROFIT  \u2014 GROSS PROFIT MEASURES WHETHER WE ARE OPTIMIZING PROFITABILITY OF OUR SALES. GROSS PROFIT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL NET REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES CONSISTS OF: MERCHANDISE COSTS, INCLUDING DESIGN, SOURCING, IMPORTING AND INBOUND FREIGHT COSTS, AS WELL AS MARKDOWNS, SHRINKAGE AND CERTAIN PROMOTIONAL COSTS (COLLECTIVELY \u201cMERCHANDISE COSTS\u201d) AND BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS. DESIGN COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, RENT, DEPRECIATION, TRAVEL, SUPPLIES AND SAMPLES.  BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES AND TRAVEL FOR OUR BUYERS AND CERTAIN SENIOR MERCHANDISING EXECUTIVES; RENT AND UTILITIES RELATED TO OUR STORES, CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND OTHER OFFICE SPACE; FREIGHT FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE STORES; COMPENSATION AND SUPPLIES FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING PURCHASING, RECEIVING AND INSPECTION COSTS; AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE OPERATION.  THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SALES, INITIAL MARKUPS OR ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR USE OF MARKDOWNS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS PROFIT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OPERATING INCOME  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT VIEWS OPERATING INCOME AS A KEY INDICATOR OF OUR PERFORMANCE. THE KEY DRIVERS OF OPERATING INCOME ARE COMPARABLE SALES, GROSS PROFIT, OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OUR LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT UTILIZES THE FOLLOWING QUALITY OF SALES METRICS IN EVALUATING OUR OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE: COMPARABLE SALES, AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL PRICE (\u201cAUR\u201d), UNITS PER TRANSACTION (\u201cUPT\u201d), AVERAGE TRANSACTION VALUE, TRANSACTIONS, CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, CONVERSION RATES, AVERAGE UNIT COST (\u201cAUC\u201d), AND COMPARABLE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS.  INVENTORY TURNOVER  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES INVENTORY TURNOVER AS A MEASURE OF HOW PRODUCTIVELY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. INVENTORY TURNOVER IS IMPORTANT AS IT CAN SIGNAL SLOW MOVING INVENTORY. THIS CAN BE CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE NEED TO TAKE MARKDOWNS ON MERCHANDISE.  21  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, INVESTING AND FINANCING IN DETERMINING THE SUFFICIEN  CY OF OUR CASH POSITION.  C  ASH FLOW HAS HISTORIC  ALLY BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR USES OF CASH. O  UR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT  CASH FLOW WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  OUR FIRST QUARTER PRODUCED THE SEVENTEENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE.  AMERICAN EAGLE\u2019S ONGOING MARKET SHARE GAINS ARE LED BY ITS DOMINANT JEANS BUSINESS, AND AERIE\u2019S CONSISTENT DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH HAS BEEN FUELED BY THE BRAND\u2019S STRONG APPEAL TO BOTH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED 8% TO $886.3 MILLION AND CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE SALES, INCLUDING AEO DIRECT, INCREASED 6%, FOLLOWING A 9% INCREASE LAST YEAR. BY BRAND, AMERICAN EAGLE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 4% FOLLOWING A 4% INCREASE LAST YEAR, WHILE AERIE COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 14% COMPARED TO A 38% INCREASE LAST YEAR. GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 7% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $324.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $304.4 MILLION LAST YEAR AND DECREASED 30 BASIS POINTS TO 36.7% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE.  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED 2% TO $40.8 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $39.9 MILLION, OR $0.22 PER DILUTED SHARE, LAST YEAR. ON AN ADJUSTED BASIS, NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE THIS YEAR INCREASED 4% TO $0.24 PER SHARE, WHICH EXCLUDES $0.01 PER SHARE OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES COMPARED TO $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE LAST YEAR, WHICH EXCLUDES $0.01 PER SHARE OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE RETURNED $43.6 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF $20.0 MILLION, AND CASH DIVIDENDS OF $23.6 MILLION.  WE HAD $349.7 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO $309.7 MILLION LAST YEAR.  MERCHANDISE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER WAS $456.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO $404.3 MILLION LAST YEAR, A 13% INCREASE.  OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY THE PATTERN OF SEASONALITY COMMON TO MOST RETAIL APPAREL BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  THIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION CONTAINS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (\u201cNON-GAAP\u201d OR \u201cADJUSTED\u201d), COMPRISED OF EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION EXCLUDING NON-GAAP ITEMS. THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS NOT BASED ON ANY STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY PRESCRIBED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) AND IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP INFORMATION IS USEFUL AS AN ADDITIONAL MEANS FOR INVESTORS TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHEN REVIEWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP AND, THEREFORE, SHOULD NOT BE USED EXCLUSIVELY IN EVALUATING OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS.  THE TABLE BELOW RECONCILES THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE TO THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE DISCUSSED ABOVE.  13 WEEKS ENDED  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4,  MAY 5,  2019  2018  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE - GAAP BASIS  $0.23  $0.22  ADD: RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  (1)(2)  0.01  0.01  NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE - ADJUSTED OR NON-  GAAP BASIS  $0.24  $0.23  (1)  13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019: $1.5 MILLION OF PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF SEVERANCE AND CLOSURE COSTS FOR OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED STORES IN CHINA  (2)  13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018: $1.6 MILLION OF PRE-TAX RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF CORPORATE SEVERANCE CHARGES  22  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE PERCENTAGE RELATIONSHIP TO TOTAL NET REVENUE OF THE LISTED LINE ITEMS INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND RETAINED EARNINGS.  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4,  MAY 5,  2019  2018  TOTAL NET REVENUE  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES, INCLUDING CERTAIN BUYING, OCCUPANCY  AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES  63.3  63.0  GROSS PROFIT  36.7  37.0  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  26.0  25.5  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  0.2  0.2  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  5.1  5.1  OPERATING INCOME  5.4  6.2  OTHER INCOME, NET  0.5  \u2014  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  5.9  6.2  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  1.3  1.4  NET INCOME  4.6%  4.8%  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS OUR CONSOLIDATED STORE DATA.  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4,  MAY 5,  2019  2018  NUMBER OF STORES.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN ONE REPORTABLE SEGMENT, CONSISTING OF 936 AMERICAN EAGLE RETAIL STORES WHICH INCLUDE 151 AERIE SIDE-BY-SIDE LOCATIONS, 119 AERIE STAND-ALONE LOCATIONS AND AEO DIRECT. ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE 5 TAILGATE AND 1 TODD SNYDER STAND-ALONE LOCATIONS.  COMPARISON OF THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  TOTAL NET REVENUE  TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED 8%, OR $63.3 MILLION, TO $886.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $823.0 MILLION LAST YEAR.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 6% FOR THE PERIOD COMPARED TO A 9% INCREASE LAST YEAR.  BY BRAND, INCLUDING THE RESPECTIVE AEO DIRECT SALES, AMERICAN EAGLE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 4%, OR $23.9 MILLION, AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 14%, OR $16.9 MILLION.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES FOR AE WOMEN\u2019S INCREASED 7% AND MEN\u2019S DECREASED 4%.  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER, CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE TRAFFIC AND TRANSACTIONS INCREASED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS. UNITS PER TRANSACTION INCREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AUR DECREASE IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  23  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 7% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $324.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $304.4 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN RATE DECLINED 30 BASIS POINTS TO A RATE OF 36.7% OF REVENUE.  RENT LEVERAGE AND IMPROVED PRODUCT COSTS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN MARKDOWNS AND DELIVERY EXPENSE.  THERE WAS $2.5 MILLION AND $2.7 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE INCLUDED IN GROSS PROFIT FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, COMPRISED OF BOTH TIME AND PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAILERS, AS SOME RETAILERS INCLUDE ALL COSTS RELATED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, AS WELL AS DESIGN COSTS IN COST OF SALES AND OTHERS MAY EXCLUDE A PORTION OF THESE COSTS FROM COST OF SALES, INCLUDING THEM IN A LINE ITEM SUCH AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  REFER TO NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY REGARDING COST OF SALES, INCLUDING CERTAIN BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES INCREASED 10% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $230.7 MILLION FROM $210.2 MILLION LAST YEAR. AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 26.0%, COMPARED TO 25.5% LAST YEAR. STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE STORES ORGANIZATION, WHICH BEGAN MIDWAY THROUGH 2018, LED TO INCREASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  ADVERTISING AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE FROM $210 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THERE WAS $2.5 MILLION AND $3.0 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED OF BOTH TIME AND PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.5 MILLION, OR 0.2% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019. THESE CHARGES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SEVERANCE AND CLOSURE COSTS FOR OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED STORES IN CHINA. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.6 MILLION, OR 0.2% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  THESE CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CORPORATE SEVERANCE CHARGES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 7% OR $2.9 MILLION TO $44.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $41.9 MILLION LAST YEAR.  AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS 5.1% THIS YEAR COMPARED TO 5.1% LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY OMNI-CHANNEL, STORES AND IT TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $4.2 MILLION THIS YEAR, COMPARED TO OTHER INCOME OF $0.5 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED INTEREST INCOME AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND IS ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR QUARTERLY EVENTS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WAS 21.7% COMPARED TO 22.0% FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE THIS YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN TAX REFORM GUIDANCE.  NET INCOME  NET INCOME INCREASED 2%, OR $0.8 MILLION, TO $40.8 MILLION, OR 4.6% AS A PERCENT TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, FROM $39.9 MILLION, OR 4.8% AS A PERCENT TO TOTAL NET REVENUE LAST YEAR. NET INCOME PER SHARE INCREASED 5% TO $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, INCLUDING $0.01 OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES FROM $0.22 PER DILUTED SHARE, INCLUDING $0.01 OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES LAST YEAR.  THE CHANGE IN NET INCOME IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE.  24  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE THIRD PARTY OPERATORS TO EXPAND OUR BRANDS INTERNATIONALLY. THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS, A SERIES OF FRANCHISED, LICENSED OR OTHER BRAND-DEDICATED AMERICAN EAGLE STORES HAVE OPENED AND WILL CONTINUE TO OPEN IN AREAS INCLUDING EASTERN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, NORTHERN AFRICA AND PARTS OF ASIA. THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR OPERATIONAL INVOLVEMENT FROM US.  WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE ENTER INTO THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD 235 STORES OPERATED BY OUR THIRD PARTY OPERATORS IN 24 COUNTRIES. INTERNATIONAL THIRD PARTY OPERATED STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STORE DATA OR THE TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET CALCULATION.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD 104 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN CANADA, 39 IN MEXICO, 6 IN HONG KONG AND 6 IN PUERTO RICO.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED UNDER ASC 820 AS THE EXIT PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF AN ASSET OR TRANSFER OF A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 820 MUST MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  IN ADDITION, ASC 820 ESTABLISHES A THREE-TIER FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  THESE TIERS INCLUDE.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 \u2014 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.  \u2022  LEVEL 2 \u2014 INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.  \u2022  LEVEL 3 \u2014 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HELD CERTAIN ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.  THESE INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820, THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS (CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS) MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AT MAY 4, 2019  (IN THOUSANDS)  CARRYING AMOUNT  QUOTED MARKET  PRICES IN ACTIVE  MARKETS FOR  IDENTICAL  ASSETS  (LEVEL 1)  SIGNIFICANT OTHER  OBSERVABLE INPUTS  (LEVEL 2)  SIGNIFICANT  UNOBSERVABLE  INPUTS  (LEVEL 3)  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

HISTORICALLY, THESE USES OF CASH HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING CASH ON HAND. ALSO, WE MAINTAIN AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO BORROW UP TO $400 MILLION, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2024.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR USES OF CASH INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AERIE BRAND, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND OMNI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION EFFORTS.  WE ALSO MADE KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND OUR ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL AND HIGHER WAGES, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL ADVERTISING EXPENSES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CURRENT CASH HOLDINGS AS WELL AS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INCLUDES FORTIFYING OUR BRANDS AND FURTHER E-COMMERCE AND STORE EXPANSION OR ACQUISITIONS. WE PERIODICALLY CONSIDER AND EVALUATE THESE OPTIONS TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH. IN THE EVENT WE DO PURSUE SUCH OPTIONS, WE COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN CLOSING ANY POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, OR THAT ANY ENDEAVOR WE UNDERTAKE WOULD INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY.  THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH CERTAIN MEASURES OF OUR LIQUIDITY.  MAY 4,  FEBRUARY 2,  MAY 5,  2019  2019  2018  WORKING CAPITAL (IN THOUSANDS)  $300,806  $503,608  $439,792  CURRENT RATIO  1.46  1.93  2.01  WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $202.8 MILLION COMPARED TO FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AND DECREASED $138.9 MILLION COMPARED TO LAST YEAR. THE ADOPTION OF ASC 842 DECREASED WORKING CAPITAL BY $215.1 MILLION, DUE TO THE ADDITION OF $266.8 MILLION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES (CURRENT PORTION), OFFSET BY $51.7 MILLION OF CURRENT DEFERRED RENT BALANCES. COMPARED TO LAST YEAR, THE REMAINING $76.2 MILLION INCREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS DRIVEN BY A $51.9 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORY AND A $40.0 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $24.1 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $7.7 MILLION AND $28.0 MILLION FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. FOR BOTH PERIODS, OUR MAJOR SOURCE OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS WAS MERCHANDISE SALES AND OUR PRIMARY OUTFLOW OF CASH FOR OPERATIONS WAS FOR THE PAYMENT OF OPERATIONAL COSTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF $47.1 MILLION OF NET SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $36.6 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018 PRIMARILY INCLUDED $46.9 MILLION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND $20.0 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PURCHASES.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $23.6 MILLION FOR CASH DIVIDENDS PAID AT A QUARTERLY RATE OF $0.1375 PER SHARE, $20.0 MILLION USED FOR PURCHASES OF 0.9 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER PUBLICALLY ANNOUNCED PROGRAMS, AND $3.5 MILLION FOR THE REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK FROM EMPLOYEES FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.

THE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE SECURED BY A FIRST-PRIORITY SECURITY INTEREST IN CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS OF THE BORROWERS AND GUARANTORS, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF CASH, RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS AND HAVE BEEN FURTHER SECURED BY FIRST-PRIORITY MORTGAGES ON CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND HAD $8.1 MILLION OUTSTANDING IN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT. NO LOANS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ON MAY 4, 2019.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WERE $36.6 MILLION AND INCLUDED $24.3 MILLION RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN OUR STORES, INCLUDING 11 NEW AEO STORES, 23 REMODELED AND REFURBISHED STORES, AND FIXTURES AND VISUAL INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE GROWTH BY INVESTING IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVES ($5.0 MILLION), E-COMMERCE ($6.9 MILLION) AND OTHER HOME OFFICE PROJECTS ($0.4 MILLION).  FOR FISCAL 2019, WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $200 MILLION TO $215 MILLION IN SUPPORT OF OUR EXPANSION EFFORTS, STORES INVESTMENTS INCLUDING SELECTIVE REMODELS OF HIGH PERFORMING, LONG-TERM LOCATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES TO SUPPORT GROWTH AND INVESTMENTS IN E-COMMERCE.  STOCK REPURCHASES  DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, AS PART OF OUR PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE REPURCHASED 0.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $20.0 MILLION, AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $21.69 PER SHARE. DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018, AS PART OF OUR PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, WE REPURCHASED 2.3 MILLION SHARES FOR $44.9 MILLION, AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE OF $19.51 PER SHARE.  DURING FISCAL 2016, OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF 25.0 MILLION SHARES UNDER A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WHICH EXPIRES ON JANUARY 30, 2021. AS OF MAY 4, 2019, 10.8 MILLION SHARES REMAIN AUTHORIZED UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM.  DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MILLION AND 0.7 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, FROM CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AT MARKET PRICES TOTALING $3.5 MILLION AND $14.2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  THESE SHARES WERE REPURCHASED FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE VESTING OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, AS PERMITTED UNDER OUR EQUITY INCENTIVE PLANS. THE AFOREMENTIONED SHARES REPURCHASED HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS TREASURY STOCK.  DIVIDENDS  DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, OUR BOARD DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.1375 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID ON APRIL 26, 2019.  SUBSEQUENT TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, OUR BOARD DECLARED A $0.1375 PER SHARE DIVIDEND, PAYABLE ON JULY 26, 2019, TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON JULY 12, 2019.  THE PAYMENT OF FUTURE DIVIDENDS IS AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD AND IS BASED ON FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN U.S. TAXATION AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS PAID WILL BE DECLARED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING DEVELOPER OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING SOLUTIONS FOR VIDEO THAT ENABLE HIGH-DEFINITION, OR HD, VIDEO CAPTURE, ANALYSIS, SHARING AND DISPLAY. A DEVICE THAT CAPTURES VIDEO INCLUDES FOUR PRIMARY COMPONENTS: A LENS, AN IMAGE SENSOR, A VIDEO PROCESSOR AND STORAGE MEMORY. THE VIDEO PROCESSOR CONVERTS RAW VIDEO INPUT INTO A FORMAT THAT CAN BE STORED AND DISTRIBUTED EFFICIENTLY AND, IN SOME CASES, ANALYZES THE VIDEO DATA TO AUTOMATE PROCESSES. WE COMBINE OUR PROCESSOR DESIGN CAPABILITIES WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING, COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE EASILY SCALABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS AND ENABLE RAPID AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP, OR SOC, DESIGNS FULLY INTEGRATE HD VIDEO PROCESSING, IMAGE PROCESSING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI, COMPUTER VISION, OR CV, FUNCTIONALITY, AUDIO PROCESSING, AND SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL VIDEO AND IMAGE QUALITY AT HIGH COMPRESSION RATES, DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONALITY AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN EXPANDING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT ONLY COMPLEMENTS OUR IMAGE PROCESSING AND VIDEO COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO BUILDS FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN AI AND CV APPLICATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT ENHANCED COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY IS CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR CURRENT VIDEO MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY CAMERA, AS WELL AS FUTURE MARKETS SUCH AS AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER, OR OEM, CAMERAS FOR ADVANCED DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, OR ADAS, AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, AND ROBOTICS. OUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON CREATING ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE, LOW-POWER HARDWARE PLATFORMS TO ENHANCE PROCESSING ACCELERATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR CVFLOW ARCHITECTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY HIGHLY-OPTIMIZED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR VIDEO PROCESSOR PROVIDES AN OPTIMIZED CV PLATFORM. IN 2017, WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST COMPUTER VISION SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP, THE CV1 SOC. IN 2018, WE INTRODUCED THREE NEW COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOCS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP INTELLIGENT CAMERA SYSTEMS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS AT DIFFERENT FEATURE LEVELS.  23  OUR REVENUE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN GENERATED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS FO  R INCORPORATION INTO SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES SUCH AS WEARABLE SPORTS CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET CAMERAS, IP SECURITY CAMERAS AND CAMERAS INCORPORATED INTO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES, OR UAVS OR DRONES. OUR REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF THE  SE MARKETS, HOWEVER, HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH, IF ANY, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND WITHIN THE CAMERA MARKETS WITH OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOC SOLU  TIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING CAMERA MARKETS, AS WELL AS EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMPARISON  TO PRIOR PERIODS AS WE DEVOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTIONS WITH INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES, AND AS WE TARGET NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOT  ICS MARKETS.  WE SELL OUR SOLUTIONS TO LEADING ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS, OR ODMS, AND OEMS GLOBALLY, AND IN THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, WE ALSO SELL TO TIER-1 SUPPLIERS TO OEMS. WE REFER TO ODMS AND TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AS OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEMS AS OUR END CUSTOMERS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR AS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. IN THE CAMERA MARKET, OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE THE CREATION OF HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO CONTENT IN WEARABLE CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS, INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP, SECURITY CAMERAS, FOR BOTH PROFESSIONAL USE AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS UAVS OR DRONES, AND VIRTUAL REALITY CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS 360\u00b0 CAMERAS. WE ALSO RECENTLY INTRODUCED, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  OUR SALES CYCLES TYPICALLY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES BEFORE WE CAN REALIZE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF OUR SOLUTIONS, IF ANY. OUR TYPICAL SALES CYCLE CONSISTS OF A MULTI-MONTH SALES AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INVOLVING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 SYSTEM DESIGNERS AND MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH OUR SALES PERSONNEL AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROCESS CULMINATES IN A CUSTOMER\u2019S DECISION TO USE OUR SOLUTIONS IN ITS SYSTEM, WHICH WE REFER TO AS A DESIGN WIN. OUR SALES EFFORTS ARE TYPICALLY DIRECTED TO THE OEM OF THE PRODUCT THAT WILL INCORPORATE OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTION, BUT THE EVENTUAL DESIGN AND INCORPORATION OF OUR SOC INTO THE PRODUCT MAY BE HANDLED BY AN ODM ON BEHALF OF THE OEM. IN SOME OF THE NEW MARKETS WE ARE ADDRESSING, SUCH AS AI-BASED AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS, IT MAY TAKE LONGER AND REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES TO SECURE DESIGN WINS THAN IN OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS.  VOLUME PRODUCTION MAY BEGIN WITHIN SIX TO 18 MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER AFTER A DESIGN WIN, DEPENDING ON THE TARGETED MARKET, THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT AND OTHER FACTORS UPON WHICH WE MAY HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE. ONCE ONE OF OUR SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\u2019S DESIGN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING A PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. CONVERSELY, A DESIGN LOSS TO A COMPETITOR WILL LIKELY PRECLUDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GENERATE FUTURE REVENUE FROM SUCH CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A DESIGN WIN AND OUR SOC REMAINS A COMPONENT THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT, THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF ACTUAL SALES OF OUR SOCS TO THE CUSTOMER DEPEND UPON THE PRODUCTION, RELEASE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PRODUCT, NONE OF WHICH ARE WITHIN OUR CONTROL. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, WHILE AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  24  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND TRENDS  \u2022  WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $47.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, A DECREASE OF 17% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM WEARABLE CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING SPORTS CAMERA, NON-SPORTS WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND DRONE MARKETS. THE DECREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER. IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, REVENUE DECLINED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR TWO LARGEST CHINA CUSTOMERS LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASED IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY THE HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC. OR GOPRO.  \u2022  WE RECORDED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $18.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF $10.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCREASED OPERATING LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS AND INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED PRIMARILY IN SUPPORT OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  \u2022  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $5.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $64,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR INCREASED NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842, LEASES. UNDER THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WE RECOGNIZE LEASES AS RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, WHILE RECOGNIZING LEASE EXPENSES UNDER STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD THROUGH THE LEASE TERM  . AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $7.9 MILLION OF ROU, NET OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND $8.0 MILLION OF LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION OF LEASE EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PERFORMANCE  DESIGN WINS  . WE CLOSELY MONITOR DESIGN WINS BY CUSTOMER AND END MARKET. WE CONSIDER DESIGN WINS TO BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS, ALTHOUGH A DESIGN WIN MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY MATERIALIZE INTO REVENUE, AND EVEN IF IT DOES RESULT IN REVENUE, THE AMOUNT GENERATED BY EACH DESIGN WIN CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR LONG-TERM SALES EXPECTATIONS ARE BASED ON FORECASTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND INTERNAL ESTIMATIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FACTORING IN THE EXPECTED TIME TO MARKET FOR END CUSTOMER PRODUCTS INCORPORATING OUR SOLUTIONS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE POTENTIAL. OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND, HOWEVER, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INACCURATE FORECASTING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, MISCALCULATIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS OF THEIR INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT ORDER MIX AND FLUCTUATING DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS.  PRICING, PRODUCT COST AND MARGIN  . OUR PRICING AND MARGINS DEPEND ON THE VOLUMES AND FEATURES OF THE SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH COST IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES THAT WE EXPECT TO DRIVE REVENUE AND MAINTAIN MARGINS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERA APPLICATIONS OR, IN THE FUTURE, ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO LOWER-PERFORMING, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICE CAN VARY BY MARKET AND APPLICATION DUE TO MARKET-SPECIFIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND, THE MATURATION OF PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE COST OF OUR SOLUTIONS. AS WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAINTAIN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR PRODUCTION YIELDS, COMPONENT COSTS AND DESIGN EFFICIENCIES.  25  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON COMPUTER VISION TRENDS  . WE EXPECT THAT COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE MARKETS,  INCLUDING  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE, ROBOTICS, AND UAV MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADVANCED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ENABLE AND SUPPORT CUSTOMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ADAS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETE  CTION, OBJECT DETECTION, PEOPLE RECOGNITION, RETAIL ANALYTICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING, AND GAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS, WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS.  SHIFTING CONSUMER PREFERENCES.  OUR REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES, REGARDING FORM FACTOR AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND HOW THOSE PREFERENCES IMPACT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE ELECTRONICS THAT WE SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, IMPROVED SMARTPHONE VIDEO CAPTURE CAPABILITIES LED TO THE DECLINE OF VIDEO CAMERAS AIMED AT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET. THE CURRENT VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET IS NOW CHARACTERIZED BY A GREATER VOLUME OF MORE SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE REPLACED WITH SMARTPHONES, SUCH AS WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS. THIS INCREASING SPECIALIZATION OF VIDEO CAPTURE DEVICES HAS CHANGED OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND END MARKETS AND HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUE. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT FURTHER CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THOSE MARKETS.  CONTINUED CONCENTRATION OF REVENUE BY END MARKET  . HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF END MARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE CAME FROM THE POCKET VIDEO, CAMCORDER AND INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR NEW MARKETS AS THEY EMERGED, SUCH AS THE WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERA MARKETS. SINCE FISCAL YEAR 2013, THE WEARABLE SPORTS, PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND UAV MARKETS HAVE BEEN OUR LARGEST END MARKETS AND SALES INTO THESE MARKETS COLLECTIVELY GENERATED THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EXPANSION INTO NEW MARKETS IS REQUIRED TO FACILITATE REVENUE GROWTH AND CUSTOMER DIVERSIFICATION AS OUR REVENUE FROM THE WEARABLE CAMERA AND UAV CAMERA MARKETS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING APPLICATIONS AND MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO EXPAND OUR END MARKET EXPOSURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR END MARKET CONCENTRATION MAY CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF PRODUCTS THAT OUR SOCS ARE DESIGNED INTO AS WELL AS THE OVERALL GROWTH OR DECLINE IN THE VIDEO CAPTURE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF ODMS WHO BUILD PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS AND FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS TO WHOM WE SHIP DIRECTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON SALES TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS.  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON CONNECTIVITY TRENDS  . MOBILE CONNECTED DEVICES ARE UBIQUITOUS TODAY AND PLAY AN INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IN CONSUMERS\u2019 LIVES. THE CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY PROVIDED BY THESE DEVICES HAS CREATED A DEMAND FOR CONNECTED ELECTRONIC PERIPHERALS SUCH AS VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES. OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE TRENDS BY SUPPORTING OUR END CUSTOMERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTED PERIPHERALS THAT SEAMLESSLY COOPERATE WITH OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SHARE VIDEO AND IMAGES WITH ONLINE MEDIA PLATFORMS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR SUCCESS. WE HAVE ADDED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONALITY INTO OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERAS. THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY WITH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY ENABLES WIRELESS VIDEO STREAMING AND UPLOADING OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES TO THE INTERNET. OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE IP SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEMS TO STREAM VIDEO CONTENT TO EITHER CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE OR CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES, AND OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE AND UAV CAMERAS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO QUICKLY STREAM OR UPLOAD VIDEO AND IMAGES TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.  SALES VOLUME  . A TYPICAL CAMERA DESIGN WIN THAT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES INTO THE MARKETPLACE CAN GENERATE A WIDE RANGE OF SALES VOLUMES FOR OUR SOLUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE END MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS. THIS CAN DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REPUTATION OF THE END CUSTOMER, MARKET PENETRATION, PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, SIZE OF THE END MARKET THAT THE PRODUCT ADDRESSES AND OUR END CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS ON SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE OFFSET BY LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS RELATED TO HIGHER VOLUMES. IN GENERAL, OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER MARKET PENETRATION AND BETTER BRANDING TEND TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LARGER VOLUMES OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  CUSTOMER PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  WE ESTIMATE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES BASED ON THE CUSTOMER, TYPE OF PRODUCT AND END MARKET. WE TYPICALLY COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS FROM SIX TO 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING A DESIGN WIN; HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS, MORE LENGTHY PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PROJECT, SUCH AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKET. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, AND AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE, TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  26  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A SUMMARY OF OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR SOC SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED IN CAMERA MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY, AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER, DRONE AND WEARABLE CAMERAS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THESE CAMERA MARKETS, IN PARTICULAR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SOCS TARGETING EMERGING COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS IN THE IP SECURITY, OEM AUTOMOTIVE, AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM SALES MADE INDIRECTLY THROUGH ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WINTECH MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR WINTECH, AND DIRECTLY TO ONE OF OUR ODM CUSTOMERS, CHICONY ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR CHICONY.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY REVENUE WITH OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER NORMALLY BEING THE HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER. THIS FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED SALES IN CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS AS OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD INVENTORIES IN PREPARATION FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. DUE TO  EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS IN SEVERAL CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY AND DRONE MARKETS  , THE SEASONAL IMPACT ON QUARTERLY REVENUE WOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. MORE GENERALLY, OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE MIX OF OUR SOLUTIONS SOLD IN A PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF BOTH CHANGES IN UNIT SALES OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION AND SALES OF NEW SOLUTIONS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A LIFE CYCLE THAT BEGINS WITH HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER VOLUMES, FOLLOWED BY BROADER MARKET ADOPTION, HIGHER VOLUMES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT ARE LOWER THAN INITIAL LEVELS.  27  THE END MARKETS INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPOSITION AN  D TIMING OF OUR REVENUE MAY DIFFER MEANINGFULLY DURING PERIODS OF TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCE CHANGES. WE EXPECT SHIFTS IN CONSUMER USE OF VIDEO CAPTURE TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AS COMPUTER VISION SPECIALIZED USE CASES EMERGE AND VIDEO CAPTUR  E CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE.  COST OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES THE COST OF MATERIALS SUCH AS WAFERS PROCESSED BY THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PACKAGING, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, AND OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPORT OPERATIONS SUCH AS LOGISTICS, PLANNING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. COST OF REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS WARRANTY, INVENTORY VALUATION RESERVES AND OTHER GENERAL OVERHEAD COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PRODUCT MIX AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERAS, AND IN FUTURE ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE OEM APPLICATIONS, HAVE HAD OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO THE LOWER-PERFORMANCE, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. AS SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS MATURE AND UNIT VOLUMES SOLD TO CUSTOMERS INCREASE, THEIR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES TYPICALLY DECLINE. THESE DECLINES MAY BE PAIRED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND LOWER WAFER, PACKAGING AND TEST COSTS, WHICH OFFSET SOME OF THE MARGIN REDUCTION THAT COULD RESULT FROM LOWER SELLING PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN WILL DECLINE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMERA MARKET AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE IP SECURITY MARKET.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OUR FOUNDRY VENDORS, COSTS OF LICENSING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THIRD PARTIES FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TOOLS, COST OF FABRICATION OF MASK SETS FOR PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR PRODUCT FEATURES AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASE HEADCOUNT FOR NEW SOC DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE MARKET.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR OUR SALES, MARKETING, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES PROFESSIONAL SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING, TAX, LEGAL SERVICES, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OF ADDRESSING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES, INTEREST INCOME FROM DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SUBSIDIES GRANTED FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE ARE INCORPORATED AND DOMICILED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, ITALY, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME IS SUBJECT TO VARYING TAX RATES, AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EARNINGS OR LOSSES AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN EACH GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION FROM CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS; TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE TAX EFFECTS OF NONDEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AS A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS. IF OUR OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS TO CHANGE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OPERATING INCOME SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN HIGHER-TAX JURISDICTIONS, OR IF WE WERE TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS ASSESSING RELATIVELY HIGHER TAX RATES, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND/OR BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  28  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSIT  IONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES ARE REASONABLE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL PROVISION FOR I  NCOME TAXES AND ACCRUALS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RE  CORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION RESERVES AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPR  IATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CHANGE OUR DETERMINATION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT CAN BE REALIZED, WE WILL ADJUST OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE WITH A CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

THE DECREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER. IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, REVENUE DECLINED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR TWO LARGEST CHINA CUSTOMERS LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASED IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY THE HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC. OR GOPRO.

THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF SOCS FOR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET.  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE THAT WAS DERIVED FROM THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET COMBINED WITH THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM THE HIGHER GROSS MARGIN SPORTS CAMERA AND DRONE MARKETS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  $33,017  $31,664  $1,353  4%  29  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT  TO SUPPORT THE COMPUT  ER VISION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CURRENT MARKETS, AS WELL AS NEW MARKETS SUCH AS THE AUTOMOTIVE AND  ROBOTICS MARKETS  . OUR ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT INCREASED TO 557 AT APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 540 AT APRIL 30, 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN S  ALARY-RELATED EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. THE INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS E  NDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS A RESULT OF ISSUANCE OF EQUITY FOR NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES AND OUR ANNUAL CASH BONUS AND EVERGREEN STOCK PROGRAMS FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THE SOC DEVELOPMENT COST WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPA  RED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF CHIPS IN DEVELOPMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  $13,077  $13,178  $(101  )  (1  )%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION LESS EXPENDITURES ON OUTSIDE PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 MILLION AS A RESULT OF OUR ANNUAL CASH BONUS AND EVERGREEN STOCK PROGRAMS FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES.  OTHER INCOME, NET  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  OTHER INCOME, NET  $2,196  $792  $1,404  177%  THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME, NET, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN AGGREGATE INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME FROM OUR DEPOSITS AND DEBT SECURITY INVESTMENTS. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LARGER INVESTED BALANCES, INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND DEBT SECURITIES PURCHASED AT DISCOUNTS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION SUBSIDY GRANTED FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  CHANGE  2019  2018  AMOUNT%  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  $1,266  $848  $418  49%  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  (7.9)%  (9.3)%  \u2014  1.4%  THE QUARTERLY INCOME TAXES REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF THE CORRESPONDING FISCAL YEAR\u2019S ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND INCLUDE, WHEN APPLICABLE, ADJUSTMENTS FROM DISCRETE TAX ITEMS ARISING IN THAT QUARTER.  THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF PROFITS GENERATED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS AND LOSSES INCURRED IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY WAS NOT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A RELATED TAX BENEFIT, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NON-DEDUCTIBLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 AND JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $366.2 MILLION AND $358.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN HIGHLY LIQUID, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, THESE SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $206.8 MILLION WITH INSIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED LOSSES CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUE.  30  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR INCREASED NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $26.6 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $19.9 MILLION IN CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE AND MATURITY OF DEBT SECURITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO $20.6 MILLION OF CASH USED FOR THE REPURCHASING OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018 THAT WAS NOT INCURRED DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CASH PROCEEDS FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE WITHHOLDING.  OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $366.2 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE AS WE INCREASE HEADCOUNT, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND IMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REQUIRE MORE WORKING CAPITAL. IF OUR AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR BORROW FUNDS COMMERCIALLY. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, THESE SECURITIES COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL.  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR COSTS;  \u2022  THE EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE EMERGENCE OF COMPETING OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS;  \u2022  THE COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PARTICIPATING IN LITIGATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND  \u2022  OUR ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  31  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  MANUFACTURING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, WE HAD PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF $22.9 MILLION.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1980 AND HAVE GROWN TO BECOME THE LARGEST  MANUFACTURER OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES (\u201cRVS\u201d) IN THE WORLD. WE ARE ALSO THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF RVS IN NORTH AMERICA, AND ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF RVS IN EUROPE. IN NORTH AMERICA, ACCORDING TO STATISTICAL SURVEYS, INC.  (\u201cSTAT SURVEYS\u201d), FOR THE CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THOR\u2019S COMBINED U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKET SHARE WAS APPROXIMATELY 46.4% FOR TRAVEL TRAILERS AND FIFTH WHEELS COMBINED AND APPROXIMATELY 35.5% FOR MOTORHOMES. IN  EUROPE, THOR\u2019S EUROPEAN MARKET SHARE FOR THE CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY 22.5% FOR MOTORCARAVANS AND CAMPERVANS COMBINED AND APPROXIMATELY 21.5% FOR CARAVANS.  OUR BUSINESS MODEL INCLUDES DECENTRALIZED OPERATING UNITS, AND OUR RV PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO INDEPENDENT,  NON-FRANCHISE  DEALERS WHO, IN TURN, RETAIL THOSE PRODUCTS. OUR GROWTH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITION, AND OUR STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY BY DRIVING  INNOVATION, SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS, MANUFACTURING QUALITY PRODUCTS, IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCIES OF OUR FACILITIES AND MAKING STRATEGIC GROWTH ACQUISITIONS.  RECENT EVENTS  ERWIN HYMER GROUP ACQUISITION  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ERWIN HYMER GROUP SE (\u201cEHG\u2019) CLOSED ON A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY  ACQUIRED EHG. EHG IS HEADQUARTERED IN BAD WALDSEE, GERMANY, AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RV MANUFACTURERS IN EUROPE, BY REVENUE. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EHG IN ORDER TO EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS INTO THE GROWING EUROPEAN MARKET WITH A LONG-STANDING EUROPEAN  INDUSTRY LEADER.  23  AT THE CLOSING, THE COMPANY PAID CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1.53 BILLION EURO  (APPROXIMATELY $1.76 BILLION AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019) AND ISSUED 2,256,492 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK TO THE SELLERS VALUED AT $144.2 MILLION. THE CASH CONSIDERATION WAS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION  OF AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND OF APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION AND DEBT FINANCING CONSISTING OF TWO CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS, A SEVEN-YEAR, $2.1 BILLION TERM LOAN, WITH AN APPROXIMATE $1.4 BILLION U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED TRANCHE AND AN  APPROXIMATE 0.6 BILLION EURO TRANCHE (APPROXIMATELY $0.7 BILLION AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AT FEBRUARY 1, 2019), AND $100 MILLION UTILIZED AT CLOSING FROM A FIVE-YEAR, $750.0 MILLION ASSET-BASED CREDIT FACILITY (ABL), EACH AS  MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UNDER EACH FACILITY ARE SECURED BY LIENS ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND BOTH AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN  CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.  CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019 RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS AND CERTAIN BANK FEES, TICKING FEES, LEGAL, ADVISORY AND OTHER COSTS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  ARE INCLUDED IN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON JUNE 19, 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED COMPANY MANAGEMENT TO UTILIZE UP TO $250,000 TO PURCHASE  SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK THROUGH JUNE 19, 2020. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2019.  TAX REFORM AND OTHER TAX MATTERS  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE  \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT INCLUDES NUMEROUS CHANGES TO TAX LAWS IMPACTING BUSINESS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BEING A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%. THE RATE REDUCTION TOOK  EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2018. AS A RESULT OF OTHER TAX ACT CHANGES, THE COMPANY\u2019S INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL BE IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (\u201cCODE  SECTION 199\u201d) DEDUCTION AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THE TAX ACT ALSO INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN INCOME WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF  EHG. THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI) PROVISIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE. UNDER GILTI, A PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION, OFFSET BY AVAILABLE FOREIGN  TAX CREDITS SUBJECT TO LIMITATION. FOR FISCAL 2019, WE DO NOT FORECAST ANY U.S. TAXATION OF GILTI.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019,  AFTER CONSIDERING THE LOWER FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 21.0%, AN ESTIMATED BLENDED STATE INCOME TAX RATE, THE ELIMINATION OF THE CODE SECTION 199 DEDUCTION, THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES AN OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BETWEEN 21% AND 23%, BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF ANY DISCRETE AND UNUSUAL TAX ITEMS.  INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\u2014NORTH AMERICA  THE COMPANY MONITORS INDUSTRY CONDITIONS IN THE  NORTH AMERICAN RV MARKET THROUGH THE USE OF MONTHLY WHOLESALE SHIPMENT DATA AS REPORTED BY THE RECREATION VEHICLE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (\u201cRVIA\u201d), WHICH IS TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  ONE-MONTH  LAG AND  REPRESENTS MANUFACTURERS\u2019 RV PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY TO DEALERS. IN ADDITION, WE MONITOR MONTHLY RETAIL SALES TRENDS AS REPORTED BY STAT SURVEYS, WHOSE DATA IS TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  MONTH-AND-A-HALF  LAG. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MONTHLY RV RETAIL SALES DATA IS IMPORTANT AS CONSUMER PURCHASES IMPACT FUTURE DEALER ORDERS AND ULTIMATELY OUR  PRODUCTION.  NORTH AMERICAN RV INDEPENDENT DEALER INVENTORY OF THOR PRODUCTS AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED 20.3% TO APPROXIMATELY  132,500 UNITS, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 166,200 UNITS AS OF APRIL 30, 2018. DURING THE REMAINDER OF OUR FISCAL 2019, WE EXPECT THE NORTH AMERICAN INDEPENDENT DEALER INVENTORY RATIONALIZATION WILL CONTINUE, BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE A RESUMPTION OF  GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS IN 2020.  THOR\u2019S NORTH AMERICAN RV BACKLOG AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED $593,422,  OR 29.6%, TO $1,409,727 COMPARED TO $2,003,149 AS OF APRIL 30, 2018, WITH THE DECREASE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CAPACITY EXPANSIONS SINCE THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH ALLOWS FOR QUICKER ORDER FULFILLMENT.  24  INDUSTRY WHOLESALE STATISTICS  KEY WHOLESALE STATISTICS FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY, AS REPORTED BY RVIA FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

RVIA NOTED THAT EXCEPT FOR THE PAST THREE  CALENDAR YEARS, TOTAL RV SHIPMENTS FOR 2019 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN IN ANY PRIOR YEAR SINCE 1973.  INDUSTRY RETAIL STATISTICS  WE BELIEVE THAT RETAIL DEMAND IS THE KEY TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY, AND THAT ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY WHOLESALE  SHIPMENTS WILL GENERALLY APPROXIMATE A  ONE-TO-ONE  REPLENISHMENT RATIO WITH RETAIL SALES AS DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED TO GENERALLY NORMALIZED LEVELS.

THIS INFORMATION IS  SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AND IS CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED, AND IS OFTEN IMPACTED BY DELAYS IN REPORTING BY VARIOUS STATES OR PROVINCES.  25  OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL SALES IS DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS FACED BY CONSUMERS SUCH AS THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, THE GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE INCOME OF CONSUMERS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CREDIT AVAILABILITY, THE HEALTH OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND CHANGES IN TAX RATES  AND FUEL PRICES. ASSUMING CONTINUED STABILITY OR IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AVAILABILITY OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE CREDIT, LOW INTEREST RATES WITH MODEST RATE INCREASES AND THE ABSENCE OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC FACTORS, WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE  LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY.  A POSITIVE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RV SEGMENT IS SUPPORTED BY  CONTINUED DEMOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. WHILE CONSUMERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 74 STILL ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY OF RV RETAIL SALES, THERE IS STRONG INTEREST AND GROWING RETAIL MOMENTUM WITH THE YOUNGER \u201cGENERATION X\u201d AND  \u201cMILLENNIALS\u201d SEGMENTS. NOT SURPRISINGLY, BEHAVIORAL ATTRIBUTES CONFIRM THESE GROUPS AS BEING MORE ACTIVE, TECH SAVVY, WELL RESEARCHED, OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, SEEKING NEW EXPERIENCES AND VERY FAMILY CENTRIC, SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO  CROSS-GENERATIONAL FAMILY ACTIVITIES LIKE RVING, CAMPING AND TIME SPENT OUTDOORS.  SINCE 2014, KAMPGROUNDS OF AMERICA (KOA) HAS MEASURED  AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 7 MILLION NEW CAMPER HOUSEHOLDS AND IN 2018 KOA PROJECTED A 45% RISE IN THE FREQUENCY OF CAMPING TRIPS AMONG ALL CAMPING FAMILIES; LARGELY DRIVEN BY MILLENNIALS, WITH 6 IN 10 HAVING TRIED A NEW CAMPING DESTINATION IN  2017. YOUNGER CONSUMERS ARE ALSO REDEFINING CULTURAL VIEWS ON \u201cVACATION\u201d AND OPTING INSTEAD FOR 50 TO 100 MILE GETAWAYS WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE TO HOME OR SCHOOL. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE YOUNGER CONSUMERS AND MILLENNIAL HOUSEHOLDS PLACE ON  FAMILY, QUALITY EXPERIENCES, TECHNOLOGY AND TIME, WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO PROVIDE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS WHICH DELIVER THE LIFESTYLE EXPERIENCES THAT COMPLEMENT MILLENNIAL EXPECTATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO YOUNGER AGE DEMOGRAPHICS, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND SALES TO A MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND GLOBAL CUSTOMER BASE THROUGH  LIFESTYLE, LIFESTAGE AND DATA-DRIVEN MARKETING. WE INTEND TO EXPAND UPON OUR RECENT MARKETING INITIATIVES THAT FOCUS ON DIVERSITY, WOMEN, FAMILIES, MILLENNIALS AND THE RV LIFESTYLE ACROSS SOCIAL, DIGITAL, WEB, ACQUISITION, MOBILE AND CONTENT  MARKETING. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING  BEST-IN-CLASS  MARKETING AND RESEARCH ASSETS TO OUR DEALERS, WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OUR END CONSUMERS WITH TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND  RV LIFESTYLE RESOURCES THROUGH OUR JOINT VENTURE, TH2.  ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RV BUSINESS INCLUDE THE COSTS OF  COMMODITIES, THE IMPACT OF ACTUAL OR THREATENED TARIFFS ON COMMODITY COSTS, AND THE LABOR USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN  RAW MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS WOULD IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OFFSET THOSE COST INCREASES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCT DECONTENTING, MATERIAL SOURCING STRATEGIES, EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OR RAISING THE SELLING  PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO OFFSET NET COST INCREASES OVER TIME.  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN CHASSIS SUPPLIERS RECENTLY. THE NORTH AMERICAN RECREATIONAL VEHICLE INDUSTRY HAS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SHORTAGES OF CHASSIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS,  INCLUDING COMPONENT SHORTAGES, PRODUCTION DELAYS AND WORK STOPPAGES AT THE CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS. THESE SHORTAGES HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR SALES AND EARNINGS IN THE PAST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF CHASSIS USED IN OUR NORTH  AMERICAN MOTORIZED RV PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY ADEQUATE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTION LEVELS, AND THAT AVAILABLE INVENTORY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN SUPPLY SCHEDULES IF THEY OCCUR.  INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\u2014EUROPE  THE COMPANY MONITORS RETAIL TRENDS IN THE EUROPEAN RV  MARKET AS REPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN CARAVAN FEDERATION (\u201cECF\u201d), WHOSE INDUSTRY DATA IS REPORTED TO THE PUBLIC QUARTERLY AND TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  ONE-TO-TWO  MONTH LAG. ADDITIONALLY, ON A MONTHLY BASIS THE COMPANY RECEIVES ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (\u201cOEM\u201d) SPECIFIC REPORTS FROM MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER COUNTRIES THAT MAKE UP THE ECF. AS THESE REPORTS ARE COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE ECF  MEMBER COUNTRIES, TIMING AND CONTENT MAY VARY, BUT TYPICALLY THE REPORTS ARE ISSUED ON A  ONE-TO-TWO  MONTH LAG AS WELL. WHILE MOST COUNTRIES PROVIDE  OEM-SPECIFIC  INFORMATION, THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH MAKES UP 29.6% AND 12.6% OF THE CARAVAN AND MOTORCARAVAN (INCLUDING CAMPERVANS) EUROPEAN MARKET, RESPECTIVELY, DOES NOT PROVIDE  OEM-SPECIFIC  INFORMATION. INDUSTRY WHOLESALE SHIPMENT DATA FOR THE EUROPEAN RV MARKET IS NOT AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EUROPEAN REPORTABLE SEGMENT SALES BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  MOTORCARAVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE CLASS A AND CLASS C MOTORIZED PRODUCTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET  CAMPERVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE CLASS B MOTORIZED PRODUCTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET, BUT ALSO INCLUDES URBAN CAMPERS  CARAVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND OTHER TOWABLE UNITS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET. FIFTH WHEEL UNITS ARE NOT SOLD IN THE EUROPEAN MARKET DUE TO THEIR GENERALLY LARGER  SIZE AND WEIGHT  OTHER \u2014  INCLUDES USED RECREATIONAL VEHICLE UNITS, PARTS AND CAMPING ACCESSORIES, REPAIR SERVICES, TENT TRAILERS, RENTAL SALES AND OTHER  26  WE BELIEVE OUR INDEPENDENT DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS OF EHG PRODUCTS IN EUROPE, WHILE ELEVATED IN  CERTAIN LOCATIONS, ARE GENERALLY APPROPRIATE FOR SEASONAL CONSUMER DEMAND IN EUROPE AND ARE PROGRESSING TOWARDS MORE NORMALIZED LEVELS. SEASONAL CONSUMER DEMAND IN EUROPE TYPICALLY ALIGNS WITH THE SEASONAL PATTERNS EXPERIENCED IN THE NORTH AMERICAN  MARKET. THOR\u2019S EUROPEAN RV BACKLOG AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $687,418.

IN ADDITION, DATA FROM THE ECF IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS AND IS CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED, AND IS OFTEN IMPACTED BY DELAYS IN REPORTING BY VARIOUS COUNTRIES.  THE EUROPEAN OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH IN RETAIL SALES DEPENDS UPON VARIOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.  END-CUSTOMER  DEMAND FOR RV VEHICLES DEPENDS  STRONGLY ON CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. FACTORS SUCH AS THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, PRIVATE CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENTS, GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE INCOME OF CONSUMERS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, THE HEALTH OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND CHANGES IN TAX RATES INFLUENCE  RETAIL SALES. ASSUMING CONTINUED STABILITY OR IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, LOW INTEREST RATES WITH MODEST RATE INCREASES AND THE ABSENCE OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC FACTORS, WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUED LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE EUROPEAN RV  INDUSTRY.  SEVERAL SOCIAL TRENDS SUPPORT THE POSITIVE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EUROPE. FIRST, THERE IS THE GROWING GROUP OF \u201cACTIVE  SENIORS\u201d (AGE 55 TO 75) WHO HAVE THE TIME, HEALTH AND WEALTH, COMBINED WITH THE DESIRE, TO EXPLORE COUNTRIES AND CULTURES. SECONDLY, THERE IS THE NEW, BUT GROWING, GROUP OF YOUNGER CUSTOMERS (AGE 35\u201445) WHO ARE DISCOVERING RVS AS A WAY TO  SUPPORT THEIR LIFESTYLE IN SEARCH OF INDEPENDENCE AND INDIVIDUALITY, AS WELL AS USING THE RV AS MULTI-PURPOSE VEHICLES TO ESCAPE URBAN LIFE AND EXPLORE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND NATURE.  OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS ADDRESS THE EUROPEAN MARKET WITH A FULL  LINE-UP  OF LEISURE VEHICLES INCLUDING SMALL  TOWABLE TENT TRAILERS AND TRAVEL TRAILERS, URBAN CAMPERS, CAMPERVANS AND  SMALL-TO-LARGE  MOTORHOMES. THE PRODUCT OFFERING IS NOT LIMITED TO VEHICLES ONLY, BUT ALSO  INCLUDES ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES INCLUDING RENTAL.  27  IN ADDITION TO ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, EHG ADDRESSES ITS CONSUMERS THROUGH A SOPHISTICATED BRAND  MANAGEMENT APPROACH, BASED ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ACCORDING TO TARGET GROUP, CORE VALUES AND EMOTIONS. WITH THE HELP OF DATA-BASED AND DIGITAL MARKETING, EHG INTENDS TO EXPAND ITS CUSTOMER REACH, IN PARTICULAR IN NEW AND YOUNGER CONSUMER SEGMENTS.  ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS AFFECTING OUR EUROPEAN RV BUSINESS INCLUDE THE COSTS OF COMMODITIES AND THE LABOR USED IN THE  MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS WOULD IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OFFSET THOSE  COST INCREASES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCT DECONTENTING, MATERIAL SOURCING STRATEGIES, EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OR RAISING THE SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS.  WE BELIEVE THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND PRIVATE CONSUMPTION IN GENERAL IS POSITIVE, WITH DIFFERENCES FOR EACH COUNTRY,  BUT COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING GLOBAL TRADE BARRIERS AND RELATED TAX TARIFFS, AS WELL AS BY EUROPEAN POLITICAL DECISIONS LIKE BREXIT, OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW EMISSION STANDARDS.  IN OUR EUROPEAN MARKET, EHG HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SIGNIFICANT, UNUSUAL SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS FROM CHASSIS SUPPLIERS RECENTLY. THE EUROPEAN  RECREATIONAL VEHICLE INDUSTRY HAS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SHORTAGES OF CHASSIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING INTRODUCTION OF NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS, COMPONENT SHORTAGES AND PRODUCTION DELAYS AT THE CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE THAT  THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF CHASSIS USED IN THE EUROPEAN MOTORIZED RV PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY ADEQUATE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTION LEVELS, AND THAT AVAILABLE INVENTORY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN SUPPLY SCHEDULES IF THEY OCCUR. HOWEVER,  UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO CHANGING EMISSION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE EURO 6D STANDARD WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE FROM JANUARY 2020 FOR NEW MODELS AND FROM JANUARY 2021 ON ALL NEW VEHICLES, MAY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OF CHASSIS USED IN OUR PRODUCTION OF  CERTAIN EUROPEAN MOTORIZED RVS AND COULD ALSO IMPACT CONSUMER BUYING PATTERNS.  28  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  CHANGE  AMOUNT%  CHANGE  NET SALES.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 INCREASED $11,377 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $12,784 DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEALER NETWORK AMORTIZATION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS TOTALED $13,363 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CHANGES IN NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS  AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES ARE ADDRESSED BELOW AND IN THE SEGMENT REPORTING THAT FOLLOWS.  CORPORATE COSTS INCLUDED IN SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $7,531 TO $19,898 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $12,367 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF 60.9%. THIS INCREASE INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $4,909, WHICH RELATES TO THE EQUAL AND OFFSETTING INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME RELATED TO THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN ASSETS AS NOTED BELOW. LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND MARKETING COSTS ALSO INCREASED BY $1,674. COSTS RELATED TO  THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES CARRIED AT CORPORATE ALSO INCREASED $669. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $1,183 IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION IN CORRELATION WITH THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME  TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WERE $13,363 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND CONSIST OF  COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG. THIS TOTAL INCLUDES COSTS OF $16,293, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF BANK FEES, PROFESSIONAL AND ADVISORY INTEGRATION FEES, AND THE  WRITE-OFF  OF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT  FEES OF $3,794 RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS ASSET-BASED FACILITY THAT WAS TERMINATED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEW FINANCING OBTAINED WITH THE EHG ACQUISITION. THESE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN OF $2,930  FROM THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CORPORATE INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE WAS $31,037 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,741 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THIS  INCREASE IN NET EXPENSE OF $28,296 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND FEES OF $30,910 RESULTING FROM THE NEW DEBT FACILITIES RELATED TO THE EHG ACQUISITION, AND ALSO AN INCREASE OF $1,886 IN THE OPERATING LOSSES RECORDED RELATED  TO THE TH2 JOINT VENTURE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN ASSETS DUE TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME RESULTING IN NET INCOME OF $3,362 IN THE  CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD AS COMPARED TO NET EXPENSE OF $1,547 IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, A NET INCREASE IN INCOME OF $4,909.  THE OVERALL  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS 24.3% COMPARED WITH 25.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY  CERTAIN FOREIGN RATE DIFFERENCES AS A RESULT OF THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES FOR BOTH THREE-MONTH PERIODS WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE ALONG WITH THE OTHER TAX IMPACTS AS A  RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, AS NOTED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RESULTED IN A GAIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 UPON CLOSING OF THE  EHG ACQUISITION.

COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASES IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND OTHER PRODUCT LINES OF 4.8% AND THE FIFTH WHEEL PRODUCT  LINES OF 6.8% WERE BOTH PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.

THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE, IN SPITE OF INCREASED SALES DISCOUNTS, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES AND  FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $7,942 WITH THE DECREASE IN SALES, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES FROM 5.5% TO 6.5%, AS THE DECREASED SALES RESULTED IN  HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 29.1%  DECREASE IN UNIT SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, WHILE THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE.  31  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $66,032, OR 5.3% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET  SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $79,598, OR 4.9% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE $13,566 DECREASE WAS DECREASED NORTH AMERICAN  TOWABLES NET SALES AND NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $13,546. SALES-RELATED TRAVEL, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS ALSO DECREASED $1,029. THESE  DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1,733 IN LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND RELATED SETTLEMENT COSTS. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE INCREASED LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND SETTLEMENT COSTS NOTED ABOVE COMBINED WITH THE LOWER SALES VOLUME.

COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS A PRODUCT LINE OF 6.8% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE CONCENTRATION OF  SALES TOWARD THE GENERALLY LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE DIESEL UNITS FROM THE MORE MODESTLY-PRICED GAS UNITS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE 27.9% DECREASE IN UNIT SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, AND THE  DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE AND THE LOWER NET SALES.

FOLLOWING ITS FEBRUARY 1, 2019 ACQUISITION DATE, EHG  ACCOUNTED FOR NET SALES OF $767,509. THESE ADDITIONAL NET SALES DURING THE PERIOD WERE OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET SALES FROM NORTH AMERICA OF $1,664,964, OR 26.3%, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED $278,976, OR 30.3%, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

CONSOLIDATED GROSS PROFIT WAS 11.5% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 14.3% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, WITH THE CHANGE IMPACTED BY THE ADDITION OF EHG\u2019S GROSS  PROFIT PERCENTAGE OF 7.0%.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED $6,055,  OR 1.6%, COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF EHG\u2019S TOTAL OF $67,761 FOR THE PERIOD. AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 INCREASED $9,140 COMPARED  TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO EHG\u2019S TOTAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $12,784, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEALER NETWORK AMORTIZATION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS TOTALED $112,511  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $74,913, AS COMPARED TO $508,681 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $433,768, OR 85.3%.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CHANGES IN NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS  AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES ARE ADDRESSED BELOW AND IN THE SEGMENT REPORTING THAT FOLLOWS.  CORPORATE COSTS INCLUDED IN SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $7,682 TO $43,084 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $50,766 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF 15.1%. THIS DECREASE INCLUDES A DECREASE IN INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION OF $5,638 IN CORRELATION WITH THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. IN ADDITION, COSTS RECORDED AT CORPORATE RELATED TO OUR STANDBY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ON DEALER INVENTORY DECREASED $3,050 DUE  TO LOWER DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS.  ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WERE $112,511 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND INCLUDE  COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE CORPORATE COSTS INCLUDED A  NON-CASH  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS OF $70,777,  WITH THE REMAINING $41,734 CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF BANK FEES, TICKING FEES, LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND ADVISORY FEES RELATED TO FINANCIAL DUE DILIGENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, REGULATORY REVIEW COSTS AND THE  WRITE-OFF  OF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT FEES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS ASSET-BASED FACILITY.  CORPORATE INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE WAS $34,700 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $662 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE  IN NET EXPENSE OF $34,038 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND FEES OF $29,895 RESULTING FROM THE NEW DEBT FACILITIES RELATED TO THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 ALSO INCLUDES NINE MONTHS OF  OPERATING LOSSES TOTALING $5,984 RELATED TO THE TH2 JOINT VENTURE AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $399 FOR THE ONE MONTH INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE,  AN INCREASE OF $5,585. THESE INCREASES IN EXPENSE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST INCOME OF $2,705 ON AVERAGE HIGHER CASH BALANCES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS 46.6% COMPARED WITH 32.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BETWEEN THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IS THE  NON-DEDUCTIBLE  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS NOTED IN NOTE 5 TO  THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE THREE MONTHS OF EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE INCOME TAX RATES FOR BOTH NINE-MONTH PERIODS WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE  INCOME TAX RATE ALONG WITH THE OTHER TAX IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018 INCLUDED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM  THE REVALUATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE LOWER TAX RATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  35  SEGMENT REPORTING  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLE RECREATIONAL VEHICLES  ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASES IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND OTHER PRODUCT LINES OF 4.9% AND THE FIFTH WHEEL PRODUCT  LINES OF 4.0% WERE BOTH PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

THE CHANGES IN MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS COMPRISED $908,958 OF THE $937,913 DECREASE IN COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS AS A COMBINED PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES INCREASED TO 80.7% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 79.3% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018. THIS INCREASE IN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE TO NET SALES, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DISCOUNTS AND SALES INCENTIVES, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DECREASES THE NET SALES PRICE  PER UNIT AND THEREFORE INCREASES THE UNIT MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE. IN ADDITION, MATERIAL COST INCREASES EXCEEDED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE WARRANTY COST PERCENTAGE TO NET SALES ALSO  INCREASED. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $28,955 WITH THE DECREASE IN SALES, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES FROM 5.6% TO 6.7%, AS THE DECREASED SALES RESULTED IN HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 31.4% DECREASE IN UNIT SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, WHILE  THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE.  36  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $187,547, OR 5.5% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES  NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $236,725, OR 5.1% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE $49,178 DECREASE WAS DECREASED NORTH AMERICAN  TOWABLES NET SALES AND NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $49,698. SALES-RELATED TRAVEL, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS ALSO DECREASED $4,167, WHILE  LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND RELATED SETTLEMENT COSTS INCREASED $5,508.

COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS A PRODUCT LINE OF 10.5% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE CONCENTRATION OF  SALES TOWARD THE GENERALLY LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE DIESEL UNITS FROM THE MORE MODESTLY-PRICED GAS UNITS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS C PRODUCT LINE OF 4.8% WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE NET IMPACT OF PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS B PRODUCT LINE OF 4.5% IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW, HIGHER-PRICED MODEL AND MORE  OPTION CONTENT PER UNIT IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD.  37  COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD DECREASED $399,324 TO $1,133,956, OR 89.9% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $1,533,280, OR 88.9% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE 34.3% DECREASE IN UNIT  SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, AND THE DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF MOTORIZED NET SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $60,070, OR 4.8% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $75,828, OR 4.4% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE $15,758 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED MOTORIZED NET SALES AND MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $15,186.  MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $64,102, OR 5.1% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO  $114,032, OR 6.6% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ THIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, AS WELL AS OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019 AS FILED WITH THE SEC.  OVERVIEW OF OUR BUSINESS  SHOE CARNIVAL, INC. IS ONE OF THE NATION\u2019S LARGEST FAMILY FOOTWEAR RETAILERS, PROVIDING THE CONVENIENCE OF SHOPPING AT ANY OF OUR STORE LOCATIONS OR ONLINE AT SHOECARNIVAL.COM.  OUR STORES COMBINE COMPETITIVE PRICING WITH A FUN AND PROMOTIONAL, IN-STORE MARKETING EFFORT THAT ENCOURAGES CUSTOMER PARTICIPATION AND INJECTS FUN AND SURPRISE INTO EVERY SHOPPING EXPERIENCE.  WE BELIEVE THIS FUN AND PROMOTIONAL ATMOSPHERE RESULTS IN VARIOUS COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES, INCLUDING INCREASED MULTIPLE UNIT SALES; THE BUILDING OF A LOYAL, REPEAT CUSTOMER BASE; THE CREATION OF WORD-OF-MOUTH ADVERTISING; AND ENHANCED SELL-THROUGH OF IN-SEASON GOODS.  A SIMILAR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE IS REFLECTED IN OUR E-COMMERCE SITE THROUGH SPECIAL PROMOTIONS AND LIMITED TIME SALES, ALONG WITH RELEVANT PRODUCT STORIES FEATURED ON OUR HOME PAGE.  OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO BE THE DESTINATION RETAILER-OF-CHOICE FOR A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMERS SEEKING VALUE-PRICED, CURRENT SEASON NAME BRAND AND PRIVATE LABEL FOOTWEAR.  OUR PRODUCT ASSORTMENT INCLUDES DRESS AND CASUAL SHOES, SANDALS, BOOTS AND A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF ATHLETIC SHOES FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY IN FOUR GENERAL CATEGORIES - WOMEN\u2019S, MEN\u2019S, CHILDREN\u2019S AND ATHLETICS.

OUR E-COMMERCE SITE OFFERS CUSTOMERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CHOOSE FROM A LARGE SELECTION OF PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE SAME CATEGORIES OF FOOTWEAR WITH A DEPTH OF SIZES AND COLORS THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN SOME OF OUR SMALLER STORES AND INTRODUCES OUR CONCEPT TO CONSUMERS WHO ARE NEW TO SHOE CARNIVAL IN BOTH EXISTING AND NEW MARKETS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IT IS NECESSARY FOR US TO INCLUDE CERTAIN JUDGMENTS IN OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE JUDGMENTS INVOLVE ESTIMATES BASED IN PART ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND INCORPORATE THE IMPACT OF THE CURRENT GENERAL ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND COMPANY-SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES. HOWEVER, BECAUSE FUTURE EVENTS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN, OUR ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES. OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS INCLUDE THOSE WITH RESPECT TO MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES,  15  VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INSURANCE RESERVES  , LEASES  AND INCOME TAXES  .  OTHER THAN OUR NEW ACCOUNTING POLICY ON LEASES, WHICH WE ADOPTED IN THE FI  RST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  AND IS  DISCUSSED IN NOTE  7  TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q,  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MORE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT  ARE DISCUSSED IN OUR A  NNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  FEBRUARY 2, 2019.

THEREFORE, STORES OPENED OR CLOSED DURING THE PERIODS INDICATED ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES. WE INCLUDE E-COMMERCE SALES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES. DUE TO OUR MULTI-CHANNEL RETAILER STRATEGY, WE VIEW E-COMMERCE SALES AS AN EXTENSION OF OUR PHYSICAL STORES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.  THIRTEEN WEEKS  ENDED MAY 4,  2019  THIRTEEN WEEKS  ENDED MAY 5,  2018  NET SALES  100.0%  100.0%  COST OF SALES (INCLUDING BUYING, DISTRIBUTION AND  OCCUPANCY COSTS)  70.4  70.0  GROSS PROFIT  29.6  30.0  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  23.4  23.3  OPERATING INCOME  6.2  6.7  INTEREST INCOME, NET  (0.1  )  0.0  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  0.8  1.7  NET INCOME  5.5%  5.0%  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY FOR FIRST QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019  LIKE MANY RETAILERS, OUR FIRST QUARTER SALES REPRESENT A SHIFT IN SEASONAL FOOTWEAR FROM COLD WEATHER BOOTS TO MORE WARM WEATHER CATEGORIES, SUCH AS SANDALS.  IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND SIZE OF TAX REFUNDS CAN ALSO IMPACT OUR RATE OF SALES GROWTH IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  THIS SPRING, WE EXPERIENCED A COLD AND WET START TO THE FIRST QUARTER.  THIS UNSEASONABLE WEATHER, ALONG WITH A DELAY IN TAX REFUNDS, RESULTED IN A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASE IN FEBRUARY.  AS THE WEATHER BECAME MORE SEASONABLE LATER IN THE QUARTER AND AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVED THEIR TAX REFUNDS, OUR CUSTOMERS REACTED POSITIVELY TO OUR SPRING ASSORTMENT, AND WE POSTED A COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASE OF 3.6% FOR THE COMBINED MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL.  FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 0.2%.  OUR MERCHANTS EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED SEASONAL INVENTORY DURING THE QUARTER, WHICH ALLOWED US TO KEEP MERCHANDISE MARGINS RELATIVELY FLAT DESPITE BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE IN ATHLETICS DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO THE SLOW START IN FEBRUARY.  HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF SOME KEY INITIATIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET SALES DECREASED $3.6 MILLION, OR 1.4%, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  WE EXPERIENCED A MID-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN STORE TRAFFIC AND DECREASES IN AVERAGE SALES PER TRANSACTION AND AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019. WE DID, HOWEVER, EXPERIENCE LOW-SINGLE DIGIT INCREASES IN OUR CONVERSION RATE AND AVERAGE UNITS PER TRANSACTION DURING THE QUARTER.  \u2022  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER DECREASED 0.4% TO 29.6% COMPARED TO 30.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  WHILE OUR MERCHANDISE MARGIN INCREASED 0.1%, OUR BUYING, DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 0.5% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  16  \u2022  WE REPURCHASED  411,168  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019  AT A TOTAL COST OF $14  .0 MILLION UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $21.6  MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVA  LENTS. WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH NO  OUTSTANDING  DEBT.  \u2022  WE HAD NO STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSED TWO STORES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, ENDING THE QUARTER WITH 395 STORES.  \u2022  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (\u201cCRM\u201d) PROGRAM AND EXPECT OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CRM TO BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CRM WILL BE A SALES DRIVER AND THAT THE DATA RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF OUR CRM PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER MERCHANDISE OUR STORES, MARKET TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND AID IN IDENTIFYING NEW STORE OPPORTUNITIES.  \u2022  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE KEY PROCESSES UNDERLYING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, ORDER MANAGEMENT AND FULFILLMENT COMPETENCIES IN ORDER TO POSITION OURSELVES FOR OUR PLANNED GROWTH OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING THESE PROCESSES THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE AND ANALYTICAL TOOLS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED $3.6 MILLION TO $253.8 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, A 1.4% DECREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S FIRST QUARTER NET SALES OF $257.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $3.9 MILLION FROM THE 16 STORES CLOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018 AND A $639,000 DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $883,000 INCREASE IN SALES FROM THE THREE NEW STORES OPENED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED TO $75.1 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO GROSS PROFIT OF $77.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN NET SALES AND AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY COSTS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 29.6% COMPARED TO 30.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  WHILE OUR MERCHANDISE MARGIN INCREASED 0.1%, OUR BUYING, DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCREASED 0.5% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER RESULTING FROM HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE PASSED THROUGH FROM LANDLORDS AND THE DELEVERAGING EFFECT OF LOWER SALES IN THE QUARTER.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $0.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $59.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $60.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, THESE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 23.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM 23.3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE OVERALL DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.0 MILLION REDUCTION IN EXPENSE FOR STORES THAT HAVE CLOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018 AND DECREASES IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND DEPRECIATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN EARNINGS ON OUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN AND WAGES.  THERE WERE NO PREOPENING EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OR THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THERE WERE NO STORE OPENINGS IN EITHER PERIOD.  NET STORE CLOSING COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OR DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  TWO STORES WERE CLOSED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THREE STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS 12.8% AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  THE REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE QUARTER WAS THE RESULT OF A $1.9 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE VESTING OF EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IS BASED ON THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND IS ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR QUARTERLY EVENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. WE BELIEVE THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS, AS THEY ARISE, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY INVENTORY PURCHASES, STORE INITIATIVES, POTENTIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE FINANCING OF CAPITAL PROJECTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN NEW SYSTEMS, AND VARIOUS OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS.  17  CASH FLOW - OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $9.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $8.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 5, 2018 DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED TO $201.6 MILLION AT MAY 4, 2019 FROM $260.8 MILLION AT MAY 5, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $13.7 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND $47.1 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FOR THE CURRENT PORTION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES. THE CURRENT RATIO WAS 2.7 AS OF MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO 4.0 AT MAY 5, 2018.  CASH FLOW - INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE EXPENDED $9.2 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE REMAINDER WAS FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE EXPENDED $1.0 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW - FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY FOR CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK CAN BE EITHER ACQUIRED AS PART OF A PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASE PROGRAM OR WITHHELD BY US IN CONNECTION WITH EMPLOYEE PAYROLL TAX WITHHOLDING UPON THE VESTING OF EQUITY AWARDS. OUR CASH INFLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REPRESENT PURCHASES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $26.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $20.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $10.7 MILLION INCREASE FOR SHARES WITHHELD UPON THE VESTING OF EQUITY AWARDS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.0 MILLION DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING ACTUAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $22 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION TO BE USED FOR A NEW STORE, RELOCATIONS AND REMODELS, AND $7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS USED TO PURCHASE OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES.  LEASE INCENTIVES TO BE RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING ACTUAL AMOUNTS RECEIVED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION TO $2 MILLION.  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CASH REQUIRED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STORE OPERATIONS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES OPENED AND RELOCATED, THE AMOUNT OF LEASE INCENTIVES, IF ANY, RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS AND THE NUMBER OF STORES REMODELED.  STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS  INCREASING MARKET PENETRATION BY OPENING NEW STORES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, AND OUR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE ON GENERATING POSITIVE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR OUR STORE PORTFOLIO.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO OPEN ONE NEW STORE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  AS WE LEVERAGE CUSTOMER DATA FROM OUR CRM PROGRAM, AND AS MORE ATTRACTIVE REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE GROWTH ACROSS LARGE, MID-SIZE AND SMALLER MARKETS IN FISCAL 2020.  THE OPENING OF NEW STORES IS DEPENDENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS, THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING IN AREAS WE TARGET FOR EXPANSION.  WE UTILIZE A FORMAL REVIEW PROCESS IN OUR EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL NEW STORE SITES AS WELL AS FOR DECISIONS SURROUNDING LEASES ON EXISTING STORE LOCATIONS.  OUR APPROACH IS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE.  WE LOOK TO CONTINUALLY ENHANCE THIS PROCESS WITH TOOLS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE SOFTWARE USED FOR PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS THAT AID IN IDENTIFYING VIABLE LOCATIONS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL STORE CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE LEARN ABOUT CUSTOMERS AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR CRM PROGRAM.  WE CLOSED TWO STORES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND EXPECT TO CLOSE A TOTAL OF SEVEN TO 10 STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE ANALYZED OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF STORES, WITH A CONCENTRATION ON UNDERPERFORMING STORES, TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH INCREASING OPERATING INCOME. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS UNDERPERFORMING STORES THAT PRODUCE LOW OR NEGATIVE CONTRIBUTION AND EITHER RENEGOTIATE LEASE TERMS, RELOCATE OR CLOSE THE STORES.  EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD REDUCE OUR OVERALL NET SALES VOLUME, WE BELIEVE THIS STRATEGY WILL REALIZE LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING INCOME AND DILUTED  18  EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DEPENDING UPON THE RESULTS OF LEASE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CERTAIN LANDLORDS OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES, WE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF STORE CLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE TIMING AND ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EXPENS  E RECORDED IN CLOSING A STORE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING, IN PART, ON THE PERIOD IN WHICH MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO A CLOSING PLAN, THE REMAINING BASIS IN THE FIXED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AT CLOSING AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY LEASE BUYOUT.  WE WILL CONTINUE  TO REVIEW OUR STORE PORTFOLIO BASED ON OUR VIEW OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE MARKETPLACE.  DIVIDENDS  ON MARCH 21, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PAYMENT OF OUR FIRST QUARTER CASH DIVIDEND TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE DIVIDEND OF $0.08 PER SHARE WAS PAID ON APRIL 26, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 8, 2019.  THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) PERMITS THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AS LONG AS NO DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BOTH IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CASH DIVIDENDS, AND THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS FOR A FISCAL YEAR DO NOT EXCEED $10.0 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON MARCH 27, 2017 WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT OF OUR CURRENT UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE BY FIVE YEARS TO MARCH 27, 2022 AND TO RENEGOTIATE CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED,  CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FOR UP TO $50.0 MILLION IN CASH ADVANCES AND COMMERCIAL AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WITH BORROWING LIMITS BASED ON ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, WHICH AMOUNT MAY BE INCREASED FROM TIME TO TIME BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ANY LENDER, IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS COVENANTS WHICH STIPULATE:  (1) TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WILL NOT FALL BELOW $250.0 MILLION AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER; (2) THE RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT PLUS THREE TIMES RENT TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) PLUS RENT WILL NOT EXCEED 2.5 TO 1.0; (3) THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS FOR A FISCAL YEAR WILL NOT EXCEED $10.0 MILLION; AND (4) DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF REDEMPTIONS OF EQUITY INTERESTS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) CAN BE MADE SOLELY WITH CASH ON HAND SO LONG AS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS THERE ARE NO REVOLVING LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  SHOULD A DEFAULT CONDITION BE REPORTED, THE LENDERS MAY PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS AND CALL ALL LOANS AND ACCRUED INTEREST AT THEIR DISCRETION.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST, AT OUR OPTION, AT (1) THE AGENT BANK\u2019S PRIME RATE AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PLUS 1%, WITH THE PRIME RATE DEFINED AS THE GREATER OF (A) THE FEDERAL FUND RATE PLUS 0.50% OR (B) THE INTEREST RATE ANNOUNCED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE AGENT BANK AS ITS \u201cPRIME RATE\u201d OR (2) LIBOR PLUS 1.25% TO 2.50%, DEPENDING ON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.  A COMMITMENT FEE IS CHARGED AT 0.20% TO 0.35% PER ANNUM, DEPENDING ON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE BANK GROUP\u2019S COMMITMENT.  THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING WERE $1.2 MILLION AT MAY 4, 2019.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, $48.8 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE TO US FOR ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON DECEMBER 13, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019. THE PURCHASES MAY BE MADE IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE AMENDED, SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND DOES NOT COMMIT US TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE HAVE FUNDED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FUND, THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FROM CASH ON HAND, AND ANY SHARES ACQUIRED WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THE ACTUAL NUMBER AND VALUE OF THE SHARES TO BE PURCHASED WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STOCK PRICE AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED 411,168 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $14.0 MILLION UNDER THE NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE AMOUNT THAT REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT MAY 4, 2019 WAS $36.0 MILLION.  SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS  OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE FLUCTUATED, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SEASONAL VARIANCES AND THE TIMING OF SALES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND CLOSING UNDERPERFORMING STORES.  NON-CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SUCH AS ADVERTISING AND PAYROLL INCURRED PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF A NEW STORE, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.  THE TIMING AND ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EXPENSE RECORDED IN CLOSING AN INDIVIDUAL STORE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING, IN PART, ON THE PERIOD IN WHICH MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO A CLOSING PLAN, THE REMAINING BASIS IN THE FIXED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AT CLOSING AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY LEASE BUYOUT.  THEREFORE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ANY QUARTER IN WHICH WE INCUR PRE-OPENING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE OPENING OF NEW STORES OR INCUR STORE CLOSING COSTS RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF EXISTING STORES.  19  WE HAVE THREE DISTINCT PEAK SELLING PERIODS: EASTER, BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND CHRISTMAS.  TO PREPARE FOR OUR PEAK SHOPPING SEASONS, WE MUST ORDER AND KEEP IN STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MERCHANDISE THAN WE WOULD CARRY DURING OTHER PARTS OF THE YEAR.  ANY U  NANTICIPATED DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DURING THESE PEAK SHOPPING SEASONS COULD REQUIRE US TO SELL EXCESS INVENTORY AT A SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWN, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.  OUR OPERAT  ING RESULTS DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY UPON THE SALES GENERATED DURING THESE PERIODS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "SHOE CARNIVAL INC", "CIK": 895447, "Date": "2019-06-11T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SCVL", "Name": "Shoe Carnival Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 5661.0, "Business": "IN", "Incorporated": "IN", "IRS": 351736614.0, "key": "20190611SCVL", "labelr1": -3.4103827207275565, "labelr2": 4.276186739897999, "labelr3": -0.037622272385244585, "labelr4": 2.4840045163718485, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.55520874, "prof1": 0.44479123, "return1&2": 0.9898836164714604, "return1&2&3": 0.990256033181946, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9656580285940616, "return2": 0.9572381326010201, "return1": 1.0341038272072756, "return3": 1.0003762227238524, "return4": 0.9751599548362816, "1_day_return": -3.4103827207275565, "cumulative_return1": 2.966219601055267, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.6436298894577497, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.029849110713086, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 5.1491231347800115, "indexx": 1284, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9914282222343173, "cumreturn1b": 1.0822557389902743, "cumreturndow": 1.0493323396007523, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0477462255735386}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1287, "level_0": 1317, "index": 85695, "text": "ITEM 2.

OUR SOLUTIONS FOR THE ADAPTIVE NETWORK CREATE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, ENABLING THEM TO INTRODUCE NEW REVENUE-GENERATING SERVICES, REDUCE COSTS AND MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.  REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS.  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH ACCELERATED AS WE BENEFITED MEANINGFULLY FROM STRONG NETWORK OPERATOR DEMAND FOR CAPACITY, FAVORABLE INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY. OUR STRATEGY HAS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION LEADERSHIP, THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER BASE, AND MARKET SHARE CAPTURE, PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONALLY. FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , OUR REVENUE GREW FROM  $1.38 BILLION  TO  $1.64 BILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  19%  , AND OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS GREW FROM  $48.8 MILLION  TO  $128.3 MILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  163%  . OUR RESULTS CAN FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THESE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH RATES WILL BE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM OUR EFFORTS TO PUSH THE PACE OF INNOVATION IN OUR MARKETS AND PROVIDE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS. KEEPING PACE WITH THE MARKET\u2019S DEMANDS FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT CAPACITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE INVESTED  $266.6 MILLION  IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  13%  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND INNOVATION EXECUTION ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS AND HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT REMAINING COMPETITIVE IN THE GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL DEPENDS UPON OUR CONTINUED INNOVATION.  WE CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR BUSINESS AND, IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , WE BENEFITED FROM REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS A DIVERSE SET OF GEOGRAPHIES, PRODUCT SOLUTIONS AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , WE GREW REVENUE IN EACH OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, WITH A DIVERSE SET OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE GREW REVENUE WITH OUR LARGEST SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, AND WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR OVERALL GROWTH, ARE INCLUDED AMONG OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS BY REVENUE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  . WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE DYNAMIC INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND TO BETTER WITHSTAND POTENTIAL SLOWDOWNS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FROM PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, CUSTOMERS OR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS.  OUR REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM MARKET SHARE GAINS AND OUR CONTINUED GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY FOCUSED ON GENERATING NEW CUSTOMER WINS AND DISPLACING INCUMBENT COMPETITORS IN KEY ACCOUNTS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND TO AGGRESSIVELY CAPTURE ADDITIONAL MARKET SHARE FROM COMPETITORS, PARTICULARLY WITH COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS INTERNATIONALLY. OUR REVENUE GROWTH, IN PART, REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF THIS STRATEGY, WHICH HAS YIELDED REVENUE GROWTH WITH ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (\u201cEMEA\u201d) AND ASIA PACIFIC AND INDIA (\u201cAPAC\u201d).

SEE NOTE  3  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT.  QUARTER ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  AS OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE ADOPTED ASC 606 USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. SEE NOTES  2  AND  3  TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS REPORT FOR THE IMPACT OF THIS ADOPTION ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  REVENUE  DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , APPROXIMATELY  19.1%  OF OUR REVENUE WAS NON-U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED, INCLUDING SALES IN EUROS, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLARS, BRAZILIAN REAIS, BRITISH POUNDS AND INDIAN RUPEE. DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2018  , FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THESE CURRENCIES AND THE U.S. DOLLAR FLUCTUATED. CONSEQUENTLY, OUR REVENUE REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS SLIGHTLY DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $19.8 MILLION  , OR  2.2%  , AS COMPARED TO THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2018  , DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY  34  OFFSET BY A SALES DECREASE OF $27.0 MILLION OF OUR 5410/5430 RECONFIGURABLE SWITCHING SYSTEMS. THE SALES INCREASE FROM OUR 6500 PACKET-OPTICAL PLATFORM IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES TO AT&T AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS, ENTERPRISE CUSTOMERS AND WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS. WAVESERVER STACKABLE INTERCONNECT SYSTEM SALES REFLECT INCREASED SALES TO WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS, WHICH REPRESENT A GROWING PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS AS WE CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY.  \u25e6  PACKET NETWORKING SALES INCREASED, PRIMARILY REFLECTING $17.0 MILLION IN INITIAL SALES OF OUR 6500 PACKET TRANSPORT SYSTEM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES DECREASES OF $3.5 MILLION OF OUR 8700 PACKETWAVE PLATFORM AND $2.9 MILLION OF OUR 3000 AND 5000 FAMILIES OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND AGGREGATION SWITCHES, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED SALES TO COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS.  \u2022  SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE-RELATED SERVICES  SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  , PRIMARILY  REFLECTING A SALES INCREASE OF  $10.1 MILLION  OF OUR BLUE PLANET AUTOMATION SOFTWARE AND SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SALES DECREASE OF  $1.2 MILLION  OF OUR PLATFORM SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN OUR BLUE PLANET AUTOMATION SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INCLUDES SALES OF $2.0 MILLION AND $3.9 MILLION RELATED TO THE PACKET DESIGN AND DONRIVER BUSINESSES ACQUIRED DURING FISCAL 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND A $2.4 MILLION INCREASE IN SALES OF OUR BLUE PLANET MANAGEMENT AND ORCHESTRATION (NFV MANO) SOFTWARE.  \u2022  GLOBAL SERVICES  SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  , PRIMARILY REFLECTING SALES INCREASES OF  $13.1 MILLION  OF OUR INSTALLATION AND DEPLOYMENT SERVICES AND  $7.9 MILLION  OF OUR MAINTENANCE SUPPORT AND TRAINING SERVICES.  OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ENGAGE IN BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS ACROSS FOUR GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS: NORTH AMERICA; EUROPE, MIDDLE EMEA; CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA (\u201cCALA\u201d); AND APAC. RESULTS FOR NORTH AMERICA INCLUDE ONLY ACTIVITIES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS OUR GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF REVENUE PRINCIPALLY BASED ON THE RELEVANT LOCATION FOR OUR DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS AND PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. OUR REVENUE, WHEN CONSIDERED BY GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR LARGE NETWORK PROJECTS, PARTICULARLY OUTSIDE OF NORTH AMERICA, CAN RESULT IN LARGE VARIATIONS IN GEOGRAPHIC REVENUE RESULTS IN ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER. THE INCREASE IN OUR CALA REGION FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES IN BRAZIL, ARGENTINA AND CHILE. THE DECREASE IN OUR APAC REGION FOR THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY DECREASED SALES IN INDIA, WHICH HAD BEEN A KEY CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN RECENT PERIODS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES IN JAPAN AND CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY TO CAPTURE NEW MARKET SHARE WITH COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE REGION.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF HIGHLIGHTS DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019.  \u2022  OUR NET SALES TOTALED $55,122, REFLECTING A 1.1% INCREASE COMPARED TO PRIOR YEAR NET SALES OF $54,514.  \u2022  OUR WHOLESALE NET SALES DECREASED 4.0% TO $27,355 AND OUR DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER NET SALES INCREASED 6.7% TO $27,767. COMPARABLE SALES, INCLUDING E-COMMERCE, INCREASED 1.1% COMPARED TO LAST YEAR.  \u2022  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $34,015, AN INCREASE OF $4,115 OR 13.8% COMPARED TO $29,900 IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  NET LOSS FOR THE QUARTER WAS $6,976, OR $0.60 PER SHARE, COMPARED TO $5,637, OR $0.49 PER SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  \u2022  WE OPENED ONE NEW RETAIL STORE AND CLOSED ONE RETAIL STORE DURING THE QUARTER.  \u2022  AS OF  MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $45,606 OF TOTAL DEBT PRINCIPAL OUTSTANDING, COMPRISED OF $26,812 OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND $18,794 OUTSTANDING ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, AS WELL AS $147 OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.  19  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS, FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, OUR OPERATING RESULTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, AS WELL AS LOSS PER SHARE DATA.

AS A RESULT OF OUR OMNI-CHANNEL SALES AND INVENTORY STRATEGY, AS WELL AS CROSS-CHANNEL CUSTOMER SHOPPING PATTERNS, THERE IS LESS DISTINCTION BETWEEN OUR BRICK-AND-MORTAR RETAIL STORES AND OUR E-COMMERCE ONLINE STORE AND WE BELIEVE THE INCLUSION OF E-COMMERCE SALES IN OUR COMPARABLE SALES METRIC IS A MORE MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATION OF THESE RESULTS AND PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF OUR YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARABLE SALES METRIC.  (2)  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE CHANGED OUR COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION TO ALIGN WITH OUR INTERNAL COMPANY REPORTING. UNDER THE NEW DEFINITION, A STORE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION AFTER IT HAS COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS AND INCLUDES STORES, IF ANY, THAT HAVE BEEN REMODELED OR RELOCATED WITHIN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC MARKET THE COMPANY SERVED PRIOR TO THE RELOCATION. NON-COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE NEW STORES WHICH HAVE NOT COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS, SALES FROM CLOSED STORES, AND RELOCATED STORES SERVING A NEW GEOGRAPHIC MARKET. UNDER THE OLD DEFINITION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE RELOCATED OR REMODELED AN EXISTING STORE, WE HAD TREATED THAT STORE AS COMPARABLE UNLESS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE CHANGED BY MORE THAN 20%, IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD TREAT THAT STORE AS NON-COMPARABLE SALES UNTIL IT HAS COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE ADJUSTMENT. FOR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEARS, WE CONTINUE TO ADJUST COMPARABLE SALES TO EXCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL WEEK. THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS IN THE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND OTHER RETAILERS CALCULATE COMPARABLE SALES. THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE SALES HAVE BEEN RE-CASTED TO ALIGN WITH OUR NEW COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION. THE CHANGE IN OUR COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGES.  20  THREE MONTHS EN  DED  MAY 4, 2019  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  NET SALES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WERE $55,122, INCREASING $608, OR 1.1%, VERSUS $54,514 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, GROSS MARGIN WAS 51.3%, COMPARED WITH 46.8% IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE TOTAL GROSS MARGIN RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  \u2022  NON-RECURRENCE OF AN UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY RESERVES IN THE PRIOR YEAR CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 245 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT; AND  \u2022  THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRONGER FULL PRICE SELLING AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 250 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d)  EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WERE $34,015, INCREASING $4,115, OR 13.8%, VERSUS $29,900 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WERE 61.7% AND 54.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN SG&A EXPENSES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  $1,350 OF STRATEGIC CONSULTING COSTS;  \u2022  $1,217 OF INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS;  \u2022  $657 OF INCREASED MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  $378 OF INCREASED RENT AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET NEW STORE OPENINGS.

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018 WAS 0.6% AND 0.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ESTABLISHED AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS PARTLY OFFSET BY STATE AND FOREIGN TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, IF ANY, BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE 2018 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FUNDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MEETING OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, PAYING AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORES AND RELATED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT  CASH FLOWS TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED.

ON JUNE 3, 2015, VINCE, LLC ENTERED INTO A FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE 2013 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THAT AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCREASED THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS UNDER THE FACILITY FROM $50,000 TO $80,000, SUBJECT TO A LOAN CAP WHICH WAS THE LESSER OF (I) THE BORROWING BASE, AS DEFINED IN THE LOAN AGREEMENT, (II) THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS, OR (III) $70,000 UNTIL DEBT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE COMPANY\u2019S 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY HAVE BEEN PAID IN FULL, AND EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE FROM NOVEMBER 27, 2018 TO JUNE 3, 2020.  ON AUGUST 21, 2018, THE COMPANY REFINANCED THE 2013 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BY ENTERING INTO THE 2018 TERM LOAN FACILITY AND THE 2018 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS UNDER THE 2013 TERM LOAN FACILITY OF $40,689, INCLUDING INTEREST, WERE REPAID IN FULL AND THE 2013 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WAS TERMINATED.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ORGANIZATIONS OR FINANCIAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS STRUCTURED FINANCE OR SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FACILITATING OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS OR OTHER CONTRACTUALLY NARROW OR LIMITED PURPOSES DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED HEREIN.  SEASONALITY  THE APPAREL AND FASHION INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE IS CYCLICAL AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OUR REVENUES ARE AFFECTED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE SEASONAL TRENDS CHARACTERISTIC TO THE APPAREL AND FASHION INDUSTRY. PURCHASES OF APPAREL ARE SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER SPENDING, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEVEL OF DISPOSABLE CONSUMER  25  INCOME, CONSUMER DEBT, INTEREST RAT  ES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS THE IMPACT  OF  ADVERSE WEATHER  CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN  THE AMOUNT OF  SALES IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER ARE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF SEASONAL WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS AFFECTING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER  SALES; AS SUCH, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WE EXPECT SUCH SEASONALITY TO CONTINUE.  INFLATION  WHILE INFLATION MAY IMPACT OUR SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND EXPENSES, WE BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RELIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, WHICH ARE PREPARED BASED ON CERTAIN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF UNCERTAINTY. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE BASED ON REASONABLE MEASUREMENT CRITERIA, ACTUAL FUTURE EVENTS CAN AND OFTEN DO RESULT IN OUTCOMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN THE MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION OF OUR 2018 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $4,485,000 ON NET SALES OF $26,893,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $5,034,000 ON NET SALES OF $22,569,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $4,324,000, A 19.2% INCREASE, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET SALES INCREASED LARGELY BECAUSE THE COMPANY STARTED THE YEAR WITH AN ORDER BACKLOG THAT WAS $4,200,000 HIGHER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR.    APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASE IN SELLING PRICE AND THE BALANCE DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SELLING PRICES TO COMPENSATE FOR SEVERE COST INCREASES INCURRED DURING LAST FISCAL YEAR.  THESE INCREASES INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF STEEL TARIFFS, TARIFFS ON PRODUCT FROM CHINA, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER COSTS.  IN ADDITION, THE PRICE INCREASE WAS INTENDED TO COVER ANTICIPATED COST INCREASES FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020.  THE AMOUNT OF PRICE INCREASE VARIED BASED UPON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND COMPETITIVE CONSIDERATIONS, BUT NO PRODUCT INCREASED BY LESS THAN 10%.  IMPACT OF THIS PRICE INCREASE DID NOT FULLY IMPACT FIRST QUARTER SALES, AS THE MAJORITY OF FIRST QUARTER SALES WERE FROM THE BEGINNING BACKLOG OF ORDERS, WHICH WERE RECEIVED BEFORE THE PRICE INCREASE.  THE IMPACT OF THE PRICE INCREASE WILL BE MORE IMPACTFUL DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS.  ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 18.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  ORDER RATES WERE VERY SLOW FOR THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH, WITH YEAR-TO-DATE ORDERS THROUGH MARCH BEING 27% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR APRIL AND MAY WHICH ARE SEASONALLY HIGHER THAN FEBRUARY AND MARCH WERE 2% LOWER THAN PRIOR YEAR.  BECAUSE THESE ORDERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DELIVERED IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION, ORDER BACKLOG AT APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 22.0%.  BACKLOG AT APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $39,254,000 COMPARED TO $50,136,000 AT APRIL 30, 2018 AND $39,553,000 AT APRIL 30, 2017.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 33.8% IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO 34.1% IN THE PRIOR QUARTER.  THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOUR COMPONENTS.  FIRST, THE COMPANY INCREASED COMPENSATION FOR FACTORY EMPLOYEES, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF PRESSURES FROM INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGE AND OTHER PRESSURES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION.  SECOND, THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED INCREASED MATERIAL COSTS FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES, PARTICULARLY STEEL AND IMPORTED COMPONENTS FROM CHINA.  THIRD, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED SELLING PRICES TO RECOVER THESE COST INCREASES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION FOR SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER WERE FROM ORDERS PLACED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIOR TO THE PRICE INCREASE.  FOURTH, FACTORY PRODUCTION LEVELS WERE APPROXIMATELY 13% LOWER FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR IN RESPONSE TO SLOW ORDER RATES.  THE REDUCED PRODUCTION LEVELS ADVERSELY IMPACTED FACTORY EFFICIENCY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $527,000 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR BUT DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES.  THE INCREASE IN SPENDING IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO VARIABLE SELLING AND SERVICE COSTS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 IS COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS 31.6% COMPARE TO 29.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS MORE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE INCREASE.  FIRST, THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED MORE MONEY TO FINANCE PRODUCTION OF INVENTORY IN ANTICIPATION OF INCREASED SUMMER SHIPPING ACTIVITY.  SECOND, EXPENSE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT APRIL 30, 2019 THAN AT APRIL 30, 2018 DUE TO INCREASED SALES DURING THE QUARTER RESULTING FROM THE BACKLOG AT JANUARY 31, 2019.  DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, THE COMPANY TRADITIONALLY BUILDS LARGE QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF SEASONALLY HIGH SUMMER SHIPMENTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCREASED INVENTORY BY APPROXIMATELY $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION LESS THAN WHAT WAS ADDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THIS REDUCTION WAS IN PART TO COMPENSATE FOR A LARGER BEGINNING INVENTORY BALANCE AT JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND IN RESPONSE TO SLOWER ORDER RATES.  AT APRIL 30, 2019 INVENTORY WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN DOLLARS DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES BUT LOWER IN UNIT VOLUME.  THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WAS FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (\"PNC\").  16  BORROWING UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC AT APRIL 30, 2019 IS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN BORROWING IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCRUAL BASIS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $884,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $613,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE BEING FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $18,286,000 COMPARED TO $16,992,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY'S UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER ITS REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  APPROXIMATELY $4,000,000 WAS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING AS OF APRIL 30, 2019.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE OUTLINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU NO. 2016-02-  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND APPLYING THE TRANSITIONAL RELIEF ALLOWING ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS AT THE ADOPTION DATE BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. CONSEQUENTLY, RESULTS AND DISCLOSURES FOR THE REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 ARE REPORTED AND PRESENTED UNDER ASC 842, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS, AND DISCLOSURES ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED AND PRESENTED UNDER ASC 840,  LEASES  . IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE NEW STANDARD, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO CARRY FORWARD THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION. FURTHER, THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT TO APPLY THE HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, WHICH ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO FORGO REASSESSING THE LEASE TERM AT ADOPTION. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR LEASES WITH AN ORIGINAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN A PURCHASE OPTION AS SHORT-TERM LEASES.  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS, OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY FINANCE LEASES, AS A LESSEE, AND NO LEASES FOR WHICH IT IS THE LESSOR.  ROU ASSETS REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO USE AN UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM IS 5.72 YEARS. AS MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE THE INTEREST RATE ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS WITH SIMILAR TERMS AND PAYMENTS USING COMPANY SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREADS. THE COMPANY USES THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN READILY DETERMINABLE. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE USED IS 6.39%. THE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSET ALSO INCLUDES ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AND EXCLUDES LEASE INCENTIVES. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION.  LEASE EXPENSE FOR OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM  THE COMPANY HAS LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS PART OF A COMBINED LEASE.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION AND $25.6 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADDITIONAL LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, NET OF THE DEFERRED TAX IMPACT, WAS DUE TO PREVIOUS DEFERRED RENT BALANCES THAT WERE REMOVED AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THE STANDARD DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE 1.7 PERCENT DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORES SALES ON AN OWNED PLUS LICENSED BASIS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  TRANSACTIONS DRIVEN BY LOWER STORE TRAFFIC. COMPARABLE STORE SALES REFLECT STORES OPEN THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND INCLUDE ECOMMERCE. ECOMMERCE SALES WERE APPROXIMATELY 5.3 PERCENT OF NET SALES. ECOMMERCE SALES INCREASED  13.6 PERCENT, INCLUDING ONLINE ORDERS SHIPPED FROM OUR STORES, AND POSITIVELY AFFECTED OUR TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, AVAILABLE CASH, CREDIT TERMS FROM VENDORS,  OUR $240.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK AND OUR $35.0 MILLION TERM LOAN (AS DISCUSSED BELOW).  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN  ON  FEBRUARY 3, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A $250.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK (\u201cWELLS FARGO\u201d) WITH  AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF FEBRUARY 2020 (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) AND A SECURED $25.0 MILLION MASTER LOAN AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO EQUIPMENT FINANCE, INC. (THE \u201cEQUIPMENT TERM LOAN\u201d) WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF  FEBRUARY 2018. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WERE INITIALLY USED FOR A SPECIAL DIVIDEND BUT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY BEING USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DURING 2015, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF $0.4 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS TERM. WE REPAID THE EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN IN FULL ON  JANUARY 22, 2018, AT WHICH TIME THE ASSOCIATED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WERE FULLY AMORTIZED.  ON FEBRUARY 19, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT  NO. 1 (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ACCOMMODATION PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) DURING WHICH WE  WERE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT). THIS CHANGE PERMITTED US TO BORROW THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE THEN APPLICABLE BORROWING BASE UNTIL WE DELIVERED OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE MEASUREMENT  PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT, A CASH DOMINION EVENT (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) OCCURRED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT  AMENDMENT AND AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER. BECAUSE OF THE CASH DOMINION EVENT, ALL OF OUR CASH RECEIPTS WERE SWEPT DAILY TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS A  SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION. AS NOTED BELOW, THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT REMOVED THE CASH DOMINION EVENT EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 18, 2018.  ON  MARCH 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 2 (THE \u201cSECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO. THE SECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  (1) THE $25.0 MILLION  TRANCHE A-1  REVOLVING LOANS (AS DEFINED IN THE SECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) WERE REPAID IN FULL WITH THE PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN (AS DEFINED BELOW); (2) THE ENTRY  INTO THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW); AND (3) CERTAIN OTHER MODIFICATIONS AND UPDATES TO COORDINATE THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITH THE TERM LOAN.  ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cTHIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS  FARGO. THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (1) THE INCREASE OF AGGREGATE TRANCHE A REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS (AS DEFINED IN THE SECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) FROM $225.0 MILLION TO $240.0 MILLION; (2) AN  EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO THE EARLIER OF (A) THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR (B) SEPTEMBER 18, 2023; AND (3) THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION EVENT  STATUS AND A CHANGE IN CASH DOMINION TO BE TRIGGERED ONLY IN THE EVENT OF (A) THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUANCE OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT OR (B) EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF LESS THAN (A) 10.0% OF THE LOAN CAP AT ANY TIME OR (B) 12.5% OF THE LOAN CAP  FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING 2018, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS RESPECTIVE TERM. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THE INITIAL CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL ALSO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE NEW TERM OF THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT. THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION STATUS CHANGED THE DEBT CLASSIFICATION FROM A SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATION.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 4 (THE \u201cFOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS  FARGO. THE FOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A MODIFICATION TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\u201d AND \u201cPERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE FOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS (INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT OF A 1.0 TO 1.0  CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF ANY COVENANT COMPLIANCE EVENT, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE AND IS CROSS-COLLATERALIZED AND  CROSS-DEFAULTED. COLLATERAL FOR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY. WELLS FARGO HAS A FIRST LIEN ON ALL COLLATERAL OTHER THAN EQUIPMENT.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE EITHER BASE RATE LOANS OR LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) LOANS. LIBOR LOANS BEAR INTEREST  EQUAL TO THE ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS THE APPLICABLE MARGIN (125 TO 175 BASIS POINTS) DEPENDING ON THE QUARTERLY AVERAGE EXCESS AVAILABILITY. BASE RATE LOANS BEAR INTEREST EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (A) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50 PERCENT,  (B) THE ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS 1.00 PERCENT, OR (C) THE WELLS FARGO \u201cPRIME RATE,\u201d PLUS THE APPLICABLE MARGIN (25 TO 75 BASIS POINTS).  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS 4.12 PERCENT AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  TERM LOAN  ON MARCH 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A TERM  LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH GORDON BROTHERS FINANCE COMPANY, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGENT\u201d), AND GORDON BROTHERS FINANCE COMPANY, LLC, AS LENDER (THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGREEMENT\u201d). THE TERM LOAN  AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR A TERM LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $50.0 MILLION (THE \u201cTERM LOAN\u201d). DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOAN WERE CAPITALIZED IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.9 MILLION AND WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE TERM  LOAN. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $49.1 MILLION FROM THE TERM LOAN WERE USED TO PERMANENTLY PAY OFF THE $25.0 MILLION  TRANCHE A-1 REVOLVING  LOAN (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) AND TO PAY DOWN  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AFTER UTILIZING PROCEEDS FROM THE TERM LOAN FOR REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE EXISTING  TRANCHE A-1 REVOLVING  LOANS, THE TERM LOAN RESULTED IN AN INCREASE  IN OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $25.0 MILLION UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE TERM LOAN ORIGINALLY MATURED ON THE EARLIER OF  (1) THE TERMINATION DATE SPECIFIED IN OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS SUCH DATE MAY BE EXTENDED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE TERM LOAN AGENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW), AND (2) MARCH 14, 2020.  ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 2 (THE \u201cSECOND TERM LOAN AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE TERM LOAN WITH GORDON BROTHERS  FINANCE COMPANY. THE SECOND TERM LOAN AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE REDUCTION OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN TO $35.0 MILLION; (2) AN EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN  AGREEMENT TO THE EARLIER OF (A) THE TERMINATION DATE SPECIFIED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT), AND (B) SEPTEMBER 18, 2023; (3) THE REDUCTION OF  THE NON-DEFAULT  INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE TERM LOAN UNDER THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT TO A FLUCTUATING RATE OF INTEREST EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR (WITH A FLOOR OF 1.5%) PLUS 8.25% PER ANNUM; AND  (4) THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION EVENT STATUS AND A CHANGE IN CASH DOMINION TO BE TRIGGERED ONLY IN THE EVENT OF (A) THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUANCE OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT OR (B) EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF LESS THAN (A) 10.0% OF THE  REVOLVING LOAN CAP AT ANY TIME OR (B) 12.5% OF THE REVOLVING LOAN CAP FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING 2018, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LOAN AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS TERM. THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION STATUS CHANGED THE DEBT CLASSIFICATION FROM A SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATION.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cTHIRD TERM LOAN AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. THE THIRD TERM  LOAN AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A MODIFICATION TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\u201d AND \u201cPERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE THIRD TERM LOAN AMENDMENT.  THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING THE RETENTION OF THE EXISTING  MINIMUM 1.0 TO 1.0 CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH LIMITS BORROWING AVAILABILITY IF NOT MET DURING PERIODS WHERE REVOLVING EXCESS AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) IS LESS THAN THE  GREATER OF $20.0 MILLION OR 10.0 PERCENT OF COMBINED LOAN CAP (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR A FACILITY OF THIS TYPE. THE TERM LOAN IS SECURED BY A SECOND LIEN SECURITY  INTEREST (SUBORDINATE ONLY TO THE LIENS SECURING THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) ON ALL ASSETS SECURING THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH CONSIST OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY), EXCEPT FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,  UPON WHICH THE TERM LOAN LENDERS HAVE A FIRST LIEN SECURITY INTEREST.  THE TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS IF AN EVENT OF  DEFAULT (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) EXISTS. IF NO SUCH EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS, PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN PRIORITY COLLATERAL ARE TO BE APPLIED TO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE TERM LOAN AGENT AND WELLS FARGO HAVE ENTERED INTO AN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT DATED AS OF MARCH 14, 2018 (THE \u201cINTERCREDITOR  AGREEMENT\u201d), ACKNOWLEDGED BY US UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT WAS ALSO AMENDED ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018 TO INCORPORATE THE AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT.  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN WAS 10.84 PERCENT AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  PROMISSORY NOTE  WE BELIEVE WE CAN BORROW, ON A SHORT-TERM  BASIS AND SUBJECT TO THE FORMAL AGREEMENT OF THE LENDER, AMOUNTS UP TO THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES RELATED TO OUR EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY IF NEEDED. AT MAY 4, 2019, THE  CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF OUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WAS $15.2 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 2, 2018, WE EXECUTED A PROMISSORY NOTE UNDER WHICH WE  BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $13.7 MILLION (THE \u201cPROMISSORY NOTE\u201d) FROM SUNTRUST BANK (THE \u201cTRUSTEE\u201d) IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE TRUSTEE UNDER A TRUST AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTRUST AGREEMENT\u201d) DATED SEPTEMBER 1, 1999. THE TRUST  ESTABLISHED BY THE TRUST AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTRUST\u201d) HOLDS CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES RELATED TO OUR EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TRUSTEE OBTAINED LOANS FROM THE INSURANCE POLICIES HELD IN THE TRUST IN AN AMOUNT NOT LESS  THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE. THE PROMISSORY NOTE WAS A SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION AND THE PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PAY DOWN BORROWINGS UNDER THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THAT AGREEMENT.  THE PROMISSORY NOTE HAD A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 3.58 PERCENT PER ANNUM AND AN ORIGINAL MATURITY DATE OF APRIL 1, 2018. ON MARCH 7, 2018,  WE EXECUTED AN AMENDMENT TO THE PROMISSORY NOTE UNDER WHICH THE TRUSTEE EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NOTE FROM APRIL 1, 2018, TO JULY 1, 2018 (THE \u201cMATURITY DATE\u201d). THE AMENDMENT DID NOT ALTER THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE  PROMISSORY NOTE. THE PROMISSORY NOTE COULD BE PREPAID IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME. ALL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE PROMISSORY NOTE WOULD HAVE BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE. THE TRUSTEE COULD OFFSET PAYMENTS DUE  UNDER THE PROMISSORY NOTE AGAINST AMOUNTS WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE TRUST UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT. ON JUNE 29, 2018, WE REPAID THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, WE EXECUTED A SECOND PROMISSORY NOTE FROM SUNTRUST BANK FOR $13.0 MILLION, WHICH CARRIED A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  3.58 PERCENT PER ANNUM AND AN ORIGINAL MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 10, 2018. THIS NOTE INCLUDED THE SAME TERMS AS THE PROMISSORY NOTE EXECUTED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2018. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE REPAID THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE  SECOND PROMISSORY NOTE.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE DRIVEN BY SALES AS WELL AS THE CREDIT TERMS AVAILABLE TO US FROM OUR VENDORS AND THEIR  FACTORS. OUR SALES GENERATE CASH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND ARE AFFECTED BY CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES AND THE DESIRABILITY OF OUR MERCHANDISE TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC IS IN TURN AFFECTED BY OUR MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, GENERAL  ECONOMIC  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, AND WEATHER. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES AND THUS CASH INFLOWS TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CREDIT TERMS AND AVAILABILITY FROM OUR VENDORS AND THEIR FACTORS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018, OUR VENDORS AND FACTORS CONSTRICTED OUR CREDIT TERMS AND LIMITS SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS WAS A REACTION TO OUR 2017 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS, AS WELL AS CONCERN ABOUT THE GENERAL RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME, WHICH INCLUDED MULTIPLE BANKRUPTCIES AND  RESTRUCTURINGS BY OTHER RETAILERS IN THE SAME BUSINESS. THIS CONSTRICTION CAUSED US TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR VENDORS AND FACTORS MORE QUICKLY THAN IN PRIOR PERIODS, THUS INCREASING OUR DEBT LEVELS DURING THAT PERIOD. THE ADDED AVAILABILITY FROM THE  TERM LOAN AGREEMENT WAS A KEY PART OF OUR ABILITY TO FUND THE ACCELERATED PAYMENTS. WE  HAVE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS  WITH THE MAJOR FACTORS, CREDIT INSURERS AND SEVERAL OF OUR LARGEST VENDORS WHICH  ALLOW US TO COMMUNICATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS TO THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. DURING 2018, WE MADE PERIODIC PRESENTATIONS TO OUR KEY VENDORS AND FACTORS AND WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS TO THEM. THESE  STEPS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN THEIR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH US, WHICH HAS CONTINUED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR  WORKING CAPITAL FLUCTUATES WITH SEASONAL VARIATIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR BORROWINGS AND AVAILABILITY. OUR AVAILABILITY IS HIGHEST JUST AFTER OUR STRONG SEASONAL SPRING AND HOLIDAY SELLING SEASONS AND IS LOWEST JUST BEFORE THOSE SEASONS AS WE BUILD  INVENTORY LEVELS. WORKING CAPITAL IS ALSO USED TO SUPPORT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE OF OUR EXISTING STORES, SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW STORE OPENINGS. WE HAVE REDUCED OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE OUR CASH FLOWS. THESE REDUCED LEVELS  OF INVESTMENT CAN BE SUSTAINED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS PRIOR TO THIS OUR STORE BASE AND SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED. POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS WILL HELP US PRESERVE SATISFACTORY CREDIT TERMS AND ALLOW US TO OPERATE WITHIN  THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING  OUR OPERATING RESULTS WE CONSIDER OUR RESOURCES ADEQUATE TO SATISFY OUR CASH NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $21.9 MILLION AND $118.8 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $35.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN, FOR A TOTAL OF $153.0 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, NET OF  $0.8 MILLION IN UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $9.0 MILLION AND $119.1 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $35.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE  TERM LOAN, FOR A TOTAL OF $153.3 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, NET OF $0.8 MILLION IN UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. AS OF MAY 5, 2018, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $16.2 MILLION AND $146.1 MILLION IN  BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, $50.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND $13.3 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROMISSORY NOTE, FOR A TOTAL OF $209.4 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR  BORROWINGS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT IS THE LESSER OF $240.0 MILLION OR 100 PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND THE NET RECOVERY PERCENTAGE VALUE OF INVENTORIES LESS RESERVES. ON MAY 4, 2019, IN  ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN, WE HAD $7.9 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT. OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WAS $102.0 MILLION ON MAY 4, 2019. AS OF  MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $15.2 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BORROW, ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, WHICH WOULD BE COLLATERALIZED BY LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES.  CASH FLOWS  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  CHANGE  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN).

THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT TERMS FROM VENDORS AND FACTORS SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018. OUR DECREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER LAST YEAR ALSO AFFECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.7 MILLION FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE CHANGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LAST YEAR\u2019S PROCEEDS FROM CANCELLED  CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.6 MILLION DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4,  2019, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $52.1 MILLION DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD NET REPAYMENTS OF DEBT OF $0.3 MILLION. WE PAID ACCRUED CASH DIVIDENDS  ON VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND CAPITAL LEASE PAYMENTS OF $0.2 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED 102,543 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $0.1 MILLION. DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018, WE HAD NET  PROCEEDS OF DEBT OF $53.3 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. WE ALSO PAID DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $0.8 MILLION, PAID ACCRUED CASH DIVIDENDS ON VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS OF $0.1 MILLION AND CAPITAL LEASE  PAYMENTS OF $0.2 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED 45,103 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION.

EXCEPT FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (TOPIC  842), WE HAVE MADE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES SINCE FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 \u201cBASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED).  SEASONALITY AND INFLATION  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL. SALES AND PROFITABILITY ARE HISTORICALLY HIGHER IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR, WHICH INCLUDE THE SPRING  AND HOLIDAY SEASONS. THEREFORE, RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT OUR INCOME WILL BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED MATERIALLY BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS DEFINED IN RULES  13A-15(E)  AND  15D-15(E)  UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF  1934, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE  EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 4, 2019, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SEC\u2019S  RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

EXECUTIVE  SUMMARY  PRELIMINARY  NOTE  ON  JANUARY 17, 2017, WE ACQUIRED A 51% INTEREST IN NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS LLC (\u201cNGDX\u201d), FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS.  ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE REMAINING EQUITY OF NGDX, AND NGDX BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY. WE INTEND TO FOCUS RESOURCES  ON NGDX\u2019 BUSINESS AS WELL AS OTHER POTENTIAL ACQUISITION CANDIDATES GOING FORWARD, BUT DO NOT INTEND TO DISCONTINUE OUR  PRE-ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES.  WE  INTEND TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON NGDX\u2019S BUSINESS, AND ON THE BUSINESSES OF REGENTYS, OLAREGEN AND THE MSAO BUSINESS ACQUIRED  FROM VENETO, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION TARGETS, BUT DO NOT INTEND TO DISCONTINUE OUR HISTORICAL ACTIVITIES.

ON  JANUARY 7, 2019, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY INTEREST IN OLAREGEN THERAPEUTIX INC. (\u201cOLAREGEN\u201d) FOR AN AGGREGATE OF $12,000,000.  $400,000 WAS PAID IN CASH AND THE REMAINDER WAS PAID BY THE ISSUANCE OF A PROMISSORY NOTE. $1,200,000 PRINCIPAL WAS PAID AGAINST  THE NOTE AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 AND AN ADDITIONAL $38,500 WAS PAID SUBSEQUENTLY FOR A TOTAL AGGREGATE OF $1,238,500 OF PRINCIPAL  PAYMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE $400,000 INITIAL PAYMENT. OLAREGEN IS LAUNCHING AN FDA-510(K) CLEARED WOUND CARE PRODUCT.  OVERVIEW  OF BUSINESS  NGDX  DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  OUR  MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS LLC (\u201cNGDX\u201d), FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, IS IN THE BUSINESS  OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT  OF CARE LEVEL WITH RESULTS AS SOON AS 10-15 MINUTES. WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL RAPID DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY  EXPRESS PLATFORMS AS WELL AS CASSETTE DEVICES BASED ON CUSTOMARY DESIGNS USED GENERALLY IN THE INDUSTRY.  SINCE  ITS FOUNDING, NGDX HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AN EXPANDING LINE OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS (RDTS) INCLUDING THOSE  FOR THE FOLLOWING INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) \u2013 1\u20442 W/P24AB, TUBERCULOSIS-XT, MALARIA,  HEPATITIS, SYPHILIS, TYPHOID, DENGUE AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  TODAY,  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SUBSTANTIAL LINE OF RDT\u2019S KNOWN AS READY TO \u201cGO-TO-MARKET.\u201d  DUE  TO THE POTENTIAL INFECTIOUS CHARACTER OF THE WHOLE BLOOD TEST SAMPLE, OUR EXPRESS SERIES OF RDTS ARE DESIGNED TO PERFORM AND DELIVER  TEST RESULTS WHILE SEALED WITHIN THE EXPRESS HOUSING, CAREFULLY CONTROLLING THE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS TEST SAMPLE. THIS DESIGN  HELPS TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE POSSIBILITY OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION. MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS, WHILE  INEXPENSIVE, ARE NOT AS USER-FRIENDLY ALLOWING FOR INCREASED USER-ERROR AND REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TRAINING AND HAVE GREATER  RISK OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION.  WE  HAVE BEEN DESIGNING AND ENGINEERING DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES OF RAPID TEST STRIPS FOR USE IN OUR  EXPRESS SERIES OF DEVICES AND WHICH YIELD A RAPID RESPONSE FOR POINT-OF-CARE PATIENT TESTING AND TREATMENT.  EACH  RDT INCORPORATES AN ACCURATE TEST STRIP THAT HAS BEEN STRIPED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES COMBINED IN A PROPRIETARY COCKTAIL  AND THEN INCORPORATED INTO AN EASY-TO-USE AND USER-FRIENDLY DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE NGDX DELIVERY SYSTEMS INCLUDE OUR STANDARD \u201cCASSETTE\u201d  DESIGN, OUR PATENTED \u201cEXPRESS\u201d HOUSING DEVICE AS WELL AS OUR NEW \u201cEXPRESS II\u201d.  EACH  SYSTEM DELIVERS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES WHICH ENHANCE THE USE, APPLICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF EACH DIAGNOSTIC. THIS EASE OF USE IN  THE EXPRESS DELIVERY SYSTEMS ENSURE THAT OUR RDTS PERFORM EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING THE MOST ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE  TEST RESULTS AVAILABLE WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, MINIMIZING THE TRANSFERENCE OF A POTENTIALLY INFECTED BLOOD SAMPLE.  THE  COMPANY MAINTAINS A FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) REGISTERED FACILITY IN MIRAMAR, FLORIDA AND IS CERTIFIED UNDER BOTH ISO9001  AND ISO13485 FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE IN-VITRO DEVICES. APPROVAL OF OUR HIV RAPID TEST  HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID). ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS QUALIFIED  FOR AND CARRY THE EUROPEAN UNION \u201cCE\u201d MARK, WHICH ALLOW US TO ENTER INTO CE MEMBER COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL  COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE TWO MALARIA RAPID TESTS APPROVED UNDER WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) GUIDELINES. OUR  NGDX PRODUCTS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGISTRATIONS AND APPROVALS ISSUED BY OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. NGDX IS CURRENTLY IN THE PLANNING  PHASE FOR ENTERING INTO THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED, WHO \u201cPRE-QUALIFIED APPROVAL\u201d PROCESS FOR OTHER NGDX TESTS. THIS PROCESS  ALLOWS EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF RAPID TESTS, REDUCING THE CURRENT 24-30 MONTH PROCESS DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 6-9 MONTHS. WHO APPROVAL  IS NECESSARY FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO BE USED IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH RELY UPON THE EXPERTISE OF THE WHO, AS WELL AS FOR NGO FUNDING  FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  38  PHARMACY  AND MSO BUSINESS  ON  OCTOBER 3, 2018, WE ACQUIRED FROM VENETO THE OPERATING ASSETS OF SYSTEM DISPENSING PHARMACIES, (B) A CENTRAL ADJUDICATING PHARMACY,  (C) A WHOLESALE PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING COMPANY, AND (D) AN IN-NETWORK LABORATORY.  ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACQUIRED VENETO\u2019S MANAGEMENT SERVICES ORGANIZATION (MSO) BUSINESS AND TWO ADDITIONAL ANCILLARY SERVICES.  REGENTYS  BUSINESS  REGENTYS  IS A DEVELOPMENT STAGE, REGENERATIVE MEDICINE COMPANY FOCUSED ON DEVELOPING TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL (GI)  DISORDERS. THEIR FIRST PRODUCT, EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX HYDROGEL (ECMH), IS A FIRST-IN-CLASS, NON-PHARMACOLOGIC, NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT  OPTION FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ULCERATIVE COLITIS.  OLAREGEN  BUSINESS.  OLAREGEN\u2019S  PRIMARY PRODUCT, EXCELLAGEN, IS AN FDA-510(K) CLEARED ASEPTICALLY-MANUFACTURED, SYRINGE-BASED, READY TO USE 3-DIMENSIONAL WOUND  CONFORMING MATRIX THAT SUPPORTS A FAVORABLE WOUND HEALING ENVIRONMENT. EXCELLAGEN IS INDICATED FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF WOUNDS INCLUDING;  PARTIAL AND FULL-THICKNESS WOUNDS, PRESSURE ULCERS, VENOUS ULCERS, DIABETIC ULCERS, CHRONIC VASCULAR ULCERS, TUNNELED/UNDERMINED  WOUNDS, SURGICAL WOUNDS (DONOR SITES/GRAFT, POST-MOHS SURGERY, POST-LASER SURGERY, PODIATRIC, WOUND DEHISCENCE), TRAUMA WOUNDS  (ABRASIONS, LACERATIONS, SECOND-DEGREE BURNS AND SKIN TEARS) AND DRAINING WOUNDS.  GENEREX  HISTORICAL BUSINESS  WE  HAVE HISTORICALLY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS  AT THE PRESENT TIME IS OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF FORMULATIONS OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS TO THE ORAL (BUCCAL)  CAVITY USING A HAND-HELD AEROSOL APPLICATOR. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ANTIGEN, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR FOCUS TO INCLUDE  IMMUNOMEDICINES INCORPORATING PROPRIETARY VACCINE FORMULATIONS. ON JANUARY 18, 2017, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS  IN NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS LLC (\u201cNGDX\u201d), FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, LLC. ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE  REMAINDER OF THE NGDX EQUITY INTERESTS FOR NOMINAL CONSIDERATION PROVIDED THAT THE GENEREX STOCK AND WARRANTS ISSUED TO THE NGDX  EQUITY OWNERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL ACQUISITION HAVE A SPECIFIED VALUE AND WE HAVE REGISTERED FOR RESALE THE COMPANY\u2019S  SHARES ISSUED TO THE NGDX EQUITY OWNERS. NGDX IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL  DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT OF CARE LEVEL WITH RESULTS AS SOON AS 10-15 MINUTES. NGDX MANUFACTURES  AND SELLS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY EXPRESS TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS CASSETTE DEVICES BASED ON CUSTOMARY  DESIGNS USED GENERALLY IN THE INDUSTRY. WE INTEND TO FOCUS ON NGDX\u2019S BUSINESS AND IN IDENTIFYING OTHER AREAS FOR EXPANSION,  BUT DO NOT INTEND TO DISCONTINUE OUR PRE-ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS APPLICATION TO MANY LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AND PROVIDES  A CONVENIENT, NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADMINISTER SUCH DRUGS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL LARGE MOLECULE  DRUGS AS POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING ESTROGEN, HEPARIN, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE AND FERTILITY  HORMONES, BUT TO DATE HAVE FOCUSED OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS PRIMARILY ON ONE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM, AN  INSULIN FORMULATION ADMINISTERED AS A FINE SPRAY INTO THE ORAL CAVITY USING OUR PROPRIETARY HAND-HELD AEROSOL SPRAY APPLICATOR  KNOWN AS RAPIDMISTTM.  OUR  SUBSIDIARY, ANTIGEN, CONCENTRATES ON DEVELOPING PROPRIETARY VACCINE FORMULATIONS THAT WORK BY STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO  EITHER ATTACK OFFENDING AGENTS (I.E., CANCER CELLS, BACTERIA, AND VIRUSES) OR TO STOP ATTACKING BENIGN ELEMENTS (I.E., SELF-PROTEINS  AND ALLERGENS). OUR IMMUNOMEDICINE PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON TWO PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES AND ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.  PRIOR TO EXHAUSTING OUR FUNDS, WE CONTINUED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIGEN\u2019S SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE VACCINES DESIGNED TO STIMULATE  A POTENT AND SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST TUMORS EXPRESSING THE HER-2/NEU ONCOGENE FOR PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST  CANCER IN A PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL AND PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND AGAINST AVIAN INFLUENZA IN TWO PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS.  WE ALSO INITIATED AN ADDITIONAL PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH EITHER BREAST OR OVARIAN CANCER.  THE SYNTHETIC  VACCINE TECHNOLOGY HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES FOR PANDEMIC OR POTENTIALLY PANDEMIC VIRUSES, SUCH AS THE H5N1 AVIAN AND H1N1 SWINE  FLU.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COLLABORATIONS WITH CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS AT ACADEMIC CENTERS TO ADVANCE THESE TECHNOLOGIES.  39  WE  OPERATE IN THREE SEGMENTS. OUR HISTORICAL BUSINESS OPERATES IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES  FOR METABOLIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES. NGDX OPERATES IN THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICES (RDTS) ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT OF CARE LEVEL. OUR SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC, WHICH ACQUIRED  THE VENETO ASSETS, OPERATES IN PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES.  ACCOUNTING  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  OUR  MAJOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE THE REFINEMENT OF OUR PLATFORM BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, OUR BUCCAL INSULIN PROJECT  (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) AND ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES.  WE  DID NOT EXPEND ANY MATERIAL RESOURCES ON OUR BUCCAL INSULIN (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) OR OTHER ORAL DELIVERY PRODUCTS IN THE FISCAL  QUARTERS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018 DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER LATE-STAGE TRIALS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED  STATES MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FUNDS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON HAND.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE PAID $342,000 TO NSABP FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RELATING TO ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNE THERAPEUTIC VACCINES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES DUE TO OUR LACK OF CASH. ONE ANTIGEN  VACCINE IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST CANCER,  AND WE HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL FOR AN ANTIGEN VACCINE FOR H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AT THE LEBANESE-CANADIAN  HOSPITAL IN BEIRUT. ANTIGEN\u2019S PROSTATE CANCER VACCINE BASED ON AE37 HAS BEEN TESTED IN A COMPLETED (AUGUST 2009) PHASE I  CLINICAL TRIAL IN GREECE.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, NGDX EXPENDED $443,504 AND $380,781 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO ITS RAPID  DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. NGDX EXPECTS TO EXPEND RESOURCES ON ITS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST DURING THE REMAINDER FISCAL YEAR ENDING JULY 31,  2019.  BECAUSE  OF VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR BUCCAL INSULIN OR ANTIGEN\u2019S  PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES OR RELATED TECHNOLOGIES.

OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IT REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS HAS OCCURRED BASED UPON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE  CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  . WE HAVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO PATENTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND WHETHER  OR NOT THESE ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE  USE AN ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED OPERATING INCOME AND RELATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE, MARKET CONDITIONS AND  OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE ASSET. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR THEIR RELATED ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE,  WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AGAINST THESE ASSETS  INVENTORY.

AS A RESULT, CERTAIN  DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITIES (NAMELY THOSE WITH A PRICE PROTECTION FEATURE) ARE NOW SEPARATELY VALUED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2009 AND  ACCOUNTED FOR ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WITH ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED  BALANCE SHEETS AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 AND JULY 31, 2018, WE USED THE BINOMIAL LATTICE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE  WARRANTS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF THE BINOMIAL LATTICE OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCLUDE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE EXERCISE PRICE  OF THE WARRANTS, APPLICABLE VOLATILITY RATES, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, EXPECTED DIVIDENDS AND THE INSTRUMENT\u2019S REMAINING  TERM.

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE IS RELEVANT TO AN ASSESSMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . IT SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AS OF, AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY IS A NEVADA-BASED, GOLD AND SILVER MINING EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WITH EXTENSIVE, CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY IN THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK AND SILVER CITY MINING DISTRICTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cCOMSTOCK DISTRICT\u201d) AND ADDITIONAL MINING, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN STOREY AND LYON COUNTIES, NEVADA. THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE BASIN AND RANGE PROVINCE OF NEVADA, NEAR RENO AND CARSON CITY. THE COMPANY BEGAN ACQUIRING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPING PROJECTS IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT IN 2003. SINCE THEN, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK DISTRICT, SECURED PERMITS, BUILT AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROUGHT EXPLORATION PROJECTS INTO PRODUCTION.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES NOW OWN OR CONTROL APPROXIMATELY  9,358  ACRES OF MINING CLAIMS AND PARCELS IN THE BROADER COMSTOCK DISTRICT AND SURROUNDING AREA. THE ACREAGE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  2,396  ACRES OF PATENTED CLAIMS AND SURFACE PARCELS (PRIVATE LANDS) AND APPROXIMATELY  6,962  ACRES OF UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS (PUBLIC LANDS), WHICH THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (\u201cBLM\u201d) ADMINISTERS. THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IS ON AMERICAN FLAT ROAD, IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA AND JUST SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA  BECAUSE OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT\u2019S HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE, THE GEOLOGY IS WELL KNOWN AND HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED BY THE COMPANY, OUR ADVISORS AND MANY INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGY THROUGH VIGOROUS SURFACE MAPPING AND DRILL HOLE LOGGING. THE VOLUME OF GEOLOGIC DATA IS IMMENSE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LUCERNE AND DAYTON RESOURCE AREAS. WE HAVE AMASSED A LARGE LIBRARY OF HISTORIC DATA AND DETAILED SURFACE MAPPING OF COMSTOCK DISTRICT PROPERTIES AND CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HISTORIC INFORMATION FROM PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES. WE INTEGRATE THIS DATA WITH INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OUR RECENT MINING OPERATIONS, TO TARGET GEOLOGICAL PROSPECTIVE EXPLORATION AREAS AND PLAN EXPLORATORY DRILLING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EXPANDED SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND DRILLING.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES EVALUATING AND ACQUIRING PROPERTIES, EXPANDING ITS FOOTPRINT AND EVALUATING ALL OF OUR EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND MINING. THE NEAR-TERM GOAL OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN IS TO MAXIMIZE INTRINSIC STOCKHOLDER VALUE REALIZED, PER SHARE, BY CONTINUING TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP MINERALIZED AND POTENTIALLY MINERALIZED PROPERTIES, EXPLORING, DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING QUALIFIED RESOURCES (MEASURED, INDICATED AND INFERRED) AND RESERVES (PROVEN AND PROBABLE) THAT ENABLE THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES THROUGH EXTENDED, LONG-LIVED MINE PLANS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, INCLUDING MINE PLANS FOR BOTH THE DAYTON AND LUCERNE RESOURCE AREAS, WITH BOTH SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND THE ADJACENT SPRING VALLEY EXPLORATION TARGETS ARE LOCATED IN LYON COUNTY, NEVADA, APPROXIMATELY SIX MILES SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY. ACCESS TO THE PROPERTIES IS BY STATE ROUTES 341 AND 342, BOTH PAVED ROADS.  OUR LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA IS LOCATED IN STOREY COUNTY, NEVADA, APPROXIMATELY THREE MILES SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY AND 30 MILES SOUTHEAST OF RENO. THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA WAS HOST TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST-RECENT TEST MINING OPERATIONS FROM 2012 THROUGH 2015. THE PROCESSING FACILITY IS IN AMERICAN FLAT, APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE WEST OF LUCERNE.  THE COMPANY ACHIEVED INITIAL PRODUCTION AND ITS FIRST POUR OF GOLD AND SILVER ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012. THE COMPANY CEASED MINING IN 2015 AND CONCLUDED PROCESSING IN 2016. FROM 2012, THROUGH 2016, THE COMPANY MINED AND PROCESSED APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION TONS OF MINERALIZED MATERIAL, AND PRODUCED 59,515 OUNCES OF GOLD AND 735,252 OUNCES OF SILVER.  21  FIGURE 1 - COMSTOCK MINING'S LAND POSITION IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT  22  CURRENT PROJECTS  THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED MANY EXPLORATION TARGETS ON ITS LAND HOLDINGS IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, BUT HAS FOCUSED, TO DATE, ON THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA (INCLUDING SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND EXPLORATION). WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE EXPLORATION PLANS FOR THE REMAINING AREAS, WHICH INCLUDE THE SPRING VALLEY GROUP, OCCIDENTAL GROUP, AND GOLD HILL GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS. EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES WILL PROCEED SUBSEQUENT TO AND IN SOME CASES CONCURRENT WITH THE ONGOING EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAYTON AND LUCERNE RESOURCE AREAS.  THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA IS SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY IN LYON COUNTY, NEVADA. IT GENERALLY INCLUDES THE HISTORIC DAYTON, KOSSUTH AND ALHAMBRA PATENTS, INCLUDING THE OLD DAYTON CONSOLIDATED MINE WORKINGS, SOUTH TO WHERE THE KOSSUTH PATENT CROSSES STATE ROUTE 341. THE HISTORIC DAYTON MINE WAS THE LAST MEANINGFUL UNDERGROUND MINING OPERATION IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, BEFORE BEING CLOSED AFTER THE WAR PRODUCTION BOARD PUBLISHED LIMITATION ORDER L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 ON OCTOBER 8, 1942, THAT CLOSED DOWN ALL GOLD MINING OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES. THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA RANKS AS ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOP EXPLORATION AND POTENTIAL MINE DEVELOPMENT TARGETS. IN JANUARY 2014, THE LYON COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS APPROVED STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN AND ZONING CHANGES ON THE DAYTON, KOSSUTH AND ALHAMBRA MINING PATENTS AND OTHER PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, ENABLING A MORE PRACTICAL, COMPREHENSIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR MINING. GEOLOGICAL STUDIES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY UTILIZING DATA FROM EXTENSIVE METALLURGICAL TESTING AND ASSESSMENT DURING 2017, 30,818 FEET OF ADDITIONAL DRILLING COMPLETED IN 2015, GEOPHYSICAL ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION COMPLETED IN 2013, AND EXTENSIVE GEOLOGICAL DATA FROM PRE-2013, DRILL PROGRAMS.  THE SPRING VALLEY GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS LIES ADJACENT TO THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, WHERE THE MINERALIZED STRUCTURES, TRENDING TO THE SOUTH FROM THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, LIE MOSTLY CONCEALED BENEATH A VENEER OF SEDIMENT GRAVELS. SPRING VALLEY INCLUDES THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE KOSSUTH PATENTED CLAIM AND THE DONDERO, DANEY AND NEW DANEY CLAIMS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY\u2019S PLACER MINING CLAIMS IN SPRING VALLEY AND GOLD CANYON.  THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS SINCE 2007. IT INCLUDES THE PREVIOUSLY MINED BILLIE THE KID, HARTFORD AND LUCERNE MINING PATENTS, AND EXTENDS EAST AND NORTHEASTERLY TO THE AREA OF THE HISTORIC WOODVILLE (SOUTHERN-MOST OF THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK BONANZAS), SUCCOR AND LAGER BEER PATENTS AND NORTH TO THE HISTORIC JUSTICE AND KEYSTONE MINES. THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA IS APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE ALONG STRIKE, WITH EXPLORED WIDTHS FROM 600 TO 1,800 FEET, REPRESENTING LESS THAN THREE PERCENT OF THE LAND HOLDINGS CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY. THE LUCERNE IS THE SITE OF OUR PREVIOUS MINING ACTIVITIES AND ONGOING EXPLORATION PROGRAM, AND THE COMPANY HOLDS THE KEY MINING PERMITS REQUIRED TO RESUME SURFACE OR UNDERGROUND MINING OF THIS AREA.  OUR LUCERNE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES INCLUDED OPEN PIT GOLD AND SILVER TEST MINING FROM 2004, THROUGH 2006, AND FROM LATE 2012 THROUGH 2015. AS DEFINED BY THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) INDUSTRY GUIDE 7, WE HAVE NOT YET ESTABLISHED ANY PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES AT OUR LUCERNE MINE.  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, THE \u201cCOMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH TONOGOLD (THE \u201cTONOGOLD AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL SELL TONOGOLD ITS INTERESTS IN COMSTOCK MINING LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF COMSTOCK (\u201cCML\u201d) WHOSE SOLE ASSETS ARE THE LUCERNE MINE PROPERTIES AND RELATED PERMITS.

THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT TONOGOLD GUARANTEE THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN NORTHERN COMSTOCK LLC (\"NORTHERN COMSTOCK\"), RELIEVING$8 MILLION IN FUTURE LEASE AND RECLAMATION OBLIGATIONS.  TONOGOLD HAS PAID THE COMPANY  $2.4 MILLION  IN NON-REFUNDABLE CASH DEPOSITS, AS OF MAY 3, 2019, OF THE TOTAL $11.5 MILLION OF THE CASH COMPONENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.  THE REMAINING $3.5 MILLION, IN THE FORM OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES OF TONOGOLD, WAS RECEIVED ON JUNE 7, 2019.  THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ALSO AGREED THAT COMMENCING UPON THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF CML, IT WILL ENTER INTO A NEW OPTION AGREEMENT TO LEASE ITS PERMITTED AMERICAN FLAT MINING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TO TONOGOLD FOR CRUSHING, LEACHING AND PROCESSING MATERIAL FROM THE LUCERNE MINE. UNDER THIS NEW OPTION AGREEMENT, TONOGOLD WILL BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $1.1 MILLION  PER YEAR TO MAINTAIN THE PROCESSING FACILITY LEASE OPTION. IF SUCH OPTION IS EXERCISED, TONOGOLD WILL THEN PAY THE COMPANY A RENTAL FEE OF  $1 MILLION  PER YEAR PLUS  $1  PER PROCESSED TON, IN ADDITION TO ALL  23  THE COSTS OF OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE FACILITY, UP TO AND UNTIL THE FIRST  $15 MILLION  IN RENTAL FEES ARE PAID, AND THEN STEPPING DOWN TO  $1 MILLION  PER YEAR AND  $0.50  PER PROCESSED TON FOR THE NEXT  $10 MILLION  PAID TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGREED, UPON THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF CML, TO ENTER INTO A  TEN  -YEAR MINERAL LEASE FOR ADDITIONAL MINERAL PROPERTIES IN STOREY COUNTY, NEVADA, GRANTING TONOGOLD THE RIGHT TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND MINE THESE PROPERTIES. TONOGOLD WILL ASSUME APPROXIMATELY  $100,000  IN ANNUAL COSTS FOR THESE PROPERTIES AND WILL ASSUME WORK COMMITMENTS TOTALING MORE THAN  $200,000  IN 2019. THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A  3%  NET SMELTER RETURN ROYALTY ON THESE ADDITIONAL LEASED PROPERTIES, WHICH WILL BE REDUCED TO  1.5%  ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF MINING OPERATIONS. THE LEASE IS RENEWABLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL  TEN  -YEAR TERM.  THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT WOULD REPLACE THE OCTOBER 2017 OPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD. THE OCTOBER 2017 OPTION AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT CLOSES.  ON APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ENTERED INTO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT (\"AMENDMENT)\"), WHICH ALLOWS TONOGOLD THE OPTION TO EXTEND THE CLOSING UNTIL AUGUST 30, 2019, UPON THE PAYMENT OF THREE ADDITIONAL $1 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES TONOGOLD TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY THE MONTHLY INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURE (GF COMSTOCK 2) BEGINNING ON MAY 31, 2019, THROUGH THE LATEST POSSIBLE CLOSING OF AUGUST 30, 2019.  ON MAY 22, 2019, THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ENTERED INTO THE SECOND PURCHASE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT (\"SECOND AMENDMENT\"), WHICH ALLOWED TONOGOLD TO FORGO FUNDING THE REMAINING $0.7 MILLION IN CASH PAYMENTS DUE IN MAY, 2019, AS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION FOR THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT REMAINS AT $11.5 MILLION IN CASH. THE SECOND AMENDMENT REQUIRED THAT TONOGOLD ISSUE THE COMPANY $3.5 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES (\"PREFERRED SHARES\"), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRICING CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. TONOGOLD ALSO ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $0.4 MILLION IN PREFERRED SHARES AS A COMMITMENT FEE.  THE PREFERRED SHARES WERE ISSUED ON JUNE 7, 2019.  THE OCCIDENTAL GROUP AND GOLD HILL GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS REPRESENT LONGER-TERM EXPLORATION TARGET AREAS THAT CONTAIN MANY HISTORIC MINING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE OVERMAN, CON IMPERIAL, CALEDONIA, AND YELLOW JACKET MINES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT HAS PROVIDED US WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO UTILIZE THE HISTORICAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IDENTIFY DRILLING TARGETS WITH SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL.  24  FIGURE 2 - COMSTOCK MINING'S PROPERTY AND MINERAL LEASES IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT  25  EXPLORATION & DEVELOPMENT  THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM, DISTRICT-WIDE PLANS CONTEMPLATE THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC, IDENTIFIED GEOLOGICAL TARGET AREAS ACROSS THE DISTRICT, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS GROUPED INTO THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA, THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREAS, AND SPRING VALLEY, OCCIDENTAL, AND GOLD HILL GROUPS OF EXPLORATION TARGETS. THESE EXPLORATION TARGETS REPRESENT OVER 7 MILES OF MINERALIZED STRIKE LENGTH, WITH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL GRADES OF GOLD AND SILVER.  FIGURE 3 - GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PRIORITY EXPLORATION TARGETS  26  LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA  IN DECEMBER, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED UNANIMOUS APPROVAL FROM THE STOREY COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO EXTEND ITS LANDMARK SPECIAL USE PERMIT (\u201cSUP\u201d) FOR MINING AND PROCESSING FOR THE LUCERNE MINE PROJECT FOR THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE, 20-YEAR TERM, EXTENDING THE ORIGINAL, 10-YEAR PERMIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2034. THIS PERMIT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, PROGRESSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PERMIT APPROVALS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORY, AND ITS EXTENSION STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PARTNER IN LUCERNE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT, TONOGOLD RESOURCES, INC.  THE AMENDMENT SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDS THE DURATION OF THE PERMITTED AND ALLOWABLE USES FOR THE ENTIRE LUCERNE MINE PROJECT, INCLUDING THE LUCERNE MINE AND RESOURCE AREA AND THE FULLY PERMITTED AMERICAN FLAT PROCESSING AREA. THE PERMIT APPLIES TO BOTH SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND MINING, PROCESSING, MILLING, EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER ANCILLARY USES.  AS DESCRIBED IN THE CURRENT PROJECTS SECTION, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL THE LUCERNE PROPERTIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL SELL ITS INTERESTS IN THE LUCERNE PROPERTIES AND RELATED PERMITS.  DAYTON RESOURCE AREA  THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADVANCE THE DAYTON PROJECT TO FULL FEASIBILITY, WITH A PRODUCTION READY MINE PLAN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF COMMENCING THAT WORK. THIS WORK HAS NOT YET COMMENCED. THE PLAN INCLUDES EXPANDING THE CURRENT RESOURCE AT THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND CONTINUING SOUTHERLY INTO SPRING VALLEY WITH INCREMENTAL EXPANSION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE EXPLORATION AND DEFINITION DRILLING OF TARGETS IDENTIFIED BY THE PRIOR CONVENTIONAL PERCUSSION, RC AND DIAMOND CORE DRILL PROGRAMS AND MAGNETIC, IP AND RESISTIVITY GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS (SEE FIGURE 4).  THE COMPANY HAS RETAINED THE INDEPENDENT MINING ADVISORY FIRM OF BEHRE DOLBEAR TO PRODUCE A NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) COMPLIANT TECHNICAL REPORT FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN 2019. THE REPORTING SCOPE INCLUDES AN UPDATED, ROBUST MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE, PLANS FOR EXPANDING AND FURTHER DEVELOPING THE MINERAL RESOURCE, AND MOST OF THE PREREQUISITE DATA FOR A SUBSEQUENT PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT (\u201cPEA\u201d). THE PEA IS THE FIRST MAJOR STEP IN DETERMINING OVERALL ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT.  THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED A MINERAL RESOURCE FOR DAYTON AS PART OF A BROADER TECHNICAL REPORT FOR THE COMSTOCK MINE PROJECT, BUT THIS NEW, BEHRE DOLBEAR COMMISSIONED TECHNICAL REPORT REPRESENTS THE FIRST STAND-ALONE NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT TO BE PUBLISHED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA. SINCE OUR LAST DAYTON RESOURCE ESTIMATE, THE COMPANY HAS.  \u2022  INCREASED THE DAYTON PROJECT PROPERTY POSITION, BOTH MINING CLAIMS AND PRIVATE LAND, INCLUDING MORE THAN 350 ACRES OF CONTIGUOUS PRIVATE LANDS SUITABLE FOR A DEDICATED MINERAL PROCESSING SITE;  \u2022  ACHIEVED A LANDMARK, LYON COUNTY MASTER PLAN AND ZONING CHANGE THAT BROADENED THE POTENTIAL LAND USES AND RESTORED MINING AS AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR THE HISTORIC MINING PATENTS;  \u2022  SUBMITTED OUR PROJECT ESTIMATES FOR DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS BY SRK CONSULTING IN BOTH RENO AND DENVER OFFICES;  \u2022  RESTORED SEVERAL HISTORIC DAYTON MINE PORTALS FOR SAFE EXPLORATION OF THE ACCESSIBLE MINE WORKINGS;  \u2022  COMPLETED UNDERGROUND GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE ACCESSIBLE MINE WORKINGS AND COMPLETED UNDERGROUND SAMPLING;  \u2022  COMPLETED SIGNIFICANT ASSAYING AND OTHER ANALYSIS FOR FURTHERING THE GEOLOGIC INTERPRETATION;  \u2022  IDENTIFIED NEW, BROADER MINERALIZED ZONES AND STRUCTURES;  \u2022  DRILLED 408 SHALLOW HOLES TOTALING 30,819 FEET, IDENTIFYING NEW MINERALIZED STRUCTURES COVERED BY SHALLOW ALLUVIUM;  \u2022  IMPROVED, MEANINGFULLY, THE GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE AREA;  \u2022  EXPANDED TRIALS BY CYCLADEX, A STRATEGIC INVESTEE, TESTING THEIR PATENTED, CYCLADEXTRIN LIXIVIANT, A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR OUR DAYTON MATERIALS; AND  \u2022  COMMENCED TRIALS WITH ITRONICS, INC., USING THEIR KAM-THIO METALLURGICAL RECOVERY PROCESSES, ANOTHER POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR OUR DAYTON MATERIALS.  THE NEW INFORMATION IS SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLETELY UPDATED, DETAILED, THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE DAYTON PROJECT. THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNICAL STAFF IS CURRENTLY COMPILING A DETAILED STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW RESOURCE MODEL. THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION IS LEADING TO A LIST OF HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE DRILL TARGETS TO FURTHER DEFINE AND EXPAND THE MINERAL RESOURCE.  27  IN-HOUSE DAYTON ENGINEERING AND MINE PLANNING HAVE RESULTED IN PROFILING VARIOUS ECONOMIC SHELLS WITH MULTIPLE CUTOFF GRADE SCENARIOS. MULTIPLE LAYOUT PLANS FOR THE MINE AND CORRESPONDING PROCESSING FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CONCEPTUALLY DEVELOPED AND LOCATED ON LANDS 100% PRIVATELY HELD BY THE COMPANY, THUS SIMPLIFYING AND SHORTENING THE CRITICAL PERMITTING CHAIN. THE NEW TECHNICAL REPORT WILL PROVIDE NOT ONLY A NEW RESOURCE ESTIMATE, BUT ALSO A PHASED DRILLING PLAN FOR FURTHER DEFINING AND EXPANDING THE RESOURCE FOR SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE MINING.  DAYTON METALLURGY  THE DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO METALLURGICAL TESTING BY INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES AS WELL AS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ON-SITE LAB. COLUMN TESTS WERE CONDUCTED BY MCCLELLAND LABORATORIES IN 2011 ON MEDIUM GRADE AND HIGH GRADE COMPOSITES FROM THE DAYTON PIT AREA, AT 1\u201d AND 1\u20442\u201d CRUSH SIZES FOR EACH SAMPLE. THE GOLD RECOVERY AFTER 154 DAYS AVERAGED 86.7% FOR GOLD AND 47.4% FOR SILVER. THE FINAL REPORT STATED THAT AT THE END OF THE TEST, THE CURVES HAD FLATTENED, BUT RECOVERY WAS STILL INCREASING.  IN EARLY 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S IN-HOUSE LAB RAN COLUMN TESTS ON BULK SAMPLES FROM THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA: GLORY HOLE MID-GRADE, GLORY HOLE HIGH-GRADE, AND DAYTON ADIT. TWO COLUMNS WERE LOADED FROM EACH BULK SAMPLE. THE RECOVERY AFTER 74 DAYS AVERAGED 84% FOR GOLD AND 55% FOR SILVER. THE METAL RECOVERY HAD NOT STOPPED AFTER 74 DAYS, BUT THE DAILY INCREMENTAL INCREASES WERE BELOW THE COMPANY\u2019S ANALYTICAL DETECTION LIMITS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO TEST ALTERNATIVE, GREENER TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROCESSING THE MINERALIZED MATERIAL FROM THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA. THIS INCLUDES TRIALS BY CYCLADEX, INC., A STRATEGIC INVESTEE, IN PART FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, FOR EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THEIR PATENTED, CYCLADEXTRIN LIXIVIANT, A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEGUN TRIALS WITH ITRONICS, INC., TO TEST THEIR KAM-THIO METALLURGICAL RECOVERY PROCESSES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR PROCESSING THE DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL. PREVIOUS TRIALS BY ITRONICS SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS FOR RECOVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE RESIDUAL SILVER FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUSLY LEACHED MATERIAL. THE COMPANY DELIVERED A BULK SAMPLE OF HIGHER-GRADE, DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL TO ITRONICS IN AUGUST. ITRONICS HAS BEGUN TESTING WITH TWO CLEAR OBJECTIVES: FIRST, TO MODEL THE SAME PROCESS FLOW SHEET THAT THEY DEVELOPED FOR PROCESSING THE PREVIOUSLY LEACHED MATERIAL, AND SECOND, TO TEST THE ABILITY OF THE KAM-THIO LIQUID TO RECOVER SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES OF GOLD AS WELL AS SILVER. A FINAL RESULT FROM THE TESTING WILL BE A PROPOSED PROCESSING FLOW SHEET AND SCREENING LEVEL ECONOMICS FOR USE IN THE PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE.  THE ONGOING TESTING OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES UNDERPINS THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE. A BREAKTHROUGH WITH ANY OF THESE CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER, FASTER RECOVERIES WITH REDUCED WASTE, AS WELL AS A STREAMLINED PERMITTING PROCESS AND LOWER LONG-TERM RECLAMATION COSTS.  28  FIGURE 4 - DAYTON AND SPRING VALLEY MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICS WITH INTERPRETED VEINS AND STRUCTURES  29  DAYTON - SPRING VALLEY GROUP TARGETS  SPRING VALLEY IS SOUTH OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, EXTENDING TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF STATE ROUTE 341. THE VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS AND STRUCTURAL CONTROLS OF THE MINERALIZATION DEFINED TO DATE FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA ARE KNOWN TO CONTINUE SOUTH INTO SPRING VALLEY. POTENTIALLY ECONOMIC GOLD MINERALIZATION HAS BEEN INTERCEPTED IN SEVERAL WIDELY SPACED HOLES DRILLED DURING PRIOR SPRING VALLEY DRILLING PROGRAMS.  GROUND MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS IDENTIFIED A LINEAR ANOMALOUS CORRIDOR, DEFINED BY A SERIES OF RELATIVE MAGNETIC LOWS. ALTERED VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BY LIMITED DRILLING AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL MINERALIZED ZONES, THE GLOBAL DAYTON RESOURCE FOOT PRINT IS OUTLINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE TECHNICAL REPORT AUTHORED BY BEHRE DOLBEAR IN JANUARY 2013. THE EXPLORATION OF SPRING VALLEY WILL INCLUDE PHASED DRILLING PROGRAMS THAT WILL CONTINUE SOUTHERLY FROM SR 341 TO THE HISTORIC DANEY MINE SITE (FIGURE 5), WITH A POTENTIAL STRIKE LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 9,600 FEET.  FIGURE 5 - DAYTON AND SPRING VALLEY GROUP TARGETS  30  THE TECHNICAL STAFF REVIEWED HISTORIC GEOLOGIC AND GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES AND PRIOR DRILL PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED UPON THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND EXTENSIONS SOUTH INTO SPRING VALLEY. THE FEW DRILL HOLES THAT WERE COMPLETED IN SPRING VALLEY INTERCEPTED ALTERED MIOCENE VOLCANIC ROCK KNOWN TO HOST THE ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE. SPECIFIC DRILL HOLES THAT ENCOUNTERED HIGHLY MINERALIZED ZONES ARE HIGHLIGHTED ON FIGURE 4. COLLECTIVELY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED AND ARE TARGETED FOR FUTURE DRILLING. THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA HAS OPEN ENDED ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DRILL HOLES TO DELINEATE THE GEOMETRY FOR MINE PLANNING. SOUTH OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA THE LIMITED DRILLING COUPLED WITH THE GEOPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION INDICATES THE TARGETED EXPLORATION MODEL EXTENDS AN ADDITIONAL 8,000 FEET (LENGTH OF GEOPHYSICAL MAGNETIC SURVEY) INTO SPRING VALLEY.  GROUND MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS IDENTIFIED A LINEAR ANOMALOUS CORRIDOR, DEFINED BY A SERIES OF RELATIVE MAGNETIC LOWS. ALTERED VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BY LIMITED DRILLING AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL MINERALIZED ZONES. SELECTED DRILL HOLE INTERCEPTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED (SEE FIGURE 4). THE MID-LEVEL MAGNETIC LOWS DEFINE A ZONE (UP TO 500 FEET WIDE) BEGINNING AT THE DAYTON RESOURCE AND CONTINUING SOUTHERLY APPROXIMATELY 8,000 FEET (LENGTH OF GEOPHYSICAL MAGNETIC SURVEY) TOWARDS THE DANEY PATENT. THE ZONE IS FURTHER DEFINED BY THE TRACE OF INTERPRETED NORTH/SOUTH TRENDING VEIN SWARMS DEPICTED ON FIGURE 4. IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA THE INCREASED DENSITY OF THE VEIN SWARMS WITH INTERSECTING CROSS STRUCTURES HAS BEEN INDICATIVE TO HOST THE HIGHER GRADES AND LARGER VOLUMES OF ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION. THIS SCENARIO IS PART OF THE EXPLORATION MODEL AND HAS GENERATED A MULTIPLE DRILL TARGET ENVIRONMENT.  THE SPRING VALLEY EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO TARGET AREAS THAT HAVE SIMILAR MAGNETIC SIGNATURES OF KNOWN ECONOMIC GRADE MINERALIZATION. THE MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY WAS FURTHER STUDIED AND A STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION WAS DEVELOPED THAT ILLUSTRATED MULTIPLE CROSS CUTTING STRUCTURES (COLORED GREEN) THAT ARE OBLIQUE TO THE SOUTHERLY PROJECTED NORTH/SOUTH VEIN TREND (COLORED RED), REFER TO FIGURE 4. THOUGH RARE DUE TO ALLUVIAL COVER, THE OUTCROPPING QUARTZ VEINS AND OUTCROPPING CROSSCUTTING STRUCTURES HAD DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSTIC MAGNETIC SIGNATURES. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURES AND VEINS WERE DERIVED BY CONNECTING THESE SPECIFIC MAGNETIC ATTRIBUTES AS IDENTIFIED ON EACH 25-METER SPACED SURVEY LINE. SIMILAR STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND WERE FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC GRADES OF MINERALIZATION.  PELEN-SUTRO TUNNEL COMPANY ACQUISITION  IN JANUARY 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED 1,475,410 SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK AS INITIAL PAYMENT TO ACQUIRE 25% OF THE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OF PELEN, LLC. PELEN, LLC IS THE 100% OWNER OF THE HISTORIC SUTRO TUNNEL COMPANY THAT OWNS THE TOWN OF SUTRO, THE HISTORIC 6-MILE SUTRO TUNNEL, THE FEDERAL LAND GRANTS AND MINING RIGHTS SPANNING 1,000 FEET ON EACH SIDE OF THE 6-MILE SPAN, THE RIGHTS TO THE TUNNEL\u2019S WATER AND THE PATENTED MINING CLAIMS AND PRIVATE LANDS ON GOLD HILL.  THE PURCHASE OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS WILL CLOSE BY DECEMBER 31, 2019, ONCE THE SELLER OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS HAS RECEIVED TOTAL CASH PROCEEDS OF AT LEAST $585,000 EITHER THROUGH SALE OF THE RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK RECEIVED OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY. IF ALL OF THE SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THE SELLER OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND THE AGGREGATE PROCEEDS RECEIVED ARE LESS THAN $585,000, THEN THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE SHORTFALL IN EITHER ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK OR CASH, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTION.  THE COMPANY ISSUED 1,758,181 ADDITIONAL SHARES IN NOVEMBER, 2018.  NON-MINING REAL ESTATE  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL THE INDUSTRIAL PARK AND WATER RIGHTS, FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF  $7.2 MILLION  . AFTER CLOSING, THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A RIGHT TO RECEIVE  3%  OF THE AMOUNT OF THE CARRIED INTEREST THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE FUND THAT PURCHASED SUCH PARTY IS DUE TO RECEIVE AFTER ALL COSTS, EXPENSES, INVESTOR HURDLES AND RETURNS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE GROSS PROCEEDS ARISING FROM ANY GAIN WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROPERTY BY THE BUYER.  DOWNTOWN SILVER SPRINGS, LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, HOLDS A CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY  160  ACRES OF CENTRALLY LOCATED LAND IN SILVER SPRINGS, NEVADA. ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR  $2.5 MILLION  , AS ADJUSTED, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, FOR ANY ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS MADE BY THE PURCHASER OF THE OPTION TO THE SELLER OF THE PROPERTY, ON BEHALF OF DTSS. AFTER CLOSING, THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A RIGHT TO RECEIVE  3%  OF THE AMOUNT OF THE CARRIED INTEREST THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE FUND THAT PURCHASED SUCH PROPERTY IS DUE TO RECEIVE AFTER ALL COSTS, EXPENSES, INVESTOR HURDLES AND RETURNS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE GROSS PROCEEDS ARISING FROM ANY GAIN WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROPERTY BY THE BUYER.  31  THE GOLD HILL HOTEL IS LISTED FOR SALE FOR $1 MILLION. THE GOLD HILL HOTEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY CASH POSITIVE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE DANEY RANCH IS LISTED FOR SALE FOR $3.9 MILLION.  OUTLOOK  OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PLANNED AT $3.8 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION OF THAT AMOUNT CURRENTLY BEING REIMBURSED UNDER THE EXISTING TONOGOLD OPTION AGREEMENT. WE ANTICIPATE AN ADDITIONAL $1 MILLION IN ANNUALIZED SAVINGS, OR A TOTAL OF $2.2 MILLION ANNUALLY, UPON CLOSING THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 31, 2019. THIS WOULD RESULT IN AN EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE ENTIRETY OF OUR APPROXIMATELY $7.9 MILLION  OUTSTANDING SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURE OBLIGATION, ELIMINATING MORE THAN $1 MILLION OF ANNUALIZED INTEREST EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S 2019 PLANS INCLUDE ADVANCING THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CERTAIN MINING AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLABORATED ON, WITH PARTNERS SUCH AS HTX TECHNOLOGIES INC., CYCLADEX INC. AND ITRONICS, AND ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MERCURY RECLAMATION AND RECOVERIES, THAT PRESENT NEARER TERM REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, ENHANCE OUR POTENTIAL PROJECT ECONOMIC FEASIBILITIES AND PRESENT ADDITIONAL REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO COMMENCED COLLABORATING ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING ACTIVITIES IN SILVER CITY ASSOCIATED WITH DAYTON MINE PLANNING. THE COMPANY ALSO PLANS ON UPDATING DAYTON\u2019S CURRENT RESOURCE ESTIMATE AND COMMENCE ACTIVITIES FOR OBTAINING THE LOCAL PERMITS FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT IN 2019. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO CONTINUE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES SOUTHERLY INTO SPRING VALLEY WITH INCREMENTAL EXPLORATION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE EXPLORATION AND DEFINITION DRILLING OF TARGETS IDENTIFIED BY GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS, SURFACE MAPPING, PRIOR DRILLING AND DEEPER GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT ALL LEAD TO PUBLISHING AN UPDATED, NI 43-101 COMPLIANT, MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT AND EXPANDED EXPLORATION IN SPRING VALLEY IN 2019.

DESCRIPTION  OF BUSINESS  BACKGROUND  WELLNESS  CENTER USA, INC. (\u201cWCUI\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN JUNE 2010 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  NEVADA. THE COMPANY INITIALLY ENGAGED IN ONLINE SPORTS AND NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY  EXPANDED INTO ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL SECTORS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING PSORIA-SHIELD INC.  (\u201cPSI\u201d), NATIONAL PAIN CENTERS, INC. (\u201cNPC\u201d) AND STEALTHCO INC. (\u201cSCI\u201d), D/B/A STEALTH MARK,  INC. ON AUGUST 11, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NPC, WHICH  HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2016.  THE  COMPANY CURRENTLY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (I) DISTRIBUTION OF TARGETED ULTRA VIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY  DEVICES FOR DERMATOLOGY; AND (II) AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE SEGMENTS ARE OPERATED, RESPECTIVELY,  THROUGH PSI AND SCI.  PSI  PSI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JUNE 17, 2009. ON AUGUST 24, 2012, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF STOCK IN PSI. PSI IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND OPERATED BY PSORIA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY  LLC, AN ILLINOIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\u201cPDC\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN WCUI/PSI AND THE MEDICAL ALLIANCE, INC.,  A FLORIDA CORPORATION (\u201cTMA\u201d).  17  ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2018, PSI AND TMA ENTERED INTO A WITHDRAW AND MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THEIR JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES OF THE JOINT VENTURE TOTALED  TO $405,383. UPON TERMINATION, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY WROTE-OFF THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S  SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES AND RECORDED A LOSS FROM DECONSOLIDATION OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST OF $405,383.  IN  DECEMBER 2018, PSI ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH GEN2 TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, LICENSING AND/OR SALE OF  PSI TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH NEO. PSI AND GEN2 WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF NEO, OWNING  50.5% AND 36.0%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE UNITS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF NEO. AN ADDITIONAL 13.5% OF SUCH UNITS  WILL BE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE AS INCENTIVES FOR KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS. UNTIL SUCH SHARES ARE DISTRIBUTED, THE COMPANY  CONTROLS 68% OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND GEN2 THE REMAINING 32%. PSI AND GEN2 WILL MANAGE NEO\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. PSI  WILL CONTRIBUTE PSI TECHNOLOGY TO NEO AND GEN2 WILL CONTRIBUTE $700,000. REPAYMENT OF THE $700,000 INVESTMENT BY GEN2 WILL BEGIN  THROUGH AND UPON THE DATE WHICH NEO HAS REALIZED AND RETAINED CUMULATIVE NET INCOME/DISTRIBUTABLE CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $300,000.  DISTRIBUTIONS THEREAFTER WILL BE MADE TO PSI, GEN2 AND OTHER MEMBERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE UNIT OWNERSHIP, AT THE  TIMES AND IN THE MANNER DETERMINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE MANAGERS, IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. GEN2 CONSISTS OF ACCREDITED INVESTORS,  AND INVESTMENT PARTICIPATION FROM SEVERAL WCUI OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, INCLUDING CALVIN R. O\u2019HARROW AND ROY M. HARSCH.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, GEN2 HAD RECEIVED $475,000 OF INVESTMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEO AND THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE  OF $323,000 TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND $152,000 TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  NEO RECORDED A NET LOSS OF $2,006 RELATING TO ITS OPERATIONS.  PSI  DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS A TARGETED ULTRAVIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE CALLED THE PSORIA-LIGHT. THE PSORIA-LIGHT  IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN TARGETED PUVA PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND UVB PHOTOTHERAPY AND IS DESIGNED TO TREAT CERTAIN SKIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING  PSORIASIS, VITILIGO, ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA), SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS, AND LEUKODERMA.  PSORIASIS,  ECZEMA, AND VITILIGO, ARE COMMON SKIN CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO TREAT, AND OFTEN CAUSE THE CLIENT SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOSOCIAL  STRESS. CLIENTS MAY UNDERGO A VARIETY OF TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE SKIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ROUTINE CONSUMPTION OF SYSTEMIC  AND BIOLOGIC DRUG THERAPIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY TOXIC, REDUCE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION, AND COME WITH A HOST OF CHEMOTHERAPY-LIKE  SIDE EFFECTS. ULTRAVIOLET (UV) PHOTOTHERAPY IS A CLINICALLY VALIDATED ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR THESE DISORDERS.  TRADITIONALLY,  \u201cNON-TARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED BY LAMPS THAT EMITTED EITHER UVA OR UVB LIGHT TO BOTH DISEASED AND  HEALTHY SKIN. WHILE SUNBLOCKS OR OTHER UV BARRIERS MAY BE USED TO PROTECT HEALTHY SKIN, THE UV ADMINISTERED IN THIS MANNER MUST  BE LOW DOSAGE TO AVOID EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE OF HEALTHY TISSUE. TODAY, \u201cTARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES ADMINISTER  MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES OF LIGHT ONLY TO AFFECTED TISSUE, RESULTING IN \u201cCLEARANCE\u201d IN THE CASE OF PSORIASIS AND ECZEMA,  AND \u201cREPIGMENTATION\u201d IN THE CASE OF VITILIGO, AT MUCH FASTER RATES THAN NON-TARGETED (LOW DOSAGE) UV TREATMENTS.  TARGETED  UV TREATMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED TO SMALLER TOTAL BODY SURFACE AREAS, AND ARE THEREFORE USED TO TREAT THE MOST INTENSE  PARTS OF A CLIENT\u2019S DISEASE. NON-TARGETED UV TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY USED AS A FOLLOW-UP AND FOR MAINTENANCE, CAPABLE OF  TREATING LARGE SURFACES OF THE BODY. EXCIMER LASER DEVICES (UVB AT 308NM) ARE EXPENSIVE AND CONSUME DANGEROUS CHEMICALS (XENON  AND CHLORINE). MERCURY LAMP DEVICES (UVB AND/OR UVA) REQUIRE EXPENSIVE LAMP REPLACEMENTS REGULARLY AND REQUIRE SPECIAL DISPOSAL  (DUE TO MERCURY CONTENT). ADDITIONALLY, MERCURY LAMP DEVICES TYPICALLY DELIVER WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT BELOW 300NM. WHILE WITHIN  THE UVB SPECTRUM, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT WAVELENGTHS BELOW 300NM PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE \u201cSUNBURN\u201d TYPE SIDE EFFECTS  THAN DO WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 300 AND 320NM WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT IN THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT.  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT IS A TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE THAT PRODUCES UVB LIGHT BETWEEN 300 AND 320 NM AS WELL AS UVA LIGHT BETWEEN  350 AND 395NM. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSUMPTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR REQUIRE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL, AND IS COST EFFECTIVE  FOR CLINICIANS, WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PATIENT ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE AND ADVANCED  FEATURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE NON-TARGETED AND TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING  USED BY DERMATOLOGISTS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE UTILIZATION OF DEEP NARROW-BAND  UVB (\u201cNB-UVB\u201d) LEDS AS LIGHT SOURCES; THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH UVA OR NB-UVB THERAPEUTIC WAVELENGTHS; AN INTEGRATED  HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL CAMERA AND CLIENT RECORD INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES; THE ABILITY TO EXPORT TO AN EXTERNAL USB MEMORY DEVICE  A PDF FILE OF TREATMENT INFORMATION INCLUDING A PATENT PENDING GRAPH THAT INCLUDES DIGITAL IMAGES PLOTTED AGAINST USER TRACKED  METRICS WHICH CAN BE SUBMITTED TO IMPROVE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS; AN ACCESSORY PORT AND ABILITY TO UPDATE SOFTWARE; EASE OF PLACEMENT  AND PORTABILITY; ADVANCED TREATMENT SITE DETECTION SAFETY SENSOR; INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT; A WARRANTY WHICH INCLUDES THE  UV LAMP(S); AND A NON-CHANGEABLE TREATMENT LOG (THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HIPPA INFORMATION).  18  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS: A BASE CONSOLE, A COLOR DISPLAY WITH TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL, AND A HAND-HELD DELIVERY  DEVICE WITH A CONDUIT (OR TETHER) BETWEEN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND THE BASE CONSOLE. PSI REQUIRES CLEARANCE BY THE UNITED STATES  FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS PERMISSION FROM  TUV SUD AMERICA INC., PSI\u2019S NOTIFIED BODY, TO AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE PSORIA-LIGHT IN ORDER TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE  IN COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  TO  OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE AND PERMISSION TO AFFIX THE CE MARK, PSI WAS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT EMC AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY TESTING, WHICH  IT COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. PSI RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2011 (NO. K103540) AND WAS GRANTED PERMISSION  TO AFFIX THE CE MARK ON NOVEMBER 10, 2011. IN ITS 510(K) APPLICATION WITH THE FDA (APPLICATION NUMBER K103540), PSI ASSERTED THAT  THE PSORIA-LIGHT WAS \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT\u201d IN INTENDED USE AND TECHNOLOGY TO TWO PREDICATE DEVICES, THE X -TRAC  EXCIMER LASER, WHICH HAS WIDE ACCEPTANCE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING LITERATURE AND HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE IN THE U.S., AND THE  DUALIGHT, ANOTHER COMPETING TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE.  PSI  HAS ESTABLISHED AN ISO 13485 COMPLIANT QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE PSORIA-LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRST AUDITED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.  THIS SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE PSI DEVICES WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN A CONTROLLED AND RELIABLE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT ITS RESOURCES  FOLLOW SIMILAR PRACTICES AND IS REQUIRED FOR SALES IN COUNTRIES REQUIRING A CE MARK. PSI HAS ALSO RECEIVED CERTIFIED SPACE TECHNOLOGY  DESIGNATION FROM THE SPACE FOUNDATION, BASED ON PSI\u2019S INCORPORATION OF ESTABLISHED NASA-FUNDED LED TECHNOLOGY.  PSI  BEGAN PSORIA-LIGHT BETA DEPLOYMENT IN JANUARY 2012. IT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND STRATEGIES WILL EVER BE SUCCESSFUL. PSI\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTANCE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS  AND CLIENTS OF PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT AS A PREFERRED METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS AND OTHER UV-TREATABLE SKIN CONDITIONS.  PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO CLIENTS, WITHOUT DEMONSTRABLE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS OR SAFETY ISSUES,  AS EVIDENCED BY MORE THAN 10,000 TREATMENTS COMPLETED ON MORE THAN 1,000 CLIENTS, DOMESTICALLY AND MEXICO, SINCE 2012. IN ORDER  FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE PSI OPERATIONS, IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND IT WILL HAVE TO SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATE INTEGRATION  OF PSI OPERATIONS WITHOUT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING CONTINUATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS.  SCI  SCI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ON MARCH 18, 2014. SCI ACQUIRED CERTAIN STEALTH MARK ASSETS ON APRIL  4, 2014 AND OPERATES AS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. IT IS A TENNESSEE-BASED PROVIDER OF: A) STEALTH MARK ENCRYPTION  AND AUTHENTICATION SOLUTIONS OFFERING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN THE SECURITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT VERTICAL SECTORS  (MICROPARTICLES)  ,  AND B) ADVANCED DATA INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFERING PROPRIETARY, UNPRECEDENTED, AND ACTIONABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES,  AND AGENCIES ON A GLOBAL SCALE (  ACTIVEDUTYTM).

ITS TECHNOLOGY IS APPLICABLE TO A WIDE RANGE OF INDUSTRIES AFFECTED BY COUNTERFEITING, DIVERSION AND  THEFT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PHARMACEUTICALS, DEFENSE/AEROSPACE, AUTOMOTIVE, ELECTRONICS, TECHNOLOGY, CONSUMER AND PERSONAL  CARE GOODS, DESIGNER PRODUCTS, BEVERAGE/SPIRITS, AND MANY OTHERS.  SCI  DELIVERS THE CLIENT A COMPLETE, SIMPLE TO USE, EASY TO IMPLEMENT, AND COST EFFECTIVE TURNKEY SYSTEM THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT  TO COMPROMISE. SCI\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND INTELLIGENT MICROPARTICLE MARKS THAT  ARE UNDUPLICATABLE AND UNDETECTABLE TO THE HUMAN EYE. THESE TAGGANTS ARE CREATED WITH PROPRIETARY MATERIALS THAT CREATE UNIQUE  NUMERICAL CODES THAT ARE ASSIGNED MEANING BY THE CLIENT AND ARE MACHINE READABLE WITHOUT THE USE OF RARE EARTH OR CHEMICAL TRACERS.  THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN COVERT AND OVERT OPERATIONS WITH EASY TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND DO-IT-YOURSELF IN-THE-FIELD FORENSIC  CALIBER VERIFICATION.  19  IN  APRIL 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARY, SCI, CONCLUDED LICENSING OF A PATENT FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THE NEXT GENERATION OF  STEALTH MARK. WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS AT THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABS, THE PATENT SIGNIFIES DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT  WILL GENERATE AN INVISIBLE MARKING SYSTEM WITH ATTRIBUTES CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN THE ANTI-COUNTERFEIT MARKETPLACE TODAY. THE  FORMULA AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN SHOWN THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING TO BE RESILIENT TO MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND CAN BE USED ON  A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS FROM WOVEN AND NON-WOVEN FABRICS, CARDBOARD, METAL, CONCRETE, PLASTICS, LEATHER, WOOD, AND PAPER. IN  ADDITION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ENCODED WITH THE SYSTEM MAKES COUNTERFEITING DIFFICULT.  ACTIVEDUTYTM  SCI\u2019S  ACTIVEDUTYTM DATA INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFER UNIQUE, UNPRECEDENTED, ACTIONABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES, AND AGENCIES  ON A GLOBAL SCALE. COMPRISED OF A SUITE OF POWERFUL ANALYTICAL TOOLS, INCLUDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY,  THE SERVICE PROVIDES TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE TO CLIENTS. ACTIVEDUTYTM IS ADAPTABLE TO A BROAD SPECTRUM OF ILLICIT ACTIVITIES  WITHIN BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SECTORS SUCH AS, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, COUNTERFEITING, SEX AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING, MONEY LAUNDERING,  AND A VARIETY OF OTHER MARKETS.  THE  PROPRIETARY ALGORITHMIC ARCHITECTURE OF ACTIVEDUTYTM CREATES THE FIRST SYSTEMIC REPORTING MECHANISM TO DELIVER STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL  RESULTS SUPPORTED BY AN INTENSE WORLDWIDE ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR. THE ACTIVEDUTYTM GLOBAL FRAMEWORK IS HEURISTIC  IN NATURE, CAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING BIG DATA ACROSS THE DIGITAL SPECTRUM AND SPEAKS ALL THE MAJOR LANGUAGES. UP UNTIL NOW, THERE  HAS NOT EXISTED A UNIFIED SYSTEM THAT COULD ACTIVELY MEASURE THIS LIFECYCLE THAT IS A COLLECTION OF DISCREET AND SEEMINGLY RANDOM  BEHAVIORS OF CRIMINALS ANYWHERE WITHIN THE DIGITAL DOMAIN. CRIMINALS CHANGE THEIR IDENTITIES BUT NOT THEIR BASIC BEHAVIORS.  DURING  THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, SCI WAS MANAGED BY ITS CEO, RICKY HOWARD. MR. HOWARD BROUGHT TO SCI OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE  IN OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE POSITIONS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES RANGING FROM ENTREPRENEURIAL STARTUPS TO FORTUNE 500  COMPANIES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  R&D EXPENSES VARY PRIMARILY WITH THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENT WAFERS PROCESSED, THE COST OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT DEDICATED TO NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONNEL COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE LEAD TIMES NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, WE TYPICALLY BEGIN TO PROCESS WAFERS BEFORE COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TESTING. DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT IS DEEMED COMPLETE WHEN IT IS QUALIFIED THROUGH REVIEWS AND TESTS FOR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. R&D EXPENSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF PRODUCT QUALIFICATION.  R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2018. R&D EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 16% HIGHER AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR R&D COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS, INCREASES IN VOLUMES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-QUALIFICATION WAFERS, INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN CAPITAL SPENDING, AND INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS.  WE SHARE THE COST OF CERTAIN PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PARTNERS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS TO JOINTLY DEVELOP 3D NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES WITH INTEL. OUR R&D EXPENSES WERE REDUCED BY REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THESE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER ARRANGEMENTS OF  $6 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , $23 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AND $53 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF  2018  . THE DECREASE IN R&D REIMBURSEMENTS IN THE THIRD AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN OUR JOINT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH INTEL FOR 3D NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE AND INTEL AGREED TO INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS OF 3D NAND. OUR 3D NAND JOINT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTEL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE AND INTEL WILL NO LONGER JOINTLY DEVELOP 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGY BEYOND THE SECOND GENERATION. WE EXPECT DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECOND GENERATION OF 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGY TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  30  INCOME TAXES  OUR INCOME TAX (PROVISION) BENEFIT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.  THIRD QUARTER  SECOND QUARTER  THIRD QUARTER  NINE MONTHS  2019  2019  2018  2019  2018  INCOME TAX (PROVISION) BENEFIT, EXCLUDING ITEMS BELOW  $125  $(216  )  $(78  )  $(469  )  $(161  )  UTILIZATION OF AND OTHER CHANGES IN NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF MMJ, MMT, AND MTTW  (32  )  (78  )  (35  )  (162  )  (78  )  REPATRIATION TAX, NET OF ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  42  14  222  9  (1,113  )  RELEASE OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ON NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF OUR U.S. OPERATIONS  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  1,337  REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECTING LOWER U.S. CORPORATE TAX RATES  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  (133  )  $135  $(280  )  $109  $(622  )  $(148  )  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  (18.9  )%  14.7%  (2.9  )%  9.7%  1.5%  THE DECREASE IN OUR INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A REDUCTION IN PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND A RELATED REDUCTION IN THE FOREIGN MINIMUM TAX. THE REPATRIATION TAX AND OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS WERE ALSO REDUCED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO TAX ACT-RELATED LAW CHANGES. OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FOREIGN MINIMUM TAX.  WE OPERATE IN A NUMBER OF TAX JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITES STATES, INCLUDING SINGAPORE, WHERE WE HAVE TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH EXPIRE IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2034, THAT ARE CONDITIONAL, IN PART, UPON MEETING CERTAIN BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT THRESHOLDS. THE EFFECT OF TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS REDUCED OUR TAX PROVISION BY  $71 MILLION  (BENEFITING OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY  $0.06  ) FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , $244 MILLION ($0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AND  $527 MILLION  (  $0.43  PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2018.  OTHER  INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED 44% AND 72% AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED 64% AND 70% AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL SPENDING.  FURTHER DISCUSSION OF OTHER OPERATING AND NON-OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES CAN BE FOUND IN \"ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 EQUITY PLANS, OTHER OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, AND OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\" NOTES.  31  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING OBTAINED FROM CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES FOR EFFICIENTLY FUNDING OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ONGOING OPERATIONS. WE EXPECT, FROM TIME TO TIME, TO ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF FINANCING TRANSACTIONS FOR SUCH PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES. WE HAVE AN UNDRAWN REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JULY 2023 AND PROVIDES FOR BORROWINGS OF UP TO  $2.50 BILLION  . WE EXPECT THAT OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND AVAILABLE FINANCING WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AT LEAST THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH, ACHIEVE OPERATING EFFICIENCIES, AND MAINTAIN PRODUCT QUALITY, WE MUST CONTINUE TO INVEST IN MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES, FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, AND R&D. WE ESTIMATE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2019 FOR PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, NET OF PARTNER CONTRIBUTIONS, TO BE APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION, FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSITIONS AND PRODUCT ENABLEMENT. THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS FOR 2019 WILL VARY DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS. AS OF  MAY 30, 2019  , WE HAD COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $3.9 BILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID WITHIN ONE YEAR.  OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AUTHORIZED THE DISCRETIONARY REPURCHASE OF UP TO  $10 BILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, BEGINNING IN OUR FISCAL 2019, WHICH WE MAY PURCHASE ON A DISCRETIONARY BASIS THROUGH OPEN-MARKET PURCHASES, BLOCK TRADES, PRIVATELY-NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS, DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, AND/OR PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1 TRADING PLANS, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR ONGOING DETERMINATION OF THE BEST USE OF AVAILABLE CASH. THE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION DOES NOT OBLIGATE US TO ACQUIRE ANY COMMON STOCK. IN THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019, WE REPURCHASED  4 MILLION  AND  67 MILLION  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RESPECTIVELY, FOR  $157 MILLION  AND  $2.66 BILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, UNDER AN ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT, RULE 10B5-1 PLANS, AND THROUGH OPEN MARKET REPURCHASES.  IN JANUARY 2019, WE EXERCISED OUR OPTION TO ACQUIRE INTEL'S INTEREST IN IMFT AND, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019, INTEL SET THE CLOSING DATE OF THE TRANSACTION TO OCCUR ON OCTOBER 31, 2019. AT CLOSING, WE EXPECT TO PAY INTEL APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION IN CASH FOR INTEL'S NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN IMFT AND IMFT MEMBER DEBT. AS OF  MAY 30, 2019  , CURRENT DEBT INCLUDED  $858 MILLION  OF IMFT MEMBER DEBT.  CASH AND MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS TOTALED  $7.86 BILLION  AND  $7.28 BILLION  AS OF  MAY 30, 2019  AND AUGUST 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE, FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK, WE INVEST THROUGH HIGH-CREDIT-QUALITY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND BY POLICY GENERALLY LIMIT THE CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT EXPOSURE BY RESTRICTING THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS WITH ANY SINGLE OBLIGOR.  LIMITATIONS ON THE USE OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS  MMJ GROUP  .  CASH AND MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS AS OF  MAY 30, 2019  INCLUDED $564 MILLION HELD BY THE MMJ GROUP. AS A RESULT OF THE CORPORATE REORGANIZATION PROCEEDINGS OF MMJ INITIATED IN MARCH 2012, AND FOR SO LONG AS SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE CONTINUING, THE MMJ GROUP IS PROHIBITED FROM PAYING DIVIDENDS TO US. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO AN ORDER OF THE TOKYO DISTRICT COURT, THE MMJ GROUP CANNOT MAKE LOANS OR ADVANCES, OTHER THAN CERTAIN ORDINARY COURSE ADVANCES, TO US WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE TOKYO DISTRICT COURT AND MAY, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, BE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE LEGAL TRUSTEE. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OF THE MMJ GROUP ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR USE BY US IN OUR OTHER OPERATIONS. FURTHERMORE, CERTAIN USES OF THE ASSETS OF THE MMJ GROUP, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, MAY REQUIRE CONSENT OF MMJ'S TRUSTEES AND/OR THE TOKYO DISTRICT COURT.  IMFT  .  CASH AND MARKETABLE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED  $184 MILLION  HELD BY IMFT AS OF  MAY 30, 2019  . OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS FUNDS HELD BY IMFT TO FINANCE OUR OTHER OPERATIONS IS SUBJECT TO AGREEMENT BY INTEL AND CONTRACTUAL LIMITATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION  .  REVENUE IS PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED AT A POINT IN TIME WHEN CONTROL OF THE PROMISED GOODS IS TRANSFERRED TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION WE EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS. CONTRACTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS ARE GENERALLY SHORT-TERM IN DURATION AT FIXED, NEGOTIATED PRICES WITH PAYMENT GENERALLY DUE SHORTLY AFTER DELIVERY. WE ESTIMATE A LIABILITY FOR RETURNS USING THE EXPECTED VALUE METHOD BASED ON HISTORICAL RATES OF RETURN. IN ADDITION, WE GENERALLY OFFER PRICE PROTECTION TO OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WHICH IS A FORM OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION THAT DECREASES THE TRANSACTION PRICE.

THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHARE PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THIS VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY AND SEEK TO MANAGE OUR COSTS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, U.K. POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606). IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION, WE PRESENT TOTAL REVENUES AND NO LONGER REPORT REVENUES BEFORE REIMBURSEMENTS (NET REVENUES). THIS CHANGE HAS NO IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME BUT DOES AFFECT RATIOS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, SUCH AS OPERATING MARGIN. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE FISCAL 2019 PRESENTATION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  4%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . REVENUES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONG, RESULTING IN GROWTH ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  , REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN RESOURCES, STRONG IN PRODUCTS, COMMUNICATION, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE, AND SOLID IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE EXPERIENCED VERY STRONG GROWTH IN GROWTH MARKETS, STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND SOLID GROWTH IN EUROPE. REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN OUTSOURCING AND STRONG IN CONSULTING DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINED COMPETITIVE, WE EXPERIENCED PRICING IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE USE THE TERM \u201cPRICING\u201d TO MEAN THE CONTRACT PROFITABILITY OR MARGIN ON THE WORK THAT WE SELL.  IN OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  3%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  7%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES, STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS AND MODEST GROWTH IN COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES  . OUR CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR DIGITAL-, CLOUD- AND SECURITY-RELATED SERVICES AND ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DELIVER COST SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO INTEGRATE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GROW AND TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES.  IN OUR OUTSOURCING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  10%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES, PRODUCTS AND COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY, STRONG GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND SOLID GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMAND TO ASSIST CLIENTS WITH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DIGITAL-RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD ENABLEMENT. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING THEIR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENCY.  AS WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  5%  AND  4%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY WITHIN RECENT  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2019  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2019  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  3%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH  THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE CONTINUE TO HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HEADCOUNT, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH SERVE OUR CLIENTS, TO APPROXIMATELY  482,000  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED  TO APPROXIMATELY  449,000  AS OF  MAY 31, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  18%  , UP FROM  17%  IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN SKILL SETS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, COMPENSATION INCREASES  BECOME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1ST OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  WE STRIVE TO ADJUST PRICING AND/OR THE MIX OF RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF COMPENSATION INCREASES ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO: KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR AMOUNTS OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING; RECOVER INCREASES IN COMPENSATION; DEPLOY OUR EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY ON A TIMELY BASIS; MANAGE ATTRITION; AND/OR EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE AND UTILIZE NEW EMPLOYEES.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASU NO. 2017-07, COMPENSATION\u2014RETIREMENT BENEFITS (TOPIC 715), WHICH REQUIRED US TO RECLASSIFY CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF PENSION COSTS FROM OPERATING EXPENSES TO NON-OPERATING EXPENSES. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE FISCAL 2019 PRESENTATION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  GROSS MARGIN (REVENUES LESS COST OF SERVICES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES) FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  31.8%  , COMPARED WITH  31.2%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . GROSS MARGIN FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  WAS  30.7%  COMPARED WITH  30.4%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER NON-PAYROLL AND LABOR COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WERE  16.3%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  AND  16.0%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  15.9%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  AND  15.8%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . WE CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR THESE COSTS AND IMPLEMENT COST-MANAGEMENT ACTIONS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  FISCAL 2018  , SALES AND MARKETING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED  40  BASIS POINTS  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SELLING AND OTHER BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED  10  BASIS POINTS.  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  FISCAL 2018  , SALES AND MARKETING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES WERE FLAT  , AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES INCREASED  20  BASIS POINTS.  OPERATING MARGIN (OPERATING INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES) FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  15.5%  , COMPARED WITH  15.3%  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  WAS  14.7%  , COMPARED WITH  14.5%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED ASU NO. 2016-16, INCOME TAXES (TOPIC 740). UPON ADOPTION, WE RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $2.1 BILLION, AND WE WILL RECOGNIZE INCREMENTAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE GOING FORWARD AS THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE UTILIZED. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  WERE  25.6%  AND  21.1%  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  WERE  34.4%  AND  27.2%  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, WE RECORDED A TAX CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENACTMENT OF THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF $41 MILLION AND $178 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. ABSENT THESE CHARGES AND $81 MILLION OF EXPENSE FROM A NON-U.S. TAX LAW CHANGE RECORDED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018 WOULD HAVE BEEN 26.8% AND 21.3%, RESPECTIVELY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION SEE NOTE 9 (INCOME TAXES) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\u201d.  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $1.93  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $1.60  FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WERE  $5.62  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED WITH  $4.76  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . THE IMPACT OF TAX LAW CHANGES DECREASED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY $0.19 AND $0.40 DURING THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  WOULD HAVE BEEN $1.79 AND $5.16, RESPECTIVELY.  WE HAVE PRESENTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX LAW CHANGES IN  FISCAL 2018  , AS WE BELIEVE DOING SO FACILITATES UNDERSTANDING AS TO BOTH THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES AND OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ABSENT THIS CHARGE, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  WOULD HAVE BEEN  21.3%  . THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER BENEFITS FROM FINAL DETERMINATIONS OF PRIOR YEAR TAXES, CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF EARNINGS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEAR TAX LIABILITIES. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXPENSE FROM THE ADOPTION OF FASB ASU NO. 2016-16 AND LOWER TAX BENEFITS FROM SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  $0.46  COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE OF  $0.37  FROM HIGHER REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,  $0.05  FROM LOWER WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING,  $0.04  FROM LOWER NON-OPERATING EXPENSE AND  $0.01  FROM A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

IN GENERAL  WE PRESENTLY SELL OUR ANCILLARY GAMING  PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT CONTEMPLATE SELLING AND LEASING OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE.  WE ARE CONTROLLED BY TWO INDIVIDUALS (OUR  PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) WHO DEVOTE APPROXIMATELY 25 HOURS A WEEK EACH OF THEIR TIME TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS OBTAINED THE LICENSE  FOR THE MANUFACTURING, SALE, MARKETING AND LICENSING OF THE FOUR ROULETTE PATENTS, AND CERTAIN OTHER PATENTS, WE HAVE NOT YET APPLIED  TO ANY STATE GAMING COMMISSION(S) TO SEEK APPROVAL TO SELL ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT, AS OF YET, ARRANGED FOR ANY  LINES OF CREDIT, AND WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS, WRITTEN OR ORAL, FROM OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR SHAREHOLDERS TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH  ADVANCES, LOANS OR OTHER FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRED MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES  AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES  NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY WORKING CAPITAL TO SUPPORT EXISTING OPERATIONS THROUGH 2018 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS HAD MINIMAL REVENUES AND  ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $897,156 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2018. OUR PRIMARY CAPITAL SOURCE WILL BE LOANS FROM STOCKHOLDERS. WE ARE SEEKING  TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THE PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES, MANUFACTURE AND SELL GAMING EQUIPMENT THAT WILL GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED A LOSS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED  EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

WE ALSO PLAN TO FILE ALL REQUIRED  PERIODIC REPORTS AND TO MAINTAIN OUR STATUS AS A FULLY-REPORTING COMPANY UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

NO SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY MANAGEMENT,  THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS OR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS, PROPOSALS, ARRANGEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS WITH  RESPECT TO THE SALE OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES.

UNLESS EXPRESSLY STATED OTHERWISE, THE COMPARISONS PRESENTED IN THIS MD&A REFER TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. OUR MD&A IS PRESENTED AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  COMPANY OVERVIEW  \u2022  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  \u2022  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  \u2022  FINANCIAL POSITION  \u2022  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  \u2022  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  \u2022  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  WE HAVE PROVIDED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\"GAAP\"), AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT THAT ARE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE MEASURES MAY BE USEFUL IN PERFORMING MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATING RESULTS, TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, AND HOW MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE BUSINESS. RECONCILIATIONS OF ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE REPORTED GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SECTION TITLED \"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\" WITHIN THIS MD&A. THESE MEASURES, HOWEVER, SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO ANY OTHER MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THIS MD&A SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MD&A INCLUDED IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . THIS DISCUSSION CONTAINS VARIOUS \"FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\" WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND WE REFER READERS TO THE SECTION TITLED \"FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\" LOCATED AT THE END OF PART I, ITEM 2 OF THIS REPORT FOR MORE INFORMATION.  COMPANY OVERVIEW  THE TORO COMPANY (\"TORO\") IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND MARKETING PROFESSIONAL TURF MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES, TURF IRRIGATION SYSTEMS, LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT AND LIGHTING PRODUCTS, SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS, AGRICULTURAL IRRIGATION SYSTEMS, RENTAL, SPECIALTY AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT, AND RESIDENTIAL YARD AND SNOW THROWER PRODUCTS. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH A NETWORK OF DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS, MASS RETAILERS, HARDWARE RETAILERS, EQUIPMENT RENTAL CENTERS, HOME CENTERS, AS WELL AS ONLINE (DIRECT TO END-USERS). WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, WELL-BUILT, AND DEPENDABLE PRODUCTS SUPPORTED BY AN EXTENSIVE SERVICE NETWORK. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR NET SALES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN, AND WE EXPECT WILL CONTINUE TO BE, ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS. WE DEFINE NEW PRODUCTS AS THOSE INTRODUCED IN THE CURRENT AND PREVIOUS TWO FISCAL YEARS.  WE CLASSIFY OUR OPERATIONS INTO TWO REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: PROFESSIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL. OUR REMAINING ACTIVITIES ARE PRESENTED AS \"OTHER\" DUE TO THEIR INSIGNIFICANCE. THESE OTHER ACTIVITIES CONSIST OF EARNINGS (LOSS) FROM OUR WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES, CORPORATE ACTIVITIES, AND THE ELIMINATION OF INTERSEGMENT REVENUES AND EXPENSES.  ON APRIL 1, 2019 (\"CLOSING DATE\"), PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER DATED FEBRUARY 14, 2019 (\"MERGER AGREEMENT\"), WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF THE CHARLES MACHINE WORKS, INC. (\"CMW\"), A PRIVATELY HELD OKLAHOMA CORPORATION. CMW DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, AND SELLS A RANGE OF PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS TO SERVE THE UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION MARKET, INCLUDING HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL DRILLS, WALK AND RIDE TRENCHERS, UTILITY LOADERS, VACUUM EXCAVATORS, ASSET LOCATORS, PIPE REHABILITATION SOLUTIONS, AND AFTER-MARKET TOOLS. CMW PROVIDES INNOVATIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT BROADEN AND STRENGTHEN OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND EXPANDS OUR DEALER NETWORK, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING A COMPLEMENTARY GEOGRAPHIC MANUFACTURING FOOTPRINT. THE TRANSACTION WAS STRUCTURED AS A MERGER, PURSUANT TO WHICH A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TORO MERGED WITH AND INTO CMW, WITH CMW CONTINUING AS THE SURVIVING ENTITY AND A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TORO. AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY SECURITIES OF CMW WERE CANCELED AND NOW ONLY REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE THE APPLICABLE CONSIDERATION AS DESCRIBED IN THE MERGER AGREEMENT. THE PRELIMINARY AGGREGATE MERGER CONSIDERATION WAS  $679.6 MILLION  (\"PURCHASE PRICE\"), AND REMAINS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL CASH, DEBT AND WORKING CAPITAL IN THE BUSINESS OF CMW AT THE CLOSING DATE. SUCH CUSTOMARY ADJUSTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED DURING FISCAL  2019  . WE FUNDED THE PRELIMINARY PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ACQUISITION BY USING A COMBINATION OF CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND BORROWINGS FROM OUR UNSECURED SENIOR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REGARDING THE ACQUISITION AND THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS UTILIZED TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE, REFER TO NOTE 2,  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  , AND NOTE 6,  INDEBTEDNESS  , IN THE NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART 1. ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  OUR NET SALES INCREASED  9.9 PERCENT  , FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS OF FISCAL  2018.  PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED  9.6 PERCENT  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARISON, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR, TORO-BRANDED RENTAL AND SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION, AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT AND IRRIGATION PRODUCTS. PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED  10.8 PERCENT  FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISON, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR IRRIGATION AND AG-IRRIGATION PRODUCTS.  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED  9.4 PERCENT  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARISON, MAINLY DUE TO THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR WALK POWER MOWERS, SNOW PRODUCTS, AND PORTABLE POWER PRODUCTS AND INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS OF OUR POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS. RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED  6.4 PERCENT  FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISON, PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR WALK POWER MOWERS AND SNOW PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS OF OUR POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS.  NET EARNINGS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $115.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $131.3 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW RESULTING IN INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS. NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $175.1 MILLION  COMPARED TO REPORTED NET EARNINGS OF  $153.9 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE FISCAL  2018  PERIOD. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (\"TAX ACT\") DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS, EACH AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW.  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $126.0 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $130.3 MILLION  FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD,  A DECREASE  OF  3.3 PERCENT  . THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING AND WARRANTY EXPENSE. ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $182.7 MILLION  COMPARED TO ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS OF  $182.4 MILLION  IN THE COMPARABLE FISCAL  2018  PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  0.1 PERCENT  . THE INCREASE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING AND WARRANTY EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX. RECONCILIATIONS OF ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE REPORTED GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SECTION TITLED \"NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\" WITHIN THIS MD&A.  WE INCREASED OUR CASH DIVIDEND FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  BY 12.5 PERCENT TO $0.225 PER SHARE COMPARED TO THE $0.20 PER SHARE CASH DIVIDEND PAID IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018.  INVENTORY LEVELS  INCREASED  $216.5 MILLION  , OR  54.8 PERCENT  , AS OF THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $243.7 MILLION  OF INVENTORIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE CMW ACQUISITION ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND HIGHER WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY. HIGHER WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY AND LOWER FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY WERE BOTH DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER RESULTING IN PRODUCTION DOWNTIME. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE  INCREASED  $99.0 MILLION  , OR  30.0 PERCENT  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $65.6 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE CMW ACQUISITION AND TIMING OF SALES ACROSS THE PROFESSIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS NEAR QUARTER END, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AS OF THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , FIELD INVENTORY LEVELS WERE HIGHER THAN THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT FIELD INVENTORY FOR OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS DRIVEN BY STRONG CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND IN ANTICIPATION OF THE UPCOMING TURF SEASON, AND HIGHER RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT WALK POWER MOWER INVENTORY DRIVEN BY STRONG CHANNEL DEMAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT INVENTORY DUE TO PRODUCTION DELAYS CAUSED BY SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER, AND LOWER RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT SNOW PRODUCT INVENTORY DRIVEN BY STRONG RETAIL DEMAND DUE TO HIGHER SNOWFALL TOTALS IN KEY REGIONS.  THREE-YEAR EMPLOYEE INITIATIVE - \"VISION 2020\"  OUR CURRENT MULTI-YEAR EMPLOYEE INITIATIVE, \"VISION 2020\", WHICH BEGAN WITH OUR 2018 FISCAL YEAR, FOCUSES ON DRIVING PROFITABLE GROWTH WITH AN EMPHASIS ON INNOVATION AND SERVING OUR CUSTOMERS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL GENERATE FURTHER MOMENTUM FOR THE ORGANIZATION. THROUGH OUR VISION 2020 INITIATIVE, WE HAVE SET SPECIFIC INTERNAL GOALS INTENDED TO HELP US DRIVE ORGANIC REVENUE AND OPERATING EARNINGS GROWTH.  ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH  WE INTEND TO PURSUE STRATEGIC GROWTH OF OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES AND PRODUCT CATEGORIES WITH AN ORGANIC REVENUE GOAL TO ACHIEVE AT LEAST FIVE PERCENT OR MORE OF ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN EACH OF THE THREE FISCAL YEARS OF THIS INITIATIVE. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS GOAL, WE DEFINE ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH AS THE INCREASE IN NET SALES, LESS NET SALES FROM ACQUISITIONS THAT OCCURRED IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.  OPERATING EARNINGS  ADDITIONALLY, AS PART OF OUR VISION 2020 INITIATIVE GROWTH GOALS, WE HAVE SET AN OPERATING EARNINGS GOAL TO INCREASE OPERATING EARNINGS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES TO 15.5 PERCENT OR HIGHER BY THE END OF FISCAL 2020.  NET SALES  WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED NET SALES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $962.0 MILLION  , UP  9.9 PERCENT  COMPARED TO  $875.3 MILLION  IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  . THE NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT WALK POWER MOWERS, SNOW PRODUCTS, AND PORTABLE POWER PRODUCTS, CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR, TORO-BRANDED RENTAL AND SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION, AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND, AND INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT DUE TO UNFAVORABLE SPRING WEATHER CONDITIONS AND PRODUCTION DELAYS CAUSED BY SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES, AS WELL AS DECREASED SALES OF IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  , WORLDWIDE CONSOLIDATED NET SALES WERE  $1,565.0 MILLION  , UP  9.9 PERCENT  FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE YEAR-TO-DATE NET SALES INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND, AND STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR WALK POWER MOWERS AND SNOW PRODUCTS. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR IRRIGATION AND AG-IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  NET SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS INCREASED BY  5.8 PERCENT  AND  1.9 PERCENT  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RESULTED IN  A DECREASE  OF OUR NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY  $7.6 MILLION  AND  $10.6 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  . THE NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE QUARTER COMPARISON WAS MAINLY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER IN KEY REGIONS. THE NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT, AND HIGHER SALES OF RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT WALK POWER MOWERS DRIVEN BY STRONG RETAIL DEMAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER IN KEY REGIONS AND FEWER SHIPMENTS OF RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE MAJOR OPERATING COSTS AND OTHER INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, AS WELL AS PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES.  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES EXCLUDES THE AMORTIZATION OF CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, INCLUDING THE INVENTORY FAIR VALUE STEP-UP AMOUNT AND BACKLOG INTANGIBLE ASSET.

THE FISCAL 2018 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX ACT FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018, INCLUDING THE PROVISIONAL REMEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $20.5 MILLION, AND THE PROVISIONAL CALCULATION OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX, WHICH RESULTED IN A DISCRETE TAX CHARGE OF $12.6 MILLION, PAYABLE OVER EIGHT YEARS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ONE-TIME CHARGES RESULTING FROM THE TAX ACT, THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS DRIVEN BY A  $5.7 MILLION  YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM A BLENDED 23.3 PERCENT IN FISCAL  2018  TO 21.0 PERCENT IN FISCAL  2019.  THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EXCLUDES INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND ONE-TIME CHARGES INCURRED UNDER THE TAX ACT. THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WAS  19.9 PERCENT  , COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  23.0 PERCENT  IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  WAS  20.2 PERCENT  , COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  22.6 PERCENT  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL  2018  . THE DECREASES IN THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISONS WERE DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM A BLENDED 23.3 PERCENT IN FISCAL  2018  TO 21.0 PERCENT IN FISCAL  2019  AND THE IMPACT OF THE INCLUSION OF CMW WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

THE DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS FOR THE QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS, AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. YEAR-TO-DATE NET EARNINGS IN FISCAL  2019  WERE  $175.1 MILLION  , OR  $1.62  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO  $153.9 MILLION  , OR  $1.41  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARATIVE PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF THE TAX ACT ON NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2018, IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN THE BENEFIT OF THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS, AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX.  ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS EXCLUDES INTEGRATION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED EXPENDITURES AND CERTAIN PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE TAX BENEFIT FOR THE EXCESS TAX DEDUCTION FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, AND ONE-TIME CHARGES INCURRED UNDER THE TAX ACT. ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $126.0 MILLION  , OR  $1.17  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO  $130.3 MILLION  , OR  $1.20  PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  ,  A DECREASE  OF  2.5 PERCENT  PER DILUTED SHARE. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS DECREASE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARISON INCLUDED THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS, AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION AS  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  A RESULT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING AND WARRANTY EXPENSE. ADJUSTED NON-GAAP NET EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  WERE  $182.7 MILLION  , OR  $1.69  PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO  $182.4 MILLION  , OR  $1.68  PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE PERIOD,  AN INCREASE  OF  0.6 PERCENT  PER DILUTED SHARE. THE INCREASE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING AND WARRANTY EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS, AND UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX.

THE PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR, TORO-BRANDED RENTAL AND SPECIALTY CONSTRUCTION, AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT DUE TO UNFAVORABLE SPRING WEATHER CONDITIONS AND PRODUCTION DELAYS CAUSED BY SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER, AS WELL AS DECREASED SALES OF IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES GROWTH FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  WAS LARGELY DUE TO INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, AND CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR LANDSCAPE CONTRACTOR AND SNOW AND ICE MANAGEMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY CHANNEL AND RETAIL DEMAND. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER SHIPMENTS OF OUR IRRIGATION AND AG-IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  SEGMENT EARNINGS  PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT EARNINGS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  DECREASED BY  9.0 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  AND DECREASED TO  20.7 PERCENT  FROM  25.0 PERCENT  WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER COMPARISON. FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  , PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASED BY  1.2 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND DECREASED TO  20.2 PERCENT  FROM  22.6 PERCENT  WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD COMPARISON. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASES FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISONS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COST INCREASES AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED RAW MATERIALS AND COMPONENT PARTS; THE IMPACT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW RESULTING IN THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS OF  $9.5 MILLION  AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE, INDIRECT SALES AND MARKETING, INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION, AND ENGINEERING EXPENSE; UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX; SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER RESULTING IN MANUFACTURING INEFFICIENCIES; INCREASED FREIGHT COSTS, AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED NET PRICE REALIZATION DRIVEN BY PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, AND LOWER DIRECT MARKETING AND WARRANTY EXPENSE.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT  SEGMENT NET SALES  WORLDWIDE NET SALES FOR OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  9.4 PERCENT  AND  6.4 PERCENT  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIODS. THE RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR WALK POWER MOWERS, SNOW PRODUCTS, AND PORTABLE POWER PRODUCTS, AND INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF OUR ZERO-TURN RIDING MOWERS. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS OF OUR POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  THE RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE COMPARISON WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES AND STRONG RETAIL DEMAND FOR OUR WALK POWER MOWERS AND SNOW PRODUCTS. THESE NET SALES INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED SHIPMENTS OF OUR POPE-BRANDED IRRIGATION PRODUCTS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS IN KEY REGIONS.  SEGMENT EARNINGS  RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  DECREASED  16.2 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , AND WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, DECREASED TO  9.5 PERCENT  FROM  12.4 PERCENT  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASE WAS MAINLY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COSTS AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS, UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, INCREASED WARRANTY EXPENSE, AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, AND DECREASED WAREHOUSING COSTS.  FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  , RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASED  16.5 PERCENT  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, AND WHEN EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, DECREASED TO  9.3 PERCENT  FROM  11.8 PERCENT  . AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF COMMODITY COSTS AND TARIFF-RELATED EXPENSES ON PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND RAW MATERIALS, UNFAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, INCREASED WARRANTY EXPENSE, AND THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF PRICE INCREASES ACROSS OUR PRODUCT LINES, PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES, AND DECREASED WAREHOUSING AND ADVERTISING COSTS.  OTHER ACTIVITIES  OTHER NET SALES  NET SALES FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES INCLUDE SALES FROM OUR WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES LESS SALES FROM THE PROFESSIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS TO THE DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES. NET SALES FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE PERIODS OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED BY  $3.6 MILLION  AND  $4.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, MAINLY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF OUR GOLF AND GROUNDS EQUIPMENT THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY DRIVEN BY INCREMENTAL SALES AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF A NORTHEASTERN U.S. DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.  OTHER OPERATING LOSS  THE OPERATING LOSS FOR OUR OTHER ACTIVITIES INCREASED  $12.9 MILLION  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $10.6 MILLION  OF INTEGRATION AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, INTEREST EXPENSE INCURRED ON HIGHER OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE AND FUNDING OF OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND AMOUNTS DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, EACH TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, AND HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF A NORTHEASTERN U.S. DISTRIBUTION COMPANY.  THE OTHER SEGMENT LOSS INCREASED  $18.6 MILLION  FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL  2019  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $12.2 MILLION  OF INTEGRATION AND TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW, HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND INTEREST EXPENSE INCURRED ON HIGHER OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RESULTING FROM THE ISSUANCE AND FUNDING OF OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND AMOUNTS DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, EACH TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND HIGHER EARNINGS FROM OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN RED IRON.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL POSITION  WORKING CAPITAL  OUR STRATEGY CONTINUES TO PLACE EMPHASIS ON IMPROVING ASSET UTILIZATION WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WORKING CAPITAL IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, ADJUSTING PRODUCTION PLANS, AND MAINTAINING OR IMPROVING ORDER REPLENISHMENT AND SERVICE LEVELS TO END-USERS. INVENTORY LEVELS WERE  UP  $216.5 MILLION  , OR  54.8 PERCENT  , AS OF THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $243.7 MILLION  OF INVENTORIES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE CMW ACQUISITION ON APRIL 1, 2019 AND HIGHER WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY. HIGHER WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY AND LOWER FINISHED GOODS INVENTORY WERE BOTH DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES AND INCLEMENT WEATHER RESULTING IN PRODUCTION DOWNTIME. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  $99.0 MILLION  , OR  30.0 PERCENT  , COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO  $65.6 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE CMW ACQUISITION AND TIMING OF SALES ACROSS THE PROFESSIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL SEGMENTS NEAR QUARTER END, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED  $87.8 MILLION  , OR  28.9 PERCENT  , AS OF THE END OF OUR  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2018  , MAINLY DUE TO NEGOTIATING MORE FAVORABLE PAYMENT TERMS WITH SUPPLIERS AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL INITIATIVES AND THE ASSUMPTION OF  $36.6 MILLION  OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AS PART OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW.  CASH FLOW  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  $25.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET EARNINGS AND LOWER INVENTORY LEVELS DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER AND SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES RESULTING IN PRODUCTION DOWNTIME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR BENEFIT OF EXTENDING ACCOUNTS PAYABLE TERMS WITH SUPPLIERS AS A COMPONENT OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL INITIATIVES. CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED  $658.6 MILLION  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO CASH UTILIZED FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CMW AND A NORTHEASTERN U.S. DISTRIBUTION COMPANY. CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  INCREASED  $630.4 MILLION  COMPARED TO CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  , MAINLY DUE TO CASH PROVIDED BY BORROWINGS UNDER OF OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AND AMOUNTS DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO FUND THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND REDUCED CASH UTILIZED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES TO FACILITATE OUR FOCUS ON REPAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MORE CASH UTILIZED FOR REPAYMENTS OF AMOUNTS DRAWN ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR BUSINESSES ARE SEASONALLY WORKING CAPITAL INTENSIVE AND REQUIRE FUNDING FOR PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIALS USED IN PRODUCTION, REPLACEMENT PARTS INVENTORY, PAYROLL AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FACILITIES, EXPANSION AND RENOVATION OF EXISTING FACILITIES, AS WELL AS FOR FINANCING RECEIVABLES FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE NOT FINANCED WITH RED IRON OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES HISTORICALLY INCREASE BETWEEN JANUARY AND APRIL AS A RESULT OF TYPICALLY HIGHER SALES VOLUMES AND EXTENDED PAYMENT TERMS MADE AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, AND TYPICALLY DECREASE BETWEEN MAY AND DECEMBER WHEN PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FUNDS AVAILABLE THROUGH EXISTING, AND POTENTIAL FUTURE, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS AND FORECASTED CASH FLOWS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR OUR ANTICIPATED WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INVESTMENTS, DEBT REPAYMENTS, QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, ALL AS APPLICABLE, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  , CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE APPROXIMATELY  $105.2 MILLION.  SEASONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE FINANCED FROM OPERATIONS, CASH ON HAND, AND WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR $600.0 MILLION UNSECURED SENIOR FIVE-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES IN JUNE 2023, AS APPLICABLE. INCLUDED IN OUR $600.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS A $10.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $30.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWINGLINE LOANS. AT OUR ELECTION, AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE NAMED BORROWERS ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE ELECTION OF THE LENDERS TO FUND SUCH INCREASE, THE AGGREGATE MAXIMUM PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE FACILITY MAY BE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT UP TO $300.0 MILLION. FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND OTHER LAWFUL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACQUISITIONS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, SUBJECT IN EACH CASE TO COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS DESCRIBED BELOW.  OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (OTHER THAN SWINGLINE LOANS), IF APPLICABLE, BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD THAT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE BETTER OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO (AS MEASURED QUARTERLY AND DEFINED AS THE RATIO OF TOTAL INDEBTEDNESS TO CONSOLIDATED EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES PLUS DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE) AND DEBT RATING OF TORO. SWINGLINE LOANS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FACILITY BEAR INTEREST AT A RATE DETERMINED BY THE SWINGLINE LENDER OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD THAT IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE BETTER OF THE LEVERAGE RATIO AND DEBT RATING OF TORO. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. OUR DEBT RATING FOR LONG-TERM UNSECURED SENIOR, NON-CREDIT ENHANCED DEBT WAS UNCHANGED DURING THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL  2019  BY STANDARD AND POOR'S RATINGS GROUP AT BBB AND BY MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE AT BAA3. IF OUR DEBT RATING FALLS BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE AND/OR OUR LEVERAGE RATIO RISES ABOVE 1.50, THE BASIS POINT SPREAD WE CURRENTLY PAY ON OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. HOWEVER, THE CREDIT COMMITMENT COULD NOT BE CANCELED BY THE BANKS BASED SOLELY ON A RATINGS DOWNGRADE. FOR THE  THREE  AND  SIX  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MAY 3, 2019  , WE MADE INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.8 MILLION  AND  $1.0 MILLION  ON THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. WE DID NOT INCUR INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT WAS IN PLACE DURING THE  THREE  AND  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2018  , AS THE COMPANY HAD NO BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY THAT WAS IN PLACE AT THAT TIME.  OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONTAINS CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINANCIAL COVENANTS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE AND MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS; AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS, RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, LIENS, AND OTHER MATTERS CUSTOMARILY RESTRICTED IN SUCH AGREEMENTS. MOST OF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM THRESHOLDS AND EXCEPTIONS. UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WE ARE NOT LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT FOR PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AS LONG AS, BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING PRO FORMA EFFECT TO SUCH PAYMENTS, OUR LEVERAGE RATIO FROM THE PREVIOUS QUARTER COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 3.5 (OR, AT OUR OPTION (WHICH WE MAY EXERCISE TWICE DURING THE TERM OF THE FACILITY) AFTER CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS WITH AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION IN EXCESS OF $75.0 MILLION, FOR THE FIRST FOUR QUARTERS FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE OF SUCH OPTION, IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 4.0), PROVIDED THAT IMMEDIATELY AFTER GIVING EFFECT OF ANY SUCH PROPOSED ACTION, NO DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT WOULD EXIST. AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  , WE WERE NOT LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT FOR PAYMENTS OF CASH DIVIDENDS AND COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS RELATED TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  , AND WE EXPECT TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS DURING THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019  . IF WE WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH ANY COVENANT REQUIRED BY THIS CREDIT AGREEMENT FOLLOWING THE APPLICABLE CURE PERIOD, THE BANKS COULD TERMINATE THEIR COMMITMENTS UNLESS WE COULD NEGOTIATE A COVENANT WAIVER FROM THE BANKS. IN ADDITION, OUR LONG-TERM SENIOR NOTES, DEBENTURES, TERM LOAN FACILITIES, AND ANY AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY COULD BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A COVENANT WAIVER OR REFINANCE OUR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT.  IN MARCH 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PARTIALLY FUNDING THE PURCHASE PRICE OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND THE RELATED FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACQUISITION. THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR A  $200 MILLION  THREE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY MATURING ON APRIL 1, 2022 AND A  $300 MILLION  FIVE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY MATURING ON APRIL 1, 2024. THE FUNDS UNDER BOTH TERM LOAN FACILITIES WERE RECEIVED ON APRIL 1, 2019 IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLOSING OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. THERE ARE NO SCHEDULED PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY ON THE  $200 MILLION  THREE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY. FOR THE  $300 MILLION  FIVE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE QUARTERLY AMORTIZATION PAYMENTS OF 2.5 PERCENT OF THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL BALANCE BEGINNING WITH THE LAST BUSINESS DAY OF THE THIRTEENTH CALENDAR QUARTER ENDING AFTER APRIL 1, 2019, WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE UNPAID PRINCIPAL BALANCE DUE AT MATURITY. NO PAYMENTS ARE REQUIRED THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF THE  $300 MILLION  FIVE YEAR UNSECURED SENIOR TERM LOAN FACILITY. THE TERM LOAN FACILITIES MAY BE PREPAID AND TERMINATED AT OUR ELECTION AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY OR PREMIUM.  THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, FINANCIAL COVENANTS, SUCH AS THE MAINTENANCE OF MINIMUM INTEREST COVERAGE AND MAXIMUM LEVERAGE RATIOS; AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, LIMIT DISPOSITION OF ASSETS, CONSOLIDATIONS AND MERGERS, RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, LIENS, AND OTHER MATTERS CUSTOMARILY RESTRICTED IN SUCH AGREEMENTS. MOST OF THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MINIMUM THRESHOLDS AND EXCEPTIONS. THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  . OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR OR AN ALTERNATIVE VARIABLE RATE, BASED ON THE HIGHEST OF THE BANK OF AMERICA PRIME RATE, THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE, OR A RATE GENERALLY BASED ON LIBOR, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO AN ADDITIONAL BASIS POINT SPREAD AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT. INTEREST IS PAYABLE QUARTERLY IN ARREARS. FOR THE  THREE  AND  SIX  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MAY 3, 2019  , WE MADE INTEREST PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $1.6 MILLION  ON THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  , WE HAD  $811.1 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS THAT INCLUDED  $100.0 MILLION  OF 7.8 PERCENT DEBENTURES DUE JUNE 15, 2027,  $123.9 MILLION  OF 6.625 PERCENT SENIOR NOTES DUE MAY 1, 2037,  $500.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND  $90.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.

AS OF  MAY 4, 2018  , WE HAD NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT WAS IN PLACE AT THAT TIME. TYPICALLY, OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY IS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM DEBT WITHIN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXTEND THE OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FOR THE FULL-TERM OF THE FACILITY. HOWEVER, IF WE INTEND TO REPAY A PORTION OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, WE RECLASSIFY THE PORTION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT WE INTEND TO REPAY WITHIN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TO CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT WITHIN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  , WE RECLASSIFIED  $90.0 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT WITHIN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED 359,758 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE OPEN MARKET UNDER OUR BOARD AUTHORIZED REPURCHASE PLAN, THEREBY REDUCING OUR TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING. WE EXPECT TO CURTAIL REPURCHASING SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019.  CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS  WHOLESALE FINANCING  OUR RED IRON JOINT VENTURE WITH TCFIF PROVIDES INVENTORY FINANCING TO CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS OF OUR PRODUCTS THAT ENABLES THEM TO CARRY REPRESENTATIVE INVENTORIES OF OUR PRODUCTS. UNDER SEPARATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN RED IRON AND THE DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, RED IRON PROVIDES LOANS TO THE DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS FOR THE ADVANCES PAID BY RED IRON TO US. THE NET AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FINANCED FOR DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  MAY 3, 2019  WERE  $1,031.3 MILLION  . WE ALSO HAVE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE FLOOR PLAN FINANCING TO CERTAIN DEALERS NOT FINANCED THROUGH RED IRON, WHICH INCLUDE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS A RESULT OF OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW. THESE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES FINANCED  $46.3 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES FOR SUCH DEALERS AND DISTRIBUTORS DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  . AS OF  MAY 3, 2019  ,  $159.1 MILLION  OF RECEIVABLES FINANCED BY THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES, EXCLUDING RED IRON, WERE OUTSTANDING.

OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OUR TERM LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AS FURTHER DESCRIBED WITHIN THE SECTION TITLED \"LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\" WITHIN THIS MD&A AND THE FOLLOWING ITEM.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SENIOR NOTES  IN APRIL 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT (\u201cNOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH CERTAIN INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS (\"PURCHASERS\"), PURSUANT TO WHICH WE HAVE AGREED TO ISSUE AND SELL TO THE PURCHASERS, IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING, $100.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.81% SERIES A SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2029 AND $100.0 MILLION IN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 3.91% SERIES B SENIOR NOTES DUE JUNE 15, 2031 (COLLECTIVELY, THE \"NOTES\").

OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ARE DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN OUR MOST RECENTLY FILED ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO SUCH OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROVIDE INVENTORY FINANCING TO CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS NOT FINANCED THROUGH RED IRON RESULTING FROM OUR ACQUISITION OF CMW AND DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL WITHIN THE SECTION TITLED \"CUSTOMER FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\" WITHIN THIS MD&A.  INFLATION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION, DEFLATION, AND CHANGING PRICES. IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , THE AVERAGE COST OF COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS PURCHASED WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE COST OF COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS PURCHASED IN THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . WE STRATEGICALLY WORK TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION ON THE COST OF COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS THAT AFFECT OUR PRODUCT LINES; HOWEVER, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE AVERAGE COST FOR SOME COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS WILL BE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2018  . HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE MITIGATED, AND WE CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT WE WOULD MITIGATE, ANY COMMODITY AND COMPONENT COST INCREASES, IN PART, BY COLLABORATING WITH SUPPLIERS, REVIEWING ALTERNATIVE SOURCING OPTIONS, SUBSTITUTING MATERIALS, UTILIZING LEAN METHODS, ENGAGING IN INTERNAL COST REDUCTION EFFORTS, AND INCREASING PRICES ON SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS, ALL AS APPROPRIATE.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE HAVE PROVIDED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, WHICH ARE NOT CALCULATED OR PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AS INFORMATION SUPPLEMENTAL AND IN ADDITION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE CALCULATED AND PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THESE MEASURES MAY BE USEFUL IN PERFORMING MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF PAST AND PRESENT OPERATING RESULTS, TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR ONGOING OPERATIONS, AND HOW MANAGEMENT VIEWS THE BUSINESS. SUCH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH, THE GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES. THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER FROM SIMILAR MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION OF FINANCIAL MEASURES CALCULATED AND REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AS WELL AS ADJUSTED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES, FOR THE  THREE  AND  SIX  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MAY 3, 2019  AND  MAY 4, 2018  .

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE DISCRETE TAX BENEFITS RECORDED AS EXCESS TAX DEDUCTIONS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION DURING THE  THREE  AND  SIX  MONTH PERIODS ENDED  MAY 3, 2019  AND  MAY 4, 2018.  3  SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX ACT, REDUCED THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35.0 PERCENT TO 21.0 PERCENT, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018, RESULTING IN A BLENDED U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 23.3 PERCENT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018. THIS REDUCTION IN RATE REQUIRED THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY'S NET DEFERRED TAXES AS OF THE DATE OF ENACTMENT. THE TAX ACT ALSO IMPOSED A ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS AND PROFITS OF FOREIGN AFFILIATES. THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE COMPANY'S NET DEFERRED TAXES AND THE ONE-TIME DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX RESULTED IN A COMBINED CHARGE OF  $33.1 MILLION  DURING THE  SIX  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MAY 4, 2018  . NO CHARGES RELATED TO THE TAX ACT WERE RECORDED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  43  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES SINCE OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  . REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7,  MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  , AND PART II, ITEM 8, NOTE 1,  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DATA  , WITHIN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS TO BE ADOPTED  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES  , WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REQUIRES LESSEES TO RECOGNIZE MOST LEASES ON-BALANCE SHEET. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS (\"ROU ASSETS\") AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS U.S. GAAP. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES A GREATER LEVEL OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES REGARDING THE NATURE OF THE ENTITY\u2019S LEASING ACTIVITIES THAN WERE PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED UNDER U.S. GAAP. IN JANUARY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-01,  LEASES (TOPIC 842).  LAND EASEMENT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT FOR TRANSITION TO TOPIC 842  , WHICH PROVIDES AN OPTIONAL TRANSITION PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO NOT EVALUATE EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENTS UNDER THE AMENDED LEASE GUIDANCE. IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-10,  CODIFICATION IMPROVEMENTS TO TOPIC 842 (LEASES)  , WHICH PROVIDES NARROW AMENDMENTS TO CLARIFY HOW TO APPLY CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE NEW LEASE STANDARD. ADDITIONALLY, IN JULY 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-11,  LEASES (TOPIC 842): TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS  , WHICH PROVIDES AN ALTERNATIVE TRANSITION METHOD THAT PERMITS AN ENTITY TO USE THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF ASU NO. 2016-02 AS THE DATE OF INITIAL APPLICATION THROUGH THE RECOGNITION OF A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS UPON ADOPTION. CONSEQUENTLY, AN ENTITY'S REPORTING FOR THE COMPARATIVE PERIODS PRESENTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN WHICH IT ADOPTS THE NEW LEASE STANDARD WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH PREVIOUS U.S. GAAP UNDER ASC TOPIC 840,  LEASES  . ASU NO. 2016-02, AS AUGMENTED BY ASU NO. 2018-01, ASU NO. 2018-10, AND ASU NO. 2018-11 (THE \"AMENDED GUIDANCE\"), WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ON THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTERNAL CONTROLS, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM. THIS CROSS-FUNCTIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM IS TASKED WITH EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE, INCLUDING COMPILING AND ANALYZING EXISTING EXPLICIT LEASE AGREEMENTS, REVIEWING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS FOR EMBEDDED LEASES, DETERMINING THE DISCOUNT RATE TO BE USED IN VALUING ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES UNDER NEW AND EXISTING LEASES, AND ASSESSING THE CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES, BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTERNAL CONTROLS, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS AND ALL APPLICABLE FINANCIAL STATEMENT DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THE AMENDED GUIDANCE. AT THIS POINT IN THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION PROCESS, THE COMPANY HAS COMPILED AND ANALYZED EXISTING EXPLICIT LEASE AGREEMENTS, COMPLETED ITS INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF ITS BUSINESS AND SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS, AND HAS SELECTED ITS THIRD-PARTY LEASE ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE SOLUTION. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING ITS THIRD-PARTY LEASE ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE SOLUTION; ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ON ITS INTERNAL CONTROL ENVIRONMENT; DEVELOPING ITS BUSINESS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING THE DISCOUNT RATE TO BE UTILIZED IN VALUING THE ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES FOR THE COMPANY'S OPERATING LEASES; EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ON ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES, BUSINESS PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS; AND, WHERE APPLICABLE, REVIEWING CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS FOR EMBEDDED LEASES.  THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE AMENDED GUIDANCE ON NOVEMBER 1, 2019, THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, UNDER THE ALTERNATIVE CUMULATIVE EFFECT TRANSITION METHOD. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE ROU ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES FOR ITS OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS WITHIN ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. WHILE THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE AND RELATED IMPLEMENTATION ACTIVITIES ARE ONGOING AND INCOMPLETE, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S EVALUATION PROCESS TO DATE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTERNAL CONTROLS, AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-07,  COMPENSATION - STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING  , WHICH EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF ASC TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS GRANTED TO NONEMPLOYEES IN EXCHANGE FOR GOODS OR SERVICES USED OR CONSUMED IN AN ENTITY'S OWN OPERATIONS AND SUPERSEDES THE GUIDANCE IN ASC TOPIC 505-50. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US COMMENCING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED BUT NOT PRIOR TO ADOPTING ASC TOPIC 606,  REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS  . WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-13, FAIR VALUE  MEASUREMENT (TOPIC 820) - CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  , WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS BY REMOVING, MODIFYING, OR ADDING CERTAIN DISCLOSURES. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED FOR ANY REMOVED OR MODIFIED DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2018-14,  COMPENSATION - RETIREMENT BENEFITS - DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS (TOPIC 715)  , WHICH MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS. THE AMENDED GUIDANCE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2021. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS NEW STANDARD ON ITS CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT ALL OTHER RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS FROM THE FASB THAT WE HAVE NOT NOTED ABOVE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR DO NOT APPLY TO OUR OPERATIONS.  FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION  THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q CONTAINS NOT ONLY HISTORICAL INFORMATION, BUT ALSO FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (\"SECURITIES ACT\"), AND SECTION 21E UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (\"EXCHANGE ACT\"), AND THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAFE HARBOR CREATED BY THOSE SECTIONS. IN ADDITION, WE OR OTHERS ON OUR BEHALF MAY MAKE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS FROM TIME TO TIME IN ORAL PRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING TELEPHONE CONFERENCES AND/OR WEB CASTS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, IN PRESS RELEASES OR REPORTS, ON OUR WEB SITES OR OTHERWISE. STATEMENTS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL ARE FORWARD-LOOKING AND REFLECT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS, AND OFTEN CAN BE IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT AND ELSEWHERE BY USING WORDS SUCH AS \"EXPECT,\" \"STRIVE,\" \"LOOKING AHEAD,\" \"OUTLOOK,\" \"GUIDANCE,\" \"FORECAST,\" \"GOAL,\" \"OPTIMISTIC,\" \"ANTICIPATE,\" \"CONTINUE,\" \"PLAN,\" \"ESTIMATE,\" \"PROJECT,\" \"BELIEVE,\" \"SHOULD,\" \"COULD,\" \"WILL,\" \"WOULD,\" \"POSSIBLE,\" \"MAY,\" \"LIKELY,\" \"INTEND,\" \"CAN,\" \"SEEK,\" \"POTENTIAL,\" \"PRO FORMA,\" OR THE NEGATIVE THEREOF AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS OR FUTURE DATES. OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS GENERALLY RELATE TO OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR ANTICIPATED OPERATING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION; OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND GOALS; THE INTEGRATION OF CMW; AND THE EFFECT OF LAWS, RULES, POLICIES, REGULATIONS, TAX REFORM, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AND OUTSTANDING LITIGATION ON OUR BUSINESS AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED OR IMPLIED. THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE FACTORS KNOWN TO US THAT COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM WHAT WE HAVE ANTICIPATED IN OUR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  \u2022  ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK IN THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE CONDUCT BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET SALES AND EARNINGS, WHICH INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO RECESSIONARY CONDITIONS; SLOW OR NEGATIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES; THE IMPACT OF U.S. FEDERAL DEBT, STATE DEBT AND SOVEREIGN DEBT DEFAULTS AND AUSTERITY MEASURES BY CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES; SLOW DOWN OR REDUCTIONS IN LEVELS OF GOLF COURSE DEVELOPMENT, RENOVATION, AND IMPROVEMENT; GOLF COURSE CLOSURES; REDUCED LEVELS OF HOME OWNERSHIP, CONSTRUCTION, AND SALES; HOME FORECLOSURES; NEGATIVE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE; REDUCED CONSUMER SPENDING LEVELS; INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT RATES; PROLONGED HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES; HIGHER COMMODITY AND COMPONENT COSTS AND FUEL PRICES; INFLATIONARY OR DEFLATIONARY PRESSURES; REDUCED CREDIT AVAILABILITY OR UNFAVORABLE CREDIT TERMS FOR OUR DISTRIBUTORS, DEALERS, AND END-USER CUSTOMERS; HIGHER SHORT-TERM, MORTGAGE, AND OTHER INTEREST RATES; REDUCED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING; AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND EXPECTATIONS.  \u2022  WEATHER CONDITIONS, INCLUDING UNFAVORABLE WEATHER CONDITIONS EXACERBATED BY GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGES OR OTHERWISE, MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR CAUSE DISRUPTIONS IN OUR OPERATIONS, INCLUDING AS A RESULT OF DISRUPTION IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS, OR MAY AFFECT THE TIMING OF DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND/OR OUR ABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCT TO FULFILL CUSTOMER DEMAND, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS.  \u2022  FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE IN THE PAST AFFECTED OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND COULD CONTINUE TO RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR NET SALES AND NET EARNINGS.  \u2022  INCREASES IN THE COST, OR DISRUPTION IN THE AVAILABILITY, OF RAW MATERIALS, COMPONENTS, PARTS AND ACCESSORIES CONTAINING VARIOUS COMMODITIES THAT WE PURCHASE, SUCH AS STEEL, ALUMINUM, PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS-BASED RESINS, LINERBOARD, COPPER, LEAD, RUBBER, ENGINES, TRANSMISSIONS, TRANSAXLES, HYDRAULICS, ELECTRIC MOTORS, AND OTHER COMMODITIES AND COMPONENTS, AND INCREASES IN OUR OTHER COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION COSTS OR INCREASED TARIFFS, DUTIES OR OTHER CHARGES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICIES OR AGREEMENTS HAVE IN THE PAST AFFECTED OUR PROFIT MARGINS AND BUSINESSES AND COULD CONTINUE TO RESULT IN DECLINES IN OUR PROFIT MARGINS AND BUSINESSES.  \u2022  OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE DEPENDENT UPON CERTAIN FACTORS, INCLUDING GOLF COURSE REVENUES AND THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN GOLF COURSE RENOVATIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS; THE LEVEL OF NEW GOLF COURSE DEVELOPMENT AND GOLF COURSE CLOSURES; THE EXTENT TO WHICH PROPERTY OWNERS OUTSOURCE THEIR LAWN CARE AND SNOW AND ICE REMOVAL ACTIVITIES; RESIDENTIAL  45  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY; CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE OF, AND DEMAND FOR, AG-IRRIGATION SOLUTIONS; THE TIMING AND OCCURRENCE OF WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS; DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE RENTAL, SPECIALTY AND UNDERGROUND CONSTRUCTION MARKETS; AVAILABILITY OF CASH OR CREDIT TO PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT CUSTOMERS ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS TO FINANCE NEW PRODUCT PURCHASES; AND THE AMOUNT OF GOVERNMENT REVENUES, BUDGET, AND SPENDING LEVELS FOR GROUNDS MAINTENANCE EQUIPMENT.  \u2022  OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE DEPENDENT UPON CONSUMERS BUYING OUR PRODUCTS AT DEALERS, MASS RETAILERS, AND HOME CENTERS, SUCH AS THE HOME DEPOT, INC.; THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT PLACEMENT AT MASS RETAILERS AND HOME CENTERS; CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING LEVELS; CHANGING BUYING PATTERNS OF CUSTOMERS; AND THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANT SALES OR PROMOTIONAL EVENTS.  \u2022  OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING OUR PROFIT MARGINS AND NET EARNINGS, CAN BE IMPACTED DEPENDING ON THE MIX OF PRODUCTS WE SELL DURING A GIVEN PERIOD, AS OUR PROFESSIONAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS THAN OUR RESIDENTIAL SEGMENT PRODUCTS. SIMILARLY, WITHIN EACH SEGMENT, IF WE EXPERIENCE LOWER SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT GENERALLY CARRY HIGHER PROFIT MARGINS, OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING PROFIT MARGINS AND NET EARNINGS, COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  \u2022  WE INTEND TO GROW OUR BUSINESS IN PART THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING BY OUR RECENTLY COMPLETED ACQUISITION OF CMW, AND ALLIANCES, STRONG CUSTOMER RELATIONS, AND NEW JOINT VENTURES AND PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH COULD BE RISKY AND HARM OUR BUSINESS, REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND OPERATING RESULTS, PARTICULARLY IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE SUCH ACQUISITIONS AND ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES, AND PARTNERSHIPS. IF PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS DO NOT PRODUCE THE EXPECTED RESULTS OR INTEGRATION INTO OUR OPERATIONS TAKES MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE HARMED. WE CANNOT GUARANTEE PREVIOUS OR FUTURE ACQUISITIONS, ALLIANCES, JOINT VENTURES OR PARTNERSHIPS WILL IN FACT PRODUCE ANY BENEFITS.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS TO MEET OUR CUSTOMERS' DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR BUSINESS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE OR OVERESTIMATE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND DO NOT MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INVENTORY LEVELS, OUR NET SALES AND/OR WORKING CAPITAL COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT DECISIONS OF OUR DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL CUSTOMERS.

OVERVIEW  BUSINESS SEGMENTS  WE OPERATE IN FOUR REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS: RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES; PAPER PACKAGING & SERVICES; FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES; AND LAND MANAGEMENT.  WE ARE A LEADING GLOBAL PRODUCER OF RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, SUCH AS STEEL, FIBRE AND PLASTIC DRUMS, RIGID  INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING PRODUCTS, TRANSIT PROTECTION PRODUCTS, WATER BOTTLES AND REMANUFACTURED AND RECONDITIONED INDUSTRIAL CONTAINERS, AND SERVICES, SUCH AS CONTAINER LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT, FILLING,  LOGISTICS, WAREHOUSING AND OTHER PACKAGING SERVICES.

IN ADDITION, WE PURCHASE AND SELL RECYCLED FIBER. CUSTOMER INDUSTRIES AND END MARKETS INCLUDE FOOD AND FOOD SERVICES, PACKAGING, AUTOMOTIVE, AND BUILDING AND HOUSING PRODUCTS.

OUR FLEXIBLE INTERMEDIATE BULK CONTAINERS CONSIST OF A POLYPROPYLENE-BASED WOVEN FABRIC THAT IS PRODUCED AT OUR PRODUCTION SITES, AS WELL AS SOURCED FROM STRATEGIC REGIONAL SUPPLIERS. OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD GLOBALLY AND SERVICE SIMILAR CUSTOMERS AND MARKET SEGMENTS AS OUR RIGID INDUSTRIAL PACKAGING & SERVICES SEGMENT. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND OUR PRESENCE IN THE AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD INDUSTRIES, AMONG OTHERS.  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE OWNED APPROXIMATELY  251,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. OUR LAND MANAGEMENT TEAM IS FOCUSED ON THE ACTIVE HARVESTING AND REGENERATION OF OUR UNITED STATES TIMBER PROPERTIES TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM YIELDS. WHILE TIMBER SALES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS, WE SEEK TO MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT CUTTING SCHEDULE, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF MARKET AND WEATHER CONDITIONS. WE ALSO SELL, FROM TIME TO TIME, TIMBERLAND AND SPECIAL USE PROPERTIES, WHICH CONSIST OF SURPLUS PROPERTIES, HIGHER AND BETTER USE (\u201cHBU\u201d) PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (\u201cGAAP\u201d). THE PREPARATION OF THESE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE PRINCIPLES, REQUIRE US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AS OF THE DATE OF OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE DISCUSSED IN PART II, ITEM 7 \u2013 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF THESE POLICIES ENABLES US TO PROVIDE READERS OF THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH USEFUL AND RELIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES TO OUR BUSINESS COMBINATION AND REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES AS DISCUSSED BELOW AND IN NOTE 2 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR INDUSTRIES, INC. (\u201cCARAUSTAR\u201d) ON FEBRUARY 11, 2019 (THE \u201cCARAUSTAR ACQUISITION\u201d).  AS A RESULT OF THIS ACQUISITION, THE PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS IN OUR PAPER PACKAGING AND SERVICES SEGMENT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED.  CARAUSTAR'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE PERIOD SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION DATE.  UNDER THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING, WE ALLOCATE THE FAIR VALUE OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED TO THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ON THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION. THE FAIR VALUES ASSIGNED, DEFINED AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN WILLING MARKET PARTICIPANTS, ARE BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. THE EXCESS PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OVER THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET OF LIABILITIES ASSUMED, IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.  WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH RESPECT TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE, BUT WHICH ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND UNPREDICTABLE AND, AS A RESULT, ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES.  DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, NOT TO EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION, WE MAY RECORD ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED, WITH A CORRESPONDING OFFSET TO GOODWILL IF NEW INFORMATION IS OBTAINED RELATED TO FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES THAT EXISTED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. AFTER THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, ANY SUBSEQUENT ADJUSTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. ACQUISITION COSTS, SUCH AS LEGAL AND CONSULTING FEES, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.  SEE NOTE 3 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q.  RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  SEE NOTE 1 TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q FOR A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF RECENTLY ISSUED AND NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING COMPARATIVE INFORMATION IS PRESENTED FOR THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  . HISTORICAL REVENUES AND EARNINGS MAY OR MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ECONOMIC AND OTHER FACTORS.  ITEMS THAT COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES LISTED IN PART I, ITEM 1A \u2014 RISK FACTORS, OF THE  2018  FORM 10-K. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY USING DIFFERENT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF CONDITIONS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE FUTURE.  THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE OF ADJUSTED EBITDA IS USED THROUGHOUT THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, BOTH FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED AND SEGMENT RESULTS. FOR OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, EBITDA, ALSO A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, INCLUDING DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION. ADJUSTED EBITDA IS DEFINED AS NET INCOME, PLUS INTEREST EXPENSE, NET, INCLUDING DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, PLUS INCOME TAX EXPENSE, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. SINCE WE DO NOT CALCULATE NET INCOME BY BUSINESS SEGMENT, ADJUSTED EBITDA BY BUSINESS SEGMENT IS RECONCILED TO OPERATING PROFIT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT LESS OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET, LESS EQUITY EARNINGS OF UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES, NET OF  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TAX, PLUS DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PLUS RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, PLUS ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS, PLUS NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, LESS (GAIN) LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS, EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET. WE USE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS ONE OF THE FINANCIAL MEASURES TO EVALUATE OUR HISTORICAL AND ONGOING OPERATIONS AND BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE IS USEFUL TO ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS OF OUR HISTORICAL AND CURRENT PERFORMANCE.  IN ADDITION, WE PRESENT OUR U.S. AND NON-U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AFTER ELIMINATING THE IMPACT OF NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, NON-CASH PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, DEBT EXTINGUISHMENT CHARGES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AND (GAINS) LOSSES ON SALES OF BUSINESSES, NET, WHICH ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ENABLE INVESTORS TO PERFORM A MEANINGFUL COMPARISON OF THE GEOGRAPHIC SOURCE OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND IS INFORMATION THAT INVESTORS FIND VALUABLE.  THE FOREGOING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ARE INTENDED TO SUPPLEMENT AND SHOULD BE READ TOGETHER WITH OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED SUPERIOR TO, OUR REPORTED FINANCIAL RESULTS. ACCORDINGLY, USERS OF THIS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE ON THE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.

LAND MANAGEMENT  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , OUR LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT CONSISTED OF APPROXIMATELY  251,000  ACRES OF TIMBER PROPERTIES IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. KEY FACTORS INFLUENCING PROFITABILITY IN THE LAND MANAGEMENT SEGMENT ARE.  \u2022  PLANNED LEVEL OF TIMBER SALES;  \u2022  SELLING PRICES AND CUSTOMER DEMAND;  \u2022  GAINS ON TIMBERLAND SALES; AND  \u2022  GAINS ON THE DISPOSAL OF DEVELOPMENT, SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTIES (\u201cSPECIAL USE PROPERTY\u201d).  IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE OF OUR TIMBER PROPERTY, WE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND EXPLORE THE DEVELOPMENT OF CERTAIN OF THESE PROPERTIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS PROCESS HAS LED US TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROPERTY AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  SURPLUS PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT CANNOT BE EFFICIENTLY OR EFFECTIVELY MANAGED BY US, WHETHER DUE TO PARCEL SIZE, LACK OF PRODUCTIVITY, LOCATION, ACCESS LIMITATIONS OR FOR OTHER REASONS.  \u2022  HBU PROPERTY, MEANING LAND THAT IN ITS CURRENT STATE HAS A HIGHER MARKET VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  \u2022  DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY, MEANING HBU LAND THAT, WITH ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT, MAY HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MARKET VALUE THAN ITS HBU MARKET VALUE.  \u2022  CORE TIMBERLAND, MEANING LAND THAT IS BEST SUITED FOR GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER.  WE REPORT THE DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS AND HBU PROPERTY IN OUR INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME UNDER \u201cGAIN ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT AND BUSINESSES, NET\u201d AND REPORT THE SALE OF DEVELOPMENT PROPERTY UNDER \u201cNET SALES\u201d AND \u201cCOST OF PRODUCTS SOLD.\u201d ALL HBU, DEVELOPMENT AND SURPLUS PROPERTY IS USED BY US TO PRODUCTIVELY GROW AND SELL TIMBER UNTIL SOLD. TIMBERLAND GAINS ARE RECORDED AS GAINS ON DISPOSALS OF PROPERTIES, PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT, NET.  WHETHER TIMBERLAND HAS A HIGHER VALUE FOR USES OTHER THAN GROWING AND SELLING TIMBER IS A DETERMINATION BASED UPON SEVERAL VARIABLES, SUCH AS PROXIMITY TO POPULATION CENTERS, ANTICIPATED POPULATION GROWTH IN THE AREA, THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LAND, AESTHETIC CONSIDERATIONS, INCLUDING ACCESS TO WATER, THE CONDITION OF THE SURROUNDING LAND, AVAILABILITY OF UTILITIES, MARKETS FOR TIMBER AND ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. GIVEN THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE CHARACTERIZATION OF LAND IS NOT A STATIC PROCESS, BUT REQUIRES AN ONGOING REVIEW AND RE-CHARACTERIZATION AS CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

IS INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  OUR QUARTERLY INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270 \"INCOME TAXES - INTERIM REPORTING.\" IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX EXPENSE IS COMPUTED BASED ON FORECASTED ANNUAL EARNINGS AND OTHER FORECASTED ANNUAL AMOUNTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITEMS SUCH AS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AND WITHHOLDING TAXES. ADDITIONALLY, LOSSES FROM JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH A VALUATION ALLOWANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE. INCOME TAX EXPENSE EACH QUARTER IS PROVIDED FOR ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS USING THE ANNUAL ESTIMATED TAX RATE, ADJUSTED FOR DISCRETE TAXABLE EVENTS THAT OCCUR DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD.  INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 WAS  $11.5 MILLION  ON  $32.5 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME AND INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018 WAS  $21.1 MILLION  ON  $72.2 MILLION  OF PRETAX INCOME. IN ADDITION TO THE TIMING OF THE ANNUAL TAX EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR THE QUARTERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740-270, WE ALSO RECORDED A PROVISIONAL NET TAX BENEFIT OF  $6.5 MILLION  FOR THE ADDITION OF CARAUSTAR. OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN A TAX BENEFIT OF  $1.6 MILLION  . FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, THE NET TAX EXPENSE RECORDED INCLUDED A  $4.3 MILLION  TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF DEFERRED TAX BALANCES AS A RESULT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT OF 2017 (THE \"TAX REFORM ACT\"). OTHER IMMATERIAL DISCRETE ITEMS IN THE QUARTER RESULTED IN A NET TAX EXPENSE OF  $3.0 MILLION.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT\u2019S EXPECTATIONS, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.  THE ESTIMATED NET DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS RANGES FROM  ZERO  TO  $6.0 MILLION  . ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THIS ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS REPRESENTS THE PORTION OF EARNINGS FROM THE OPERATIONS OF OUR MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES THAT WAS SUBTRACTED FROM NET INCOME TO ARRIVE AT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO US. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTERS OF  2019  AND  2018  WAS  $7.5 MILLION  AND  $6.8 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET OPERATING PROFIT OF THE FLEXIBLE PRODUCTS & SERVICES SEGMENT JOINT VENTURE THAT WAS FORMED IN 2010 BY GREIF, INC. AND ONE OF ITS INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES (REFERRED TO HEREIN AS THE \u201cFLEXIBLE PACKAGING JV\u201d OR \u201cFPS VIE\u201d).  NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREIF, INC.

THE  $12.1 MILLION  DECREASE  IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS TO  $80.0 MILLION  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  FROM $92.1 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN INCOME TAX RECEIVABLES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR SENIOR SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES, PROCEEDS FROM THE SENIOR NOTES WE HAVE ISSUED, AND PROCEEDS FROM OUR TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE USE THESE SOURCES TO FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CASH DIVIDENDS, COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES AND ACQUISITIONS. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FUND THESE ITEMS IN A LIKE MANNER.

THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY MATURES ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2019. THE  $150.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING BALANCE UNDER THE U.S. RECEIVABLE FACILITY AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  IS REPORTED IN LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS BECAUSE WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATION ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENT OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT.  WE CAN TERMINATE THE U.S. RECEIVABLES FACILITY AT ANY TIME UPON FIVE DAYS PRIOR WRITTEN NOTICE.

ON APRIL 17, 2019, THE MAIN SPV AND SELLER AMENDED AND EXTENDED THE TERM OF THE EUROPEAN RPA THROUGH APRIL 17, 2020. UNDER THE EUROPEAN RPA, AS AMENDED, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES THAT MAY BE SOLD AND OUTSTANDING UNDER THE EUROPEAN RPA AT ANY TIME IS  \u20ac100.0 MILLION  (  $111.5 MILLION  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  ).  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE EUROPEAN RPA, WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO LOAN EXCESS CASH TO THE PURCHASING BANK AFFILIATES IN THE FORM OF A SUBORDINATED LOAN RECEIVABLE.

THE REMAINING DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE IS SETTLED UPON COLLECTION OF THE RECEIVABLES.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE WAS ADDED TO THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA. A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE NULLIFIES LEGAL ISOLATION AND TRUE-SALE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT BECAUSE A PARENT-LEVEL GUARANTEE IS A FORM OF CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT. THEREFORE, WE DO NOT REMOVE FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE, AND THE EUROPEAN RPA AND SINGAPORE RPA ARE NOW PRESENTED AS LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE INTEND TO REFINANCE THE OBLIGATIONS ON A LONG-TERM BASIS AND HAVE THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO CONSUMMATE A LONG-TERM REFINANCING BY EXERCISING THE RENEWAL OPTION IN THE AGREEMENTS OR ENTERING INTO A NEW FINANCING ARRANGEMENT.  53  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRIOR TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, THE STRUCTURE OF THE EUROPEAN RPA AND THE SINGAPORE RPA PROVIDED FOR A LEGAL TRUE SALE, ON A REVOLVING BASIS, OF THE RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED FROM OUR VARIOUS SUBSIDIARIES TO THE RESPECTIVE PURCHASERS.

THEREFORE, WE REMOVED FROM ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THE AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM THE INITIAL PURCHASE PRICE SINCE THEY MET THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA OF ASC 860, \u201cTRANSFERS AND SERVICING,\u201d AND WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OR OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE RECEIVABLES WERE SOLD ON A NON-RECOURSE BASIS WITH THE TOTAL FUNDS IN THE SERVICING COLLECTION ACCOUNTS PLEDGED TO THE BANKS BETWEEN SETTLEMENT DATES. THE CASH INITIALLY RECEIVED, ALONG WITH THE DEFERRED PURCHASE PRICE, RELATED TO THE SALE OR ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES AND WAS NOT SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT OTHER RISKS GIVEN THEIR SHORT TERM NATURE.

IN 2019, WE ENTERED INTO SIX INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO THE DEBT INCURRED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF CARAUSTAR. SEE \"BORROWING ARRANGEMENTS - 2019 CREDIT AGREEMENT\".  THESE SIX INTEREST RATE SWAPS HAVE A TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $1,300.0 MILLION  . WE  RECEIVE VARIABLE RATE INTEREST PAYMENTS BASED UPON 1 MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR, AND IN RETURN WE ARE OBLIGATED TO PAY INTEREST AT A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF  2.49%.

ACCORDINGLY, WE ENTER INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF CERTAIN EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE HAD OUTSTANDING FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS IN THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF  $139.3 MILLION  (  $194.4 MILLION  AS OF  OCTOBER 31, 2018  ).

OUTLOOK  FOR 2019, WE PLAN TO FOCUS ON THREE KEY AREAS: PRODUCT, BRAND AND PRODUCT CLARITY, AND CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION. WHILE WE EXPECT OUR RESULTS TO REMAIN CHALLENGING IN THE NEAR-TERM, WE BELIEVE THAT BY FOCUSING ON THE FUNDAMENTALS WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE THE TREND OF THE BUSINESS. THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES AN UPDATE ON EACH AREA.  PRODUCT  WE ARE INCREASING CUSTOMER INSIGHTS AND APPLYING THE LEARNINGS TO HOW WE MAKE BUYING DECISIONS. WE ARE ALSO REASSESSING OUR TESTING AND BUYING PROCESSES TO ENSURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT DATA TO INFORM OUR DECISIONS. WE WILL BEGIN BRINGING IN INCREASED QUANTITIES OF FORWARD SEASON MERCHANDISE, WHICH WILL GIVE US A BETTER READ ON STYLES AND MORE TIME TO MAXIMIZE TREND-RIGHT PRODUCT DURING THE HEART OF THE SELLING SEASON.  BRAND AND PRODUCT CLARITY  IN 2019, WE ARE ENSURING THERE IS A FOCUS ON BRAND AND PRODUCT CLARITY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING.  1) SHARPENING OUR EDIT POINTS FOR THE WOMEN\u2019S AND MEN\u2019S CUSTOMER TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A SINGLE FASHION POINT OF VIEW FOR OUR DESIGN, MERCHANDISE, MARKETING, AND STORES TEAMS;  2) CREATING A NEW COMMERCIAL PLANNING PROCESS TO ALIGN AND FOCUS KEY CUSTOMER MESSAGES WITH THE KEY FASHION TRENDS AND BRAND WORK TO ENSURE WE HAVE CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGING ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEMS ACROSS ALL CUSTOMER TOUCHPOINTS; AND  3) OPTIMIZING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO TO IMPROVE CLARITY, PARTICULARLY IN OUR STORES.  CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION  IN 2019, WE ARE ADDRESSING THIS FOCUS AREA THROUGH A COMBINATION OF ANALYTICS, NEW RETENTION INITIATIVES, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH KEY FASHION INFLUENCERS TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS. THESE PLANS INCLUDE LAUNCHING A NEW FIRST IMPRESSIONS INITIATIVE, CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON SIGNING UP MORE CUSTOMERS IN OUR NEXT LOYALTY PROGRAM, AND LAUNCHING PRODUCT COLLECTIONS DESIGNED IN COLLABORATION WITH ROCKY BARNES AND KARLA WELCH. IN ADDITION, WE ARE CONTINUING OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NBA BY EXPANDING OUR ASSORTMENT AND OFFERING FASHIONABLE WOMEN\u2019S NBA-LICENSED PRODUCTS.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  PRODUCT  BRAND AND PRODUCT CLARITY  CUSTOMER INSIGHTS  . WE MADE GOOD PROGRESS AGAINST THIS INITIATIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, BUT STILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WORK TO DO TO INGRAIN THIS INTO ALL BUYING AND CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE DECISIONS.  FORWARD SEASON MERCHANDISE.  WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO AFFECT A NUMBER OF RECEIPTS FOR LATE SPRING, WHICH SHOULD GET US IN A BETTER POSITION TO REACT TO RESULTS IN FALL.  CLEAR AND CONSISTENT MESSAGING.  WE HAVE A CROSS FUNCTIONAL TEAM WORKING ON THIS INITIATIVE WITH THE GOAL OF HAVING THE NEW PROCESS IN PLACE BY THE END OF THE SUMMER.  OPTIMIZING OUR PRODUCT PORTFOLIO.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT ALL PRODUCTS WE DELIVER FIT WITHIN THE EXPRESS BRAND AND CREATE A DIFFERENTIATED POSITION FOR THE CUSTOMER.  WHERE THAT IS NOT THE CASE, WE NEED TO EXIT THESE CATEGORIES.  AS AN EXAMPLE, WE HAVE MADE THE DECISION TO EXIT SWIM AND WATCHES.  FLOORSET EXECUTION.  WE NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO CUSTOMERS WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, BOTH IN OUR BRAND MESSAGE AND FROM A FASHION STAND POINT.  THIS WILL FIRST IMPACT OUR JULY 2019 FLOORSET.  CUSTOMER ACQUISITION AND RETENTION  PROGRESS AGAINST OUR OTHER INITIATIVES  CUSTOMER ACQUISITION. WE LAUNCHED A NEW MARKETING MIX OPTIMIZATION TOOL IN MAY AND WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACTIONABLE OUTPUT FROM THE MODEL AT THE END OF JULY, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL DRIVE HIGHER RETURNS ON OUR MARKETING INVESTMENT STARTING IN THE BACK HALF OF 2019.  CUSTOMER RETENTION. WE LAUNCHED A NEW FIRST IMPRESSIONS INITIATIVE WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING \u201cONE AND DONE\u201d CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON SIGNING UP MORE CUSTOMERS IN OUR NEXT LOYALTY PROGRAM.  FASHION INFLUENCERS. DURING THE QUARTER WE INTRODUCED A COLLECTION DESIGNED WITH ROCKY BARNES, A WIDELY FOLLOWED FASHION MODEL AND INFLUENCER. WE WILL FURTHER BUILD ON THIS IN JULY BY LAUNCHING A LIMITED-EDITION COLLECTION OF APPAREL DESIGNED BY KARLA WELCH, ONE OF THE INDUSTRY\u2019S MOST SUCCESSFUL FASHION STYLISTS.  COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES.  IN 2016, WE ANNOUNCED COST SAVINGS OPPORTUNITIES OF $44 TO $54 MILLION, WHICH WE EXPECT TO REALIZE THROUGH 2019. WE ACHIEVED OUR TARGET OF $40 MILLION IN COSTS SAVINGS THROUGH 2018 AND ARE ON TRACK TO DELIVER THE $44 TO $54 MILLION DOLLARS OF ANNUALIZED COST SAVINGS BY 2019.  STORE FLEET OPTIMIZATION.

GENERALLY, APPROXIMATELY 45% OF OUR ANNUAL NET SALES OCCUR IN THE SPRING SEASON (FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS) AND 55% OCCUR IN THE FALL SEASON (THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS).  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  COMPARABLE SALES  COMPARABLE SALES IS A MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN A PERIOD RELATIVE TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES GENERATED IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WERE CALCULATED USING THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE 13-WEEK PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES INCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM RETAIL STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD  \u2022  E-COMMERCE SALES  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES INCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM OUTLET STORES THAT WERE OPEN 12 MONTHS OR MORE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD, INCLUDING CONVERSIONS  COMPARABLE SALES EXCLUDES.  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE HAS CHANGED BY MORE THAN 20% DUE TO REMODEL OR RELOCATION ACTIVITY  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES IN A PHASED REMODEL WHERE A PORTION OF THE STORE IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND THEREFORE NOT PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE  \u2022  SALES FROM STORES WHERE THE STORE CANNOT OPEN DUE TO WEATHER DAMAGE OR OTHER CATASTROPHE  OUR BUSINESS AND OUR COMPARABLE SALES ARE SUBJECT, AT CERTAIN TIMES, TO CALENDAR SHIFTS, WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING KEY SELLING PERIODS CLOSE TO HOLIDAYS SUCH AS EASTER, THANKSGIVING, AND CHRISTMAS, AND REGIONAL FLUCTUATIONS FOR EVENTS SUCH AS SALES TAX HOLIDAYS.  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE  \u2022  INVENTORY SHRINK AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS  \u2022  INBOUND AND OUTBOUND FREIGHT  \u2022  MERCHANDISING, DESIGN, PLANNING AND ALLOCATION, AND MANUFACTURING/PRODUCTION COSTS  \u2022  OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORE OPERATIONS (SUCH AS RENT AND COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, AND DEPRECIATION ON ASSETS)  \u2022  LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR E-COMMERCE BUSINESS  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD TYPICALLY INCREASES IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS BECAUSE THE DIRECT COST OF PURCHASED MERCHANDISE IS TIED TO SALES.  THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE COSTS OF INDIVIDUAL GOODS ARE RAW MATERIALS, LABOR IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE OUR MERCHANDISE IS SOURCED, AND LOGISTICS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTING OUR MERCHANDISE.  BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS RELATED TO STORES ARE LARGELY FIXED AND DO NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE AS VOLUME INCREASES.  CHANGES IN THE MIX OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY TYPE OF PRODUCT OR BY CHANNEL MAY ALSO IMPACT OUR OVERALL COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS.  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN  GROSS PROFIT IS NET SALES MINUS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS. GROSS MARGIN MEASURES GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  GROSS PROFIT/GROSS MARGIN IS IMPACTED BY THE PRICE AT WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO SELL OUR MERCHANDISE AND THE COST OF OUR PRODUCT.  WE REVIEW OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ON AN ON-GOING BASIS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY SLOW-MOVING MERCHANDISE AND GENERALLY USE MARKDOWNS TO CLEAR SUCH MERCHANDISE. THE TIMING AND LEVEL OF MARKDOWNS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY SEASONALITY AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR MERCHANDISE AND HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT ON OUR GROSS MARGIN.  ANY MARKED DOWN MERCHANDISE THAT IS NOT SOLD IS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK. WE USE THIRD-PARTY VENDORS TO DISPOSE OF THIS MARKED-OUT-OF-STOCK MERCHANDISE.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCIAL MEASURES  DESCRIPTION  DISCUSSION  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCLUDES OPERATING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS SUCH AS.  \u2022  PAYROLL AND OTHER EXPENSES RELATED TO OPERATIONS AT OUR CORPORATE OFFICES  \u2022  STORE EXPENSES OTHER THAN OCCUPANCY COSTS  \u2022  MARKETING EXPENSES, INCLUDING PRODUCTION, MAILING, PRINT, AND DIGITAL ADVERTISING COSTS, AMONG OTHER THINGS  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF STORE PAYROLL, CERTAIN MARKETING EXPENSES, AND INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES GENERALLY DO NOT VARY PROPORTIONALLY WITH NET SALES. AS A RESULT, SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN LOWER VOLUME QUARTERS AND LOWER IN HIGHER VOLUME QUARTERS.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  NET SALES  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  NET SALES (IN THOUSANDS)  $451,271  $479,352  COMPARABLE RETAIL SALES  (9  )%  1%  COMPARABLE OUTLET SALES  (2  )%  2%  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGE CHANGE  (7  )%  1%  GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE AT END OF PERIOD (IN THOUSANDS)  5,349  5,387  NUMBER OF.

THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN RETAIL AND OUTLET SALES, OFFSET IN PART BY INCREASES IN NON-COMPARABLE SALES AND OTHER REVENUE IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2018  .  THE DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED TRAFFIC AT OUR RETAIL STORES AND OUR OUTLET STORES.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  GROSS PROFIT  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS, GROSS PROFIT IN DOLLARS, AND GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  COST OF GOODS SOLD, BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS  $328,768  $336,190  GROSS PROFIT  $122,503  $143,162  GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE  27.1%  29.9%  THE  280  BASIS POINT  DECREASE  IN GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE, OR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2018  WAS COMPRISED OF A  100  BASIS POINT DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN AND A  180  BASIS POINT INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. THE DECREASE IN MERCHANDISE MARGIN WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY VALUATION RESERVES ON SLOW MOVING INVENTORY, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REDUCTION IN PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN THE LATTER HALF OF THE QUARTER THAT LED TO REDUCED SALES OF THIS INVENTORY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP MAKE ROOM FOR MORE NEW PRODUCT HEADING INTO FALL. THE INCREASE IN BUYING AND OCCUPANCY COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE DECREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN DOLLARS AND AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES)  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  $135,367  $140,634  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  30.0%  29.3%  THE  $5.3 MILLION  DECREASE  IN SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER OF 2018  WAS THE RESULT OF DECREASED HOME OFFICE PAYROLL, INCLUDING INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, OF $3.5 MILLION.  IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A DECREASE IN MARKETING COSTS OF $2.7 MILLION.  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN DOLLARS FOR THE STATED PERIODS.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  INCOME TAX (BENEFIT)/EXPENSE  $(908  )  $2,084  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  8.4%  FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019  COMPARED TO  80.1%  FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  . THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 REFLECTS A TAX BENEFIT FROM A PRE-TAX LOSS OFFSET BY $1.4 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018 REFLECTS $1.3 MILLION OF DISCRETE TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO A TAX SHORTFALL FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, EXCLUDING DISCRETE ITEMS, WAS 22.1% AND 28.6% FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  A SUMMARY OF CASH PROVIDED BY OR USED IN OPERATING, INVESTING, AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  MAY 5, 2018  (IN THOUSANDS)  USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $(16,945  )  $(24,779  )  USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (4,078  )  (7,920  )  USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  (6,414  )  (19,002  )  DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  (27,437  )  (51,701  )  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT END OF PERIOD  $144,233  $184,521  OUR BUSINESS RELIES ON CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AS OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THOSE CASH FLOWS BEING GENERATED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE YEAR. OUR PRIMARY OPERATING CASH NEEDS ARE FOR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, PAYROLL, STORE RENT AND MARKETING. FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019  , OUR CASH FLOWS USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE  $16.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO  $24.8 MILLION  USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  .  THIS  $7.8 MILLION  INCREASE IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES BETWEEN THE RESPECTIVE QUARTERS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A FIRST QUARTER 2018 DISTRIBUTION OF  $25.6 MILLION  RELATED TO THE TERMINATION OF OUR NON-QUALIFIED SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY  $10.5 MILLION  LOWER NET INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  IN ADDITION TO CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, WE HAVE ACCESS TO ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, IF NEEDED, THROUGH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AS OF  MAY 4, 2019  , WE HAD  $247.0 MILLION  AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. ON MAY 24, 2019, WE AMENDED AND RESTATED OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE FACILITY REMAINS AT  $250 MILLION  BUT THE EXPIRATION DATE OF THE FACILITY HAS BEEN EXTENDED TO MAY 24, 2024. REFER TO NOTE 8 TO OUR UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  WE ALSO USE CASH FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019  , WE HAD CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF APPROXIMATELY  $4.1 MILLION  . THESE RELATE PRIMARILY TO STORE REMODELS, NEW OUTLET STORES, AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGIC BUSINESS INITIATIVES. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019  TO BE APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION TO $38 MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY STORE REMODELS, NEW OUTLET STORES, AND INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THESE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DO NOT INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY  $1.4 MILLION  FOR THE REMAINDER OF  2019.  ON NOVEMBER 28, 2017, THE BOARD APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM THAT AUTHORIZES US TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $150 MILLION  OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK USING AVAILABLE CASH. DURING THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019  AND THE  THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  , WE REPURCHASED  0.9 MILLION  SHARES AND  2.2 MILLION  SHARES UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY, FOR AGGREGATE AMOUNTS EQUAL TO  $4.9 MILLION  AND  $15.6 MILLION  , INCLUDING COMMISSIONS, RESPECTIVELY. WE HAVE  $44.7 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM.  OUR LIQUIDITY POSITION BENEFITS FROM THE FACT THAT WE GENERALLY COLLECT CASH FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS THE SAME DAY OR, IN THE CASE OF CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS, WITHIN THREE TO FIVE DAYS OF THE RELATED SALE, AND WE HAVE UP TO 75 DAYS TO PAY CERTAIN MERCHANDISE VENDORS AND 45 DAYS TO PAY THE MAJORITY OF OUR NON-MERCHANDISE VENDORS.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF BORROWINGS UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS DID NOT CHANGE MATERIALLY BETWEEN  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  AND  MAY 4, 2019  .

OUR SOLUTIONS FOR THE ADAPTIVE NETWORK CREATE BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL VALUE FOR OUR CUSTOMERS, ENABLING THEM TO INTRODUCE NEW REVENUE-GENERATING SERVICES, REDUCE COSTS AND MAXIMIZE THE RETURN ON THEIR NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT.  REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS.  DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS GROWTH ACCELERATED AS WE BENEFITED MEANINGFULLY FROM STRONG NETWORK OPERATOR DEMAND FOR CAPACITY, FAVORABLE INDUSTRY AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THE CONTINUED EXECUTION OF OUR STRATEGY. OUR STRATEGY HAS FOCUSED ON INNOVATION LEADERSHIP, THE DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS AND CUSTOMER BASE, AND MARKET SHARE CAPTURE, PARTICULARLY INTERNATIONALLY. FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , OUR REVENUE GREW FROM  $1.38 BILLION  TO  $1.64 BILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  19%  , AND OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS GREW FROM  $48.8 MILLION  TO  $128.3 MILLION  , OR APPROXIMATELY  163%  . OUR RESULTS CAN FLUCTUATE FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT THESE REVENUE AND PROFIT GROWTH RATES WILL BE SUSTAINABLE LONG-TERM.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM OUR EFFORTS TO PUSH THE PACE OF INNOVATION IN OUR MARKETS AND PROVIDE MARKET-LEADING OFFERINGS. KEEPING PACE WITH THE MARKET\u2019S DEMANDS FOR TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT CAPACITY. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2019  , WE INVESTED  $266.6 MILLION  IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY  13%  COMPARED TO THE FIRST  SIX  MONTHS OF FISCAL  2018  . WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND INNOVATION EXECUTION ARE IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS AND HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THAT REMAINING COMPETITIVE IN THE GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE SELL DEPENDS UPON OUR CONTINUED INNOVATION.  WE CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY OUR BUSINESS AND, IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , WE BENEFITED FROM REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS A DIVERSE SET OF GEOGRAPHIES, PRODUCT SOLUTIONS AND CUSTOMER SEGMENTS. DURING THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  , WE GREW REVENUE IN EACH OF THE GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND IN EACH OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, WITH A DIVERSE SET OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE GREW REVENUE WITH OUR LARGEST SERVICE PROVIDER CUSTOMERS, AND WEB-SCALE PROVIDERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTORS TO OUR OVERALL GROWTH, ARE INCLUDED AMONG OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS BY REVENUE FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  . WE BELIEVE THAT CONTINUED DIVERSIFICATION OF OUR BUSINESS IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS THE DYNAMIC INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE, TO CONTINUE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, AND TO BETTER WITHSTAND POTENTIAL SLOWDOWNS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FROM PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIES, MARKETS, CUSTOMERS OR CUSTOMER SEGMENTS.  OUR REVENUE GROWTH FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM MARKET SHARE GAINS AND OUR CONTINUED GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY FOCUSED ON GENERATING NEW CUSTOMER WINS AND DISPLACING INCUMBENT COMPETITORS IN KEY ACCOUNTS. AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE OUR TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP AND TO AGGRESSIVELY CAPTURE ADDITIONAL MARKET SHARE FROM COMPETITORS, PARTICULARLY WITH COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS INTERNATIONALLY. OUR REVENUE GROWTH, IN PART, REFLECTS THE BENEFITS OF THIS STRATEGY, WHICH HAS YIELDED REVENUE GROWTH WITH ADDITIONAL CUSTOMERS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (\u201cEMEA\u201d) AND ASIA PACIFIC AND INDIA (\u201cAPAC\u201d).

OUR GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, OR \u201cGROSS MARGIN,\u201d CAN FLUCTUATE DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN VIEWED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. OUR GROSS MARGIN CAN FLUCTUATE AND BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED DEPENDING UPON OUR REVENUE CONCENTRATION WITHIN A PARTICULAR SEGMENT, PRODUCT LINE, GEOGRAPHY, OR CUSTOMER, INCLUDING OUR SUCCESS IN SELLING SOFTWARE IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD. OUR GROSS MARGIN REMAINS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR CONTINUED ABILITY TO DRIVE PRODUCT COST REDUCTIONS RELATIVE TO THE PRICE COMPRESSION THAT WE REGULARLY ENCOUNTER IN OUR MARKETS. MOREOVER, WE ARE OFTEN REQUIRED TO COMPETE WITH AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND COMMERCIAL TERMS AND, TO SECURE BUSINESS WITH NEW AND EXISTING CUSTOMERS, WE MAY AGREE TO PRICING OR OTHER UNFAVORABLE COMMERCIAL TERMS THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR GROSS MARGIN. WHEN WE HAVE SUCCESS IN TAKING SHARE AND WINNING NEW BUSINESS, IT CAN RESULT IN ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGIN FROM THESE PRICING DYNAMICS, PARTICULARLY DURING THE EARLY STAGES OF THESE NETWORK DEPLOYMENTS. EARLY STAGES OF NEW NETWORK BUILDS ALSO OFTEN INCLUDE AN INCREASED CONCENTRATION OF LOWER MARGIN \u201cCOMMON\u201d  EQUIPMENT SALES AND INSTALLATION SERVICES, WITH OUR INTENT TO IMPROVE MARGIN AS WE SELL CHANNEL CARDS, MAINTENANCE SERVICES, AND OTHER HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS ADDING CAPACITY OR SERVICES TO THEIR NETWORKS. GROSS MARGIN AND REVENUE CAN BE IMPACTED BY TECHNOLOGY-BASED PRICE COMPRESSION AND THE INTRODUCTION OR SUBSTITUTION OF NEW PLATFORMS WITH IMPROVED PRICE FOR PERFORMANCE AS COMPARED TO EXISTING SOLUTIONS THAT MAY CARRY HIGHER MARGINS. GROSS MARGIN CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN EXPENSE FOR EXCESS AND OBSOLETE INVENTORY AND WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THAT WE MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSE, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. BY THEIR NATURE, THESE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO AN INHERENT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. AMONG OTHER THINGS, THESE ESTIMATES FORM THE BASIS FOR JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE MATERIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR ESTIMATES AND ACTUAL RESULTS, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL BE AFFECTED.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES  WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\u201cGAAP\u201d). HOWEVER,  WE BELIEVE THAT CERTAIN  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES PROVIDE USERS OF OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION WITH ADDITIONAL USEFUL INFORMATION IN EVALUATING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES SHOULD BE VIEWED AS SUPPLEMENTING, AND NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR SUBSTITUTE FOR, FINANCIAL RESULTS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM OR INCLUDED IN  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY BE SIGNIFICANT AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND PERFORMANCE. THE METHODS WE USED TO CALCULATE THESE  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM METHODS USED BY OTHER COMPANIES TO COMPUTE SIMILAR MEASURES. AS A RESULT, THE  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED HEREIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR  MEASURES PROVIDED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  CALCULATIONS OF OUR COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDING SALES FROM LICENSED DEPARTMENTS ARE  NON-GAAP  FINANCIAL MEASURES. WE BELIEVE THAT PROVIDING CALCULATIONS OF CHANGES IN COMPARABLE SALES, BOTH INCLUDING AND EXCLUDING SALES FROM LICENSED DEPARTMENTS, ASSISTS IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES  GROWTH, WHETHER THROUGH OWNED BUSINESSES OR DEPARTMENTS LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THESE CALCULATIONS.  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES ON AN OWNED BASIS (1)  (2.5) %  (1.8) %  IMPACT OF GROWTH IN COMPARABLE SALES OF DEPARTMENTS LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES (2)  0.8  %  1.1  %  DECREASE IN COMPARABLE SALES ON AN OWNED PLUS LICENSED BASIS  (1.7) %  (0.7) %  (1)  REPRESENTS THE  PERIOD-TO-PERIOD  PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN NET SALES FROM STORES OPEN THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD PRESENTED AND THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND ALL ONLINE SALES OF STEINMART.COM, EXCLUDING COMMISSIONS FROM DEPARTMENTS LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES.  (2)  REPRESENTS THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING THE FULL SALES AMOUNTS FOR DEPARTMENTS LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES THROUGHOUT THE  PERIOD PRESENTED AND THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR ON THE CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE SALES. WE LICENSE OUR SHOE AND VINTAGE HANDBAG DEPARTMENTS TO THIRD PARTIES AND RECEIVE A COMMISSION FROM THESE THIRD PARTIES BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THEIR  SALES. IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP, WE INCLUDE COMMISSIONS (RATHER THAN SALES OF THE DEPARTMENTS LICENSED TO THIRD PARTIES) IN OUR NET SALES. WE DO NOT INCLUDE THE COMMISSION AMOUNTS FROM LICENSED DEPARTMENT SALES IN  OUR COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018 (TABLES PRESENTED  IN THOUSANDS).

TOTAL NET SALES  (3.8)%  COMPARABLE STORE SALES ON AN OWNED PLUS LICENSED BASIS  (1.7)%  THE 3.8 PERCENT DECREASE IN NET SALES REFLECTS LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND FEWER STORES FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE 1.7 PERCENT DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORES SALES ON AN OWNED PLUS LICENSED BASIS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF  TRANSACTIONS DRIVEN BY LOWER STORE TRAFFIC. COMPARABLE STORE SALES REFLECT STORES OPEN THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND PRIOR FISCAL YEAR AND INCLUDE ECOMMERCE. ECOMMERCE SALES WERE APPROXIMATELY 5.3 PERCENT OF NET SALES. ECOMMERCE SALES INCREASED  13.6 PERCENT, INCLUDING ONLINE ORDERS SHIPPED FROM OUR STORES, AND POSITIVELY AFFECTED OUR TOTAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY 40 BASIS POINTS FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019.

WHILE  DEBT IS LOWER DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, INTEREST EXPENSE IS FLAT TO LAST YEAR BECAUSE OF A HIGHER BLENDED INTEREST RATE ON DEBT THIS YEAR.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS ARE FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, AVAILABLE CASH, CREDIT TERMS FROM VENDORS,  OUR $240.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO BANK AND OUR $35.0 MILLION TERM LOAN (AS DISCUSSED BELOW).  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN  ON  FEBRUARY 3, 2015, WE ENTERED INTO A $250.0 MILLION SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY PURSUANT TO A SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) WITH WELLS FARGO BANK (\u201cWELLS FARGO\u201d) WITH  AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF FEBRUARY 2020 (THE \u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\u201d) AND A SECURED $25.0 MILLION MASTER LOAN AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO EQUIPMENT FINANCE, INC. (THE \u201cEQUIPMENT TERM LOAN\u201d) WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF  FEBRUARY 2018. BORROWINGS UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY WERE INITIALLY USED FOR A SPECIAL DIVIDEND BUT ARE SUBSEQUENTLY BEING USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. DURING 2015, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS  OF $0.4 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS TERM. WE REPAID THE EQUIPMENT TERM LOAN IN FULL ON  JANUARY 22, 2018, AT WHICH TIME THE ASSOCIATED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WERE FULLY AMORTIZED.  ON FEBRUARY 19, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT  NO. 1 (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AN ACCOMMODATION PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) DURING WHICH WE  WERE NOT REQUIRED TO MEET THE FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT). THIS CHANGE PERMITTED US TO BORROW THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE THEN APPLICABLE BORROWING BASE UNTIL WE DELIVERED OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE MEASUREMENT  PERIOD (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 2018. PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT, A CASH DOMINION EVENT (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) OCCURRED AS OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT  AMENDMENT AND AT ALL TIMES THEREAFTER. BECAUSE OF THE CASH DOMINION EVENT, ALL OF OUR CASH RECEIPTS WERE SWEPT DAILY TO REPAY OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS A  SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION. AS NOTED BELOW, THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT REMOVED THE CASH DOMINION EVENT EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 18, 2018.  ON  MARCH 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 2 (THE \u201cSECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS FARGO. THE SECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.

ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cTHIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS  FARGO. THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS  (1) THE INCREASE OF AGGREGATE TRANCHE A REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENTS (AS DEFINED IN THE SECOND CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT) FROM $225.0 MILLION TO $240.0 MILLION; (2) AN  EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY DATE OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY TO THE EARLIER OF (A) THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR (B) SEPTEMBER 18, 2023; AND (3) THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION EVENT  STATUS AND A CHANGE IN CASH DOMINION TO BE TRIGGERED ONLY IN THE EVENT OF (A) THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUANCE OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT OR (B) EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF LESS THAN (A) 10.0% OF THE LOAN CAP AT ANY TIME OR (B) 12.5% OF THE LOAN CAP  FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING 2018, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS RESPECTIVE TERM. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $0.1 MILLION  REMAINING UNDER THE INITIAL CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL ALSO BE AMORTIZED OVER THE NEW TERM OF THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT. THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION STATUS CHANGED THE DEBT CLASSIFICATION FROM A SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATION.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 4 (THE \u201cFOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH WELLS  FARGO. THE FOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A MODIFICATION TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\u201d AND \u201cPERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE FOURTH CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS (INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT OF A 1.0 TO 1.0  CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF ANY COVENANT COMPLIANCE EVENT, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT), AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR FACILITIES OF THIS TYPE AND IS CROSS-COLLATERALIZED AND  CROSS-DEFAULTED. COLLATERAL FOR THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY CONSISTS OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY. WELLS FARGO HAS A FIRST LIEN ON ALL COLLATERAL OTHER THAN EQUIPMENT.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE EITHER BASE RATE LOANS OR LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) LOANS. LIBOR LOANS BEAR INTEREST  EQUAL TO THE ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS THE APPLICABLE MARGIN (125 TO 175 BASIS POINTS) DEPENDING ON THE QUARTERLY AVERAGE EXCESS AVAILABILITY. BASE RATE LOANS BEAR INTEREST EQUAL TO THE HIGHEST OF (A) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50 PERCENT,  (B) THE ADJUSTED LIBOR PLUS 1.00 PERCENT, OR (C) THE WELLS FARGO \u201cPRIME RATE,\u201d PLUS THE APPLICABLE MARGIN (25 TO 75 BASIS POINTS).  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS 4.12 PERCENT AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  TERM LOAN  ON MARCH 14, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO A TERM  LOAN CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH GORDON BROTHERS FINANCE COMPANY, AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT (IN SUCH CAPACITY, THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGENT\u201d), AND GORDON BROTHERS FINANCE COMPANY, LLC, AS LENDER (THE \u201cTERM LOAN AGREEMENT\u201d). THE TERM LOAN  AGREEMENT PROVIDED FOR A TERM LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $50.0 MILLION (THE \u201cTERM LOAN\u201d). DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM LOAN WERE CAPITALIZED IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.9 MILLION AND WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER THE TERM OF THE TERM  LOAN. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $49.1 MILLION FROM THE TERM LOAN WERE USED TO PERMANENTLY PAY OFF THE $25.0 MILLION  TRANCHE A-1 REVOLVING  LOAN (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) AND TO PAY DOWN  THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. AFTER UTILIZING PROCEEDS FROM THE TERM LOAN FOR REPAYMENT OF AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE EXISTING  TRANCHE A-1 REVOLVING  LOANS, THE TERM LOAN RESULTED IN AN INCREASE  IN OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $25.0 MILLION UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE TERM LOAN ORIGINALLY MATURED ON THE EARLIER OF  (1) THE TERMINATION DATE SPECIFIED IN OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS SUCH DATE MAY BE EXTENDED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE TERM LOAN AGENT OR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT (DEFINED BELOW), AND (2) MARCH 14, 2020.  ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 2 (THE \u201cSECOND TERM LOAN AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE TERM LOAN WITH GORDON BROTHERS  FINANCE COMPANY. THE SECOND TERM LOAN AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE FOLLOWING: (1) THE REDUCTION OF THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF THE TERM LOAN TO $35.0 MILLION; (2) AN EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY DATE OF THE TERM LOAN  AGREEMENT TO THE EARLIER OF (A) THE TERMINATION DATE SPECIFIED IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE THIRD CREDIT AGREEMENT AMENDMENT), AND (B) SEPTEMBER 18, 2023; (3) THE REDUCTION OF  THE NON-DEFAULT  INTEREST RATE APPLICABLE TO THE TERM LOAN UNDER THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT TO A FLUCTUATING RATE OF INTEREST EQUAL TO THREE-MONTH LIBOR (WITH A FLOOR OF 1.5%) PLUS 8.25% PER ANNUM; AND  (4) THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION EVENT STATUS AND A CHANGE IN CASH DOMINION TO BE TRIGGERED ONLY IN THE EVENT OF (A) THE OCCURRENCE AND CONTINUANCE OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT OR (B) EXCESS AVAILABILITY OF LESS THAN (A) 10.0% OF THE  REVOLVING LOAN CAP AT ANY TIME OR (B) 12.5% OF THE REVOLVING LOAN CAP FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS. DURING 2018, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TERM  22  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LOAN AND ARE BEING AMORTIZED OVER ITS TERM. THE ELIMINATION OF CASH DOMINION STATUS CHANGED THE DEBT CLASSIFICATION FROM A SHORT-TERM TO LONG-TERM OBLIGATION.  ON FEBRUARY 26, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO AMENDMENT NO. 3 (THE \u201cTHIRD TERM LOAN AMENDMENT\u201d) TO THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT. THE THIRD TERM  LOAN AMENDMENT PROVIDED FOR, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A MODIFICATION TO THE DEFINITION OF \u201cCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\u201d AND \u201cPERMITTED INDEBTEDNESS\u201d AS DEFINED IN THE THIRD TERM LOAN AMENDMENT.  THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT CONTAINS CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, AFFIRMATIVE AND NEGATIVE COVENANTS INCLUDING THE RETENTION OF THE EXISTING  MINIMUM 1.0 TO 1.0 CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH LIMITS BORROWING AVAILABILITY IF NOT MET DURING PERIODS WHERE REVOLVING EXCESS AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) IS LESS THAN THE  GREATER OF $20.0 MILLION OR 10.0 PERCENT OF COMBINED LOAN CAP (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) FOR FOUR CONSECUTIVE BUSINESS DAYS, AND EVENTS OF DEFAULT FOR A FACILITY OF THIS TYPE. THE TERM LOAN IS SECURED BY A SECOND LIEN SECURITY  INTEREST (SUBORDINATE ONLY TO THE LIENS SECURING THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) ON ALL ASSETS SECURING THE CREDIT AGREEMENT (WHICH CONSIST OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR PERSONAL PROPERTY), EXCEPT FURNITURE, FIXTURES AND EQUIPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,  UPON WHICH THE TERM LOAN LENDERS HAVE A FIRST LIEN SECURITY INTEREST.  THE TERM LOAN IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS IF AN EVENT OF  DEFAULT (AS DEFINED IN THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT) EXISTS. IF NO SUCH EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS, PROCEEDS OF THE TERM LOAN PRIORITY COLLATERAL ARE TO BE APPLIED TO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE TERM LOAN AGENT AND WELLS FARGO HAVE ENTERED INTO AN INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT DATED AS OF MARCH 14, 2018 (THE \u201cINTERCREDITOR  AGREEMENT\u201d), ACKNOWLEDGED BY US UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT WAS ALSO AMENDED ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2018 TO INCORPORATE THE AMENDMENT TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE TERM LOAN AGREEMENT.  THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE FOR THE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TERM LOAN WAS 10.84 PERCENT AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  PROMISSORY NOTE  WE BELIEVE WE CAN BORROW, ON A SHORT-TERM  BASIS AND SUBJECT TO THE FORMAL AGREEMENT OF THE LENDER, AMOUNTS UP TO THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES RELATED TO OUR EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY IF NEEDED. AT MAY 4, 2019, THE  CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF OUR LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WAS $15.2 MILLION.  ON FEBRUARY 2, 2018, WE EXECUTED A PROMISSORY NOTE UNDER WHICH WE  BORROWED APPROXIMATELY $13.7 MILLION (THE \u201cPROMISSORY NOTE\u201d) FROM SUNTRUST BANK (THE \u201cTRUSTEE\u201d) IN ITS CAPACITY AS THE TRUSTEE UNDER A TRUST AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTRUST AGREEMENT\u201d) DATED SEPTEMBER 1, 1999. THE TRUST  ESTABLISHED BY THE TRUST AGREEMENT (THE \u201cTRUST\u201d) HOLDS CERTAIN LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES RELATED TO OUR EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS. THE TRUSTEE OBTAINED LOANS FROM THE INSURANCE POLICIES HELD IN THE TRUST IN AN AMOUNT NOT LESS  THAN THE AMOUNT OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE. THE PROMISSORY NOTE WAS A SHORT-TERM OBLIGATION AND THE PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PAY DOWN BORROWINGS UNDER THE EXISTING CREDIT AGREEMENT WHICH PROVIDED ADDITIONAL AVAILABILITY UNDER THAT AGREEMENT.  THE PROMISSORY NOTE HAD A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF 3.58 PERCENT PER ANNUM AND AN ORIGINAL MATURITY DATE OF APRIL 1, 2018. ON MARCH 7, 2018,  WE EXECUTED AN AMENDMENT TO THE PROMISSORY NOTE UNDER WHICH THE TRUSTEE EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF THE NOTE FROM APRIL 1, 2018, TO JULY 1, 2018 (THE \u201cMATURITY DATE\u201d). THE AMENDMENT DID NOT ALTER THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THE  PROMISSORY NOTE. THE PROMISSORY NOTE COULD BE PREPAID IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT ANY TIME. ALL UNPAID PRINCIPAL AND ACCRUED INTEREST ON THE PROMISSORY NOTE WOULD HAVE BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE ON THE MATURITY DATE. THE TRUSTEE COULD OFFSET PAYMENTS DUE  UNDER THE PROMISSORY NOTE AGAINST AMOUNTS WE WOULD OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE TRUST UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TRUST AGREEMENT. ON JUNE 29, 2018, WE REPAID THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE PROMISSORY NOTE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, WE EXECUTED A SECOND PROMISSORY NOTE FROM SUNTRUST BANK FOR $13.0 MILLION, WHICH CARRIED A FIXED INTEREST RATE OF  3.58 PERCENT PER ANNUM AND AN ORIGINAL MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 10, 2018. THIS NOTE INCLUDED THE SAME TERMS AS THE PROMISSORY NOTE EXECUTED ON FEBRUARY 2, 2018. ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2018, WE REPAID THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE  SECOND PROMISSORY NOTE.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS ARE DRIVEN BY SALES AS WELL AS THE CREDIT TERMS AVAILABLE TO US FROM OUR VENDORS AND THEIR  FACTORS. OUR SALES GENERATE CASH ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AND ARE AFFECTED BY CUSTOMER TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES AND THE DESIRABILITY OF OUR MERCHANDISE TO THOSE CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMER TRAFFIC IS IN TURN AFFECTED BY OUR MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, GENERAL  ECONOMIC  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS, AND WEATHER. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE SALES AND THUS CASH INFLOWS TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS.  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS CAN BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN CREDIT TERMS AND AVAILABILITY FROM OUR VENDORS AND THEIR FACTORS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018, OUR VENDORS AND FACTORS CONSTRICTED OUR CREDIT TERMS AND LIMITS SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS WAS A REACTION TO OUR 2017 THIRD-QUARTER RESULTS, AS WELL AS CONCERN ABOUT THE GENERAL RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME, WHICH INCLUDED MULTIPLE BANKRUPTCIES AND  RESTRUCTURINGS BY OTHER RETAILERS IN THE SAME BUSINESS. THIS CONSTRICTION CAUSED US TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO OUR VENDORS AND FACTORS MORE QUICKLY THAN IN PRIOR PERIODS, THUS INCREASING OUR DEBT LEVELS DURING THAT PERIOD. THE ADDED AVAILABILITY FROM THE  TERM LOAN AGREEMENT WAS A KEY PART OF OUR ABILITY TO FUND THE ACCELERATED PAYMENTS. WE  HAVE NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS  WITH THE MAJOR FACTORS, CREDIT INSURERS AND SEVERAL OF OUR LARGEST VENDORS WHICH  ALLOW US TO COMMUNICATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS TO THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. DURING 2018, WE MADE PERIODIC PRESENTATIONS TO OUR KEY VENDORS AND FACTORS AND WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS TO THEM. THESE  STEPS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN THEIR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WITH US, WHICH HAS CONTINUED THROUGH THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  OUR  WORKING CAPITAL FLUCTUATES WITH SEASONAL VARIATIONS WHICH AFFECT OUR BORROWINGS AND AVAILABILITY. OUR AVAILABILITY IS HIGHEST JUST AFTER OUR STRONG SEASONAL SPRING AND HOLIDAY SELLING SEASONS AND IS LOWEST JUST BEFORE THOSE SEASONS AS WE BUILD  INVENTORY LEVELS. WORKING CAPITAL IS ALSO USED TO SUPPORT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS FOR MAINTENANCE OF OUR EXISTING STORES, SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW STORE OPENINGS. WE HAVE REDUCED OUR CAPITAL INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE OUR CASH FLOWS. THESE REDUCED LEVELS  OF INVESTMENT CAN BE SUSTAINED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS PRIOR TO THIS OUR STORE BASE AND SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN WELL MAINTAINED. POSITIVE OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS WILL HELP US PRESERVE SATISFACTORY CREDIT TERMS AND ALLOW US TO OPERATE WITHIN  THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN AGREEMENT.  BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS REGARDING  OUR OPERATING RESULTS WE CONSIDER OUR RESOURCES ADEQUATE TO SATISFY OUR CASH NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $21.9 MILLION AND $118.8 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $35.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN, FOR A TOTAL OF $153.0 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, NET OF  $0.8 MILLION IN UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. AS OF FEBRUARY 2, 2019, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $9.0 MILLION AND $119.1 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT AND $35.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE  TERM LOAN, FOR A TOTAL OF $153.3 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS, NET OF $0.8 MILLION IN UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS. AS OF MAY 5, 2018, WE HAD CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS OF $16.2 MILLION AND $146.1 MILLION IN  BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT, $50.0 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE TERM LOAN AND $13.3 MILLION IN BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROMISSORY NOTE, FOR A TOTAL OF $209.4 MILLION IN OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. THE TOTAL AMOUNT AVAILABLE FOR  BORROWINGS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT IS THE LESSER OF $240.0 MILLION OR 100 PERCENT OF ELIGIBLE CREDIT CARD RECEIVABLES AND THE NET RECOVERY PERCENTAGE VALUE OF INVENTORIES LESS RESERVES. ON MAY 4, 2019, IN  ADDITION TO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND TERM LOAN, WE HAD $7.9 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT. OUR EXCESS AVAILABILITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WAS $102.0 MILLION ON MAY 4, 2019. AS OF  MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $15.2 MILLION AVAILABLE TO BORROW, ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS, WHICH WOULD BE COLLATERALIZED BY LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES.

THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED CREDIT TERMS FROM VENDORS AND FACTORS SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018. OUR DECREASED INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER LAST YEAR ALSO AFFECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $1.7 MILLION FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $0.9 MILLION FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE CHANGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LAST YEAR\u2019S PROCEEDS FROM CANCELLED  CORPORATE-OWNED LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES.  24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $0.6 MILLION DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4,  2019, COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $52.1 MILLION DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD NET REPAYMENTS OF DEBT OF $0.3 MILLION. WE PAID ACCRUED CASH DIVIDENDS  ON VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS OF LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION AND CAPITAL LEASE PAYMENTS OF $0.2 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED 102,543 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $0.1 MILLION. DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018, WE HAD NET  PROCEEDS OF DEBT OF $53.3 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR ACCELERATED PAYMENTS TO VENDORS. WE ALSO PAID DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS OF $0.8 MILLION, PAID ACCRUED CASH DIVIDENDS ON VESTED EMPLOYEE STOCK AWARDS OF $0.1 MILLION AND CAPITAL LEASE  PAYMENTS OF $0.2 MILLION. IN ADDITION, WE REPURCHASED 45,103 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR LESS THAN $0.1 MILLION.

EXCEPT FOR THE ADOPTION OF THE LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD (TOPIC  842), WE HAVE MADE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES SINCE FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  RECENT ACCOUNTING  PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 \u201cBASIS OF PRESENTATION\u201d OF THE NOTES TO CONDENSED  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED).  SEASONALITY AND INFLATION  OUR BUSINESS IS SEASONAL. SALES AND PROFITABILITY ARE HISTORICALLY HIGHER IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR, WHICH INCLUDE THE SPRING  AND HOLIDAY SEASONS. THEREFORE, RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THAT OUR INCOME WILL BE INFLUENCED BY GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT INFLATION HAS HAD A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT OUR BUSINESS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED MATERIALLY BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.  ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED  THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES, AS DEFINED IN RULES  13A-15(E)  AND  15D-15(E)  UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF  1934, AS AMENDED (THE \u201cEXCHANGE ACT\u201d), AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES WERE  EFFECTIVE AS OF MAY 4, 2019, TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN OUR REPORTS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SEC\u2019S  RULES AND FORMS, AND THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.  THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE MOST RECENT FISCAL QUARTER THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED OR ARE  REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OTHER THAN THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASC 842,  LEASES,  ON FEBRUARY 3, 2019, AND IMPLEMENTED NEW CONTROLS AND PROCESSES TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE  STANDARD.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  AS A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE, WE MANUFACTURE, RECYCLE, AND MARKET STEEL AND METAL PRODUCTS, RELATED MATERIALS AND SERVICES THROUGH A NETWORK OF FACILITIES THAT INCLUDES  EIGHT  ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE  (\"  EAF  \") MINI MILLS,  TWO  EAF  MICRO MILLS, A REROLLING MILL, STEEL FABRICATION AND PROCESSING PLANTS, CONSTRUCTION-RELATED PRODUCT WAREHOUSES, AND METAL RECYCLING FACILITIES IN THE UNITED STATES (\"U.S.\") AND POLAND. OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.  AMERICAS RECYCLING  ,  AMERICAS MILLS  ,  AMERICAS FABRICATION  , AND  INTERNATIONAL MILL.  FINANCIAL RESULTS OVERVIEW  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND EXCLUDES ANY RESULTS OF OUR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

OUR RESULTS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  INCLUDE THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DISCUSSED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  , WHICH CONTRIBUTED NET SALES OF  $453.5 MILLION  QUARTER-TO-DATE AND  $958.6 MILLION  YEAR-TO-DATE.  THIRD  QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE NET SALES IN OUR AMERICAS MILLS SEGMENT INCREASED IN FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018, DUE TO THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND AN INCREASE IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES IN BOTH FISCAL PERIODS.  THIRD  QUARTER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WERE DOWN IN FISCAL  2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , IN OUR AMERICAS RECYCLING AND INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENTS, LEADING TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS RECYCLING SEGMENT ON BOTH A QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS AND IN THE INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENT ON A YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS. QUARTER-TO-DATE NET SALES IN THE INTERNATIONAL MILL SEGMENT, HOWEVER, INCREASED AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN TONS SHIPPED. IN OUR AMERICAS FABRICATION SEGMENT, THIRD QUARTER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WERE UP IN FISCAL 2019, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, AS WE HAVE SHIPPED THE MAJORITY OF THE LOWER PRICED WORK IN OUR BACKLOG LEADING TO YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES ON BOTH A QUARTER AND YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS.  EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED $36.2 MILLION AND $28.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS FOR FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN QUARTER-TO-DATE AND YEAR-TO-DATE METAL MARGINS AND TONS SHIPPED IN OUR AMERICAS MILLS SEGMENT.  29  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  INCREASED  $14.0 MILLION  AND  $25.4 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE  AND  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  $7.0 MILLION  AND  $28.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  . THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , INCLUDING ISSUANCE OF THE  2026 NOTES  AND A DRAW UNDER THE  2018 TERM LOAN  (BOTH DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  ), WHICH DROVE INCREASES OF $5.4 MILLION AND $18.2 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCREASE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31,  2019  WERE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTIONS IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST OF $7.2 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF THE OKLAHOMA MICRO MILL IN FISCAL 2018.  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS  27.0%  AND  31.9%  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED WITH  23.9%  AND  21.8%  , FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CURRENT PERIOD WAS GREATER THAN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF TAX EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR, BOTH AS A RESULT OF THE  TCJA  . SEE  NOTE 12, INCOME TAX  , FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF THE  TCJA  TO EACH COMPARATIVE PERIOD.

THE  INCREASE  IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO SHIPMENTS FROM THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  OF  469  THOUSAND SHORT TONS AND  974  THOUSAND SHORT TONS FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO  INCREASED  NET SALES WERE  INCREASED  AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  $38  PER SHORT TON AND  $87  PER SHORT TON FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AS TRADE ACTIONS RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED IN THE U.S., AIMED AT UNFAIRLY PRICED STEEL IMPORTS, HAVE FAVORABLY IMPACTED THE PRICING ENVIRONMENT.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  $68.5 MILLION  AND  $189.4 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  , WITH THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  CONTRIBUTING  $53.6 MILLION  AND  $87.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE  INCREASE  IN ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND METAL MARGIN EXPANSION OF  27%  AND  28%  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO DECREASES IN FERROUS SCRAP PRICES AND MANUFACTURING COSTS DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION LEVELS. ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $1.1 MILLION  AND  $3.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $1.1 MILLION  AND  $3.9 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

THE  INCREASE  IN NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN SHORT TONS SHIPPED OF  167 THOUSAND  AND  376 THOUSAND  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO SHIPMENTS BY THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  DURING FISCAL  2019  , AND BY INCREASES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES OF  $148  AND  $102  PER TON, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018, AS SELLING PRICES HAVE INCREASED IN RESPONSE TO RISING INPUT COSTS. NET SALES FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  INCLUDED AMORTIZATION BENEFIT OF  $23.4 MILLION  AND  $58.2 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO THE UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , AMERICAS FABRICATION REPORTED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $23.3 MILLION  AND  $109.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $8.2 MILLION  AND  $14.8 MILLION  IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  . THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WAS THE ADDITIONAL VOLUME AND LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND COMPRESSION IN METAL MARGINS AS AVERAGE SELLING PRICES HAVE NOT INCREASED AS MUCH AS REBAR PRICES. AS THE MAJORITY OF OUR REBAR FABRICATION PROJECTS IN THIS SEGMENT ARE FIXED PRICE, THERE IS A LAG BETWEEN CURRENT MARKET PRICES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICE OF MATERIAL WE SHIP AS WE WORK THROUGH THE PROJECT BACKLOG. HOWEVER, IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE EXISTING BUSINESS APPROACHED BREAK-EVEN LEVELS AT CURRENT REBAR SELLING PRICES, WHILE THE UNFAVORABLE CONTRACT BACKLOG ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES HAD A LOWER PER TON VALUE AND IS EXPECTED TO TURN PROFITABLE IN FISCAL 2020. ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $0.4 MILLION  AND  $1.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $0.3 MILLION  AND  $1.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS DUE TO A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS OF  18%  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  13%  DECREASE  IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE REDUCTION IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED IMPORTS INTO THE EUROPEAN UNION. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , THE  DECREASE  IN NET SALES COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A  4%  DECREASE  IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE WHILE SHIPMENTS REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT. NET SALES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $20.2  MILLION AND  $46.9  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  DECREASED  $7.9 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN METAL MARGINS. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  DECREASED  $17.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , DRIVEN, IN PART, BY THE  DECREASE  IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES DESCRIBED ABOVE AND AN  INCREASE  IN MANUFACTURING COSTS ON A PER TON BASIS DUE TO A DECREASE IN MELT SHOP VOLUMES. ADJUSTED EBITDA INCLUDED NON-CASH STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF  $0.4 MILLION  AND  $0.7 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND  $0.2 MILLION  AND  $1.2 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. ADJUSTED EBITDA FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  REFLECTED UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.3  MILLION AND  $5.7  MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE FLUCTUATIONS OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN RELATION TO THE POLISH ZLOTY.  32  CORPORATE AND OTHER  CORPORATE AND OTHER REPORTED AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $27.3 MILLION  AND  $111.0 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO AN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS OF  $31.8 MILLION  AND  $81.8 MILLION  FOR THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS IN FISCAL  2018  , RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  , THE INCREASE IN ADJUSTED EBITDA LOSS, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL  2018  , WAS LARGELY DRIVEN BY A  $25.3 MILLION  INCREASE  IN CORPORATE EXPENSES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL FEES RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  AND OTHER LEGAL EXPENSES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WHILE WE BELIEVE THE LENDING INSTITUTIONS PARTICIPATING IN OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE FINANCIALLY CAPABLE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE BANKING AND CAPITAL MARKETS PERIODICALLY EXPERIENCE VOLATILITY THAT MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE CAPITAL IN A COST EFFICIENT MANNER. IN ADDITION, OUR FINANCING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RAISING CAPITAL MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES TO OUR CREDIT RATING MADE BY ANY RATING AGENCY.  SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE HAVE ACCESS TO THE  $350.0 MILLION  REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR SALE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS, AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  WE ACTIVELY MONITOR OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND, BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMERS' FINANCIAL CONDITION, WE RECORD ALLOWANCES AS SOON AS WE BELIEVE ACCOUNTS ARE UNCOLLECTIBLE. CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE LIQUIDITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL ALLOWANCES AS WE MAKE OUR ASSESSMENTS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE CREDIT INSURANCE INTERNATIONALLY TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF CUSTOMER INSOLVENCY. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT INSURED RECEIVABLES (AND THOSE COVERED BY EXPORT LETTERS OF CREDIT) WAS APPROXIMATELY  12%  OF TOTAL TRADE RECEIVABLES AT  MAY 31, 2019.  THE TABLE BELOW SHOWS OUR SOURCES, FACILITIES AND AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  .

CASH FLOWS  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES RESULT PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF STEEL, NONFERROUS METALS AND RELATED PRODUCTS. WE HAVE A DIVERSE AND GENERALLY STABLE CUSTOMER BASE. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE FUTURES OR FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MITIGATE THE RISKS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN COMMODITY PRICES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, NATURAL GAS PRICES AND INTEREST RATES. SEE  NOTE 10, DERIVATIVES AND RISK MANAGEMENT  , FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE  $218.5 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED TO  $330.5 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  .  THE DECREASE IN CASH USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $124.1 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH COLLECTIONS OF THE  DPP  FROM THE  PROGRAMS  DESCRIBED IN NOTE 6, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  , AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  . THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A  $9.8 MILLION  YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN CASH USED IN OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (\"WORKING CAPITAL\") FOR THE  NINE  MONTHS ENDED  MAY 31, 2019  . FOR CONTINUING OPERATIONS, OPERATING WORKING CAPITAL DAYS DETERIORATED FOUR DAYS ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  33  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INCREASED  $794.1 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR  INCREASE  IN CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  , AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 2, ACQUISITION  . PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS INCREASE WAS A YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $52.5 MILLION.  WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FISCAL  2019  CAPITAL SPENDING WILL RANGE BETWEEN  $150 MILLION TO $175 MILLION  . WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR CAPITAL SPENDING BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED RESULTS.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET YEAR-OVER-YEAR CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL  2019  DECREASED  BY  $152.6 MILLION  COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . THE  DECREASE  WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $170 MILLION REDUCTION IN ISSUANCE OF LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL 2019 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL  2018  . WE REGULARLY EVALUATE THE USE OF OUR CASH IN EFFORTS TO MAXIMIZE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN, INCLUDING DEBT REPAYMENT, CAPITAL DEPLOYMENT, SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS.  WE ANTICIPATE OUR CURRENT CASH BALANCES, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND OUR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SCHEDULED DEBT REPAYMENTS, PAYMENTS FOR OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DIVIDENDS AND OTHER PRUDENT USES OF CAPITAL, SUCH AS FUTURE ACQUISITIONS. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AT  MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY  $316 MILLION  FROM  AUGUST 31, 2018  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  . THE INCREASE INCLUDES FINANCING AND RELATED INTEREST OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL OPEN PURCHASE ORDERS OF THE  ACQUIRED BUSINESSES  RELATED TO THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDING  MAY 31  , 2020 ARE APPROXIMATELY  $527 MILLION  AND PRIMARILY CONSIST OF EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL REVENUE PRODUCING ACTIVITIES.  OTHER COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS THAT OUR INSURANCE PROVIDERS AND SUPPLIERS REQUEST. AT  MAY 31, 2019  , WE HAD COMMITTED  $28.1 MILLION  UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, OF WHICH  $3.0 MILLION  REDUCED AVAILABILITY UNDER THE  REVOLVER  , AS DEFINED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS DESCRIBED IN  NOTE 9, CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS  , WE HAVE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PROGRAMS IN BOTH THE U.S. AND POLAND. AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, THE  PROGRAMS  WERE AMENDED SUCH THAT THEY NO LONGER QUALIFY FOR OFF-BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT. FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACCOUNTED FOR TRANSFERS OF THE TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS SALES. TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES TRANSFERRED WERE REMOVED FROM THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, AND CASH ADVANCES RECEIVED WERE REFLECTED AS CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.  CONTINGENCIES  IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF CONDUCTING OUR BUSINESS, WE BECOME INVOLVED IN LITIGATION, ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS. WE MAY INCUR SETTLEMENTS, FINES, PENALTIES OR JUDGMENTS AS A RESULT OF THESE MATTERS. LIABILITIES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES REQUIRE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING EACH MATTER AND THE ADVICE OF OUR LEGAL COUNSEL. WE RECORD LIABILITIES FOR LITIGATION-RELATED LOSSES WHEN A LOSS IS PROBABLE AND WE CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS. WE EVALUATE THE MEASUREMENT OF RECORDED LIABILITIES EACH REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES SPECIFIC TO EACH MATTER. THE ULTIMATE LOSSES INCURRED UPON FINAL RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION-RELATED LOSS CONTINGENCIES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE ESTIMATED LIABILITY RECORDED AT A PARTICULAR BALANCE SHEET DATE. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH CHANGES OCCUR. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY CURRENTLY PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO WHICH WE ARE A PARTY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SUMMARIZES THE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOWS AS OF AND FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED BELOW. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  IN ADDITION TO HISTORICAL INFORMATION, THIS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS THAT INVOLVE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS OUR PLANS, OBJECTIVES, EXPECTATIONS, AND INTENTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND THE TIMING OF EVENTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE DISCUSSED UNDER THE SECTION OF THIS ITEM 2 ENTITLED \u201cSAFE HARBOR STATEMENT.\u201d  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF OPERATING RESULTS  WE ARE A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED OFF-PRICE RETAILER OF HIGH-QUALITY, BRANDED APPAREL AT EVERYDAY LOW PRICES. WE OPENED OUR FIRST STORE IN BURLINGTON, NEW JERSEY IN 1972, SELLING PRIMARILY COATS AND OUTERWEAR. SINCE THEN, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR STORE BASE TO 684 STORES AS OF MAY 4, 2019, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE, IN 45 STATES AND PUERTO RICO, AND DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT CATEGORIES BY OFFERING AN EXTENSIVE SELECTION OF IN-SEASON, FASHION-FOCUSED MERCHANDISE, INCLUDING WOMEN\u2019S READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL, ACCESSORIES, FOOTWEAR, MENSWEAR, YOUTH APPAREL, BABY, HOME, COATS, BEAUTY, TOYS AND GIFTS. WE SELL A BROAD SELECTION OF DESIRABLE, FIRST-QUALITY, CURRENT-BRAND, LABELED MERCHANDISE ACQUIRED DIRECTLY FROM NATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER SUPPLIERS.  HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  WE GENERATED TOTAL REVENUES OF $1,634.2 MILLION COMPARED WITH $1,524.7 MILLION.  \u2022  NET SALES IMPROVED $110.1 MILLION TO $1,628.5 MILLION. COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASED 0.1%.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED TO 41.0% COMPARED WITH 41.2%. PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  \u2022  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED TO 31.8% COMPARED WITH 30.8%.  \u2022  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $77.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $82.6 MILLION.  \u2022  ADJUSTED NET INCOME DECREASED $1.5 MILLION TO $85.5 MILLION.  \u2022  ADJUSTED EBITDA IMPROVED $3.0 MILLION TO $167.9 MILLION.  \u2022  ADJUSTED EBIT DECREASED $2.3 MILLION TO $117.4 MILLION.  FISCAL YEAR  FISCAL 2019 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 1, 2020. FISCAL 2018 IS DEFINED AS THE 52-WEEK YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  STORE OPENINGS, CLOSINGS, AND RELOCATIONS  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE OPENED 17 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SIX RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED TWO STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF MAY 4, 2019 TO 684 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE.  20  ONGOING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2019  WE CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON A NUMBER OF ONGOING INITIATIVES AIMED AT INCREASING OUR OVERALL PROFITABILITY BY IMPROVING OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES TRENDS, INCREASING TOTAL SALES GROWTH AND REDUCING EXPENSES. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  DRIVING COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH.  WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE COMPARABLE STORE SALES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO ENHANCE EXECUTION OF THE OFF-PRICE MODEL.  WE PLAN TO DRIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY FOCUSING ON PRODUCT FRESHNESS TO ENSURE THAT WE CONSISTENTLY DELIVER NEWNESS TO THE SELLING FLOORS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORIES, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL RESULT IN FASTER INVENTORY TURNOVER. WE MAINTAIN OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR PACK-AND-HOLD PROGRAM, WHICH IS DESIGNED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TERRIFIC BUYS OF EITHER HIGHLY DESIRABLE BRANDED PRODUCT OR KEY SEASONAL MERCHANDISE FOR THE NEXT YEAR. WHILE THE AMOUNT OF GOODS WE PURCHASE ON PACK-AND-HOLD IS PURELY BASED ON THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE MARKETPLACE, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A GREAT AVENUE TO SOURCE PRODUCT. WE ALSO INTEND TO USE OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY SELL-THROUGH RATES BY PRODUCT, CAPITALIZE ON STRONG PERFORMING CATEGORIES, IDENTIFY AND BUY INTO NEW FASHION TRENDS AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY ACQUIRE PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  SHARPENING FOCUS ON OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER.  WE HAVE FOCUSED ON BETTER SERVING OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER, A BRAND-CONSCIOUS FASHION ENTHUSIAST, AGED 25-49, WITH AN AVERAGE ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $25,000-$100,000, BY IMPROVING OUR PRODUCT OFFERING, STORE MERCHANDISING AND MARKETING FOCUS ON WOMEN\u2019S READY-TO-WEAR APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL SALES FROM OUR CORE FEMALE CUSTOMER AND BECOME A DESTINATION FOR HER ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE EFFORTS WILL INCREASE THE FREQUENCY OF HER VISITS AND HER AVERAGE SPEND, FURTHER IMPROVING THE COMPARABLE STORE SALES PERFORMANCE IN WOMEN\u2019S CATEGORIES.  \u2022  CONTINUING TO IMPROVE OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE.  WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED THE STORE EXPERIENCE AND EASE OF SHOPPING AT ALL OF OUR STORES BY IMPLEMENTING A COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM FOCUSED ON OFFERING MORE BRANDS AND STYLES AND SIMPLIFYING STORE NAVIGATION. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THIS BY UTILIZING CLEAR WAY-FINDING SIGNS AND DISTINCT PRODUCT SIGNAGE, HIGHLIGHTING KEY BRANDS AND NEW ARRIVALS, IMPROVING ORGANIZATION OF THE FLOOR SPACE, REDUCING RACK DENSITY, FACILITATING QUICKER CHECKOUTS AND DELIVERING BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE. WE HAVE MADE PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENTS IN PRODUCT SIZE VISIBILITY, QUEUING AND FITTING ROOMS. TO ENSURE CONSISTENT EXECUTION OF OUR CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE PRIORITIES, WE HAVE IMPROVED OUR STORE ASSOCIATE TRAINING AND REORGANIZED AND STRENGTHENED OUR FIELD MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION. OUR MUCH IMPROVED STORE EXPERIENCE CONTINUES TO RESONATE WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR ONLINE CUSTOMER SURVEY TO PROVIDE MORE ACTIONABLE CUSTOMER FEEDBACK TO STORES. STORES DEVELOP ACTION PLANS TO ADDRESS CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AREAS OF FOCUS. STORE MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS, AND REACT ACCORDINGLY.  \u2022  INCREASING OUR SALES THROUGH E-COMMERCE.  WE HAVE BEEN SELLING TO OUR CUSTOMERS ONLINE FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. WE PLAN TO LEVERAGE THIS HERITAGE AND CONTINUE TO UTILIZE E-COMMERCE STRATEGIES OFFERING MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WHILE DRIVING INCREMENTAL TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES.  \u2022  ENHANCING EXISTING CATEGORIES AND INTRODUCING NEW CATEGORIES.  WE HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF CERTAIN EXISTING CATEGORIES SUCH AS LADIES\u2019 APPAREL, CHILDREN\u2019S PRODUCTS, BATH AND COSMETIC MERCHANDISE, HOUSEWARES, DE\u0301COR FOR THE HOME AND BEAUTY AS WE CONTINUE TO DE-WEATHER OUR BUSINESS, AND MAINTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO INTRODUCE NEW CATEGORIES.  \u2022  PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD.  WE HAVE PILOTED A NEW PRIVATE LABEL CREDIT CARD PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT TO 140 STORES, WITH PLANS TO BRING THE PROGRAM TO ALL STORES. WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DEEPEN CUSTOMER LOYALTY, INFORM CUSTOMER CONTACT STRATEGIES, AND DRIVE INCREASES IN TRIP FREQUENCY AND TRANSACTION SIZE.  21  \u2022  EXPANDING AND ENHANCING OUR RETAIL STORE BASE.  WE INTEND TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR RETAIL STORE BASE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  ADHERING TO A MARKET FOCUSED AND FINANCIALLY DISCIPLINED REAL ESTATE STRATEGY.  WE HAVE GROWN OUR STORE BASE CONSISTENTLY SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN 1972, DEVELOPING MORE THAN 99% OF OUR STORES ORGANICALLY. WE BELIEVE THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR RETAIL STORE BASE IN THE UNITED STATES. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ALLOW US TO REACH 1,000 STORES OVER THE LONG-TERM. OUR GOAL IS TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  \u2022  MAINTAINING FOCUS ON UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS.  WE HAVE ADOPTED A MARKET FOCUSED APPROACH TO NEW STORE OPENINGS WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON MAXIMIZING SALES WHILE ACHIEVING ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS AND RETURNS. BY FOCUSING ON OPENING STORES WITH ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS, WE ARE ABLE TO ACHIEVE ATTRACTIVE RETURNS ON CAPITAL AND CONTINUE TO GROW OUR MARGINS. WE BELIEVE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY, WE WILL BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF OUR STORES WHILE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR BROAD ASSORTMENT.  \u2022  ENHANCING THE STORE EXPERIENCE THROUGH STORE REMODELS AND RELOCATIONS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN STORE REMODELS ON A STORE-BY-STORE BASIS WHERE APPROPRIATE, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE AGE, SALES AND PROFITABILITY OF A STORE, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT TO THE CUSTOMER SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. IN OUR REMODELED STORES, WE HAVE TYPICALLY INCORPORATED NEW FLOORING, PAINTING, LIGHTING AND GRAPHICS, RELOCATED OUR FITTING ROOMS TO MAXIMIZE PRODUCTIVE SELLING SPACE, ADDED NEW DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HOME AND ACCESSORIES AND MADE VARIOUS OTHER IMPROVEMENTS AS APPROPRIATE BY LOCATION.  \u2022  ENHANCING OPERATING MARGINS.  WE INTEND TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES.  \u2022  OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MARKDOWN SYSTEM ALLOWS US TO MAXIMIZE SALES AND GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS BASED ON FORWARD-LOOKING SALES FORECASTS, SELL-THROUGH TARGETS, AND EXIT DATES. THIS ALLOWS US TO OPTIMIZE MARKDOWNS AT THE STYLE AND COLOR LEVEL BY STORE CLUSTER.  \u2022  ENHANCE PURCHASING POWER.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR INCREASING SIZE AND WEST COAST BUYING OFFICE PROVIDE US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CAPTURE INCREMENTAL BUYING OPPORTUNITIES AND REALIZE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IN OUR MERCHANDISING AND NON-MERCHANDISING PURCHASING ACTIVITIES.  \u2022  DRIVE OPERATING LEVERAGE.  WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE OUR GROWING SALES OVER THE FIXED COSTS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE FOCUSED ON CONTINUING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR CORPORATE AND IN-STORE OPERATIONS.  UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES  AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE PROFITABILITY THROUGH ACHIEVING POSITIVE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND LEVERAGING PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE IN-STORE EXPERIENCE, MORE EFFICIENT MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS FROM THE VENDORS TO THE SELLING FLOORS, AND MODIFYING OUR MARKETING PLANS TO INCREASE OUR CORE CUSTOMER BASE AND INCREASE OUR SHARE OF OUR CURRENT CUSTOMERS\u2019 SPENDING, THERE ARE UNCERTAINTIES AND CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS AN OFF-PRICE RETAILER OF APPAREL AND ACCESSORIES FOR MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND HOME FURNISHINGS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES OR INCOME.  SEASONALITY OF SALES AND WEATHER CONDITIONS  . OUR SALES, LIKE MOST OTHER RETAILERS, ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL INFLUENCES, WITH THE MAJORITY OF OUR SALES AND NET INCOME DERIVED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, WHICH INCLUDES THE BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND HOLIDAY SEASONS.  WEATHER CONTINUES TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE SALE OF OUR CLOTHING. GENERALLY, OUR SALES ARE HIGHER IF THE WEATHER IS COLD DURING THE FALL AND WARM DURING THE EARLY SPRING. SALES OF COLD WEATHER CLOTHING ARE INCREASED BY EARLY COLD WEATHER DURING THE FALL, WHILE SALES OF WARM WEATHER CLOTHING ARE IMPROVED BY EARLY WARM WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE DIVERSIFIED OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, WE BELIEVE TRAFFIC TO OUR STORES IS STILL DRIVEN, IN PART, BY WEATHER PATTERNS.  GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.  CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS, INCLUDING SPENDING FOR THE MERCHANDISE THAT WE SELL, ARE AFFECTED BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PREVAILING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INFLATION, LEVELS OF EMPLOYMENT, SALARIES AND WAGE RATES, PREVAILING INTEREST RATES, HOUSING COSTS, ENERGY COSTS, COMMODITIES PRICING, INCOME TAX RATES AND POLICIES, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND CONSUMER PERCEPTION OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMER PURCHASING PATTERNS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY CONSUMERS\u2019 DISPOSABLE INCOME, CREDIT AVAILABILITY AND DEBT LEVELS.  22  A SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ECONOMIC OUTLOOK OR A CREDIT CRISIS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT CONSUMER SPENDING HABITS RESULTING IN LOWER NET SALES AND PROFITS THAN EXPECTED ON A QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL BASIS. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS AL  SO AFFECTED BY THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SITUATION. OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN AREAS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TAXES AND HEALTHCARE. ONGOING INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND T  ARIFF NEGOTIATIONS COULD HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR INCOME AND AN INDIRECT IMPACT ON CONSUMER PRICES. THE OUTBREAK OR ESCALATION OF WAR, OR THE OCCURRENCE OF TERRORIST ACTS OR OTHER HOSTILITIES IN OR AFFECTING THE U.S., COULD LEAD TO A DECREASE IN SPENDIN  G BY CONSUMERS. IN ADDITION, NATURAL DISASTERS, INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS AND ACTS OF WAR IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DISRUPTING SUPPLIES AND RAISING PRICES GLOBALLY WHICH, IN TURN, MAY HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE WORLD AND U.S. ECONO  MIES AND LEAD TO A DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND SPENDING.  WE CLOSELY MONITOR OUR NET SALES, GROSS MARGIN AND EXPENSES. WE HAVE PERFORMED SCENARIO PLANNING SUCH THAT IF OUR NET SALES DECLINE, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED VARIABLE COSTS THAT COULD BE REDUCED TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THESE DECLINES. IF WE WERE TO EXPERIENCE ADVERSE ECONOMIC TRENDS AND/OR IF OUR EFFORTS TO COUNTERACT THE IMPACTS OF THESE TRENDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY EFFECTIVE, THERE COULD BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND POSITION IN FUTURE FISCAL PERIODS.  COMPETITION AND MARGIN PRESSURE.  WE BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, WE MUST CONTINUE TO OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT A DISCOUNT TO PRICES OFFERED BY OTHER RETAILERS AS WELL AS AN ASSORTMENT OF MERCHANDISE THAT IS APPEALING TO OUR CUSTOMERS.  THE U.S. RETAIL APPAREL AND HOME FURNISHINGS MARKETS ARE HIGHLY FRAGMENTED AND COMPETITIVE. WE COMPETE FOR BUSINESS WITH DEPARTMENT STORES, OFF-PRICE RETAILERS, INTERNET RETAILERS, SPECIALTY STORES, DISCOUNT STORES, WHOLESALE CLUBS, AND OUTLET STORES AS WELL AS WITH C  ERTAIN TRADITIONAL, FULL-PRICE RETAIL CHAINS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED OFF-PRICE CONCEPTS  . AT VARIOUS TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, TRADITIONAL FULL-PRICE DEPARTMENT STORE CHAINS AND SPECIALTY SHOPS OFFER BRAND-NAME MERCHANDISE AT SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWNS, WHICH CAN RESULT IN PRICES APPROXIMATING THOSE OFFERED BY US AT OUR BURLINGTON STORES. WE ANTICIPATE THAT COMPETITION WILL INCREASE IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO DIFFERENTIATE OUR STORES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.  THE U.S. RETAIL INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO FACE INCREASED PRESSURE ON MARGINS AS OVERALL CHALLENGING RETAIL CONDITIONS HAVE LED CONSUMERS TO BE MORE VALUE CONSCIOUS. OUR \u201cOPEN TO BUY\u201d PARADIGM, UNDER WHICH WE PURCHASE BOTH PRE-SEASON AND IN-SEASON MERCHANDISE, ALLOWS US THE FLEXIBILITY TO PURCHASE LESS PRE-SEASON WITH THE BALANCE PURCHASED IN-SEASON AND OPPORTUNISTICALLY. IT ALSO PROVIDES US WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO SHIFT PURCHASES BETWEEN SUPPLIERS AND CATEGORIES. THIS ENABLES US TO OBTAIN BETTER TERMS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO HELP OFFSET ANY RISING COSTS OF GOODS.  KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES  WE CONSIDER NUMEROUS FACTORS IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE. KEY PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT INCLUDE NET INCOME, ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBIT, COMPARABLE STORE SALES, GROSS MARGIN, INVENTORY, STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES AND LIQUIDITY.  NET INCOME  . WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $77.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH NET INCOME OF $82.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT  : ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES OF OUR PERFORMANCE.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED NET INCOME AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (II) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; AND (V) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS, ALL OF WHICH ARE TAX EFFECTED TO ARRIVE AT ADJUSTED NET INCOME.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; (VI) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE DEFINE ADJUSTED EBIT AS NET INCOME, EXCLUSIVE OF THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, IF APPLICABLE: (I) INTEREST EXPENSE; (II) INTEREST INCOME; (III) LOSS ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT; (IV) INCOME TAX EXPENSE; (V) IMPAIRMENT CHARGES; (VI) NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST; (VII) COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS; AND (VIII) OTHER UNUSUAL, NON-RECURRING OR EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSES, LOSSES, CHARGES OR GAINS.  WE PRESENT ADJUSTED NET INCOME, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBIT, BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THEY ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES IN EVALUATING THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR BUSINESS AND PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN PARTICULAR,  23  WE BELIEVE THAT EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMS THAT MAY VARY SUBSTANTIAL  LY IN FREQUENCY AND MAGNITUDE FROM OPERATING INCOME ARE USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL MEASURES THAT ASSIST IN EVALUATING OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE EARNINGS AND LEVERAGE SALES, AND TO MORE READILY COMPARE THESE METRICS BETWEEN PAST AND FUTURE PERIODS.  ADJUSTED NET INCOME HAS LIMITATIONS AS AN ANALYTICAL TOOL, AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED EITHER IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR NET INCOME OR OTHER DATA PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.

DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, ADJUSTED NET INCOME DECLINED $1.5 MILLION TO $85.5 MILLION. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE.

THESE EXPENSES ARE RECORDED IN THE LINE ITEM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES.  COMPARABLE STORE SALES MEASURE PERFORMANCE OF A STORE DURING THE CURRENT REPORTING PERIOD AGAINST THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SAME STORE IN THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING COMPARABLE STORE SALES VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR DEFINITION OF COMPARABLE STORE SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS.  WE DEFINE COMPARABLE STORE SALES AS MERCHANDISE SALES OF THOSE STORES, INCLUDING OUR ONLINE STORE, COMMENCING ON THE FIRST DAY OF THE FISCAL MONTH ONE YEAR AFTER THE END OF THEIR GRAND OPENING ACTIVITIES, WHICH NORMALLY CONCLUDE WITHIN THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF OPERATIONS. IF A STORE IS CLOSED FOR SEVEN OR MORE DAYS DURING A MONTH, OUR POLICY IS TO REMOVE THAT STORE FROM OUR CALCULATION OF COMPARABLE STORES SALES FOR ANY SUCH MONTH, AS WELL AS DURING THE MONTH(S) OF THEIR GRAND RE-OPENING ACTIVITIES. THE INCREASE IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WAS AS FOLLOWS.  THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 4, 2019  0.1%  MAY 5, 2018  4.8%  VARIOUS FACTORS AFFECT COMPARABLE STORE SALES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WEATHER CONDITIONS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE TIMING OF OUR RELEASES OF NEW MERCHANDISE AND PROMOTIONAL EVENTS, THE GENERAL RETAIL SALES ENVIRONMENT, CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND BUYING TRENDS, CHANGES IN SALES MIX AMONG DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, COMPETITION, AND THE SUCCESS OF MARKETING PROGRAMS.  GROSS MARGIN.  GROSS MARGIN IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NET SALES AND THE COST OF SALES. OUR COST OF SALES AND GROSS MARGIN MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER ENTITIES, SINCE SOME ENTITIES MAY INCLUDE ALL OF THE COSTS RELATED TO THEIR BUYING AND DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS, CERTAIN STORE-RELATED COSTS AND OTHER COSTS, IN COST OF SALES. WE INCLUDE CERTAIN OF THESE COSTS IN THE LINE ITEMS \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d AND \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d IN OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. WE INCLUDE IN OUR \u201cCOST OF SALES\u201d LINE ITEM ALL COSTS OF MERCHANDISE (NET OF PURCHASE DISCOUNTS AND CERTAIN VENDOR ALLOWANCES), INBOUND FREIGHT, DISTRIBUTION CENTER OUTBOUND FREIGHT AND CERTAIN MERCHANDISE ACQUISITION COSTS, PRIMARILY COMMISSIONS AND IMPORT FEES. GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS TO 41.0% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN  . PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  INVENTORY.  INVENTORY AT MAY 4, 2019 INCREASED TO $895.8 MILLION COMPARED WITH $786.6 MILLION AT MAY 5, 2018. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY LEVELS, WHICH WERE 28% OF TOTAL INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO 27% AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCREASE RELATED TO OUR 37 NET NEW STORES OPENED FROM MAY 5, 2018 THROUGH MAY 4, 2019. COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 5%.  26  INVENTORY AT  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  WAS $954.2  MILLION. THE  DECREASE  IN INVENTORY FROM  FEBRUARY 2, 2019  REFLECTS THE SEASONALITY OF OUR BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INVENTORY REQUIRED FOR OUR  NINE  NET NE  W STORES OPENED DURING  THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019.  IN ORDER TO BETTER SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAXIMIZE SALES, WE CONTINUE TO REFINE OUR MERCHANDISING MIX AND INVENTORY LEVELS WITHIN OUR STORES. BY APPROPRIATELY MANAGING OUR INVENTORIES, WE BELIEVE WE WILL BE BETTER ABLE TO DELIVER A CONTINUAL FLOW OF FRESH MERCHANDISE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD MORE PRODUCTIVE INVENTORIES BY INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT INVENTORY AS A PERCENT OF TOTAL INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER ARE PERFORMANCE METRICS THAT INDICATE HOW EFFICIENTLY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. THEY EACH MEASURE THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT WE OWN OUR INVENTORY.  INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COST OF GOODS SOLD BY THE 13 MONTH AVERAGE COST VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. OUR INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  8% FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING COMPARABLE STORE SALES BY THE AVERAGE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORY FOR THE PERIOD BEING MEASURED. THE COMPARABLE STORE RETAIL VALUE OF INVENTORIES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE ORIGINAL SALES PRICE OF ITEMS ON HAND REDUCED BY RETAIL REDUCTIONS (WHICH INCLUDE SALES, MARKDOWNS, AN ESTIMATED SHORTAGE ADJUSTMENT AND EMPLOYEE DISCOUNTS) FOR OUR COMPARABLE STORES. THE CALCULATION IS BASED ON A ROLLING 13 MONTH AVERAGE OF INVENTORY (AT ESTIMATED RETAIL VALUE) AND THE LAST 12 MONTHS\u2019 COMPARABLE SALES. OUR COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER RATE DECLINED APPROXIMATELY  4% DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED WITH THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INVENTORY TURNOVER AND COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE LATTER NOT INCLUDING DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND WAREHOUSE INVENTORY OR INVENTORY AT NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES. INVENTORY HELD AT OUR WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS INCLUDES MERCHANDISE BEING READIED FOR SHIPMENT TO OUR STORES AND PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY ACQUIRED OPPORTUNISTICALLY FOR FUTURE STORE RELEASE. THE MAGNITUDE OF PACK-AND-HOLD INVENTORY, AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME, IS DEPENDENT ON THE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MARKETPLACE.  WE PRESENT INVENTORY TURNOVER, BECAUSE IT DEMONSTRATES HOW EFFECTIVE WE ARE AT MANAGING OUR INVENTORY. WE PRESENT COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER AS WE BELIEVE THIS IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTAL METRIC IN EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR MERCHANDISING EFFORTS, AS A FASTER COMPARABLE STORE INVENTORY TURNOVER GENERALLY LEADS TO REDUCED MARKDOWNS AND MORE FRESH MERCHANDISE IN OUR STORES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES.  STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE OUR PAYROLL IN ACCORDANCE WITH INCREASES OR DECREASES IN NET SALES. THE METHOD OF CALCULATING STORE PAYROLL VARIES ACROSS THE RETAIL INDUSTRY. AS A RESULT, OUR STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES MAY DIFFER FROM OTHER RETAILERS. WE DEFINE STORE PAYROLL AS REGULAR AND OVERTIME PAYROLL FOR ALL STORE PERSONNEL AS WELL AS REGIONAL AND TERRITORY PERSONNEL, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYROLL CHARGES RELATED TO CORPORATE AND WAREHOUSE EMPLOYEES. STORE PAYROLL AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WAS 8.7% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED WITH 8.5% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  LIQUIDITY.  LIQUIDITY MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH. MANAGEMENT MEASURES LIQUIDITY THROUGH CASH FLOW, WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF CASH GENERATED FROM OR USED IN OPERATING, FINANCING, AND INVESTING ACTIVITIES. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, INCLUDING RESTRICTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASED $7.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $56.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. REFER TO THE SECTION BELOW ENTITLED \u201cLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\u201d FOR FURTHER EXPLANATION.  27  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH CERTAIN ITEMS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.

COST OF SALES  COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 20 BASIS POINTS TO 59.0% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED MERCHANDISE MARGIN. PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 10 BASIS POINTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES. ON A DOLLAR BASIS, COST OF SALES INCREASED $68.6 MILLION, OR 7.7%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR OVERALL INCREASE IN SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 100 BASIS POINTS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019.

ADDITIONALLY, PRODUCT SOURCING COSTS INCREASED 10 BASIS POINTS, STORE PAYROLL INCREASED 20 BASIS POINTS, AND STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 25 BASIS POINTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY 20 BASIS POINTS OF LEVERAGE IN OUR NATIONAL TELE  VISION ADVERTISING AND DIRECT MARKETING EFFORTS.  COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS  DURING FISCAL 2018, WE RECORDED TOTAL ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO DEBT AMENDMENTS OF $2.5 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY.  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE REVERSED $0.4 MILLION OF THIS ESTIMATED EXPENSE BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENSES INCURRED.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE DEPRECIATION OF FIXED ASSETS AMOUNTED TO $50.6 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $50.5 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY OUR NEW AND NON-COMPARABLE STORES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE TO SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING ASU 2016-02.  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE IMPROVED $1.2 MILLION TO $13.4 MILLION. THE IMPROVEMENT WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE $150 MILLION PAYDOWN AND REPRICING OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY DURING FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  OUR AVERAGE INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE BALANCES RELATED TO OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH PRIOR YEAR, ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

INCOME TAX EXPENSE  INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS $16.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $17.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WAS 17.2% COMPARED WITH 17.4% DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  AT THE END OF EACH INTERIM PERIOD, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE BEST ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND THEN APPLY THAT RATE IN PROVIDING FOR INCOME TAXES ON A CURRENT YEAR-TO-DATE (INTERIM PERIOD) BASIS. USE OF THIS METHODOLOGY DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 RESULTED IN AN ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF APPROXIMATELY  25% (BEFORE DISCRETE ITEMS) AS OUR BEST ESTIMATE.  NET INCOME  WE EARNED NET INCOME OF $77.8 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $82.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS DECLINE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INCREASED GROSS MARGIN, AS WELL AS DECREASES IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND INTEREST EXPENSE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR ABILITY TO SATISFY INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE WHICH, IN TURN, IS SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO FINANCIAL, BUSINESS AND OTHER FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL. IF WE DO NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO SERVICE INTEREST PAYMENT AND FUTURE PRINCIPAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS ON OUR  29  OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS AND IF WE CANNOT BORROW OR O  BTAIN EQUITY FINANCING TO SATISFY THOSE OBLIGATIONS, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. WE CANNOT BE ASSURED THAT ANY REPLACEMENT BORROWING OR EQUITY FINANCING COULD BE SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ON TERMS SIMILAR TO O  UR CURRENT FINANCING AGREEMENTS, OR AT ALL.  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, ALONG WITH OUR EXISTING CASH AND OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR EXPECTED CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS AND PLANNED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS AS WELL AS THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO OFFSET DECLINES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES WITH SAVINGS INITIATIVES IN THE EVENT THAT THE ECONOMY DECLINES.  CASH FLOW FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018  WE USED $7.2 MILLION OF CASH FLOW DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $56.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AMOUNTED TO $54.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $60.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OUR DECREASED OPERATING RESULTS.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $83.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH $57.9 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO A NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OUR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS, AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES).  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $22.4 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED WITH A USE OF $58.5 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THIS CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN THE NET BORROWINGS ON OUR DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF SHARE REPURCHASES.  CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL ALSO IMPACT OUR CASH FLOWS. WORKING CAPITAL EQUALS CURRENT ASSETS (EXCLUSIVE OF RESTRICTED CASH) MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT MAY 4, 2019 OF $114.0 MILLION COMPARED WITH A $12.6 MILLION DEFICIT AT MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR ADOPTION OF ASU 2016-02, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDING A PORTION OF THE NEW LEASE LIABILITY TO CURRENT LIABILITIES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES, INCREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, DECREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. WE HAD A WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AT FEBRUARY 2, 2019 OF $2.3 MILLION.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  FOR THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, CASH SPEND FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NET OF $12.2 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, AMOUNTED TO $71.6 MILLION. WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY  $310  MILLION, NET OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION OF LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $155 MILLION, NET OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LANDLORD ALLOWANCES, FOR STORE EXPENDITURES (NEW STORES, REMODELS AND OTHER STORE EXPENDITURES). IN ADDITION, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WILL SPEND APPROXIMATELY $60  MILLION TO SUPPORT OUR SUPPLY CHAIN INITIATIVES, WITH THE REMAINING CAPITAL USED TO SUPPORT OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER BUSINESS INITIATIVES.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON AUGUST 15, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $300 MILLION OF COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS AUTHORIZED TO BE EXECUTED THROUGH AUGUST 2020. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS FUNDED USING OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL LINE OF CREDIT.  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE REPURCHASED 841,460 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $122.8 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF COMMISSIONS, UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $175.6 MILLION REMAINING UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION.  WE ARE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE, FROM TIME TO TIME, SHARES OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS UNDER OUR REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF STOCK REPURCHASES WILL DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE MARKET CONDITIONS AS WELL AS CORPORATE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS. OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED, MODIFIED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REPURCHASE ANY AMOUNT OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE PROGRAM.  30  DIVIDENDS  WE CURRENTLY DO, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO, RETAIN ALL AVAILABLE FUNDS AND ANY FUTURE EARNINGS TO FUND ALL OF THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, BUSINESS INITIATIVES, AND TO SUPPORT ANY POTENTIAL OPPORTUNISTIC CAPITAL STRUCTURE INITIATIVES. THEREFORE, AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS IN THE NEAR TERM. OUR ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK WILL BE LIMITED BY RESTRICTIONS ON THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE TERMS OF CURRENT AND ANY FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS. ANY FUTURE DETERMINATION TO PAY DIVIDENDS WILL BE AT THE DISCRETION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SUBJECT TO COMPLIANCE WITH COVENANTS IN OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE AGREEMENTS GOVERNING OUR INDEBTEDNESS, AND WILL DEPEND UPON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DEEMS RELEVANT.  IN ADDITION, SINCE WE ARE A HOLDING COMPANY, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS SHOWN ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ARE HELD BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND ABILITY TO PAY DIVIDENDS ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES AND THE DISTRIBUTION OR OTHER PAYMENT OF SUCH EARNINGS TO US IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS.  OPERATIONAL GROWTH  DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE OPENED 17 NEW STORES, INCLUSIVE OF SIX RELOCATIONS, AND CLOSED TWO STORES, EXCLUSIVE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RELOCATIONS, BRINGING OUR STORE COUNT AS OF MAY 4, 2019 TO 684 STORES, INCLUSIVE OF AN INTERNET STORE. WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE OUR GROWTH PLANS AND INVEST IN CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT MEET OUR FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2019, WE PLAN TO OPEN APPROXIMATELY 50 NET NEW STORES,  WHICH INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 75 GROSS NEW STORES, ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY 25 STORE RELOCATIONS AND CLOSINGS.  WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES BOTH WITHIN OUR CURRENT MARKET AREAS AND IN OTHER REGIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO FIND SATISFACTORY LOCATIONS FOR OUR STORES IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE CONTINUED GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESS. THE OPENING OF STORES GENERALLY IS CONTINGENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS WITH SUITABLE STRUCTURES AND THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO FIND SUITABLE LOCATIONS FOR NEW STORES OR THAT EVEN IF SUCH LOCATIONS ARE FOUND AND ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS ARE OBTAINED, WE WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES PRESENTLY PLANNED. ASSUMING THAT APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO EXECUTE OUR GROWTH STRATEGY WITHOUT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING OUR CURRENT STORES.  DEBT AND HEDGING  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, OUR OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE $956.9 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF ORIGINAL ISSUE DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY AND $150.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS ON OUR ABL FACILITY. OUR DEBT OBLIGATIONS ALSO INCLUDE $32.3 MILLION OF CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  TERM LOAN FACILITY  AT MAY 4, 2019, OUR BORROWING RATE RELATED TO THE TERM LOAN FACILITY WAS  4.5%.  ABL LINE OF CREDIT  AT MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD $393.9 MILLION AVAILABLE UNDER THE ABL LINE OF CREDIT. THE MAXIMUM BORROWINGS UNDER THE FACILITY DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $255.0  MILLION. AVERAGE BORROWINGS DURING THE THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AMOUNTED TO $147.4  MILLION AT AN AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 3.8%.  HEDGING  WE ARE HEDGED ON $800 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY THROUGH MAY 2019. ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACT, WHICH WAS DESIGNATED AS A CASH FLOW HEDGE. THIS NEW INTEREST RATE SWAP, WHICH HEDGES $450 MILLION OF OUR TERM LOAN FACILITY, BECOMES EFFECTIVE MAY 31, 2019 AND MATURES DECEMBER 29, 2023.  CERTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THE COMPANY HAD $1,118.1 MILLION OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATED TO GOODS THAT WERE NOT RECEIVED AS OF MAY 4, 2019. THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES REGARDING OUR OBLIGATIONS TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER CURRENT CONTRACTS FROM THOSE INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  31  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. WE BELIEVE THERE ARE SEVERAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING OUR HISTORICAL AND FUTURE PERFORMANCE AS THESE POLICIES AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT AREAS THAT INVOLVE MANAGEMENT\u2019S JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES. THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT (I) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; (II) THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; AND (III) THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, INVENTORIES, LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, GOODWILL, INSURANCE RESERVES AND INCOME TAXES. HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES UNDER DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR CONDITIONS. A CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE MEETS TWO CRITERIA: (1) IT REQUIRES ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HIGHLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS AND (2) THERE WOULD BE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM EITHER USING A DIFFERENT, ALTHOUGH REASONABLE, AMOUNT WITHIN THE RANGE OF THE ESTIMATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD OR FROM REASONABLY LIKELY PERIOD-TO-PERIOD CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE.  LEASES  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD UPDATE (ASU) 2016-02, \u201cLEASES.\u201d THE STANDARD\u2019S CORE PRINCIPLE IS TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG ORGANIZATIONS BY RECOGNIZING LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AND DISCLOSING KEY INFORMATION ABOUT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS ASU AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019.  WE APPLIED THE CHANGES FROM THE NEW GUIDANCE AT THE ADOPTION DATE AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION, AS ALLOWED UNDER ASU 2018-11, \u201cLEASES: TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS.\u201d WE DID NOT ADJUST PRIOR PERIODS. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION NOT TO CAPITALIZE LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF TWELVE MONTHS OR LESS. WE ELECTED THE TRANSITION PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWS US TO CARRY FORWARD FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES: I) THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION AS EITHER OPERATING OR CAPITAL; II) ASSESSMENT OF WHETHER ANY EXPIRED OR EXISTING CONTRACTS ARE OR CONTAIN LEASES; AND III) CAPITALIZATION OF INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO NOT SEPARATE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, TO NOT ASSESS WHETHER EXISTING OR EXPIRED LAND EASEMENTS CONTAIN A LEASE, AND TO EMPLOY HINDSIGHT WHEN DETERMINING LEASE TERMS FOR EXISTING LEASES ON THE DATE OF ADOPTION.  ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD ALSO RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN THE TIMING OF CERTAIN EXPENSE RECOGNITION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET FAVORABLE LEASE COST, AS WELL AS A RECLASSIFICATION OF FAVORABLE LEASE COST FROM \u201cDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\u201d TO \u201cSELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\u201d ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019. THIS GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY.  OTHER THAN THE LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICY DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THOSE DISCLOSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, \u201cSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 2, 2019.  SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT  THIS REPORT CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS, ESTIMATES, FORECASTS AND PROJECTIONS ABOUT US, THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH WE OPERATE AND OTHER MATTERS, AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT\u2019S BELIEFS AND ASSUMPTIONS AND OTHER STATEMENTS REGARDING MATTERS THAT ARE NOT HISTORICAL FACTS.

ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE RESULTS ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS. WHILE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY ALL SUCH FACTORS, FACTORS THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATED BY US INCLUDE: GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ONE OR MORE OF OUR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND GROWTH PLANS; THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE STORE LOCATIONS ON SUITABLE TERMS; CHANGING CONSUMER PREFERENCES AND DEMAND; INDUSTRY TRENDS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN BUYING, INVENTORY AND OTHER BUSINESS PRACTICES BY CUSTOMERS; COMPETITIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING PRICING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES OF MAJOR COMPETITORS AND AN INCREASE IN COMPETITION WITHIN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE; THE AVAILABILITY, SELECTION AND PURCHASING OF ATTRACTIVE MERCHANDISE ON FAVORABLE TERMS; IMPORT RISKS, INCLUDING TAX AND TRADE POLICIES, TARIFFS AND GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; WEATHER PATTERNS, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CHANGES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR TEMPERATURES; OUR FUTURE PROFITABILITY; OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL COSTS  32  AND EXPENSES; UNFORESEEN CYBER-RELATED PROBLEMS OR ATTACKS; ANY UNFO  RESEEN MATERIAL LOSS OR CASUALTY; THE EFFECT OF INFLATION; REGULATORY AND TAX CHANGES; OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH EMPLOYEES; THE IMPACT OF CURRENT AND FUTURE LAWS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SUCH LAWS; TERRORIST ATTACKS, PARTICULARLY ATTACKS ON OR WITHIN MARKETS  IN WHICH WE OPERATE; NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INCLUDING FIRE, SNOW AND ICE STORMS, FLOOD, HAIL, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES; OUR SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL OF INDEBTEDNESS AND RELATED DEBT-SERVICE OBLIGATIONS; RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED BY COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AG  REEMENTS; AVAILABILITY OF ADEQUATE FINANCING; OUR DEPENDENCE ON VENDORS FOR OUR MERCHANDISE; DOMESTIC EVENTS AFFECTING THE DELIVERY OF MERCHANDISE TO OUR STORES; EXISTENCE OF ADVERSE LITIGATION; AND OTHER RISKS DISCUSSED FROM TIME TO TIME IN OUR FILINGS WI  TH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC).  MANY OF THESE FACTORS ARE BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT OR CONTROL. IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER FACTORS, OUR PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE RELIED ON AS AN INDICATION OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE. THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REFERRED TO IN THIS SECTION ALSO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY SUBSEQUENT WRITTEN OR ORAL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT MAY BE ISSUED BY US OR PERSONS ACTING ON OUR BEHALF. WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW. IN LIGHT OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, THE FORWARD-LOOKING EVENTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES DISCUSSED IN THIS REPORT MIGHT NOT OCCUR. FURTHERMORE, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS, EVENTS, LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, PERFORMANCE OR ACHIEVEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\u2019S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS DISCLOSED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 28, 2018.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY IS A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER AND MARKETER OF BRANDED FOOD PRODUCTS.  IT OPERATES IN FOUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE N - SEGMENT REPORTING IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  THE COMPANY REPORTED NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE OF  $0.52  FOR THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, COMPARED TO  $0.44  PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IMPACTING THE QUARTER WERE.  \u2022  THE COMPANY DELIVERED EARNINGS GROWTH.  NET EARNINGS BENEFITED FROM ONE-TIME GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF CYTOSPORT, INC. (CYTOSPORT), LOWER SG&A, AND A STRONG QUARTER FROM GROCERY PRODUCTS.  \u2022  THREE OF THE COMPANY'S FOUR SEGMENTS DELIVERED VOLUME AND NET SALES GROWTH.  \u2022  REFRIGERATED FOODS SEGMENT PROFIT DECLINED AS GROWTH IN VALUE-ADDED PROFITS DID NOT FULLY OFFSET A STEEP DECLINE IN COMMODITY PROFITS.  HIGHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS ALSO IMPACTED PROFITABILITY.  \u2022  GROCERY PRODUCTS PROFIT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND MARGIN ACROSS MANY PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  \u2022  JOTS SEGMENT PROFIT WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PLANT STARTUP COSTS, HIGHER FEED COSTS, AND LOWER RETAIL SALES.  \u2022  INTERNATIONAL & OTHER PROFIT DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONTINUED IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON FRESH PORK EXPORTS ALONG WITH HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS.  \u2022  THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SALE OF CYTOSPORT TO PEPSICO, INC., ON APRIL 15, 2019.  THE COMPANY RECEIVED $473.9 MILLION IN CASH, SUBJECT TO WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS, AND USED THE PROCEEDS TO PAY OFF THE REMAINING DEBT FROM THE COLUMBUS MANUFACTURING, INC.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO INVESTORS BECAUSE THEY ARE MEASUREMENTS USED TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE ON A COMPARABLE YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR U.S. GAAP MEASUREMENTS IN ANALYZING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  THESE NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS ARE NOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM NON-GAAP MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDE THE ONE-TIME GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE DIVESTITURE OF THE CYTOSPORT BUSINESS, WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED IN NET UNALLOCATED EXPENSE AND PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  THE TAX BENEFIT WAS DRIVEN BY THE SALE OF SHARES OF THE CYTOSPORT LEGAL ENTITY.

MARGINS IN GROCERY PRODUCTS INCREASED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 DUE TO HIGHER MARGINS ACROSS MANY CATEGORIES, WHILE REFRIGERATED FOODS, JOTS, AND INTERNATIONAL & OTHER DECLINED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  MARGINS IN REFRIGERATED FOODS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LOWER COMMODITY PROFITS AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.  JOTS DECLINED ON HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED PLANT STARTUP EXPENSES, HIGHER FEED COSTS, AND LOWER RETAIL SALES.  INTERNATIONAL & OTHER WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LOWER FRESH PORK EXPORTS AND HIGHER FREIGHT COSTS.  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECLINED DUE TO LOWER PORK COMMODITY PROFITS, HIGHER FREIGHT EXPENSES, HIGHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES, AND LOWER FRESH PORK EXPORTS.  LOOKING TO THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE REFRIGERATED FOODS, GROCERY PRODUCTS, AND INTERNATIONAL & OTHER SEGMENTS TO EXPERIENCE PERIODS OF MARGIN COMPRESSION DUE TO RISING AND VOLATILE PORK MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACT OF  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AFRICAN SWINE FEVER IN CHINA.  ADDITIONALLY, PORK EXPORT MARGINS COULD REMAIN CHALLENGED DUE TO TARIFFS AND GLOBAL TRADE UNCERTAINTY.  LOST LEAN GROUND TURKEY DISTRIBUTION IS EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY IMPACT JOTS.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT REPRESENT THESE SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING PROFIT AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN BELOW.  AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2019, THE HORMEL DELI SOLUTIONS DIVISION COMBINED ALL DELI BUSINESSES, INCLUDING THE JENNIE-O TURKEY STORE DELI DIVISION, INTO ONE DIVISION WITHIN THE REFRIGERATED FOODS SEGMENT.

FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, NET SALES GROWTH FROM THE COMPANY'S MEGAMEX JOINT VENTURE AND OTHER KEY BRANDS MORE THAN OFFSET DECLINES AT CYTOSPORT.  FOR THE SECOND QUARTER, SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLUME AND MARGIN ACROSS MANY CATEGORIES AND LOWER EXPENSES FOR CYTOSPORT.  SEGMENT PROFIT INCREASED FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 AS HIGHER VOLUMES AND MARGINS AND A LEGAL SETTLEMENT MORE THAN OFFSET THE EFFECT OF A NON-OPERATING TAX BENEFIT IN THE COMPANY'S MEGAMEX JOINT VENTURE IN FISCAL 2018.  THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES VOLUME, SALES, AND PROFIT DECLINES IN THE SECOND HALF DUE TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CYTOSPORT, THE POTENTIAL FOR HIGHER INPUT COSTS DUE TO AFRICAN SWINE FEVER, AND A PRICE DECLINE ON  SKIPPY  \u00ae  PEANUT BUTTER PRODUCTS DRIVEN BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REFRIGERATED FOODS  RESULTS FOR THE REFRIGERATED FOODS SEGMENT COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR ARE AS FOLLOWS.

BRANDED VALUE-ADDED SALES GROWTH WAS OFFSET BY A DOUBLE-DIGIT DECLINE IN COMMODITY SALES AS THE COMPANY CONVERTS COMMODITY PORK TO VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS.  FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2019, GROWTH FROM MANY VALUE-ADDED PRODUCTS MORE THAN OFFSET DECLINES IN COMMODITY SALES.  REFRIGERATED FOODS PROFIT FOR THE QUARTER DECLINED AS GROWTH IN VALUE-ADDED PROFITS DID NOT FULLY OFFSET A STEEP DECLINE IN COMMODITY PROFITS AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES RELATED TO CAPACITY EXPANSION PROJECTS.  SEGMENT PROFIT FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS DECLINED DUE TO REDUCED COMMODITY PROFITS, INCREASED FREIGHT EXPENSES, AND HIGHER OPERATIONAL EXPENSES.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS  $365.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO  $443.3 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  THE DECREASE IS DUE TO HIGHER LEVELS OF WORKING CAPITAL PRIMARILY FROM INVENTORY IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS  $424.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST  SIX MONTHS  OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF  $986.5 MILLION  IN THE SAME PERIOD OF FISCAL 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $473.9 MILLION FOR THE SALE OF CYTOSPORT.  IN FISCAL 2018, THE COMPANY SPENT $857.6 MILLION ON THE ACQUISITION OF COLUMBUS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES ITS FISCAL 2019 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $310.0 MILLION.  KEY PROJECTS FOR THE FULL YEAR INCLUDE CAPACITY INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S NEVADA, IOWA, PIZZA TOPPINGS FACILITY, AN EXPANSION AT THE FONTANINI FACILITY IN MCCOOK, ILL, AND MULTIPLE OTHER PROJECTS DESIGNED TO INCREASE VALUE-ADDED CAPACITY.

IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY REPAID $374.8 MILLION OF DEBT RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF COLUMBUS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED BY CERTAIN COVENANTS IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN SPECIFIED LEVELS OF FINANCIAL RATIOS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.  AT THE END OF THE  SECOND  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THESE DEBT COVENANTS.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH ITS PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY.  THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO CASH FLOWS FROM THIS SOURCE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE THE COMPANY OPERATES IN A RELATIVELY STABLE INDUSTRY AND HAS STRONG BRANDS ACROSS MANY PRODUCT LINES.  THE COMPANY IS DEDICATED TO RETURNING EXCESS CASH FLOW TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS.  GROWING THE BUSINESS THROUGH INNOVATION AND EVALUATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS REMAINS A FOCUS FOR THE COMPANY.  REINVESTMENTS IN THE BUSINESS TO ENSURE EMPLOYEE AND FOOD SAFETY ARE A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COMPANY.

WE MAINTAIN A GROUPING CALLED UNALLOCATED CORPORATE & OTHER, WHICH INCLUDES TRANSACTION EXPENSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS BASED ON PERFORMANCE OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND OTHER FACTORS, CERTAIN SEVERANCE AND LEGAL COSTS NOT ALLOCABLE TO OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS, DEPRECIATION OF CORPORATE ASSETS, INTEREST EXPENSE, OTHER, NET, INCOME TAXES AND INTER-SEGMENT ELIMINATIONS, AND BEGINNING IN 2018, EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL EXPENSE FLUCTUATIONS RELATIVE TO PLANNED COSTS AS DETERMINED DURING THE ANNUAL PLANNING PROCESS. OTHER CORPORATE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, BASED UPON A RELATIVE MEASURE OF PROFITABILITY IN ORDER TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT EACH REPORTABLE BUSINESS SEGMENT'S ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.  THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE USED TO PREPARE OUR ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  IN AN EFFORT TO FOCUS ON PROTECTING MARGINS AND IMPROVING CASH FLOWS, WE IMPLEMENTED A STRATEGY TO REDUCE OUR SALES VOLUME WITH CERTAIN LOW-MARGIN CUSTOMERS.  DURING 2017, WE RATIONALIZED CAPACITY AND CLOSED TWO U.S. VINYL PLANTS AND TWO CABINET DOOR PLANTS, RELOCATING ASSETS TO IMPROVE OVERALL OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY.  PURSUANT TO THESE RESTRUCTURING EFFORTS, WE EXPENSED $0.1 MILLION AND $0.2 MILLION DURING THE  THREE AND SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND $0.2 MILLION AND $0.6 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIODS.  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ORGANIC GROWTH INITIATIVES, ENHANCE OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS, PROVIDE NEW COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGY, ENHANCE OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION WITHIN THE MARKETS WE SERVE, AND EXPAND INTO NEW MARKETS OR SERVICE LINES.  WE HAVE DISPOSED OF NON-CORE BUSINESSES IN THE PAST, AND CONTINUE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS PORTFOLIO TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN MARKETS WHERE WE BELIEVE THERE IS POTENTIAL FUTURE GROWTH.  RECENT TRANSACTIONS AND EVENTS  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED INTO LAW A SWEEPING TAX REFORM BILL WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING PROVISIONS WHICH IMPACT U.S. CORPORATIONS:  (1) REDUCTION OF THE STATUTORY FEDERAL CORPORATE TAX RATE FROM 35% TO 21%; (2) SHIFTING TO A TERRITORIAL TAX SYSTEM IN WHICH FOREIGN EARNINGS COULD BE REPATRIATED THROUGH A 100% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION; (3) IMPOSING A ONE-TIME TAX ON UN-REPATRIATED EARNINGS OF 15.5% ON CASH AND 8% ON OTHER ASSETS; (4) DOUBLING BONUS DEPRECIATION TO 100% FOR FIVE YEARS AND ALLOWING USED PROPERTY TO QUALIFY; (5) LIMITING NET INTEREST EXPENSE DEDUCTIONS TO 30% OF ADJUSTED TAXABLE INCOME; (6) LIMITING NOL DEDUCTIONS TO 80% OF TAXABLE INCOME; AND (7) REPEALING THE CORPORATE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX.  WE MADE AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF THIS NEW TAX LAW AND RECORDED A DISCRETE BENEFIT OF $6.5 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $1.2 MILLION FOR THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX ON DEEMED REPATRIATION OF PREVIOUSLY TAX-DEFERRED AND UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  WE COMPLETED THE ACCOUNTING FOR THE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF THE ACT AND RECORDED A BENEFIT OF $0.2 MILLION FOR THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF THE ONE-TIME MANDATORY TRANSITION TAX DURING SIX MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MARKET OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  WE BELIEVE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF OUR OPERATING RESULTS CONTINUE TO BE NORTH AMERICAN NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION AND RESIDENTIAL REMODELING AND REPLACEMENT (R&R) ACTIVITY. WE BELIEVE THAT HOUSING STARTS AND WINDOW SHIPMENTS ARE INDICATORS OF ACTIVITY LEVELS IN THE HOMEBUILDING AND WINDOW INDUSTRIES, AND WE USE THIS DATA, AS PUBLISHED BY OR DERIVED FROM THIRD-PARTY SOURCES, TO EVALUATE THE MARKET. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EVALUATED THE MARKET USING DATA FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HOMEBUILDERS (NAHB) WITH REGARD TO HOUSING STARTS, AND PUBLISHED REPORTS BY DUCKER WORLDWIDE, LLC (DUCKER), A CONSULTING AND RESEARCH FIRM, WITH REGARD TO WINDOW SHIPMENTS IN THE U.S.  WE OBTAIN MARKET DATA FROM FREEDONIA GROUP AND CATALINA RESEARCH AND KCMA, EACH A CONSULTING AND RESEARCH FIRM, FOR INSIGHT INTO THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL WOOD CABINET DEMAND.  REPORTS AND FORECASTS FROM THESE SOURCES INDICATE CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE MARKETS WE SERVE.  THE NAHB HAS FORECASTED CALENDAR-YEAR HOUSING STARTS (EXCLUDING MANUFACTURED UNITS) TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY THROUGH 2021.  DUCKER INDICATED THAT WINDOW SHIPMENTS IN THE R&R MARKET ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE 1% THROUGH 2020 AND REMAIN FLAT DURING 2021.  DERIVED FROM REPORTS PUBLISHED BY DUCKER, THE OVERALL GROWTH IN WINDOW SHIPMENTS FOR THE TRAILING TWELVE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS 0.9%, DURING THIS PERIOD, GROWTH IN R&R ACTIVITY AND NEW CONSTRUCTION INCREASED 0.9% AND 0.8%, RESPECTIVELY.  CATALINA RESEARCH ESTIMATES RESIDENTIAL SEMI-CUSTOM CABINET DEMAND IN THE U.S. TO GROW APPROXIMATELY 3% ANNUALLY THROUGH 2020.  WE UTILIZE SEVERAL COMMODITIES IN OUR BUSINESS FOR WHICH PRICING CAN FLUCTUATE, INCLUDING POLYVINYL RESIN (PVC), TITANIUM DIOXIDE (TIO2), PETROLEUM PRODUCTS, ALUMINUM AND WOOD.  FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND CRITICAL SUPPLIERS, WE HAVE PRICE ADJUSTERS IN PLACE WHICH EFFECTIVELY SHARE THE BASE PASS-THROUGH PRICE CHANGES FOR OUR PRIMARY COMMODITIES WITH OUR CUSTOMERS COMMENSURATE WITH THE MARKET AT LARGE.  OUR LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO THESE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS IS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED DUE TO THE CONTRACTUAL COMPONENT OF THE ADJUSTER PROGRAM.  HOWEVER, THESE ADJUSTERS ARE NOT IN PLACE WITH ALL CUSTOMERS AND FOR ALL COMMODITIES, AND THERE IS A LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO SUCH VOLATILITY DUE TO THE LAG ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PRICE UPDATES IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CUSTOMER AGREEMENTS, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO HARDWOODS.  IN ADDITION, SOME OF THESE COMMODITIES, SUCH AS SILICONE, ARE IN HIGH DEMAND, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE, WHICH CAN AFFECT THE COST OF THE RAW MATERIALS, A PORTION OF WHICH WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FULLY RECOVER.  ON JUNE 23, 2016, VOTERS IN THE U.K. VOTED FOR THE U.K. TO EXIT THE EUROPEAN UNION (E.U.) (REFERRED TO AS BREXIT).  THE U.K. IS CURRENTLY DUE TO LEAVE THE E.U. ON OCTOBER 31, 2019, BUT THE ACTUAL TIMING, TERMS OF ITS WITHDRAWAL AND THE NATURE OF ITS FUTURE WITH THE E.U. ARE STILL BEING DEBATED.  SINCE THE 2016 VOTE, THE PRIMARY IMPACT ON QUANEX\u2019S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS OF THE BRITISH POUND STERLING.  THIS FLUCTUATION HAS DRIVEN FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS, AS WELL AS RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES FROM UPSTREAM SUPPLIERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.K.  GIVEN THE LACK OF COMPARABLE PRECEDENT, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO PREDICT THE FUTURE IMPACTS ON OUR U.K. BASED OPERATIONS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 14% OF OUR TOTAL SALES FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL A MAJORITY OF OUR U.K. PRODUCTS WITHIN THE U.K., THERE IS MINIMAL RISK TO OUR ABILITY TO PHYSICALLY DELIVER GOODS AND COMPLETE SALES.  AS SUCH, WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL POSITIONED WITHIN THE U.K. TO RESPOND TO POTENTIAL CHANGES TO UNDERLYING DEMAND AS A RESULT OF THE FINAL BREXIT OUTCOME.  THE PRIMARY FOCUS FOR OUR U.K. OPERATIONS CENTERS ON THE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING OF RAW MATERIALS.  WHILE WE SOURCE THE MAJORITY OF OUR RAW MATERIALS FROM WITHIN THE U.K., MANY OF THE PRIMARY UPSTREAM RAW MATERIALS OUR VENDORS UTILIZE ARE BEING SOURCED FROM OUTSIDE OF THE U.K., WHICH COULD EXPOSE US TO CROSS-BORDER ISSUES AND RAW MATERIAL PRICE IMPACTS DUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY VOLATILITY.  IF THE U.K. EXITS THE E.U. WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT (REFERRED TO AS A HARD BREXIT), THERE COULD BE COMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE U.K. BORDER WHICH COULD HAVE WIDE-SPREAD NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS FOR THE U.K.  WE DO NOT EXPECT A FULL CLOSURE TO OCCUR AND INSTEAD ASSUME AT A MINIMUM THAT TRADING WITH CERTAIN COUNTRIES WILL CONTINUE UNINTERRUPTED.  SINCE WE PURCHASE THE SAME RAW MATERIALS UTILIZED IN OUR U.K. FACILITIES AT OUR OTHER NON-U.K. FACILITIES AND SOURCE RAW MATERIALS FROM MULTIPLE COUNTRIES, WE ARE PREPARED TO UTILIZE OUR EXISTING QUANEX-WIDE SUPPLY INFRASTRUCTURE TO MINIMIZE POTENTIAL SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019  2018  CHANGE $% VARIANCE  (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS)  NET SALES  $218.2  $214.2  $4.0  2%  COST OF SALES (EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION)  171.4  169.0  2.4  (1  )%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  23.7  23.9  (0.2  )  1%  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  0.1  0.2  (0.1  )  50%  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION  12.4  13.3  (0.9  )  7%  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES  30.0  \u2014  30.0  (100  )%  OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME  $(19.4  )  $7.8  $(27.2  )  (349  )%  INTEREST EXPENSE  (2.6  )  (2.5  )  (0.1  )  (4  )%  OTHER, NET  \u2014  0.2  (0.2  )  (100  )%  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  (2.0  )  (1.4  )  (0.6  )  (43  )%  NET (LOSS) INCOME  $(24.0  )  $4.1  $(28.1  )  (685  )%  OUR PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD RESULTS BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT FOLLOW.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CHANGES RELATED TO OPERATING INCOME BY REPORTABLE SEGMENT.

DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE DECREASED  $0.9 MILLION  , OR  12%  , FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  , REFLECTING THE RUN-OFF OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE RELATED TO EXISTING ASSETS AND DISPOSALS DURING THE PERIOD.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.  ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF  $30.0 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  REPRESENT A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WHICH WAS RECORDED AS A RESULT OF AN INDUSTRY-WIDE SHIFT FROM CUSTOM CABINETS TO STOCK CABINETS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  $5.1 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  .  THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO (I) $2.5 MILLION OF HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE VALUATIONS OF OUR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS, (II) $1.2 MILLION OF HIGHER MEDICAL EXPENSES DUE TO A HIGHER CLAIMS EXPERIENCE, AND (III) HIGHER SEVERANCE EXPENSE OF $1.2 MILLION AS A RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER, NET OF  $0.4 MILLION  AT  APRIL 30, 2019  COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  RELATES PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN NET PENSION SERVICE BENEFITS.  INCOME TAXES  .  WE RECORDED INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF $1.0 MILLION ON A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $26.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AN EFFECTIVE RATE OF 3.6% AND INCOME TAX BENEFIT OF $6.2 MILLION ON PRE-TAX INCOME OF $2.9 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, AN EFFECTIVE BENEFIT RATE OF 211.5%.  THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE FACT THAT THE $30.0 MILLION ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE NORTH AMERICAN CABINETS COMPONENTS SEGMENT DID NOT GENERATE A TAX BENEFIT.  THE EFFECTIVE RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018 REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT, WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 22, 2017 AND REDUCED OUR FEDERAL TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0% AS OF JANUARY 1, 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN A DISCRETE TAX BENEFIT.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OVERVIEW  HISTORICALLY, OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN CASH ON HAND, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  WE MAINTAIN A $325.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE CREDIT FACILITY).  THE CREDIT FACILITY MATURES IN 2023 (5-YEAR TERM) AND REQUIRES INTEREST PAYMENTS CALCULATED, AT OUR ELECTION AND DEPENDING UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO, AT EITHER A BASE RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN (0.25% TO 1.00%) OR THE LIBOR RATE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN (1.25% TO 2.00%).  THE APPLICABLE RATE DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  FLUCTUATED BETWEEN LIBOR + 1.50% AND 1.75%.  IN ADDITION TO THE CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO COVENANT, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MEET A CONSOLIDATED INTEREST COVERAGE RATIO COVENANT, AND THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS INCLUDING OUR ABILITY TO INCUR INDEBTEDNESS, INCUR LIENS, DISPOSE OF MATERIAL ASSETS, ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, MAKE RESTRICTED PAYMENTS AND PAY DIVIDENDS (LIMITED TO $20.0 MILLION PER YEAR).  WE ARE AMORTIZING DEFERRED FINANCING FEES OF  $1.3 MILLION  STRAIGHT-LINE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE FACILITY.  AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE HAD  $20.3 MILLION  OF CASH AND EQUIVALENTS,  $210.0 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY,  $4.8 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AND  $17.2 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER CAPITAL LEASES.  WE HAD  $110.2 MILLION  AVAILABLE FOR USE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AT  APRIL 30, 2019.  WE REPATRIATED  $5.3 MILLION  OF FOREIGN CASH DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  .  WE EXPECT TO REPATRIATE EXCESS CASH MOVING FORWARD AND UTILIZE THE FUNDS TO RETIRE DEBT OR MEET CURRENT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ANALYSIS OF CASH FLOW  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOW RESULTS FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  SIX MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30,  2019  2018  (IN MILLIONS)  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $0.1  $21.6  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(12.7  )  $(15.0  )  CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $3.9  $(13.9  )  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  .  OPERATING CASH FLOW FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  DECLINED APPROXIMATELY $21.5 MILLION COMPARED TO THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  .  CASH RECEIPTS WERE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY A REDUCTION IN NET INCOME AS WELL AS UNFAVORABLE WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES, INCLUDING A HIGHER PAYOUT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVES AND HIGHER SPENDING ON THE SEASONAL INVENTORY BUILD COMPARED TO  2018.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $2.3 MILLION WHEN COMPARING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  TO THE SAME PERIOD IN  2018  RELATED TO A DECLINE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $3.9 MILLION FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $14.2 MILLION OF NET BORROWINGS OF DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DIVIDENDS PAID TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $5.3 MILLION, AND $4.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE PURCHASE OF TREASURY STOCK.  FOR THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  , CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $13.9 MILLION, PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $12.9 MILLION OF NET REPAYMENTS OF DEBT, DIVIDENDS PAID TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS OF $2.8 MILLION, AND $0.7 MILLION OF CASH PAID FOR PAYROLL TAXES RELATED TO STOCK BASED COMPENSATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $2.6 MILLION OF PROCEEDS RECEIVED FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.  LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS  OUR STRATEGY FOR DEPLOYING CASH IS TO INVEST IN ORGANIC GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES, DEVELOP OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, AND MAKE STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS.  OTHER USES OF CASH INCLUDE PAYING CASH DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS AND REPURCHASING OUR COMMON STOCK.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY INVESTED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN COMMERCIAL PAPER WITH TERMS OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.  WE DID NOT HAVE ANY INVESTMENTS DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  AND  2018  .  WE MAINTAIN CASH BALANCES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES WHICH TOTAL $13.1 MILLION AS OF  APRIL 30, 2019  .  DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE REPATRIATED  $5.3 MILLION  OF FOREIGN EARNINGS FROM OUR FOREIGN LOCATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP) REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND THEIR EFFECTS CANNOT BE PERCEIVED WITH CERTAINTY. ESTIMATES MAY CHANGE AS NEW EVENTS OCCUR, AS MORE EXPERIENCE IS ACQUIRED, AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS OUR OPERATING ENVIRONMENT CHANGES. WE BASE OUR ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, AND THAT WE BELIEVE PROVIDE A BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE THROUGH OPEN MARKET QUOTES.  WE MUST USE OUR JUDGMENT WITH REGARD TO UNCERTAINTIES IN ORDER TO MAKE THESE ESTIMATES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, SEE OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  OCTOBER 31, 2018  .  DURING THE  SIX  MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  , WE CHANGED OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICY RELATED TO INVENTORY.  SPECIFICALLY, WE CHANGED THE METHOD OF INVENTORY COSTING FOR CERTAIN INVENTORY TO THE FIRST-IN FIRST-OUT (FIFO) METHOD FROM THE LAST-IN FIRST-OUT (LIFO) METHOD.  FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THIS CHANGE, REFER TO \"PART I, FINANCIAL INFORMATION\" OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  FROM TIME TO TIME, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ARE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) OR OTHER STANDARDS SETTING BODIES THAT WE ADOPT AS OF THE SPECIFIED EFFECTIVE DATE. UNLESS OTHERWISE DISCUSSED, WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF ANY RECENTLY ISSUED STANDARDS THAT ARE NOT YET EFFECTIVE ARE EITHER NOT APPLICABLE TO US AT THIS TIME OR WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.  IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842): AMENDMENTS TO THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION  . THESE AMENDMENTS REPLACE CURRENT GUIDANCE AND REQUIRE THE RECOGNITION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES BY LESSEES FOR THOSE LEASES CLASSIFIED AS OPERATING LEASES UNDER PREVIOUS U.S. GAAP.  THE AMENDMENTS APPLY TO ANY ENTITY THAT ENTERS INTO LEASING ARRANGEMENTS. THIS GUIDANCE BECOMES EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018, AND, THEREFORE, WE WILL ADOPT THIS PRONOUNCEMENT IN FISCAL 2020 USING THE CURRENT PERIOD ADJUSTMENT METHOD APPROVED BY THE FASB IN MARCH 2018.  THIS METHOD ALLOWS US TO NOT RESTATE COMPARATIVE PERIODS AND INSTEAD APPLY THE NEW STANDARD ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. UNDER THIS METHOD, A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT IS RECORDED TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION.  WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF GATHERING AND REVIEWING OUR CONTRACTS, AS WELL AS REVIEWING OUR CURRENT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTROLS, PROCESSES AND DISCLOSURES THAT WILL CHANGE AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING THIS NEW STANDARD.  WE ARE ALSO EVALUATING THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS AVAILABLE TO US WITHIN THE NEW GUIDANCE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION ON WHICH PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS TO ADOPT.  WHILE OUR EVALUATION IS STILL IN PROCESS, WE EXPECT THE ADOPTION TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.  REFER TO OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018 FOR ADDITIONAL STANDARDS WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS", "is_valid": false, "label": 1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "Quanex Building Products CORP", "CIK": 1423221, "Date": "2019-06-05T00:00:00", "Ticker": "NX", "Name": "Quanex Building Products Corp", "Exchange": "NYSE", "SIC": 3350.0, "Business": "TX", "Incorporated": "DE", "IRS": 261561397.0, "key": "20190605NX", "labelr1": 0.532544378698224, "labelr2": -1.706886403766917, "labelr3": 0.4191616766467083, "labelr4": 2.20632081097198, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.54552627, "prof1": 0.4544737, "return1&2": 1.0116525209747471, "return1&2&3": 1.0074120613059905, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9851853193451544, "return2": 1.0170688640376693, "return1": 0.9946745562130178, "return3": 0.9958083832335328, "return4": 0.9779367918902802, "1_day_return": 0.5325443786982298, "cumulative_return1": 3.491203466899898, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.7310321258514867, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.4297471165408857, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 4.6704997180642716, "indexx": 1260, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9969007202753186, "cumreturn1b": 1.0500401452031751, "cumreturndow": 1.036087391196153, "cumreturnsp500": 1.036296892418737}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1262, "level_0": 1292, "index": 41882, "text": "ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FISCAL 2018 MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN OUR FISCAL 2018 FORM 10-K.  IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO.  THIS REPORT CONTAINS VARIOUS \u201cFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 27A OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND SECTION 21E OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, WHICH REPRESENT OUR EXPECTATIONS OR BELIEFS CONCERNING FUTURE EVENTS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  THE PLANNED OPENING OF 15 TO 20 AMERICAN EAGLE STORES, 35 TO 40 AERIE STANDALONE STORES, AND THE OPENING OF 25 TO 35 AERIE SIDE-BY-SIDE FORMAT STORES WITH NEW OR EXISTING AMERICAN EAGLE STORES IN NORTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY, ENGAGE IN FUTURE FRANCHISE/LICENSE AGREEMENTS, AND/OR GROWTH THROUGH ACQUISITIONS OR JOINT VENTURES;  \u2022  THE SELECTION OF APPROXIMATELY 40 TO 50 AMERICAN EAGLE STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA FOR REMODELING AND REFURBISHING DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 15 AMERICAN EAGLE AND 5 TO 10 AERIE STORES, PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE PLANNED OPENING OF APPROXIMATELY 15 TO 20 NEW INTERNATIONAL THIRD-PARTY OPERATED AMERICAN EAGLE STORES DURING FISCAL 2019;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR CORE AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRANDS THROUGH OUR OMNI-CHANNEL AND LICENSED OUTLETS WITHIN NORTH AMERICA AND INTERNATIONALLY;  \u2022  THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESS PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES;  \u2022  THE CONTINUED VALIDITY OF OUR TRADEMARKS;  \u2022  OUR PERFORMANCE DURING THE YEAR-END HOLIDAY SELLING SEASON;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO PREDICT INVENTORY TURNOVER;  \u2022  THE ACCURACY OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE PURSUANT TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES;  \u2022  THE EXPECTED PAYMENT OF A DIVIDEND IN FUTURE PERIODS;  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT OUR CREDIT FACILITIES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE BORROWINGS  \u2022  THE AVAILABILITY OF SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW TO FUND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS;  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT PRODUCT COSTS ARE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN TRADE ISSUES (INCLUDING IMPORT TARIFFS AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS WITH CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES), CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, INCREASING PRICES FOR RAW MATERIALS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY OR OTHER REASONS; AND  \u2022  THE POSSIBILITY THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STORE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO UNDERPERFORMING STORES.  WE CAUTION THAT THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, AND THOSE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, INVOLVE MATERIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE BASED ON FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL AS DISCUSSED HEREIN AND ITEM 1A OF OUR FISCAL 2018 FORM 10-K. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.  20  KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS  OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WHICH ARE CONSIDERED KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, IN ASSESSING OUR PERFORMANCE.  COMPARABLE SALES  \u2014 COMPARABLE SALES PROVIDE A MEASURE OF SALES GROWTH FOR STORES AND CHANNELS OPEN AT LEAST ONE YEAR OVER THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS FOLLOWING THOSE WITH 53 WEEKS, THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD IS SHIFTED BY ONE WEEK TO COMPARE SIMILAR CALENDAR WEEKS. A STORE IS INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH OF OPERATION. HOWEVER, STORES THAT HAVE A GROSS SQUARE FOOTAGE CHANGE OF 25% OR GREATER DUE TO A REMODEL ARE REMOVED FROM THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE, BUT ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL SALES. THESE STORES ARE RETURNED TO THE COMPARABLE SALES BASE IN THE THIRTEENTH MONTH FOLLOWING THE REMODEL. SALES FROM AMERICAN EAGLE, AERIE, TAILGATE AND TODD SNYDER STORES, AS WELL AS SALES FROM AEO DIRECT AND OTHER DIGITAL CHANNELS, ARE INCLUDED IN TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES. SALES FROM LICENSED STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE SALES. INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES DISCLOSURES REPRESENT SALES FROM STORES AND AEO DIRECT.  AEO DIRECT SALES ARE INCLUDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL AMERICAN EAGLE AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES METRIC FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS.  \u2022  OUR APPROACH TO CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT IS \u201cOMNI-CHANNEL\u201d, WHICH PROVIDES A SEAMLESS CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE THROUGH BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, INCLUDING FOUR WALL STORE LOCATIONS, WEB, MOBILE/TABLET DEVICES, SOCIAL NETWORKS, EMAIL, IN-STORE DISPLAYS AND KIOSKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE FULFILL ONLINE ORDERS AT STORES THROUGH OUR BUY ONLINE, SHIP FROM STORE CAPABILITY, MAXIMIZING STORE INVENTORY EXPOSURE TO DIGITAL TRAFFIC. WE ALSO OFFER RESERVE ONLINE, PICKUP IN STORE SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GIVE THEM THE ABILITY TO LOOK UP STORE INVENTORY FROM ALL DIGITAL CHANNELS; AND  \u2022  SHOPPING BEHAVIOR HAS CONTINUED TO EVOLVE ACROSS MULTIPLE CHANNELS THAT WORK IN TANDEM TO MEET CUSTOMER NEEDS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT PRESENTING A BRAND LEVEL PERFORMANCE METRIC THAT INCLUDES ALL CHANNELS (I.E., STORES AND AEO DIRECT) IS THE MOST APPROPRIATE, GIVEN CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR.  OUR MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS COMPARABLE SALES TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF OUR CURRENT PERFORMANCE. COMPARABLE SALES RESULTS ARE IMPORTANT TO ACHIEVE LEVERAGING OF OUR COSTS, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL, STORE SUPPLIES, RENT, ETC. COMPARABLE SALES ALSO HAVE A DIRECT IMPACT ON OUR TOTAL NET REVENUE, CASH AND WORKING CAPITAL.  GROSS PROFIT  \u2014 GROSS PROFIT MEASURES WHETHER WE ARE OPTIMIZING PROFITABILITY OF OUR SALES. GROSS PROFIT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TOTAL NET REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. COST OF SALES CONSISTS OF: MERCHANDISE COSTS, INCLUDING DESIGN, SOURCING, IMPORTING AND INBOUND FREIGHT COSTS, AS WELL AS MARKDOWNS, SHRINKAGE AND CERTAIN PROMOTIONAL COSTS (COLLECTIVELY \u201cMERCHANDISE COSTS\u201d) AND BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS. DESIGN COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, RENT, DEPRECIATION, TRAVEL, SUPPLIES AND SAMPLES.  BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING COSTS CONSIST OF: COMPENSATION, EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSES AND TRAVEL FOR OUR BUYERS AND CERTAIN SENIOR MERCHANDISING EXECUTIVES; RENT AND UTILITIES RELATED TO OUR STORES, CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND OTHER OFFICE SPACE; FREIGHT FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS TO THE STORES; COMPENSATION AND SUPPLIES FOR OUR DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, INCLUDING PURCHASING, RECEIVING AND INSPECTION COSTS; AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS RELATED TO OUR E-COMMERCE OPERATION.  THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN ACCEPTABLE LEVELS OF SALES, INITIAL MARKUPS OR ANY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR USE OF MARKDOWNS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR GROSS PROFIT AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  OPERATING INCOME  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT VIEWS OPERATING INCOME AS A KEY INDICATOR OF OUR PERFORMANCE. THE KEY DRIVERS OF OPERATING INCOME ARE COMPARABLE SALES, GROSS PROFIT, OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, AND OUR LEVEL OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT UTILIZES THE FOLLOWING QUALITY OF SALES METRICS IN EVALUATING OUR OMNI-CHANNEL SALES PERFORMANCE: COMPARABLE SALES, AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL PRICE (\u201cAUR\u201d), UNITS PER TRANSACTION (\u201cUPT\u201d), AVERAGE TRANSACTION VALUE, TRANSACTIONS, CUSTOMER TRAFFIC, CONVERSION RATES, AVERAGE UNIT COST (\u201cAUC\u201d), AND COMPARABLE GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS.  INVENTORY TURNOVER  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES INVENTORY TURNOVER AS A MEASURE OF HOW PRODUCTIVELY INVENTORY IS BOUGHT AND SOLD. INVENTORY TURNOVER IS IMPORTANT AS IT CAN SIGNAL SLOW MOVING INVENTORY. THIS CAN BE CRITICAL IN DETERMINING THE NEED TO TAKE MARKDOWNS ON MERCHANDISE.  21  CASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY  \u2014 OUR MANAGEMENT EVALUATES CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, INVESTING AND FINANCING IN DETERMINING THE SUFFICIEN  CY OF OUR CASH POSITION.  C  ASH FLOW HAS HISTORIC  ALLY BEEN SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR USES OF CASH. O  UR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT  CASH FLOW WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ANTICIPATED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW  OUR FIRST QUARTER PRODUCED THE SEVENTEENTH CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF POSITIVE COMPARABLE SALES INCREASE.  AMERICAN EAGLE\u2019S ONGOING MARKET SHARE GAINS ARE LED BY ITS DOMINANT JEANS BUSINESS, AND AERIE\u2019S CONSISTENT DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH HAS BEEN FUELED BY THE BRAND\u2019S STRONG APPEAL TO BOTH EXISTING AND NEW CUSTOMERS.  TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED 8% TO $886.3 MILLION AND CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE SALES, INCLUDING AEO DIRECT, INCREASED 6%, FOLLOWING A 9% INCREASE LAST YEAR. BY BRAND, AMERICAN EAGLE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 4% FOLLOWING A 4% INCREASE LAST YEAR, WHILE AERIE COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 14% COMPARED TO A 38% INCREASE LAST YEAR. GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 7% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $324.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $304.4 MILLION LAST YEAR AND DECREASED 30 BASIS POINTS TO 36.7% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE.  NET INCOME FOR THE QUARTER INCREASED 2% TO $40.8 MILLION, OR $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $39.9 MILLION, OR $0.22 PER DILUTED SHARE, LAST YEAR. ON AN ADJUSTED BASIS, NET INCOME PER DILUTED SHARE THIS YEAR INCREASED 4% TO $0.24 PER SHARE, WHICH EXCLUDES $0.01 PER SHARE OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES COMPARED TO $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE LAST YEAR, WHICH EXCLUDES $0.01 PER SHARE OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.  DURING THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, WE RETURNED $43.6 MILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH SHARE REPURCHASES OF $20.0 MILLION, AND CASH DIVIDENDS OF $23.6 MILLION.  WE HAD $349.7 MILLION IN CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO $309.7 MILLION LAST YEAR.  MERCHANDISE INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER WAS $456.2 MILLION, COMPARED TO $404.3 MILLION LAST YEAR, A 13% INCREASE.  OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED BY THE PATTERN OF SEASONALITY COMMON TO MOST RETAIL APPAREL BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT AND PRIOR PERIODS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.  THIS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SECTION CONTAINS NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (\u201cNON-GAAP\u201d OR \u201cADJUSTED\u201d), COMPRISED OF EARNINGS PER SHARE INFORMATION EXCLUDING NON-GAAP ITEMS. THIS FINANCIAL MEASURE IS NOT BASED ON ANY STANDARDIZED METHODOLOGY PRESCRIBED BY U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (\u201cGAAP\u201d) AND IS NOT NECESSARILY COMPARABLE TO SIMILAR MEASURES PRESENTED BY OTHER COMPANIES. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS NON-GAAP INFORMATION IS USEFUL AS AN ADDITIONAL MEANS FOR INVESTORS TO EVALUATE OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE, WHEN REVIEWED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE 5 TAILGATE AND 1 TODD SNYDER STAND-ALONE LOCATIONS.  COMPARISON OF THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 TO THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018  TOTAL NET REVENUE  TOTAL NET REVENUE INCREASED 8%, OR $63.3 MILLION, TO $886.3 MILLION COMPARED TO $823.0 MILLION LAST YEAR.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 6% FOR THE PERIOD COMPARED TO A 9% INCREASE LAST YEAR.  BY BRAND, INCLUDING THE RESPECTIVE AEO DIRECT SALES, AMERICAN EAGLE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 4%, OR $23.9 MILLION, AND AERIE BRAND COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED 14%, OR $16.9 MILLION.  TOTAL COMPARABLE SALES FOR AE WOMEN\u2019S INCREASED 7% AND MEN\u2019S DECREASED 4%.  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER, CONSOLIDATED COMPARABLE TRAFFIC AND TRANSACTIONS INCREASED IN THE HIGH-SINGLE DIGITS. UNITS PER TRANSACTION INCREASED IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN AUR DECREASE IN THE LOW-SINGLE DIGITS.  23  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT INCREASED 7% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $324.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $304.4 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THE GROSS MARGIN RATE DECLINED 30 BASIS POINTS TO A RATE OF 36.7% OF REVENUE.  RENT LEVERAGE AND IMPROVED PRODUCT COSTS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES IN MARKDOWNS AND DELIVERY EXPENSE.  THERE WAS $2.5 MILLION AND $2.7 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE INCLUDED IN GROSS PROFIT FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, COMPRISED OF BOTH TIME AND PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF OTHER RETAILERS, AS SOME RETAILERS INCLUDE ALL COSTS RELATED TO THEIR DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, AS WELL AS DESIGN COSTS IN COST OF SALES AND OTHERS MAY EXCLUDE A PORTION OF THESE COSTS FROM COST OF SALES, INCLUDING THEM IN A LINE ITEM SUCH AS SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  REFER TO NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICY REGARDING COST OF SALES, INCLUDING CERTAIN BUYING, OCCUPANCY AND WAREHOUSING EXPENSES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d) EXPENSES INCREASED 10% OR $20.5 MILLION TO $230.7 MILLION FROM $210.2 MILLION LAST YEAR. AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, SG&A EXPENSES INCREASED 50 BASIS POINTS TO 26.0%, COMPARED TO 25.5% LAST YEAR. STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN THE STORES ORGANIZATION, WHICH BEGAN MIDWAY THROUGH 2018, LED TO INCREASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  ADVERTISING AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE FROM $210 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THERE WAS $2.5 MILLION AND $3.0 MILLION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT EXPENSE INCLUDED IN SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE PERIODS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY, COMPRISED OF BOTH TIME AND PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.5 MILLION, OR 0.2% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019. THESE CHARGES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SEVERANCE AND CLOSURE COSTS FOR OUR COMPANY-OWNED AND OPERATED STORES IN CHINA. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES WERE $1.6 MILLION, OR 0.2% AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  THESE CHARGES WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF CORPORATE SEVERANCE CHARGES.  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE INCREASED 7% OR $2.9 MILLION TO $44.8 MILLION, COMPARED TO $41.9 MILLION LAST YEAR.  AS A RATE TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS 5.1% THIS YEAR COMPARED TO 5.1% LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY OMNI-CHANNEL, STORES AND IT TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME INCREASED TO $4.2 MILLION THIS YEAR, COMPARED TO OTHER INCOME OF $0.5 MILLION LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED INTEREST INCOME AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE AND IS ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR QUARTERLY EVENTS. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WAS 21.7% COMPARED TO 22.0% FOR THE 13 WEEKS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE THIS YEAR IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO CHANGES IN TAX REFORM GUIDANCE.  NET INCOME  NET INCOME INCREASED 2%, OR $0.8 MILLION, TO $40.8 MILLION, OR 4.6% AS A PERCENT TO TOTAL NET REVENUE, FROM $39.9 MILLION, OR 4.8% AS A PERCENT TO TOTAL NET REVENUE LAST YEAR. NET INCOME PER SHARE INCREASED 5% TO $0.23 PER DILUTED SHARE, INCLUDING $0.01 OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES FROM $0.22 PER DILUTED SHARE, INCLUDING $0.01 OF RESTRUCTURING CHARGES LAST YEAR.  THE CHANGE IN NET INCOME IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE.  24  INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS  WE HAVE AGREEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE THIRD PARTY OPERATORS TO EXPAND OUR BRANDS INTERNATIONALLY. THROUGH THESE AGREEMENTS, A SERIES OF FRANCHISED, LICENSED OR OTHER BRAND-DEDICATED AMERICAN EAGLE STORES HAVE OPENED AND WILL CONTINUE TO OPEN IN AREAS INCLUDING EASTERN EUROPE, THE MIDDLE EAST, CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, NORTHERN AFRICA AND PARTS OF ASIA. THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT INVOLVE A SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL INVESTMENT OR OPERATIONAL INVOLVEMENT FROM US.  WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COUNTRIES IN WHICH WE ENTER INTO THESE TYPES OF ARRANGEMENTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO EXPAND INTERNATIONALLY.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD 235 STORES OPERATED BY OUR THIRD PARTY OPERATORS IN 24 COUNTRIES. INTERNATIONAL THIRD PARTY OPERATED STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STORE DATA OR THE TOTAL GROSS SQUARE FEET CALCULATION.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HAD 104 COMPANY-OWNED STORES IN CANADA, 39 IN MEXICO, 6 IN HONG KONG AND 6 IN PUERTO RICO.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  ASC 820 DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.  FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED UNDER ASC 820 AS THE EXIT PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF AN ASSET OR TRANSFER OF A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 820 MUST MAXIMIZE THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZE THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS.  IN ADDITION, ASC 820 ESTABLISHES A THREE-TIER FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE.  THESE TIERS INCLUDE.  \u2022  LEVEL 1 \u2014 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS.  \u2022  LEVEL 2 \u2014 INPUTS OTHER THAN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY.  \u2022  LEVEL 3 \u2014 UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY LITTLE OR NO MARKET ACTIVITY AND THAT ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, WE HELD CERTAIN ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.  THESE INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 820, THE FOLLOWING TABLE REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSETS (CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS) MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.

HISTORICALLY, THESE USES OF CASH HAVE BEEN FUNDED WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING CASH ON HAND. ALSO, WE MAINTAIN AN ASSET-BASED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT ALLOWS US TO BORROW UP TO $400 MILLION, WHICH WILL EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2024.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR USES OF CASH INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AERIE BRAND, INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND OMNI-CHANNEL CAPABILITIES, AND OUR INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION EFFORTS.  WE ALSO MADE KEY INVESTMENTS IN THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE AND OUR ASSOCIATES, INCLUDING STORE PAYROLL AND HIGHER WAGES, AS WELL AS INCREMENTAL ADVERTISING EXPENSES. WE EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO FUND OUR FUTURE CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH CURRENT CASH HOLDINGS AS WELL AS CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR GROWTH STRATEGY INCLUDES FORTIFYING OUR BRANDS AND FURTHER E-COMMERCE AND STORE EXPANSION OR ACQUISITIONS. WE PERIODICALLY CONSIDER AND EVALUATE THESE OPTIONS TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH. IN THE EVENT WE DO PURSUE SUCH OPTIONS, WE COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EQUITY OR DEBT FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL IN CLOSING ANY POTENTIAL TRANSACTION, OR THAT ANY ENDEAVOR WE UNDERTAKE WOULD INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY.  THE FOLLOWING SETS FORTH CERTAIN MEASURES OF OUR LIQUIDITY.

OVERVIEW  WE ARE A LEADING DEVELOPER OF SEMICONDUCTOR PROCESSING SOLUTIONS FOR VIDEO THAT ENABLE HIGH-DEFINITION, OR HD, VIDEO CAPTURE, ANALYSIS, SHARING AND DISPLAY. A DEVICE THAT CAPTURES VIDEO INCLUDES FOUR PRIMARY COMPONENTS: A LENS, AN IMAGE SENSOR, A VIDEO PROCESSOR AND STORAGE MEMORY. THE VIDEO PROCESSOR CONVERTS RAW VIDEO INPUT INTO A FORMAT THAT CAN BE STORED AND DISTRIBUTED EFFICIENTLY AND, IN SOME CASES, ANALYZES THE VIDEO DATA TO AUTOMATE PROCESSES. WE COMBINE OUR PROCESSOR DESIGN CAPABILITIES WITH OUR EXPERTISE IN VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING, COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TO PROVIDE A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM THAT IS DESIGNED TO BE EASILY SCALABLE ACROSS MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS IN A VARIETY OF MARKETS AND ENABLE RAPID AND EFFICIENT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. OUR SYSTEM-ON-A-CHIP, OR SOC, DESIGNS FULLY INTEGRATE HD VIDEO PROCESSING, IMAGE PROCESSING, ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, OR AI, COMPUTER VISION, OR CV, FUNCTIONALITY, AUDIO PROCESSING, AND SYSTEM FUNCTIONS ONTO A SINGLE CHIP, DELIVERING EXCEPTIONAL VIDEO AND IMAGE QUALITY AT HIGH COMPRESSION RATES, DIFFERENTIATED FUNCTIONALITY AND LOW POWER CONSUMPTION.  OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN EXPANDING OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY THAT NOT ONLY COMPLEMENTS OUR IMAGE PROCESSING AND VIDEO COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY, BUT ALSO BUILDS FOUNDATION TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES IN AI AND CV APPLICATIONS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS. WE BELIEVE THAT ENHANCED COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY IS CRITICAL BOTH TO OUR CURRENT VIDEO MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY CAMERA, AS WELL AS FUTURE MARKETS SUCH AS AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER, OR OEM, CAMERAS FOR ADVANCED DRIVING ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, OR ADAS, AND AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, AND ROBOTICS. OUR RECENT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON CREATING ADVANCED COMPUTER VISION ALGORITHMS AND HIGH-PERFORMANCE, LOW-POWER HARDWARE PLATFORMS TO ENHANCE PROCESSING ACCELERATION, WHICH WE REFER TO AS OUR CVFLOW ARCHITECTURE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTEGRATION OF OUR PROPRIETARY HIGHLY-OPTIMIZED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY WITH OUR VIDEO PROCESSOR PROVIDES AN OPTIMIZED CV PLATFORM. IN 2017, WE INTRODUCED OUR FIRST COMPUTER VISION SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP, THE CV1 SOC. IN 2018, WE INTRODUCED THREE NEW COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOCS TO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO DEVELOP INTELLIGENT CAMERA SYSTEMS FOR A VARIETY OF MARKETS AT DIFFERENT FEATURE LEVELS.  23  OUR REVENUE OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN GENERATED PRIMARILY FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS FO  R INCORPORATION INTO SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES SUCH AS WEARABLE SPORTS CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET CAMERAS, IP SECURITY CAMERAS AND CAMERAS INCORPORATED INTO UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES, OR UAVS OR DRONES. OUR REVENUE FROM SEVERAL OF THE  SE MARKETS, HOWEVER, HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DECLINES.  AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH, IF ANY, WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO EXPAND WITHIN THE CAMERA MARKETS WITH OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOC SOLU  TIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING CAMERA MARKETS, AS WELL AS EMERGING MARKETS SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMPARISON  TO PRIOR PERIODS AS WE DEVOTE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTIONS WITH INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY, SUCH AS COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES, AND AS WE TARGET NEW MARKETS, SUCH AS THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOT  ICS MARKETS.  WE SELL OUR SOLUTIONS TO LEADING ORIGINAL DESIGN MANUFACTURERS, OR ODMS, AND OEMS GLOBALLY, AND IN THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKET, WE ALSO SELL TO TIER-1 SUPPLIERS TO OEMS. WE REFER TO ODMS AND TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AS OUR CUSTOMERS AND OEMS AS OUR END CUSTOMERS, EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE INDICATED OR AS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE REQUIRES. IN THE CAMERA MARKET, OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE THE CREATION OF HIGH-QUALITY VIDEO CONTENT IN WEARABLE CAMERAS, AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS, INTERNET PROTOCOL, OR IP, SECURITY CAMERAS, FOR BOTH PROFESSIONAL USE AND HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING, UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS UAVS OR DRONES, AND VIRTUAL REALITY CAMERAS, ALSO REFERRED TO AS 360\u00b0 CAMERAS. WE ALSO RECENTLY INTRODUCED, AND CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, AND DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS.  OUR SALES CYCLES TYPICALLY REQUIRE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OF TIME AND A SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURE OF RESOURCES BEFORE WE CAN REALIZE REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF OUR SOLUTIONS, IF ANY. OUR TYPICAL SALES CYCLE CONSISTS OF A MULTI-MONTH SALES AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS INVOLVING OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 SYSTEM DESIGNERS AND MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH OUR SALES PERSONNEL AND SOFTWARE ENGINEERS. IF SUCCESSFUL, THIS PROCESS CULMINATES IN A CUSTOMER\u2019S DECISION TO USE OUR SOLUTIONS IN ITS SYSTEM, WHICH WE REFER TO AS A DESIGN WIN. OUR SALES EFFORTS ARE TYPICALLY DIRECTED TO THE OEM OF THE PRODUCT THAT WILL INCORPORATE OUR VIDEO AND IMAGE PROCESSING SOLUTION, BUT THE EVENTUAL DESIGN AND INCORPORATION OF OUR SOC INTO THE PRODUCT MAY BE HANDLED BY AN ODM ON BEHALF OF THE OEM. IN SOME OF THE NEW MARKETS WE ARE ADDRESSING, SUCH AS AI-BASED AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS, IT MAY TAKE LONGER AND REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES TO SECURE DESIGN WINS THAN IN OUR TRADITIONAL MARKETS.  VOLUME PRODUCTION MAY BEGIN WITHIN SIX TO 18 MONTHS OR EVEN LONGER AFTER A DESIGN WIN, DEPENDING ON THE TARGETED MARKET, THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT AND OTHER FACTORS UPON WHICH WE MAY HAVE LITTLE OR NO INFLUENCE. ONCE ONE OF OUR SOLUTIONS HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO A CUSTOMER\u2019S DESIGN, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SOLUTION IS LIKELY TO REMAIN A COMPONENT OF THE CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT FOR ITS LIFE CYCLE BECAUSE OF THE TIME AND EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH REDESIGNING A PRODUCT OR SUBSTITUTING AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION. CONVERSELY, A DESIGN LOSS TO A COMPETITOR WILL LIKELY PRECLUDE ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GENERATE FUTURE REVENUE FROM SUCH CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT. EVEN IF WE OBTAIN A DESIGN WIN AND OUR SOC REMAINS A COMPONENT THROUGH THE LIFE CYCLE OF A CUSTOMER\u2019S PRODUCT, THE VOLUME AND TIMING OF ACTUAL SALES OF OUR SOCS TO THE CUSTOMER DEPEND UPON THE PRODUCTION, RELEASE AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THAT PRODUCT, NONE OF WHICH ARE WITHIN OUR CONTROL. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, WHILE AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT LIFECYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  24  FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS AND TRENDS  \u2022  WE RECORDED REVENUE OF $47.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, A DECREASE OF 17% AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. THE DECREASE IN REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM WEARABLE CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING SPORTS CAMERA, NON-SPORTS WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND DRONE MARKETS. THE DECREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER. IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, REVENUE DECLINED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR TWO LARGEST CHINA CUSTOMERS LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASED IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY THE HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC. OR GOPRO.  \u2022  WE RECORDED AN OPERATING LOSS OF $18.2 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO AN OPERATING LOSS OF $10.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCREASED OPERATING LOSS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUE AND GROSS MARGINS AND INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED PRIMARILY IN SUPPORT OF NEW APPLICATIONS FOR THE AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION-BASED SOLUTIONS. THE INCREASE IN EXPENSES RELATED PRIMARILY TO INCREASED ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE.  \u2022  WE GENERATED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $5.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO $64,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR INCREASED NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS.  \u2022  EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 1, 2019, WE ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (\u201cASC\u201d) TOPIC 842, LEASES. UNDER THIS NEW GUIDANCE, WE RECOGNIZE LEASES AS RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES AT THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS, WHILE RECOGNIZING LEASE EXPENSES UNDER STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD THROUGH THE LEASE TERM  . AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $7.9 MILLION OF ROU, NET OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE, AND $8.0 MILLION OF LEASE LIABILITIES RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION OF LEASE EXPENSE RECORDED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.  FACTORS AFFECTING OUR PERFORMANCE  DESIGN WINS  . WE CLOSELY MONITOR DESIGN WINS BY CUSTOMER AND END MARKET. WE CONSIDER DESIGN WINS TO BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS, ALTHOUGH A DESIGN WIN MAY NOT SUCCESSFULLY MATERIALIZE INTO REVENUE, AND EVEN IF IT DOES RESULT IN REVENUE, THE AMOUNT GENERATED BY EACH DESIGN WIN CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. OUR LONG-TERM SALES EXPECTATIONS ARE BASED ON FORECASTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND INTERNAL ESTIMATIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FACTORING IN THE EXPECTED TIME TO MARKET FOR END CUSTOMER PRODUCTS INCORPORATING OUR SOLUTIONS AND ASSOCIATED REVENUE POTENTIAL. OUR ABILITY TO ACCURATELY FORECAST DEMAND, HOWEVER, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING INACCURATE FORECASTING BY OUR CUSTOMERS, MISCALCULATIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS OF THEIR INVENTORY REQUIREMENTS, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ADVERSE CHANGES IN OUR PRODUCT ORDER MIX AND FLUCTUATING DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS.  PRICING, PRODUCT COST AND MARGIN  . OUR PRICING AND MARGINS DEPEND ON THE VOLUMES AND FEATURES OF THE SOLUTIONS WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH COST IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES THAT WE EXPECT TO DRIVE REVENUE AND MAINTAIN MARGINS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERA APPLICATIONS OR, IN THE FUTURE, ADVANCED DRIVER ASSISTANCE SYSTEMS, HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO LOWER-PERFORMING, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICE CAN VARY BY MARKET AND APPLICATION DUE TO MARKET-SPECIFIC SUPPLY AND DEMAND, THE MATURATION OF PRODUCTS LAUNCHED IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE LAUNCH OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUALLY MONITOR THE COST OF OUR SOLUTIONS. AS WE RELY ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS, WE MAINTAIN A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THESE SUPPLIERS TO CONTINUALLY MONITOR PRODUCTION YIELDS, COMPONENT COSTS AND DESIGN EFFICIENCIES.  25  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON COMPUTER VISION TRENDS  . WE EXPECT THAT COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITY WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT IN MANY OF OUR CURRENT AND FUTURE MARKETS,  INCLUDING  IP SECURITY,  AUTOMOTIVE, ROBOTICS, AND UAV MARKETS. AS A RESULT, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP ADVANCED AI COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ENABLE AND SUPPORT CUSTOMER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS ADAS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETE  CTION, OBJECT DETECTION, PEOPLE RECOGNITION, RETAIL ANALYTICS, AND MACHINE LEARNING, AND GAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM AND SOLUTIONS, WILL BE CRITICAL TO OUR FUTURE SUCCESS.  SHIFTING CONSUMER PREFERENCES.  OUR REVENUE IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CONSUMER PREFERENCES, REGARDING FORM FACTOR AND FUNCTIONALITY, AND HOW THOSE PREFERENCES IMPACT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE ELECTRONICS THAT WE SUPPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, IMPROVED SMARTPHONE VIDEO CAPTURE CAPABILITIES LED TO THE DECLINE OF VIDEO CAMERAS AIMED AT THE VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET. THE CURRENT VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE MARKET IS NOW CHARACTERIZED BY A GREATER VOLUME OF MORE SPECIALIZED VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES THAT ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE REPLACED WITH SMARTPHONES, SUCH AS WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE CAMERAS. THIS INCREASING SPECIALIZATION OF VIDEO CAPTURE DEVICES HAS CHANGED OUR CUSTOMER BASE AND END MARKETS AND HAS IMPACTED OUR REVENUE. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT FURTHER CHANGES WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE IN THOSE MARKETS.  CONTINUED CONCENTRATION OF REVENUE BY END MARKET  . HISTORICALLY, OUR REVENUE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF END MARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE CAME FROM THE POCKET VIDEO, CAMCORDER AND INFRASTRUCTURE MARKETS. SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS FOR NEW MARKETS AS THEY EMERGED, SUCH AS THE WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERA MARKETS. SINCE FISCAL YEAR 2013, THE WEARABLE SPORTS, PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY AND UAV MARKETS HAVE BEEN OUR LARGEST END MARKETS AND SALES INTO THESE MARKETS COLLECTIVELY GENERATED THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUE. WE BELIEVE, HOWEVER, THAT EXPANSION INTO NEW MARKETS IS REQUIRED TO FACILITATE REVENUE GROWTH AND CUSTOMER DIVERSIFICATION AS OUR REVENUE FROM THE WEARABLE CAMERA AND UAV CAMERA MARKETS HAS DECLINED IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS EMERGING APPLICATIONS AND MARKETS, SUCH AS THE INCORPORATION OF COMPUTER VISION FUNCTIONALITIES FOR AI-ENABLED SECURITY CAMERAS, AI-BASED DRIVING APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING AUTO-PARKING, DRIVER MONITORING SYSTEMS, ADVANCED BLIND SPOT DETECTION, OBJECT DETECTION, DEEP LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR HD MAPPING SOLUTIONS, OEM AUTOMOTIVE ADAS APPLICATIONS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WHILE WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK TO EXPAND OUR END MARKET EXPOSURE, WE ANTICIPATE THAT SALES TO A LIMITED NUMBER OF END MARKETS WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. OUR END MARKET CONCENTRATION MAY CAUSE OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE TO FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD BASED ON THE SUCCESS OR FAILURE OF PRODUCTS THAT OUR SOCS ARE DESIGNED INTO AS WELL AS THE OVERALL GROWTH OR DECLINE IN THE VIDEO CAPTURE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF ODMS WHO BUILD PRODUCTS ON BEHALF OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS AND FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF OEMS TO WHOM WE SHIP DIRECTLY. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO DEPEND ON SALES TO A RELATIVELY SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS.  ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON CONNECTIVITY TRENDS  . MOBILE CONNECTED DEVICES ARE UBIQUITOUS TODAY AND PLAY AN INCREASINGLY PROMINENT ROLE IN CONSUMERS\u2019 LIVES. THE CONSTANT CONNECTIVITY PROVIDED BY THESE DEVICES HAS CREATED A DEMAND FOR CONNECTED ELECTRONIC PERIPHERALS SUCH AS VIDEO AND IMAGE CAPTURE DEVICES. OUR ABILITY TO CAPITALIZE ON THESE TRENDS BY SUPPORTING OUR END CUSTOMERS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONNECTED PERIPHERALS THAT SEAMLESSLY COOPERATE WITH OTHER CONNECTED DEVICES AND ALLOW CONSUMERS TO DISTRIBUTE AND SHARE VIDEO AND IMAGES WITH ONLINE MEDIA PLATFORMS IS CRITICAL FOR OUR SUCCESS. WE HAVE ADDED WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FUNCTIONALITY INTO OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE, IP SECURITY, UAV AND AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER CAMERAS. THE COMBINATION OF OUR COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY WITH WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY ENABLES WIRELESS VIDEO STREAMING AND UPLOADING OF VIDEOS AND IMAGES TO THE INTERNET. OUR SOLUTIONS ENABLE IP SECURITY CAMERA SYSTEMS TO STREAM VIDEO CONTENT TO EITHER CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE OR CONNECTED MOBILE DEVICES, AND OUR SOLUTIONS FOR WEARABLE AND UAV CAMERAS ALLOW CONSUMERS TO QUICKLY STREAM OR UPLOAD VIDEO AND IMAGES TO SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS.  SALES VOLUME  . A TYPICAL CAMERA DESIGN WIN THAT SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHES INTO THE MARKETPLACE CAN GENERATE A WIDE RANGE OF SALES VOLUMES FOR OUR SOLUTIONS, DEPENDING ON THE END MARKET DEMAND FOR OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCTS. THIS CAN DEPEND ON SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THE REPUTATION OF THE END CUSTOMER, MARKET PENETRATION, PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, SIZE OF THE END MARKET THAT THE PRODUCT ADDRESSES AND OUR END CUSTOMERS\u2019 ABILITY TO SELL THEIR PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN CASES, WE MAY PROVIDE VOLUME DISCOUNTS ON SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH MAY BE OFFSET BY LOWER MANUFACTURING COSTS RELATED TO HIGHER VOLUMES. IN GENERAL, OUR CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER MARKET PENETRATION AND BETTER BRANDING TEND TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT GENERATE LARGER VOLUMES OVER THE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  CUSTOMER PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE.  WE ESTIMATE OUR CUSTOMERS\u2019 PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES BASED ON THE CUSTOMER, TYPE OF PRODUCT AND END MARKET. WE TYPICALLY COMMENCE COMMERCIAL SHIPMENTS FROM SIX TO 18 MONTHS FOLLOWING A DESIGN WIN; HOWEVER, IN SOME MARKETS, MORE LENGTHY PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT CYCLES ARE POSSIBLE, DEPENDING ON THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF THE PROJECT, SUCH AS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM MARKET. A PORTABLE CONSUMER DEVICE TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF SIX TO 18 MONTHS, AND AN IP SECURITY CAMERA TYPICALLY HAS A PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE OF 12 TO 24 MONTHS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES WILL TYPICALLY BE LONGER THAN 24 MONTHS IN THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE, TIER-1 AUTOMOTIVE SUPPLIERS AND ROBOTICS MARKETS, AS NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS TYPICALLY OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY IN THESE MARKETS.  26  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A SUMMARY OF OUR STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

IN RECENT YEARS, OUR SOC SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY USED IN CAMERA MARKETS, SUCH AS IP SECURITY, AUTOMOTIVE VIDEO RECORDER, DRONE AND WEARABLE CAMERAS. ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT THESE CAMERA MARKETS, IN PARTICULAR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE REVENUE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WE HAVE RECENTLY INTRODUCED NEW SOCS TARGETING EMERGING COMPUTER VISION APPLICATIONS IN THE IP SECURITY, OEM AUTOMOTIVE, AND ROBOTICS MARKETS. WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM SALES MADE INDIRECTLY THROUGH ONE OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS, WINTECH MICROELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR WINTECH, AND DIRECTLY TO ONE OF OUR ODM CUSTOMERS, CHICONY ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., OR CHICONY.  WE HAVE HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR QUARTERLY REVENUE WITH OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER NORMALLY BEING THE HIGHEST REVENUE QUARTER. THIS FLUCTUATION HAS BEEN DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED SALES IN CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS AS OUR CUSTOMERS BUILD INVENTORIES IN PREPARATION FOR THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. DUE TO  EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR OUR SOLUTIONS IN SEVERAL CONSUMER CAMERA MARKETS, INCLUDING WEARABLE CAMERA, VIRTUAL REALITY AND DRONE MARKETS  , THE SEASONAL IMPACT ON QUARTERLY REVENUE WOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT. MORE GENERALLY, OUR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE MIX OF OUR SOLUTIONS SOLD IN A PERIOD WHICH REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF BOTH CHANGES IN UNIT SALES OF EXISTING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS THE INTRODUCTION AND SALES OF NEW SOLUTIONS. OUR SOLUTIONS ARE TYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED BY A LIFE CYCLE THAT BEGINS WITH HIGHER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER VOLUMES, FOLLOWED BY BROADER MARKET ADOPTION, HIGHER VOLUMES AND AVERAGE SELLING PRICES THAT ARE LOWER THAN INITIAL LEVELS.  27  THE END MARKETS INTO WHICH WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS HAVE SEEN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AS CONSUMER PREFERENCES HAVE EVOLVED IN RESPONSE TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPOSITION AN  D TIMING OF OUR REVENUE MAY DIFFER MEANINGFULLY DURING PERIODS OF TECHNOLOGY OR CONSUMER PREFERENCE CHANGES. WE EXPECT SHIFTS IN CONSUMER USE OF VIDEO CAPTURE TO CONTINUE TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AS COMPUTER VISION SPECIALIZED USE CASES EMERGE AND VIDEO CAPTUR  E CONTINUES TO PROLIFERATE.  COST OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN  COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES THE COST OF MATERIALS SUCH AS WAFERS PROCESSED BY THIRD-PARTY FOUNDRIES, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PACKAGING, ASSEMBLY AND TESTING, AND OUR MANUFACTURING SUPPORT OPERATIONS SUCH AS LOGISTICS, PLANNING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE. COST OF REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES INDIRECT COSTS SUCH AS WARRANTY, INVENTORY VALUATION RESERVES AND OTHER GENERAL OVERHEAD COSTS.  WE EXPECT THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN MAY FLUCTUATE FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICE, PRODUCT MIX AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS BY US OR OUR COMPETITORS. IN GENERAL, SOLUTIONS INCORPORATED INTO MORE COMPLEX CONFIGURATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE USED IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE CAMERAS, AND IN FUTURE ADVANCED AUTOMOTIVE OEM APPLICATIONS, HAVE HAD OR ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE HIGHER PRICES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, AS COMPARED TO SOLUTIONS SOLD INTO THE LOWER-PERFORMANCE, MORE COMPETITIVE CAMERA APPLICATIONS. AS SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS MATURE AND UNIT VOLUMES SOLD TO CUSTOMERS INCREASE, THEIR AVERAGE SELLING PRICES TYPICALLY DECLINE. THESE DECLINES MAY BE PAIRED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN MANUFACTURING YIELDS AND LOWER WAFER, PACKAGING AND TEST COSTS, WHICH OFFSET SOME OF THE MARGIN REDUCTION THAT COULD RESULT FROM LOWER SELLING PRICES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR GROSS MARGIN WILL DECLINE IN THE FUTURE AS WE CONTINUE TO PENETRATE THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CAMERA MARKET AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE IP SECURITY MARKET.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OUR FOUNDRY VENDORS, COSTS OF LICENSING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY FROM THIRD PARTIES FOR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, COSTS OF DEVELOPMENT FOR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE TOOLS, COST OF FABRICATION OF MASK SETS FOR PROTOTYPE PRODUCTS, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WE EXPECT OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND OUR PRODUCT FEATURES AND OFFERINGS AND INCREASE HEADCOUNT FOR NEW SOC DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE OEM AUTOMOTIVE MARKET.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF PERSONNEL COSTS, INCLUDING SALARIES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS FOR OUR SALES, MARKETING, FINANCE, HUMAN RESOURCES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONNEL. THE EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES PROFESSIONAL SERVICE COSTS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING, TAX, LEGAL SERVICES, AND ALLOCATED DEPRECIATION AND FACILITY EXPENSES. WE EXPECT OUR SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO INCREASE IN ABSOLUTE DOLLARS AS WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPAND THE SIZE OF OUR SALES AND MARKETING ORGANIZATION TO SUPPORT OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OF ADDRESSING NEW OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR COMPUTER VISION TECHNOLOGY.  OTHER INCOME, NET  OTHER INCOME, NET, CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INTEREST INCOME FROM INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES, INTEREST INCOME FROM DEPOSITS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND SUBSIDIES GRANTED FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE ARE INCORPORATED AND DOMICILED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND ALSO CONDUCT BUSINESS IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES SUCH AS THE UNITED STATES, CHINA, TAIWAN, HONG KONG, ITALY, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN, AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS. OUR WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME IS SUBJECT TO VARYING TAX RATES, AND OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF OUR EARNINGS OR LOSSES AND THE TAX LAWS AND REGULATIONS IN EACH GEOGRAPHICAL REGION. IT IS ALSO SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION FROM CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES; TAX BENEFITS FROM EXCESS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DEDUCTIONS; TRANSFER PRICING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE TAX EFFECTS OF NONDEDUCTIBLE COMPENSATION. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY HAD LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AS A SUBSTANTIAL PERCENTAGE OF OUR OPERATIONS ARE CONDUCTED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS. IF OUR OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE WAS TO CHANGE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT WOULD INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF OPERATING INCOME SUBJECT TO TAXATION IN HIGHER-TAX JURISDICTIONS, OR IF WE WERE TO COMMENCE OPERATIONS IN JURISDICTIONS ASSESSING RELATIVELY HIGHER TAX RATES, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS AND/OR BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  28  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN EVALUATING OUR UNCERTAIN TAX POSIT  IONS AND DETERMINING OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR RESERVES ARE REASONABLE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS WILL NOT BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN OUR HISTORICAL PROVISION FOR I  NCOME TAXES AND ACCRUALS. WE ADJUST THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS THE CLOSING OF A TAX AUDIT OR THE REFINEMENT OF AN ESTIMATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FINAL TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS IS DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS RE  CORDED, SUCH DIFFERENCES WILL IMPACT THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION RESERVES AND CHANGES TO RESERVES THAT ARE CONSIDERED APPROPR  IATE, AS WELL AS THE RELATED NET INTEREST AND PENALTIES.  SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN DETERMINING ANY VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AGAINST DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE NEED FOR A VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WE CONSIDER ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, INCLUDING PAST OPERATING RESULTS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME, AND THE FEASIBILITY OF TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES. IN THE EVENT THAT WE CHANGE OUR DETERMINATION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT CAN BE REALIZED, WE WILL ADJUST OUR VALUATION ALLOWANCE WITH A CORRESPONDING IMPACT TO THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

THE DECREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AUTOMOTIVE MARKETS, PRINCIPALLY THE VIDEO RECORDER MARKET, CAUSED BY A SIGNIFICANT SLOWDOWN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 FROM A LARGE AUTOMOTIVE CUSTOMER THAT DID NOT RECUR IN THE CURRENT FISCAL QUARTER. IN THE PROFESSIONAL IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, REVENUE DECLINED DUE TO LOWER DEMAND FROM OUR TWO LARGEST CHINA CUSTOMERS LIKELY AS A RESULT OF THE RECENTLY ENACTED JOHN S. MCCAIN NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019. THE DECREASED REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT REVENUE INCREASED IN THE CONSUMER IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET, LED BY THE HOME SECURITY AND MONITORING MARKET IN THE NORTH AMERICA REGION. IN THE SPORTS CAMERA MARKET, INCORPORATION OF OUR SOLUTIONS INTO NEWLY LAUNCHED SPORTS CAMERA PRODUCTS FROM DAJIANG INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY INC., OR DJI, PARTIALLY OFFSET REVENUE LOSS FROM SALES OF OUR SOLUTIONS TO GOPRO, INC.

THE DECREASE IN COST OF REVENUE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SHIPMENTS OF SOCS FOR THE IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET.  GROSS MARGIN DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE THAT WAS DERIVED FROM THE LOWER GROSS MARGIN IP SECURITY CAMERA MARKET COMBINED WITH THE DECLINE IN REVENUE FROM THE HIGHER GROSS MARGIN SPORTS CAMERA AND DRONE MARKETS.

OUR ENGINEERING HEADCOUNT INCREASED TO 557 AT APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 540 AT APRIL 30, 2018, WHICH RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN S  ALARY-RELATED EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $0.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. THE INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.7 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS E  NDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS A RESULT OF ISSUANCE OF EQUITY FOR NEWLY HIRED EMPLOYEES AND OUR ANNUAL CASH BONUS AND EVERGREEN STOCK PROGRAMS FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES. THE SOC DEVELOPMENT COST WAS RELATIVELY FLAT FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPA  RED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO THE TIMING AND NUMBER OF CHIPS IN DEVELOPMENT.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LARGER INVESTED BALANCES, INTEREST RATE INCREASES AND DEBT SECURITIES PURCHASED AT DISCOUNTS. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION SUBSIDY GRANTED FROM A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE INCREASE IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF PROFITS GENERATED IN LOWER-TAX JURISDICTIONS AND LOSSES INCURRED IN JURISDICTIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY WAS NOT ABLE TO RECOGNIZE A RELATED TAX BENEFIT, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN NON-DEDUCTIBLE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 AND JANUARY 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $366.2 MILLION AND $358.9 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.  WE INVEST IN HIGHLY LIQUID, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AND HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, THESE SECURITIES HAD A FAIR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $206.8 MILLION WITH INSIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED LOSSES CAUSED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUE.  30  CASH FLOWS  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR CASH FLOWS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

THE INCREASED CASH FLOWS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASED NET LOSS ADJUSTED FOR INCREASED NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND DECREASED CASH RECEIPTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO APPROXIMATELY $26.6 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN DEBT SECURITIES. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $19.9 MILLION IN CASH RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE AND MATURITY OF DEBT SECURITIES.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, PRIMARILY DUE TO $20.6 MILLION OF CASH USED FOR THE REPURCHASING OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES UNDER THE STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018 THAT WAS NOT INCURRED DURING THE FISCAL QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. THE INCREASE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO APPROXIMATELY $1.3 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CASH PROCEEDS FROM OPTION EXERCISES AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE WITHHOLDING.  OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE REQUIREMENTS  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $366.2 MILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR EXISTING CASH BALANCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. IN THE FUTURE, WE EXPECT OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE AS WE INCREASE HEADCOUNT, EXPAND OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES, AND IMPLEMENT AND ENHANCE OUR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. AS WE EXPAND OUR OPERATIONS, WE MAY REQUIRE MORE WORKING CAPITAL. IF OUR AVAILABLE CASH BALANCES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR FUTURE LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, WE MAY SEEK TO SELL EQUITY OR CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES OR BORROW FUNDS COMMERCIALLY. THE SALE OF EQUITY AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES MAY RESULT IN DILUTION TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS, AND THOSE SECURITIES MAY HAVE RIGHTS SENIOR TO THOSE OF OUR ORDINARY SHARES. IF WE RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES, THESE SECURITIES COULD CONTAIN COVENANTS THAT WOULD RESTRICT OUR OPERATIONS. WE MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEYOND OUR CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED AMOUNTS. ADDITIONAL CAPITAL MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO US ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL.  OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS WILL DEPEND ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS;  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL OUR COSTS;  \u2022  THE EXPANSION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PRODUCTS TO ADDRESS NEW MARKETS AND APPLICATIONS;  \u2022  THE EMERGENCE OF COMPETING OR COMPLEMENTARY TECHNOLOGIES OR PRODUCTS;  \u2022  THE COSTS OF FILING, PROSECUTING, DEFENDING AND ENFORCING ANY PATENT CLAIMS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR PARTICIPATING IN LITIGATION-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND  \u2022  OUR ACQUISITION OF COMPLEMENTARY BUSINESSES, PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  31  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  MANUFACTURING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  AS OF APRIL 30, 2019, WE HAD PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OF $22.9 MILLION.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  WE WERE FOUNDED IN 1980 AND HAVE GROWN TO BECOME THE LARGEST  MANUFACTURER OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES (\u201cRVS\u201d) IN THE WORLD. WE ARE ALSO THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF RVS IN NORTH AMERICA, AND ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF RVS IN EUROPE. IN NORTH AMERICA, ACCORDING TO STATISTICAL SURVEYS, INC.  (\u201cSTAT SURVEYS\u201d), FOR THE CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THOR\u2019S COMBINED U.S. AND CANADIAN MARKET SHARE WAS APPROXIMATELY 46.4% FOR TRAVEL TRAILERS AND FIFTH WHEELS COMBINED AND APPROXIMATELY 35.5% FOR MOTORHOMES. IN  EUROPE, THOR\u2019S EUROPEAN MARKET SHARE FOR THE CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS APPROXIMATELY 22.5% FOR MOTORCARAVANS AND CAMPERVANS COMBINED AND APPROXIMATELY 21.5% FOR CARAVANS.  OUR BUSINESS MODEL INCLUDES DECENTRALIZED OPERATING UNITS, AND OUR RV PRODUCTS ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO INDEPENDENT,  NON-FRANCHISE  DEALERS WHO, IN TURN, RETAIL THOSE PRODUCTS. OUR GROWTH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BOTH ORGANICALLY AND THROUGH ACQUISITION, AND OUR STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE OUR PROFITABILITY BY DRIVING  INNOVATION, SERVICING OUR CUSTOMERS, MANUFACTURING QUALITY PRODUCTS, IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCIES OF OUR FACILITIES AND MAKING STRATEGIC GROWTH ACQUISITIONS.  RECENT EVENTS  ERWIN HYMER GROUP ACQUISITION  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY AND THE SHAREHOLDERS OF ERWIN HYMER GROUP SE (\u201cEHG\u2019) CLOSED ON A TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY  ACQUIRED EHG. EHG IS HEADQUARTERED IN BAD WALDSEE, GERMANY, AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST RV MANUFACTURERS IN EUROPE, BY REVENUE. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EHG IN ORDER TO EXPAND ITS OPERATIONS INTO THE GROWING EUROPEAN MARKET WITH A LONG-STANDING EUROPEAN  INDUSTRY LEADER.  23  AT THE CLOSING, THE COMPANY PAID CASH CONSIDERATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1.53 BILLION EURO  (APPROXIMATELY $1.76 BILLION AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019) AND ISSUED 2,256,492 SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK TO THE SELLERS VALUED AT $144.2 MILLION. THE CASH CONSIDERATION WAS FUNDED THROUGH A COMBINATION  OF AVAILABLE CASH ON HAND OF APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION AND DEBT FINANCING CONSISTING OF TWO CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS, A SEVEN-YEAR, $2.1 BILLION TERM LOAN, WITH AN APPROXIMATE $1.4 BILLION U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED TRANCHE AND AN  APPROXIMATE 0.6 BILLION EURO TRANCHE (APPROXIMATELY $0.7 BILLION AT THE EXCHANGE RATE AT FEBRUARY 1, 2019), AND $100 MILLION UTILIZED AT CLOSING FROM A FIVE-YEAR, $750.0 MILLION ASSET-BASED CREDIT FACILITY (ABL), EACH AS  MORE FULLY DESCRIBED IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY UNDER EACH FACILITY ARE SECURED BY LIENS ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY, AND BOTH AGREEMENTS CONTAIN CERTAIN  CUSTOMARY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.  CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019 RELATED TO THIS ACQUISITION, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS AND CERTAIN BANK FEES, TICKING FEES, LEGAL, ADVISORY AND OTHER COSTS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,  ARE INCLUDED IN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON JUNE 19, 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED COMPANY MANAGEMENT TO UTILIZE UP TO $250,000 TO PURCHASE  SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK THROUGH JUNE 19, 2020. THERE WERE NO REPURCHASES UNDER THIS PROGRAM DURING THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED APRIL 30, 2019.  TAX REFORM AND OTHER TAX MATTERS  ON DECEMBER 22, 2017, THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE  \u201cTAX ACT\u201d), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE TAX ACT INCLUDES NUMEROUS CHANGES TO TAX LAWS IMPACTING BUSINESS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BEING A PERMANENT REDUCTION IN THE FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE FROM 35.0% TO 21.0%. THE RATE REDUCTION TOOK  EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2018. AS A RESULT OF OTHER TAX ACT CHANGES, THE COMPANY\u2019S INCOME TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 WILL BE IMPACTED BY, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, THE REPEAL OF THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES (\u201cCODE  SECTION 199\u201d) DEDUCTION AND LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. THE TAX ACT ALSO INCLUDED SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE TAXATION OF FOREIGN INCOME WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION OF  EHG. THE GLOBAL INTANGIBLE LOW TAXED INCOME (GILTI) PROVISIONS MAY ALSO IMPACT THE COMPANY\u2019S EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE. UNDER GILTI, A PORTION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S FOREIGN EARNINGS WILL BE SUBJECT TO U.S. TAXATION, OFFSET BY AVAILABLE FOREIGN  TAX CREDITS SUBJECT TO LIMITATION. FOR FISCAL 2019, WE DO NOT FORECAST ANY U.S. TAXATION OF GILTI.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2019,  AFTER CONSIDERING THE LOWER FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 21.0%, AN ESTIMATED BLENDED STATE INCOME TAX RATE, THE ELIMINATION OF THE CODE SECTION 199 DEDUCTION, THE GILTI PROVISIONS AND THE LIMITATIONS ON THE DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE  COMPENSATION, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ESTIMATES AN OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BETWEEN 21% AND 23%, BEFORE CONSIDERATION OF ANY DISCRETE AND UNUSUAL TAX ITEMS.  INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\u2014NORTH AMERICA  THE COMPANY MONITORS INDUSTRY CONDITIONS IN THE  NORTH AMERICAN RV MARKET THROUGH THE USE OF MONTHLY WHOLESALE SHIPMENT DATA AS REPORTED BY THE RECREATION VEHICLE INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION (\u201cRVIA\u201d), WHICH IS TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  ONE-MONTH  LAG AND  REPRESENTS MANUFACTURERS\u2019 RV PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY TO DEALERS. IN ADDITION, WE MONITOR MONTHLY RETAIL SALES TRENDS AS REPORTED BY STAT SURVEYS, WHOSE DATA IS TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  MONTH-AND-A-HALF  LAG. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MONTHLY RV RETAIL SALES DATA IS IMPORTANT AS CONSUMER PURCHASES IMPACT FUTURE DEALER ORDERS AND ULTIMATELY OUR  PRODUCTION.  NORTH AMERICAN RV INDEPENDENT DEALER INVENTORY OF THOR PRODUCTS AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED 20.3% TO APPROXIMATELY  132,500 UNITS, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 166,200 UNITS AS OF APRIL 30, 2018. DURING THE REMAINDER OF OUR FISCAL 2019, WE EXPECT THE NORTH AMERICAN INDEPENDENT DEALER INVENTORY RATIONALIZATION WILL CONTINUE, BUT WE EXPECT TO SEE A RESUMPTION OF  GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKETS IN 2020.  THOR\u2019S NORTH AMERICAN RV BACKLOG AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED $593,422,  OR 29.6%, TO $1,409,727 COMPARED TO $2,003,149 AS OF APRIL 30, 2018, WITH THE DECREASE PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CAPACITY EXPANSIONS SINCE THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH ALLOWS FOR QUICKER ORDER FULFILLMENT.  24  INDUSTRY WHOLESALE STATISTICS  KEY WHOLESALE STATISTICS FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY, AS REPORTED BY RVIA FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, ARE AS FOLLOWS.  U.S. AND CANADA WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS  CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31,  INCREASE%  2019  2018  (DECREASE)  CHANGE  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLE UNITS  87,253  119,593  (32,340  )  (27.0  )  NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED UNITS  12,723  17,493  (4,770  )  (27.3  )  TOTAL  99,976  137,086  (37,110  )  (27.1  )  ACCORDING TO THEIR MOST RECENT FORECAST PUBLISHED IN MAY 2019, RVIA HAS FORECASTED THAT 2019 CALENDAR YEAR  SHIPMENTS FOR TOWABLES AND MOTORIZED UNITS WILL EASE BACK TO APPROXIMATELY 365,200 AND 51,100 UNITS, RESPECTIVELY, FOR A TOTAL OF 416,300 UNITS, A DECLINE OF 13.9% FROM THE 2018 CALENDAR YEAR SHIPMENTS. RVIA NOTED THAT EXCEPT FOR THE PAST THREE  CALENDAR YEARS, TOTAL RV SHIPMENTS FOR 2019 ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER THAN IN ANY PRIOR YEAR SINCE 1973.  INDUSTRY RETAIL STATISTICS  WE BELIEVE THAT RETAIL DEMAND IS THE KEY TO CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY, AND THAT ANNUAL NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY WHOLESALE  SHIPMENTS WILL GENERALLY APPROXIMATE A  ONE-TO-ONE  REPLENISHMENT RATIO WITH RETAIL SALES AS DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS ARE ADJUSTED TO GENERALLY NORMALIZED LEVELS.  KEY RETAIL STATISTICS FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY, AS REPORTED BY STAT SURVEYS FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

COMPANY  WHOLESALE STATISTICS  THE COMPANY\u2019S WHOLESALE RV SHIPMENTS, FOR THE CALENDAR QUARTERS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018 TO  CORRESPOND TO THE INDUSTRY WHOLESALE PERIODS NOTED ABOVE, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

U.S. AND CANADA RETAIL UNIT REGISTRATIONS  CALENDAR QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31,  INCREASE%  2019  2018  (DECREASE)  CHANGE  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLE UNITS  34,902  39,126  (4,224  )  (10.8  )  NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED UNITS  3,730  5,245  (1,515  )  (28.9  )  TOTAL  38,632  44,371  (5,739  )  (12.9  )  NOTE: DATA REPORTED BY STAT SURVEYS IS BASED ON OFFICIAL STATE AND PROVINCIAL RECORDS. THIS INFORMATION IS  SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT AND IS CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED, AND IS OFTEN IMPACTED BY DELAYS IN REPORTING BY VARIOUS STATES OR PROVINCES.  25  OUR OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL SALES IS DEPENDENT UPON VARIOUS ECONOMIC  CONDITIONS FACED BY CONSUMERS SUCH AS THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, THE GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE INCOME OF CONSUMERS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, CREDIT AVAILABILITY, THE HEALTH OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND CHANGES IN TAX RATES  AND FUEL PRICES. ASSUMING CONTINUED STABILITY OR IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AVAILABILITY OF RETAIL AND WHOLESALE CREDIT, LOW INTEREST RATES WITH MODEST RATE INCREASES AND THE ABSENCE OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC FACTORS, WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE  LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE NORTH AMERICAN RV INDUSTRY.  A POSITIVE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE NORTH AMERICAN RV SEGMENT IS SUPPORTED BY  CONTINUED DEMOGRAPHIC DIVERSIFICATION. WHILE CONSUMERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 74 STILL ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJORITY OF RV RETAIL SALES, THERE IS STRONG INTEREST AND GROWING RETAIL MOMENTUM WITH THE YOUNGER \u201cGENERATION X\u201d AND  \u201cMILLENNIALS\u201d SEGMENTS. NOT SURPRISINGLY, BEHAVIORAL ATTRIBUTES CONFIRM THESE GROUPS AS BEING MORE ACTIVE, TECH SAVVY, WELL RESEARCHED, OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, SEEKING NEW EXPERIENCES AND VERY FAMILY CENTRIC, SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT COMES TO  CROSS-GENERATIONAL FAMILY ACTIVITIES LIKE RVING, CAMPING AND TIME SPENT OUTDOORS.  SINCE 2014, KAMPGROUNDS OF AMERICA (KOA) HAS MEASURED  AN INCREASE OF MORE THAN 7 MILLION NEW CAMPER HOUSEHOLDS AND IN 2018 KOA PROJECTED A 45% RISE IN THE FREQUENCY OF CAMPING TRIPS AMONG ALL CAMPING FAMILIES; LARGELY DRIVEN BY MILLENNIALS, WITH 6 IN 10 HAVING TRIED A NEW CAMPING DESTINATION IN  2017. YOUNGER CONSUMERS ARE ALSO REDEFINING CULTURAL VIEWS ON \u201cVACATION\u201d AND OPTING INSTEAD FOR 50 TO 100 MILE GETAWAYS WITHIN DRIVING DISTANCE TO HOME OR SCHOOL. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE YOUNGER CONSUMERS AND MILLENNIAL HOUSEHOLDS PLACE ON  FAMILY, QUALITY EXPERIENCES, TECHNOLOGY AND TIME, WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO PROVIDE THE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT OFFERINGS WHICH DELIVER THE LIFESTYLE EXPERIENCES THAT COMPLEMENT MILLENNIAL EXPECTATIONS.  IN ADDITION TO YOUNGER AGE DEMOGRAPHICS, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND SALES TO A MORE ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AND GLOBAL CUSTOMER BASE THROUGH  LIFESTYLE, LIFESTAGE AND DATA-DRIVEN MARKETING. WE INTEND TO EXPAND UPON OUR RECENT MARKETING INITIATIVES THAT FOCUS ON DIVERSITY, WOMEN, FAMILIES, MILLENNIALS AND THE RV LIFESTYLE ACROSS SOCIAL, DIGITAL, WEB, ACQUISITION, MOBILE AND CONTENT  MARKETING. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING  BEST-IN-CLASS  MARKETING AND RESEARCH ASSETS TO OUR DEALERS, WE ARE COMMITTED TO PROVIDING OUR END CONSUMERS WITH TECHNOLOGY TOOLS AND  RV LIFESTYLE RESOURCES THROUGH OUR JOINT VENTURE, TH2.  ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS AFFECTING OUR RV BUSINESS INCLUDE THE COSTS OF  COMMODITIES, THE IMPACT OF ACTUAL OR THREATENED TARIFFS ON COMMODITY COSTS, AND THE LABOR USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD, AND ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN  RAW MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS WOULD IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OFFSET THOSE COST INCREASES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCT DECONTENTING, MATERIAL SOURCING STRATEGIES, EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OR RAISING THE SELLING  PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO OFFSET NET COST INCREASES OVER TIME.  WE  HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SIGNIFICANT UNUSUAL SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN CHASSIS SUPPLIERS RECENTLY. THE NORTH AMERICAN RECREATIONAL VEHICLE INDUSTRY HAS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SHORTAGES OF CHASSIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS,  INCLUDING COMPONENT SHORTAGES, PRODUCTION DELAYS AND WORK STOPPAGES AT THE CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS. THESE SHORTAGES HAVE HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR SALES AND EARNINGS IN THE PAST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF CHASSIS USED IN OUR NORTH  AMERICAN MOTORIZED RV PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY ADEQUATE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTION LEVELS, AND THAT AVAILABLE INVENTORY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN SUPPLY SCHEDULES IF THEY OCCUR.  INDUSTRY OUTLOOK\u2014EUROPE  THE COMPANY MONITORS RETAIL TRENDS IN THE EUROPEAN RV  MARKET AS REPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN CARAVAN FEDERATION (\u201cECF\u201d), WHOSE INDUSTRY DATA IS REPORTED TO THE PUBLIC QUARTERLY AND TYPICALLY ISSUED ON A  ONE-TO-TWO  MONTH LAG. ADDITIONALLY, ON A MONTHLY BASIS THE COMPANY RECEIVES ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (\u201cOEM\u201d) SPECIFIC REPORTS FROM MOST OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBER COUNTRIES THAT MAKE UP THE ECF. AS THESE REPORTS ARE COMING DIRECTLY FROM THE ECF  MEMBER COUNTRIES, TIMING AND CONTENT MAY VARY, BUT TYPICALLY THE REPORTS ARE ISSUED ON A  ONE-TO-TWO  MONTH LAG AS WELL. WHILE MOST COUNTRIES PROVIDE  OEM-SPECIFIC  INFORMATION, THE UNITED KINGDOM, WHICH MAKES UP 29.6% AND 12.6% OF THE CARAVAN AND MOTORCARAVAN (INCLUDING CAMPERVANS) EUROPEAN MARKET, RESPECTIVELY, DOES NOT PROVIDE  OEM-SPECIFIC  INFORMATION. INDUSTRY WHOLESALE SHIPMENT DATA FOR THE EUROPEAN RV MARKET IS NOT AVAILABLE.  THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS EUROPEAN REPORTABLE SEGMENT SALES BASED ON THE FOLLOWING PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  MOTORCARAVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE CLASS A AND CLASS C MOTORIZED PRODUCTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET  CAMPERVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE CLASS B MOTORIZED PRODUCTS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET, BUT ALSO INCLUDES URBAN CAMPERS  CARAVAN \u2014  SIMILAR TO THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND OTHER TOWABLE UNITS IN THE NORTH AMERICAN MARKET.

NOTE: FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES, THE TOTALS REFLECTED ABOVE INCLUDE THE  PRE-ACQUISITION  RESULTS OF EHG FOR JANUARY 2019 (AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018).  IN ADDITION, DATA FROM THE ECF IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENTS AND IS CONTINUOUSLY UPDATED, AND IS OFTEN IMPACTED BY DELAYS IN REPORTING BY VARIOUS COUNTRIES.  THE EUROPEAN OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH IN RETAIL SALES DEPENDS UPON VARIOUS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.  END-CUSTOMER  DEMAND FOR RV VEHICLES DEPENDS  STRONGLY ON CONSUMER CONFIDENCE. FACTORS SUCH AS THE RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT, PRIVATE CONSUMPTION AND INVESTMENTS, GROWTH IN DISPOSABLE INCOME OF CONSUMERS, CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, THE HEALTH OF THE HOUSING MARKET AND CHANGES IN TAX RATES INFLUENCE  RETAIL SALES. ASSUMING CONTINUED STABILITY OR IMPROVEMENT IN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, LOW INTEREST RATES WITH MODEST RATE INCREASES AND THE ABSENCE OF NEGATIVE ECONOMIC FACTORS, WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUED LONG-TERM GROWTH IN THE EUROPEAN RV  INDUSTRY.  SEVERAL SOCIAL TRENDS SUPPORT THE POSITIVE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR EUROPE. FIRST, THERE IS THE GROWING GROUP OF \u201cACTIVE  SENIORS\u201d (AGE 55 TO 75) WHO HAVE THE TIME, HEALTH AND WEALTH, COMBINED WITH THE DESIRE, TO EXPLORE COUNTRIES AND CULTURES. SECONDLY, THERE IS THE NEW, BUT GROWING, GROUP OF YOUNGER CUSTOMERS (AGE 35\u201445) WHO ARE DISCOVERING RVS AS A WAY TO  SUPPORT THEIR LIFESTYLE IN SEARCH OF INDEPENDENCE AND INDIVIDUALITY, AS WELL AS USING THE RV AS MULTI-PURPOSE VEHICLES TO ESCAPE URBAN LIFE AND EXPLORE OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND NATURE.  OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS ADDRESS THE EUROPEAN MARKET WITH A FULL  LINE-UP  OF LEISURE VEHICLES INCLUDING SMALL  TOWABLE TENT TRAILERS AND TRAVEL TRAILERS, URBAN CAMPERS, CAMPERVANS AND  SMALL-TO-LARGE  MOTORHOMES. THE PRODUCT OFFERING IS NOT LIMITED TO VEHICLES ONLY, BUT ALSO  INCLUDES ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES INCLUDING RENTAL.  27  IN ADDITION TO ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS, EHG ADDRESSES ITS CONSUMERS THROUGH A SOPHISTICATED BRAND  MANAGEMENT APPROACH, BASED ON CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION ACCORDING TO TARGET GROUP, CORE VALUES AND EMOTIONS. WITH THE HELP OF DATA-BASED AND DIGITAL MARKETING, EHG INTENDS TO EXPAND ITS CUSTOMER REACH, IN PARTICULAR IN NEW AND YOUNGER CONSUMER SEGMENTS.  ECONOMIC OR INDUSTRY-WIDE FACTORS AFFECTING OUR EUROPEAN RV BUSINESS INCLUDE THE COSTS OF COMMODITIES AND THE LABOR USED IN THE  MANUFACTURE OF OUR PRODUCTS. MATERIAL AND LABOR COSTS ARE THE PRIMARY FACTORS DETERMINING OUR COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN RAW MATERIAL OR LABOR COSTS WOULD IMPACT OUR PROFIT MARGINS NEGATIVELY IF WE WERE UNABLE TO OFFSET THOSE  COST INCREASES THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCT DECONTENTING, MATERIAL SOURCING STRATEGIES, EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS OR RAISING THE SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS BY CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS.  WE BELIEVE THE OUTLOOK FOR FUTURE GROWTH OF THE EUROPEAN ECONOMY AND PRIVATE CONSUMPTION IN GENERAL IS POSITIVE, WITH DIFFERENCES FOR EACH COUNTRY,  BUT COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY INCREASING GLOBAL TRADE BARRIERS AND RELATED TAX TARIFFS, AS WELL AS BY EUROPEAN POLITICAL DECISIONS LIKE BREXIT, OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW EMISSION STANDARDS.  IN OUR EUROPEAN MARKET, EHG HAS NOT EXPERIENCED ANY SIGNIFICANT, UNUSUAL SUPPLY CONSTRAINTS FROM CHASSIS SUPPLIERS RECENTLY. THE EUROPEAN  RECREATIONAL VEHICLE INDUSTRY HAS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCED SHORTAGES OF CHASSIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS, INCLUDING INTRODUCTION OF NEW REGULATORY STANDARDS, COMPONENT SHORTAGES AND PRODUCTION DELAYS AT THE CHASSIS MANUFACTURERS. WE BELIEVE THAT  THE CURRENT SUPPLY OF CHASSIS USED IN THE EUROPEAN MOTORIZED RV PRODUCTION IS GENERALLY ADEQUATE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTION LEVELS, AND THAT AVAILABLE INVENTORY WOULD COMPENSATE FOR SHORT-TERM CHANGES IN SUPPLY SCHEDULES IF THEY OCCUR. HOWEVER,  UNCERTAINTIES RELATED TO CHANGING EMISSION STANDARDS, SUCH AS THE EURO 6D STANDARD WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE FROM JANUARY 2020 FOR NEW MODELS AND FROM JANUARY 2021 ON ALL NEW VEHICLES, MAY IMPACT THE AVAILABILITY OF CHASSIS USED IN OUR PRODUCTION OF  CERTAIN EUROPEAN MOTORIZED RVS AND COULD ALSO IMPACT CONSUMER BUYING PATTERNS.  28  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2019  THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018  CHANGE  AMOUNT%  CHANGE  NET SALES.

THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EHG\u2019S NET SALES OF  $767,509, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET SALES FROM NORTH AMERICA OF $510,180, OR 23.1%, COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 INCREASED $11,377 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF $12,784 DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEALER NETWORK AMORTIZATION AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS TOTALED $13,363 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $41,523, AS COMPARED TO $180,525 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, A DECREASE OF $139,002, OR 77.0%.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE CHANGES IN NET SALES, GROSS PROFIT, SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS  AND INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES ARE ADDRESSED BELOW AND IN THE SEGMENT REPORTING THAT FOLLOWS.  CORPORATE COSTS INCLUDED IN SELLING,  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $7,531 TO $19,898 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $12,367 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, AN INCREASE OF 60.9%. THIS INCREASE INCLUDES AN INCREASE IN DEFERRED  COMPENSATION EXPENSE OF $4,909, WHICH RELATES TO THE EQUAL AND OFFSETTING INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME RELATED TO THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN ASSETS AS NOTED BELOW. LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND MARKETING COSTS ALSO INCREASED BY $1,674. COSTS RELATED TO  THE WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION AND PRODUCT LIABILITY RESERVES CARRIED AT CORPORATE ALSO INCREASED $669. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $1,183 IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION IN CORRELATION WITH THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME  TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WERE $13,363 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND CONSIST OF  COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG. THIS TOTAL INCLUDES COSTS OF $16,293, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF BANK FEES, PROFESSIONAL AND ADVISORY INTEGRATION FEES, AND THE  WRITE-OFF  OF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT  FEES OF $3,794 RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS ASSET-BASED FACILITY THAT WAS TERMINATED ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NEW FINANCING OBTAINED WITH THE EHG ACQUISITION. THESE COSTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN OF $2,930  FROM THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  CORPORATE INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE WAS $31,037 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $2,741 OF NET EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THIS  INCREASE IN NET EXPENSE OF $28,296 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND FEES OF $30,910 RESULTING FROM THE NEW DEBT FACILITIES RELATED TO THE EHG ACQUISITION, AND ALSO AN INCREASE OF $1,886 IN THE OPERATING LOSSES RECORDED RELATED  TO THE TH2 JOINT VENTURE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN ASSETS DUE TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME RESULTING IN NET INCOME OF $3,362 IN THE  CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD AS COMPARED TO NET EXPENSE OF $1,547 IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD, A NET INCREASE IN INCOME OF $4,909.  THE OVERALL  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS 24.3% COMPARED WITH 25.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY  CERTAIN FOREIGN RATE DIFFERENCES AS A RESULT OF THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES FOR BOTH THREE-MONTH PERIODS WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE INCOME TAX RATE ALONG WITH THE OTHER TAX IMPACTS AS A  RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT. THE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT, AS NOTED IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, RESULTED IN A GAIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 UPON CLOSING OF THE  EHG ACQUISITION.

ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY RVIA, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019,  COMBINED TRAVEL TRAILER AND FIFTH WHEEL WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS DECREASED 18.7% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY STAT SURVEYS, FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, OUR MARKET  SHARE FOR TRAVEL TRAILERS AND FIFTH WHEELS COMBINED WAS 46.4% AND 47.8%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASES IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE TRAVEL TRAILER AND OTHER PRODUCT LINES OF 4.8% AND THE FIFTH WHEEL PRODUCT  LINES OF 6.8% WERE BOTH PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER.  COST OF  PRODUCTS SOLD DECREASED $311,772 TO $1,057,643, OR 85.5% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $1,369,415 OR 85.2% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018. THE CHANGES IN MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS COMPRISED $303,830 OF THE $311,772 DECREASE IN COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD. MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS AS A COMBINED PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES DECREASED TO 79.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 79.7% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF SLIGHT IMPROVEMENTS IN EACH OF THESE COSTS CATEGORIES. THE SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT IN THE MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE, IN SPITE OF INCREASED SALES DISCOUNTS, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES AND  FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $7,942 WITH THE DECREASE IN SALES, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES FROM 5.5% TO 6.5%, AS THE DECREASED SALES RESULTED IN  HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $59,187 TO $179,612, OR 14.5% OF NORTH AMERICAN  TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $238,799, OR 14.8% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 29.1%  DECREASE IN UNIT SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, WHILE THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PERCENTAGE IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE.  31  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $66,032, OR 5.3% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET  SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $79,598, OR 4.9% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE $13,566 DECREASE WAS DECREASED NORTH AMERICAN  TOWABLES NET SALES AND NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $13,546. SALES-RELATED TRAVEL, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTIONAL COSTS ALSO DECREASED $1,029. THESE  DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $1,733 IN LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND RELATED SETTLEMENT COSTS. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES IS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE INCREASED LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND SETTLEMENT COSTS NOTED ABOVE COMBINED WITH THE LOWER SALES VOLUME.  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $103,715, OR 8.4% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $147,853 OR 9.2% OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY RVIA, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30,  2019, COMBINED MOTORHOME WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS DECREASED 24.7% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY STAT SURVEYS, FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, OUR MARKET SHARE FOR  MOTORHOMES WAS 35.5% AND 40.2%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS A PRODUCT LINE OF 6.8% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE CONCENTRATION OF  SALES TOWARD THE GENERALLY LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE DIESEL UNITS FROM THE MORE MODESTLY-PRICED GAS UNITS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS C PRODUCT LINE OF 5.2% WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE NET IMPACT OF PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS B PRODUCT LINE OF 4.1% IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRODUCT MIX AS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW,  HIGHER-PRICED MODEL AND MORE OPTION CONTENT PER UNIT IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD.  32  COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD DECREASED $121,849 TO $411,775, OR 89.7% OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET  SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $533,624, OR 89.2% OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE CHANGES IN MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS COMPRISED $120,551 OF THE $121,849 DECREASE DUE TO THE DECREASED SALES VOLUME. MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS AS A  COMBINED PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES DECREASED SLIGHTLY TO 84.9% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 85.3% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018, WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER LABOR  COST PERCENTAGE. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $1,298 WITH THE VOLUME DECREASE, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF MOTORIZED NET SALES FROM 3.9% TO 4.8%, AS THE DECREASE IN SALES RESULTED IN HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.

THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE 27.9% DECREASE IN UNIT SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, AND THE  DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE AND THE LOWER NET SALES.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $21,010, OR 4.6% OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $24,811, OR 4.1% OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET  SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE $3,801 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES AND NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER  COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $4,516. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND RELATED SETTLEMENT COSTS OF $1,041.  NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $25,185, OR 5.5% OF NORTH AMERICAN MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $38,908, OR 6.5% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES,  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

THIS DECREASE INCLUDES A DECREASE IN INCENTIVE  COMPENSATION OF $5,638 IN CORRELATION WITH THE DECREASE IN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. IN ADDITION, COSTS RECORDED AT CORPORATE RELATED TO OUR STANDBY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ON DEALER INVENTORY DECREASED $3,050 DUE  TO LOWER DEALER INVENTORY LEVELS.  ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS WERE $112,511 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND INCLUDE  COSTS RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF EHG AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THESE CORPORATE COSTS INCLUDED A  NON-CASH  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS OF $70,777,  WITH THE REMAINING $41,734 CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF BANK FEES, TICKING FEES, LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND ADVISORY FEES RELATED TO FINANCIAL DUE DILIGENCE AND IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, REGULATORY REVIEW COSTS AND THE  WRITE-OFF  OF THE REMAINING UNAMORTIZED DEBT FEES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUS ASSET-BASED FACILITY.

THIS INCREASE  IN NET EXPENSE OF $34,038 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND FEES OF $29,895 RESULTING FROM THE NEW DEBT FACILITIES RELATED TO THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 ALSO INCLUDES NINE MONTHS OF  OPERATING LOSSES TOTALING $5,984 RELATED TO THE TH2 JOINT VENTURE AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS COMPARED TO A LOSS OF $399 FOR THE ONE MONTH INCLUDED IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE ACQUISITION DATE,  AN INCREASE OF $5,585. THESE INCREASES IN EXPENSE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INTEREST INCOME OF $2,705 ON AVERAGE HIGHER CASH BALANCES AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS 46.6% COMPARED WITH 32.8% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED  APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE BETWEEN THE COMPARABLE PERIODS IS THE  NON-DEDUCTIBLE  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACT LOSS NOTED IN NOTE 5 TO  THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE THREE MONTHS OF EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE EHG ACQUISITION. THE INCOME TAX RATES FOR BOTH NINE-MONTH PERIODS WERE IMPACTED BY THE REDUCTION IN THE U.S. FEDERAL CORPORATE  INCOME TAX RATE ALONG WITH THE OTHER TAX IMPACTS AS A RESULT OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT ON DECEMBER 22, 2017. THE TAX RATE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018 INCLUDED ADDITIONAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM  THE REVALUATION OF THE COMPANY\u2019S NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE LOWER TAX RATES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT.  35  SEGMENT REPORTING  NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLE RECREATIONAL VEHICLES  ANALYSIS OF THE CHANGE IN NET SALES FOR  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018.

THIS INCREASE IN PERCENTAGE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN THE MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE TO NET SALES, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN DISCOUNTS AND SALES INCENTIVES, WHICH EFFECTIVELY DECREASES THE NET SALES PRICE  PER UNIT AND THEREFORE INCREASES THE UNIT MATERIAL COST PERCENTAGE. IN ADDITION, MATERIAL COST INCREASES EXCEEDED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES SINCE THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE WARRANTY COST PERCENTAGE TO NET SALES ALSO  INCREASED. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $28,955 WITH THE DECREASE IN SALES, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES NET SALES FROM 5.6% TO 6.7%, AS THE DECREASED SALES RESULTED IN HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.

THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE $49,178 DECREASE WAS DECREASED NORTH AMERICAN  TOWABLES NET SALES AND NORTH AMERICAN TOWABLES INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $49,698. SALES-RELATED TRAVEL, ADVERTISING AND PROMOTION COSTS ALSO DECREASED $4,167, WHILE  LEGAL, PROFESSIONAL AND RELATED SETTLEMENT COSTS INCREASED $5,508.

ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY RVIA, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, COMBINED  MOTORHOME WHOLESALE UNIT SHIPMENTS DECREASED 23.0% COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO STATISTICS PUBLISHED BY STAT SURVEYS, FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, OUR MARKET SHARE FOR MOTORHOMES WAS 37.7% AND  39.0%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARISONS OF COMPANY SHIPMENTS TO INDUSTRY SHIPMENTS ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS EXPECTED FOR A FULL FISCAL YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS A PRODUCT LINE OF 10.5% WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN THE CONCENTRATION OF  SALES TOWARD THE GENERALLY LARGER AND MORE EXPENSIVE DIESEL UNITS FROM THE MORE MODESTLY-PRICED GAS UNITS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS C PRODUCT LINE OF 4.8% WAS PRIMARILY  DUE TO THE NET IMPACT OF PRODUCT MIX CHANGES AND SELECTIVE NET PRICE INCREASES. THE INCREASE IN THE OVERALL NET PRICE PER UNIT WITHIN THE CLASS B PRODUCT LINE OF 4.5% IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW, HIGHER-PRICED MODEL AND MORE  OPTION CONTENT PER UNIT IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD.  37  COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD DECREASED $399,324 TO $1,133,956, OR 89.9% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $1,533,280, OR 88.9% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE CHANGES IN MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS  COMPRISED $392,591 OF THE $399,324 DECREASE DUE TO THE DECREASED SALES VOLUME. MATERIAL, LABOR,  FREIGHT-OUT  AND WARRANTY COSTS AS A COMBINED PERCENTAGE OF MOTORIZED NET SALES WAS 85.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO 84.9% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. TOTAL MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD DECREASED $6,733 WITH THE VOLUME DECREASE, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF MOTORIZED NET SALES FROM 4.0% TO 4.9%, AS THE  DECREASE IN SALES RESULTED IN HIGHER OVERHEAD COSTS PER UNIT SOLD.  MOTORIZED GROSS PROFIT DECREASED $63,724 TO $127,975, OR 10.1% OF  MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $191,699, OR 11.1% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE 34.3% DECREASE IN UNIT  SALES VOLUME NOTED ABOVE, AND THE DECREASE AS A PERCENTAGE OF MOTORIZED NET SALES IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD PERCENTAGE NOTED ABOVE.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE $60,070, OR 4.8% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $75,828, OR 4.4% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS  ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE $15,758 DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED MOTORIZED NET SALES AND MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES, WHICH CAUSED RELATED COMMISSIONS, BONUSES AND OTHER COMPENSATION TO DECREASE BY $15,186.  MOTORIZED INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $64,102, OR 5.1% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO  $114,032, OR 6.6% OF MOTORIZED NET SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS DECREASE IN PERCENTAGE WERE THE INCREASES IN BOTH THE COST OF PRODUCTS SOLD AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  PERCENTAGES NOTED ABOVE.

THEREFORE, STORES OPENED OR CLOSED DURING THE PERIODS INDICATED ARE NOT INCLUDED IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES. WE INCLUDE E-COMMERCE SALES IN OUR COMPARABLE STORE SALES. DUE TO OUR MULTI-CHANNEL RETAILER STRATEGY, WE VIEW E-COMMERCE SALES AS AN EXTENSION OF OUR PHYSICAL STORES.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES FOR THE PERIODS INDICATED.

IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND SIZE OF TAX REFUNDS CAN ALSO IMPACT OUR RATE OF SALES GROWTH IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.  THIS SPRING, WE EXPERIENCED A COLD AND WET START TO THE FIRST QUARTER.  THIS UNSEASONABLE WEATHER, ALONG WITH A DELAY IN TAX REFUNDS, RESULTED IN A HIGH SINGLE-DIGIT COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASE IN FEBRUARY.  AS THE WEATHER BECAME MORE SEASONABLE LATER IN THE QUARTER AND AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVED THEIR TAX REFUNDS, OUR CUSTOMERS REACTED POSITIVELY TO OUR SPRING ASSORTMENT, AND WE POSTED A COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASE OF 3.6% FOR THE COMBINED MONTHS OF MARCH AND APRIL.  FOR THE THIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARABLE STORE SALES DECREASED 0.2%.  OUR MERCHANTS EFFECTIVELY CONTROLLED SEASONAL INVENTORY DURING THE QUARTER, WHICH ALLOWED US TO KEEP MERCHANDISE MARGINS RELATIVELY FLAT DESPITE BEING MORE AGGRESSIVE IN ATHLETICS DURING THE QUARTER DUE TO THE SLOW START IN FEBRUARY.  HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF SOME KEY INITIATIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS.  \u2022  NET SALES DECREASED $3.6 MILLION, OR 1.4%, FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 5, 2018.  WE EXPERIENCED A MID-SINGLE DIGIT DECLINE IN STORE TRAFFIC AND DECREASES IN AVERAGE SALES PER TRANSACTION AND AVERAGE UNIT RETAIL DURING THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019. WE DID, HOWEVER, EXPERIENCE LOW-SINGLE DIGIT INCREASES IN OUR CONVERSION RATE AND AVERAGE UNITS PER TRANSACTION DURING THE QUARTER.  \u2022  GROSS PROFIT MARGIN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER DECREASED 0.4% TO 29.6% COMPARED TO 30.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  WHILE OUR MERCHANDISE MARGIN INCREASED 0.1%, OUR BUYING, DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED 0.5% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  16  \u2022  WE REPURCHASED  411,168  SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE  FIRST  QUARTER  OF FISCAL 2019  AT A TOTAL COST OF $14  .0 MILLION UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND ENDED THE QUARTER WITH $21.6  MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVA  LENTS. WE ENDED THE QUARTER WITH NO  OUTSTANDING  DEBT.  \u2022  WE HAD NO STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSED TWO STORES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, ENDING THE QUARTER WITH 395 STORES.  \u2022  WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN OUR CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT (\u201cCRM\u201d) PROGRAM AND EXPECT OUR INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION OF CRM TO BE COMPLETE BY THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.  WE BELIEVE THAT OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH TO CRM WILL BE A SALES DRIVER AND THAT THE DATA RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF OUR CRM PROGRAM WILL ALLOW US TO BETTER MERCHANDISE OUR STORES, MARKET TO SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS AND AID IN IDENTIFYING NEW STORE OPPORTUNITIES.  \u2022  WE ALSO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE KEY PROCESSES UNDERLYING OUR SUPPLY CHAIN, ORDER MANAGEMENT AND FULFILLMENT COMPETENCIES IN ORDER TO POSITION OURSELVES FOR OUR PLANNED GROWTH OVER THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS.  WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPROVING THESE PROCESSES THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN SOFTWARE AND ANALYTICAL TOOLS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019  NET SALES  NET SALES DECREASED $3.6 MILLION TO $253.8 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, A 1.4% DECREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR\u2019S FIRST QUARTER NET SALES OF $257.4 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $3.9 MILLION FROM THE 16 STORES CLOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018 AND A $639,000 DECREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $883,000 INCREASE IN SALES FROM THE THREE NEW STORES OPENED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT DECREASED TO $75.1 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO GROSS PROFIT OF $77.3 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN NET SALES AND AN INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY COSTS.  OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN DECREASED TO 29.6% COMPARED TO 30.0% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  WHILE OUR MERCHANDISE MARGIN INCREASED 0.1%, OUR BUYING, DISTRIBUTION AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES INCREASED 0.5% AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OCCUPANCY EXPENSE FOR THE QUARTER RESULTING FROM HIGHER PROPERTY TAXES AND COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE PASSED THROUGH FROM LANDLORDS AND THE DELEVERAGING EFFECT OF LOWER SALES IN THE QUARTER.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $0.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 TO $59.5 MILLION COMPARED TO $60.0 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, THESE EXPENSES INCREASED TO 23.4% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FROM 23.3% IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  THE OVERALL DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $1.0 MILLION REDUCTION IN EXPENSE FOR STORES THAT HAVE CLOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2018 AND DECREASES IN INCENTIVE COMPENSATION AND DEPRECIATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN EARNINGS ON OUR RETIREMENT SAVINGS PLAN AND WAGES.  THERE WERE NO PREOPENING EXPENSES RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OR THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THERE WERE NO STORE OPENINGS IN EITHER PERIOD.  NET STORE CLOSING COSTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 OR DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  TWO STORES WERE CLOSED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THREE STORES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS 12.8% AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2018.  THE REDUCTION IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE QUARTER WAS THE RESULT OF A $1.9 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THE VESTING OF EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX EXPENSE IS BASED ON THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF OUR ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AND IS ADJUSTED AS NECESSARY FOR QUARTERLY EVENTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ON HAND, CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABILITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY. WE BELIEVE THESE RESOURCES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR CASH NEEDS, AS THEY ARISE, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. OUR PRIMARY USES OF CASH ARE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, WHICH ARE PRINCIPALLY INVENTORY PURCHASES, STORE INITIATIVES, POTENTIAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, POTENTIAL SHARE REPURCHASES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE FINANCING OF CAPITAL PROJECTS, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN NEW SYSTEMS, AND VARIOUS OTHER COMMITMENTS AND OBLIGATIONS.  17  CASH FLOW - OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OUR NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $9.3 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $8.5 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THESE AMOUNTS REFLECT OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS AND WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE CHANGES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO THE QUARTER ENDED MAY 5, 2018 DUE TO THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS.  WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED TO $201.6 MILLION AT MAY 4, 2019 FROM $260.8 MILLION AT MAY 5, 2018, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $13.7 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND $47.1 MILLION RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 FOR THE CURRENT PORTION OF OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES. THE CURRENT RATIO WAS 2.7 AS OF MAY 4, 2019 COMPARED TO 4.0 AT MAY 5, 2018.  CASH FLOW - INVESTING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE EXPENDED $9.2 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $7.0 MILLION WAS FOR THE PURCHASE OF OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS AND THE REMAINDER WAS FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE EXPENDED $1.0 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOW - FINANCING ACTIVITIES  OUR CASH OUTFLOWS FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES WERE PRIMARILY FOR CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK CAN BE EITHER ACQUIRED AS PART OF A PUBLICLY ANNOUNCED REPURCHASE PROGRAM OR WITHHELD BY US IN CONNECTION WITH EMPLOYEE PAYROLL TAX WITHHOLDING UPON THE VESTING OF EQUITY AWARDS. OUR CASH INFLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY REPRESENT PURCHASES UNDER OUR EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $26.9 MILLION COMPARED TO $20.4 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018. THE INCREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $10.7 MILLION INCREASE FOR SHARES WITHHELD UPON THE VESTING OF EQUITY AWARDS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $5.0 MILLION DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING ACTUAL EXPENDITURES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $20 MILLION AND $22 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION TO BE USED FOR A NEW STORE, RELOCATIONS AND REMODELS, AND $7 MILLION OF WHICH WAS USED TO PURCHASE OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  THE REMAINING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED FOR CONTINUED INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND NORMAL ASSET REPLACEMENT ACTIVITIES.  LEASE INCENTIVES TO BE RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS DURING FISCAL 2019, INCLUDING ACTUAL AMOUNTS RECEIVED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER, ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION TO $2 MILLION.  THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CASH REQUIRED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR STORE OPERATIONS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE NUMBER OF NEW STORES OPENED AND RELOCATED, THE AMOUNT OF LEASE INCENTIVES, IF ANY, RECEIVED FROM LANDLORDS AND THE NUMBER OF STORES REMODELED.  STORE OPENINGS AND CLOSINGS  INCREASING MARKET PENETRATION BY OPENING NEW STORES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A KEY COMPONENT OF OUR GROWTH STRATEGY, AND OUR FOCUS CONTINUES TO BE ON GENERATING POSITIVE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR OUR STORE PORTFOLIO.  WE CURRENTLY EXPECT TO OPEN ONE NEW STORE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019.  AS WE LEVERAGE CUSTOMER DATA FROM OUR CRM PROGRAM, AND AS MORE ATTRACTIVE REAL ESTATE OPPORTUNITIES BECOME AVAILABLE, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BRICK-AND-MORTAR STORE GROWTH ACROSS LARGE, MID-SIZE AND SMALLER MARKETS IN FISCAL 2020.  THE OPENING OF NEW STORES IS DEPENDENT UPON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE AVAILABILITY OF DESIRABLE LOCATIONS, THE NEGOTIATION OF ACCEPTABLE LEASE TERMS AND GENERAL ECONOMIC AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING IN AREAS WE TARGET FOR EXPANSION.  WE UTILIZE A FORMAL REVIEW PROCESS IN OUR EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL NEW STORE SITES AS WELL AS FOR DECISIONS SURROUNDING LEASES ON EXISTING STORE LOCATIONS.  OUR APPROACH IS BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE IN NATURE.  WE LOOK TO CONTINUALLY ENHANCE THIS PROCESS WITH TOOLS SUCH AS REAL ESTATE SOFTWARE USED FOR PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS THAT AID IN IDENTIFYING VIABLE LOCATIONS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION AND IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL STORE CLOSINGS AND RELOCATIONS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WE LEARN ABOUT CUSTOMERS AS WE IMPLEMENT OUR CRM PROGRAM.  WE CLOSED TWO STORES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 AND EXPECT TO CLOSE A TOTAL OF SEVEN TO 10 STORES DURING FISCAL 2019.  OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE HAVE ANALYZED OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF STORES, WITH A CONCENTRATION ON UNDERPERFORMING STORES, TO MEET OUR LONG-TERM GOAL OF INCREASING SHAREHOLDER VALUE THROUGH INCREASING OPERATING INCOME. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS UNDERPERFORMING STORES THAT PRODUCE LOW OR NEGATIVE CONTRIBUTION AND EITHER RENEGOTIATE LEASE TERMS, RELOCATE OR CLOSE THE STORES.  EVEN THOUGH THIS COULD REDUCE OUR OVERALL NET SALES VOLUME, WE BELIEVE THIS STRATEGY WILL REALIZE LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN OPERATING INCOME AND DILUTED  18  EARNINGS PER SHARE.  DEPENDING UPON THE RESULTS OF LEASE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CERTAIN LANDLORDS OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES, WE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF STORE CLOSURES IN FUTURE PERIODS.  THE TIMING AND ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EXPENS  E RECORDED IN CLOSING A STORE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING, IN PART, ON THE PERIOD IN WHICH MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO A CLOSING PLAN, THE REMAINING BASIS IN THE FIXED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AT CLOSING AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY LEASE BUYOUT.  WE WILL CONTINUE  TO REVIEW OUR STORE PORTFOLIO BASED ON OUR VIEW OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES IN THE MARKETPLACE.  DIVIDENDS  ON MARCH 21, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE PAYMENT OF OUR FIRST QUARTER CASH DIVIDEND TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. THE DIVIDEND OF $0.08 PER SHARE WAS PAID ON APRIL 26, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON APRIL 8, 2019.  THE DECLARATION AND PAYMENT OF ANY FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND WILL DEPEND ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, BUSINESS CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS DEEMED RELEVANT BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) PERMITS THE PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS AS LONG AS NO DEFAULT OR EVENT OF DEFAULT EXISTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT BOTH IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO THE CASH DIVIDENDS, AND THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS FOR A FISCAL YEAR DO NOT EXCEED $10.0 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY  ON MARCH 27, 2017 WE ENTERED INTO A SECOND AMENDMENT OF OUR CURRENT UNSECURED CREDIT AGREEMENT (THE \u201cCREDIT AGREEMENT\u201d) TO EXTEND THE EXPIRATION DATE BY FIVE YEARS TO MARCH 27, 2022 AND TO RENEGOTIATE CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED,  CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FOR UP TO $50.0 MILLION IN CASH ADVANCES AND COMMERCIAL AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT WITH BORROWING LIMITS BASED ON ELIGIBLE INVENTORY, WHICH AMOUNT MAY BE INCREASED FROM TIME TO TIME BY UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $50.0 MILLION, WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF ANY LENDER, IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET.  THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS COVENANTS WHICH STIPULATE:  (1) TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) WILL NOT FALL BELOW $250.0 MILLION AT THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER; (2) THE RATIO OF FUNDED DEBT PLUS THREE TIMES RENT TO EBITDA (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) PLUS RENT WILL NOT EXCEED 2.5 TO 1.0; (3) THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF CASH DIVIDENDS FOR A FISCAL YEAR WILL NOT EXCEED $10.0 MILLION; AND (4) DISTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF REDEMPTIONS OF EQUITY INTERESTS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT) CAN BE MADE SOLELY WITH CASH ON HAND SO LONG AS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER SUCH DISTRIBUTIONS THERE ARE NO REVOLVING LOANS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT.  WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS AS OF MAY 4, 2019.  SHOULD A DEFAULT CONDITION BE REPORTED, THE LENDERS MAY PRECLUDE ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS AND CALL ALL LOANS AND ACCRUED INTEREST AT THEIR DISCRETION.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST, AT OUR OPTION, AT (1) THE AGENT BANK\u2019S PRIME RATE AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PLUS 1%, WITH THE PRIME RATE DEFINED AS THE GREATER OF (A) THE FEDERAL FUND RATE PLUS 0.50% OR (B) THE INTEREST RATE ANNOUNCED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE AGENT BANK AS ITS \u201cPRIME RATE\u201d OR (2) LIBOR PLUS 1.25% TO 2.50%, DEPENDING ON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA.  A COMMITMENT FEE IS CHARGED AT 0.20% TO 0.35% PER ANNUM, DEPENDING ON OUR ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE BANK GROUP\u2019S COMMITMENT.  THERE WERE NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING WERE $1.2 MILLION AT MAY 4, 2019.  AS OF MAY 4, 2019, $48.8 MILLION WAS AVAILABLE TO US FOR ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  ON DECEMBER 13, 2018, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR UP TO $50.0 MILLION OF OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2019. THE PURCHASES MAY BE MADE IN THE OPEN MARKET OR THROUGH PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE AMENDED, SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME AND DOES NOT COMMIT US TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. WE HAVE FUNDED, AND INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FUND, THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FROM CASH ON HAND, AND ANY SHARES ACQUIRED WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES.  THE ACTUAL NUMBER AND VALUE OF THE SHARES TO BE PURCHASED WILL DEPEND ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR STOCK PRICE AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE REPURCHASED 411,168 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A TOTAL COST OF $14.0 MILLION UNDER THE NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. THE AMOUNT THAT REMAINED AVAILABLE UNDER THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AT MAY 4, 2019 WAS $36.0 MILLION.  SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS  OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE FLUCTUATED, AND ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE IN THE FUTURE, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF SEASONAL VARIANCES AND THE TIMING OF SALES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPENING NEW STORES AND CLOSING UNDERPERFORMING STORES.  NON-CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SUCH AS ADVERTISING AND PAYROLL INCURRED PRIOR TO THE OPENING OF A NEW STORE, ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE AS INCURRED.  THE TIMING AND ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EXPENSE RECORDED IN CLOSING AN INDIVIDUAL STORE CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING, IN PART, ON THE PERIOD IN WHICH MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO A CLOSING PLAN, THE REMAINING BASIS IN THE FIXED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF AT CLOSING AND THE AMOUNT OF ANY LEASE BUYOUT.  THEREFORE, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN ANY QUARTER IN WHICH WE INCUR PRE-OPENING EXPENSES RELATED TO THE OPENING OF NEW STORES OR INCUR STORE CLOSING COSTS RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF EXISTING STORES.  19  WE HAVE THREE DISTINCT PEAK SELLING PERIODS: EASTER, BACK-TO-SCHOOL AND CHRISTMAS.  TO PREPARE FOR OUR PEAK SHOPPING SEASONS, WE MUST ORDER AND KEEP IN STOCK SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MERCHANDISE THAN WE WOULD CARRY DURING OTHER PARTS OF THE YEAR.  ANY U  NANTICIPATED DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS DURING THESE PEAK SHOPPING SEASONS COULD REQUIRE US TO SELL EXCESS INVENTORY AT A SUBSTANTIAL MARKDOWN, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AND NEGATIVELY AFFECT OUR PROFITABILITY.  OUR OPERAT  ING RESULTS DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY UPON THE SALES GENERATED DURING THESE PERIODS.", "is_valid": false, "label": -1, "Form Type": "10-Q", "Company Name": "SHOE CARNIVAL INC", "CIK": 895447, "Date": "2019-06-11T00:00:00", "Ticker": "SCVL", "Name": "Shoe Carnival Inc", "Exchange": "NASDAQ", "SIC": 5661.0, "Business": "IN", "Incorporated": "IN", "IRS": 351736614.0, "key": "20190611SCVL", "labelr1": -3.4103827207275565, "labelr2": 4.276186739897999, "labelr3": -0.037622272385244585, "labelr4": 2.4840045163718485, "pred": -1.0, "prof-1": 0.55520874, "prof1": 0.44479123, "return1&2": 0.9898836164714604, "return1&2&3": 0.990256033181946, "return1&2&3&4": 0.9656580285940616, "return2": 0.9572381326010201, "return1": 1.0341038272072756, "return3": 1.0003762227238524, "return4": 0.9751599548362816, "1_day_return": -3.4103827207275565, "cumulative_return1": 2.966219601055267, "cumulative_return1&2": 1.6436298894577497, "cumulative_return1&2&3": 2.029849110713086, "cumulative_return1&2&3&4": 5.1491231347800115, "indexx": 1284, "dailyaveragereturn": 0.9887431775507939, "cumreturn1b": 1.0898706285836084, "cumreturndow": 1.0493323396007523, "cumreturnsp500": 1.0477462255735386}, {"Unnamed: 0": 1286, "level_0": 1316, "index": 58392, "text": "ITEM 2.

EACH TERM DEFINED IN THE NOTES HAS THE SAME MEANING IN THIS ITEM AND THE BALANCE OF THIS REPORT.  THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RESULTS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  THAT WE BELIEVE ARE KEY INDICATORS OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE WHEN COMPARED TO OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  \u2022  NET SALES INCREASED  $27.8 MILLION  , OR  2.2%.  \u2022  COMPARABLE STORE SALES FOR STORES OPEN AT LEAST FIFTEEN MONTHS, INCLUDING E-COMMERCE, INCREASED $18.2 MILLION, OR 1.5%.  \u2022  GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS INCREASED  $7.0 MILLION  , WHILE GROSS MARGIN RATE DECLINED  30  BASIS POINTS TO  40.1%  OF SALES.  \u2022  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  $22.5 MILLION  .  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED  90  BASIS POINTS TO  35.5%  OF NET SALES.  \u2022  OPERATING PROFIT RATE DECREASED  160  BASIS POINTS TO  2.0%.  \u2022  DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED TO  $0.39  PER SHARE FROM  $0.74  PER SHARE.  \u2022  INVENTORY INCREASED BY  9.1%  OR  $77.4 MILLION  TO  $927.0 MILLION  FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018.  \u2022  WE DECLARED AND PAID A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.30 PER COMMON SHARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 CONSISTENT WITH THE QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER COMMON SHARE PAID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  \u2022  WE ACQUIRED 1.3 MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES FOR $48.0 MILLION UNDER OUR 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM.

NET SALES INCREASED  $27.8 MILLION  , OR  2.2%  , TO  $1,295.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $1,268.0 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A 1.5% INCREASE IN OUR COMPS, WHICH INCREASED NET SALES BY $18.2 MILLION.  ADDITIONALLY, OUR NON-COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASED NET SALES BY $9.6 MILLION.  THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR NEW AND RELOCATED STORES HAS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED THE PRODUCTIVITY OF OUR CLOSED STORES, BUT THIS POSITIVE FACTOR WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 11 STORES AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF STORES OPEN AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  OUR COMPS ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE RESULTS OF ALL STORES THAT WERE OPEN AT LEAST FIFTEEN MONTHS PLUS THE RESULTS OF OUR E-COMMERCE NET SALES.  OUR FURNITURE, SOFT HOME, SEASONAL, AND CONSUMABLES MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES GENERATED INCREASED NET SALES AND POSITIVE COMPS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  \u2022  THE  FURNITURE  CATEGORY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES AND COMPS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE UPHOLSTERY, CASE GOODS, AND MATTRESSES DEPARTMENTS.  OUR CORE CUSTOMER, JENNIFER, CONTINUED TO RESPOND TO OUR NEWNESS OF TREND-RIGHT PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IN UPHOLSTERY AND CASE GOODS.  ADDITIONALLY, WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWTH AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR LEASE-TO-OWN FINANCE OFFERING.  \u2022  SOFT HOME  EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN NET SALES AND COMPS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE HOME DECOR, FLOORING, AND BATH DEPARTMENTS, AS WE GRADUALLY EXPAND OUR SPACE ALLOCATION IN THIS CATEGORY THROUGH OUR STORE OF THE FUTURE CONVERSIONS.  \u2022  THE POSITIVE COMPS AND INCREASED NET SALES IN OUR  SEASONAL  CATEGORY WERE ATTRIBUTED TO IMPROVED QUALITY AND EXPANSION OF ASSORTMENT ALONG WITH MORE AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  \u2022  CONSUMABLES  HAD SLIGHT INCREASES IN BOTH NET SALES AND COMPS, DRIVEN BY OUR HEALTH, BEAUTY, AND COSMETICS DEPARTMENT.  THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND POSITIVE COMPS IN OUR FURNITURE, SOFT HOME, SEASONAL, AND CONSUMABLES MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NEGATIVE NET SALES AND COMPS IN OUR FOOD, HARD HOME, AND ELECTRONICS, TOYS, & ACCESSORIES MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES.  \u2022  OUR  FOOD  CATEGORY EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN COMPS AND NET SALES PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY COMPETITIVE PRESSURES ON OUR STAPLE FOOD OFFERINGS.  \u2022  HARD HOME  EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN NET SALES AND NEGATIVE COMPS AS A RESULT OF AN INTENTIONALLY NARROWED ASSORTMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY POSITIVE COMPS IN OUR TABLETOP DEPARTMENT.  \u2022  THE DECREASED NET SALES AND NEGATIVE COMPS IN  ELECTRONICS, TOYS, & ACCESSORIES  WERE A RESULT OF OUR INTENTIONALLY NARROWED ASSORTMENT AND REDUCED SPACE ALLOCATION, PARTICULARLY IN OUR ELECTRONICS AND JEWELRY DEPARTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A POSITIVE COMP IN THE TOYS DEPARTMENT.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WE EXPECT TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE LOW TO MID-SINGLE DIGITS DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, BASED ON A NET NEW STORE GROWTH IN THE QUARTER ALONG WITH A COMPARABLE STORE SALES INCREASE OF LOW SINGLE DIGITS.  THE COMPARABLE STORES SALES GROWTH OF LOW SINGLE DIGITS IS BASED ON MAY SALES RESULTS, STRENGTH IN THE FURNITURE AND SOFT HOME CATEGORIES, IMPROVEMENT IN OUR SEASONAL CATEGORY DUE TO IMPROVED WEATHER AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES IN THE MONTHS OF JUNE AND JULY, AND GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF COMPLETED REMODELS THROUGH OUR STORE OF THE FUTURE REMODEL INITIATIVE.  GROSS MARGIN  GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS INCREASED $7.0 MILLION, OR 1.4%, TO  $519.0 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $512.0 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  . THE INCREASE IN GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH INCREASED GROSS MARGIN DOLLARS BY $11.2 MILLION.  GROSS MARGIN AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DECREASED 30 BASIS POINTS TO  40.1%  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  AS COMPARED TO  40.4%  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE GROSS MARGIN RATE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF A $6.0 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF INVENTORY IN OUR GREETING CARDS DEPARTMENT, AS WE ARE CHOOSING TO EXIT THAT DEPARTMENT, AND A HIGHER MARKDOWN RATE, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BOTH A SLIGHTLY HIGHER INITIAL MARK-UP AND FAVORABLE SHRINK RESULTS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  , WE EXPECT OUR GROSS MARGIN RATE WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018  , AS WE ANTICIPATE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER MARKDOWN RATE.  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WERE  $460.6 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $438.1 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE OF $22.5 MILLION IN SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY $15.3 MILLION IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TRANSFORMATIONAL RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVE ANNOUNCED IN MARCH 2019, $8.0 MILLION IN ACCRUED BONUS EXPENSE, AN ADDITIONAL $7.3 MILLION IN ESTIMATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WAGE AND HOUR CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, STORE-RELATED OCCUPANCY COSTS OF $5.6 MILLION, AND STORE-RELATED PAYROLL OF $2.7 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 OF THE IMPACT OF BOTH THE RETIREMENT OF OUR FORMER CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF $7.0 MILLION AND THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTERS FOR $3.5 MILLION, AND A DECREASE IN SELF-INSURANCE COSTS OF $4.8 MILLION.  THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR TRANSFORMATIONAL RESTRUCTURING CONSISTED OF CONSULTING EXPENSES AND EMPLOYEE SEPARATION COSTS INCURRED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  THE INCREASE IN ACCRUED BONUS EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY STRONGER PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 RELATIVE TO OUR QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING PLANS AS COMPARED TO OUR PERFORMANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 RELATIVE TO OUR QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL OPERATING PLANS.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ACCRUED ESTIMATED LEGAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEE CLASS ACTIONS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF $7.3 MILLION.  STORE-RELATED OCCUPANCY COSTS INCREASED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF A NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD, ALONG WITH IMPACT OF RENT ASSOCIATED WITH LEASES ACQUIRED THROUGH BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS IN LOCATIONS THAT HAVE NOT YET OPENED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO OPEN IN THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2019.  THE INCREASE IN STORE-RELATED PAYROLL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 IS PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN WAGE RATES, WHICH BEGAN IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A NET DECREASE OF 11 STORES SINCE THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, WE INCURRED $3.5 MILLION IN CHARGES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF SHAREHOLDER AND DERIVATIVE LITIGATION MATTERS THAT WERE INITIALLY FILED IN 2012.  THE DECREASE IN OUR SELF-INSURANCE COSTS RESULTED FROM A DECREASE OF WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND MEDICAL CLAIMS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED 90 BASIS POINTS TO  35.5%  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  34.6%  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  , WE EXPECT OUR SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES WILL INCREASE IN COMPARISON TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE FIRST QUARTER TREND, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED STORE-RELATED OCCUPANCY COSTS, INCREASED ACCRUED BONUS EXPENSE AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ADDITIONAL TRANSFORMATIONAL RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES.  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE INCREASED $4.3 MILLION TO  $32.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $28.5 MILLION  FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES INCREASED 30 BASIS POINTS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY OUR INVESTMENT IN OUR STORE OF THE FUTURE CONCEPT, THROUGH BOTH REMODELS AND NEW STORES.  DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF  2019  , WE EXPECT THAT DEPRECIATION EXPENSE WILL BE HIGHER AS COMPARED TO  2018  , AS TRENDS FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 CONTINUE.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  INTEREST EXPENSE  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS  $3.7 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $1.6 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY BOTH AN INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND HIGHER TOTAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS.  THE AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON OUR REVOLVING DEBT WAS IMPACTED BY INCREASES IN THE LIBOR RATE, AS OUR 2011 CREDIT AGREEMENT WAS AND 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT IS, VARIABLE BASED ON LIBOR, AND A LOWERING OF OUR CREDIT RATING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018.  WE HAD TOTAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS (INCLUDING CAPITAL LEASES) OF $428.8 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO TOTAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS OF $215.2 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE IN TOTAL AVERAGE BORROWINGS (INCLUDING FINANCE LEASES) WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE OF $213.6 MILLION IN OUR AVERAGE REVOLVING DEBT BALANCE UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS DRIVEN BY BEGINNING 2019 WITH DEBT BALANCE THAT WAS $174.3 MILLION HIGHER THAN THE BEGINNING OF 2018.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE)  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) WAS  $0.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , COMPARED TO  $0.5 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE CHANGE WAS DRIVEN BY OUR DIESEL FUEL HEDGING CONTRACTS, AS FUEL PRICES SLIGHTLY INCREASED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, REDUCING THE UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THOSE CONTRACTS.  INCOME TAXES  THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2019  AND THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF  2018  WAS 31.9% AND 29.4%, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NET TAX BENEFIT DEFICIENCIES ASSOCIATED WITH SETTLEMENT OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT AWARDS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 AS COMPARED THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018, AND AN INCREASE IN NONDEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE 2017 FEDERAL TAX REFORM.  ADDITIONALLY, THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 WAS IMPACTED BY THE LOWER OVERALL INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY  ON AUGUST 31, 2018, WE ENTERED INTO THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR A  $700 MILLION  FIVE  -YEAR UNSECURED CREDIT FACILITY AND REPLACED THE 2011 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT EXPIRES ON AUGUST 31, 2023.  BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WORKING CAPITAL, AND TO REPAY CERTAIN INDEBTEDNESS.  THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDES A $30 MILLION SWING LOAN SUBLIMIT, A $75 MILLION LETTER OF CREDIT SUBLIMIT, A $75 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR LOANS TO FOREIGN BORROWERS, AND A $200 MILLION OPTIONAL CURRENCY SUBLIMIT.  THE INTEREST RATES, PRICING AND FEES UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT FLUCTUATE BASED ON OUR DEBT RATING.  THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT ALLOWS US TO SELECT OUR INTEREST RATE FOR EACH BORROWING FROM MULTIPLE INTEREST RATE OPTIONS.  THE INTEREST RATE OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM THE PRIME RATE OR LIBOR.  WE MAY PREPAY REVOLVING LOANS MADE UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT WITHOUT PENALTY.  THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LIMITATIONS ON INDEBTEDNESS, LIENS AND INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE OF TWO FINANCIAL RATIOS \u2013 A LEVERAGE RATIO AND A FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO.  ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE SUBJECT TO CROSS-DEFAULT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYNTHETIC LEASE FOR OUR NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN CALIFORNIA.  A VIOLATION OF ANY OF THE COVENANTS COULD RESULT IN A DEFAULT UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT WOULD PERMIT THE LENDERS TO RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO FURTHER ACCESS THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT FOR LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AND REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE REPAYMENT OF ANY OUTSTANDING LOANS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  AT  MAY 4, 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS OF THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OUR LIQUIDITY IS CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND, AS NECESSARY, BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT.  OUR NET INCOME AND, CONSEQUENTLY, OUR CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS ARE IMPACTED BY NET SALES VOLUME, SEASONAL SALES PATTERNS, AND OPERATING PROFIT MARGINS.  OUR NET SALES ARE TYPICALLY HIGHEST DURING THE NINE-WEEK CHRISTMAS SELLING SEASON IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.  GENERALLY, OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS PEAK LATE IN OUR THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OR EARLY IN OUR FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER.  WE HAVE TYPICALLY FUNDED THOSE REQUIREMENTS WITH BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY.  AT  MAY 4, 2019  , WE HAD  $470.4 MILLION  OF BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT, AND THE BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT WERE  $214.2 MILLION  , AFTER TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE REDUCTION IN AVAILABILITY RESULTING FROM OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALING  $15.4 MILLION  .  WE BELIEVE THAT CASH ON HAND, CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH AVAILABLE FROM FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND OUR 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE US WITH SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  CASH REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE AMONG OTHER THINGS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, INTEREST PAYMENTS, AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS.  IN MARCH 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED US TO REPURCHASE UP TO  $50.0  MILLION OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON SHARES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE PURCHASED APPROXIMATELY  1.3 MILLION  OF OUR COMMON SHARES FOR  $48.0 MILLION  UNDER THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $37.78  .  WE UTILIZED PROCEEDS FROM THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT TO ASSIST IN FUNDING OUR 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  WE EXPECT TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON SHARES UNDER THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE OPEN MARKET AND/OR IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTIONS AT OUR DISCRETION, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. COMMON SHARES ACQUIRED THROUGH THE 2019 REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AVAILABLE TO MEET OBLIGATIONS UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS AND FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. WE INTEND TO FUND THE REPURCHASES WITH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE CYCLICAL PATTERN OF OUR CASH FLOWS, WE MAY NEED TO USE BORROWINGS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT TO FUND REPURCHASES AS WE DID IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019.  IN MARCH 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER COMMON SHARE PAYABLE ON APRIL 5, 2019 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON MARCH 22, 2019.  THE CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.30 PER COMMON SHARE IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS DECLARED IN  2018  .  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  , WE PAID APPROXIMATELY  $13.2 MILLION  IN DIVIDENDS COMPARED TO  $14.4 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE COMPARES THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF OUR CASH FLOWS FROM THE  FIRST QUARTER  2019  COMPARED TO THE  FIRST QUARTER  2018  .  (IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  CHANGE  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $57,435  $96,885  $(39,450  )  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (76,766  )  (65,437  )  (11,329  )  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED IN) FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $36,869  $(17,794  )  $54,663  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY  $39.5 MILLION  TO  $57.4 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $96.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  . THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE DECREASE WERE INCREASED CASH OUTFLOWS FOR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND A DECREASE OF $15.7 MILLION IN NET INCOME.  THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A REDUCTION IN THE CASH OUTFLOWS FOR OTHER CURRENT ASSETS OF $33.6 MILLION, ALONG WITH A $19.4 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH INFLOWS FROM INVENTORIES.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DECIDED TO ACCELERATE OUR INVENTORY PURCHASES TO MITIGATE TARIFF COST EXPOSURE.  THE RESULT OF THIS DECISION WAS THAT IT INCREASED OUR INVENTORY POSITION, WHILE DECREASING OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE POSITION, AS WE HAVE ALREADY PAID FOR THE EARLIER INVENTORY RECEIPTS BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WHEN WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO PAY FOR THEM BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  ADDITIONALLY, THE INCREASE IN OUR INVENTORY WAS DRIVEN BY A SHIFT IN TIMING OF OUR PLANNED HOME EVENTS, WHICH SUPPORT OUR FURNITURE, SOFT HOME AND HARD HOME MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES TO EARLIER IN THE SUMMER; THEREFORE WE SHIFTED FORWARD THE TIMING OF MERCHANDISE RECEIPTS TO SUPPORT THOSE EVENTS.  THE CHANGE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS WAS DRIVEN BY THE SETTLEMENT OF OUR SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION MATTER IN 2018, AFTER THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $11.3 MILLION  TO  $76.8 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $65.4 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $45.8 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ASSETS ACQUIRED UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASE OF $34.5 MILLION FOR OUR NEW DISTRIBUTION CENTER IN APPLE VALLEY, CALIFORNIA.  THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WAS DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN NEW STORES GROWTH, OUR STORE OF THE FUTURE REMODEL INITIATIVE AND EQUIPMENT FOR OUR NEW CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  THE DECREASE IN ASSETS ACQUIRED UNDER SYNTHETIC LEASE WAS DRIVEN BY THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF A NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY  $54.7 MILLION  TO  $36.9 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2019  COMPARED TO  $17.8 MILLION  USED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2018  .  THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS AN INCREASE IN NET PROCEEDS UNDER THE 2018 CREDIT AGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $122.1 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018.  PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS A $34.3 MILLION INCREASE IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON SHARES UNDER OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 COMPARED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018 AND A DECREASE OF $34.5 MILLION IN PROCEEDS FROM THE SYNTHETIC LEASE FOR OUR CALIFORNIA DISTRIBUTION CENTER.  WE NOW EXPECT CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES LESS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION FOR  2019  , WHICH REFLECTS THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF CASH OUTFLOWS FOR THE TRANSFORMATIONAL RESTRUCTURING INITIATIVES.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD, AS WELL AS THE RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ON AN ONGOING BASIS, MANAGEMENT EVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS, AND BASES ITS ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, CURRENT TRENDS, AND VARIOUS OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.  SEE NOTE 1 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN OUR  2018  FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE ADOPTED ASU 2016-02,  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , AND ELECTED THE OPTIONAL TRANSITION  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  METHOD THAT ALLOWED FOR A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION AND DID NOT RESTATE PRIOR PERIODS.

AS A RESULT OF OUR OMNI-CHANNEL SALES AND INVENTORY STRATEGY, AS WELL AS CROSS-CHANNEL CUSTOMER SHOPPING PATTERNS, THERE IS LESS DISTINCTION BETWEEN OUR BRICK-AND-MORTAR RETAIL STORES AND OUR E-COMMERCE ONLINE STORE AND WE BELIEVE THE INCLUSION OF E-COMMERCE SALES IN OUR COMPARABLE SALES METRIC IS A MORE MEANINGFUL REPRESENTATION OF THESE RESULTS AND PROVIDES A MORE COMPREHENSIVE VIEW OF OUR YEAR OVER YEAR COMPARABLE SALES METRIC.  (2)  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WE CHANGED OUR COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION TO ALIGN WITH OUR INTERNAL COMPANY REPORTING. UNDER THE NEW DEFINITION, A STORE IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION AFTER IT HAS COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS AND INCLUDES STORES, IF ANY, THAT HAVE BEEN REMODELED OR RELOCATED WITHIN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC MARKET THE COMPANY SERVED PRIOR TO THE RELOCATION. NON-COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE NEW STORES WHICH HAVE NOT COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS, SALES FROM CLOSED STORES, AND RELOCATED STORES SERVING A NEW GEOGRAPHIC MARKET. UNDER THE OLD DEFINITION, IN THE EVENT THAT WE RELOCATED OR REMODELED AN EXISTING STORE, WE HAD TREATED THAT STORE AS COMPARABLE UNLESS THE SQUARE FOOTAGE CHANGED BY MORE THAN 20%, IN WHICH CASE WE WOULD TREAT THAT STORE AS NON-COMPARABLE SALES UNTIL IT HAS COMPLETED 13 FULL FISCAL MONTHS OF OPERATIONS FOLLOWING THE SQUARE FOOTAGE ADJUSTMENT. FOR 53-WEEK FISCAL YEARS, WE CONTINUE TO ADJUST COMPARABLE SALES TO EXCLUDE THE ADDITIONAL WEEK. THERE MAY BE VARIATIONS IN THE WAY IN WHICH SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS AND OTHER RETAILERS CALCULATE COMPARABLE SALES. THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARABLE SALES HAVE BEEN RE-CASTED TO ALIGN WITH OUR NEW COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION. THE CHANGE IN OUR COMPARABLE SALES DEFINITION DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' COMPARABLE SALES PERCENTAGES.  20  THREE MONTHS EN  DED  MAY 4, 2019  COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED  MAY 5, 2018  NET SALES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WERE $55,122, INCREASING $608, OR 1.1%, VERSUS $54,514 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018.

COMPARABLE SALES INCREASED $281, OR 1.1%, INCLUDING E-COMMERCE, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE DOLLAR SALE. NON-COMPARABLE SALES CONTRIBUTED $1,467 OF SALES GROWTH. SINCE MAY 5, 2018, TWO NET NEW STORES HAVE OPENED, BRINGING OUR TOTAL RETAIL STORE COUNT TO 59 AS OF MAY 4, 2019, COMPARED TO 57 AS OF THE END OF THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, GROSS MARGIN WAS 51.3%, COMPARED WITH 46.8% IN THE PRIOR YEAR FIRST QUARTER. THE TOTAL GROSS MARGIN RATE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.  \u2022  NON-RECURRENCE OF AN UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO INVENTORY RESERVES IN THE PRIOR YEAR CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 245 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT; AND  \u2022  THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF STRONGER FULL PRICE SELLING AND LOWER PRODUCT COSTS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 250 BASIS POINTS OF IMPROVEMENT.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\u201cSG&A\u201d)  EXPENSES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WERE $34,015, INCREASING $4,115, OR 13.8%, VERSUS $29,900 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES WERE 61.7% AND 54.8% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE IN SG&A EXPENSES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR PERIOD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO.  \u2022  $1,350 OF STRATEGIC CONSULTING COSTS;  \u2022  $1,217 OF INCREASED COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS;  \u2022  $657 OF INCREASED MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES; AND  \u2022  $378 OF INCREASED RENT AND OCCUPANCY EXPENSES PRIMARILY RELATED TO NET NEW STORE OPENINGS.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 WAS $42 AS COMPARED TO $48 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 5, 2018. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018 WAS 0.6% AND 0.9%, RESPECTIVELY. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MAY 4, 2019 AND MAY 5, 2018 DIFFERED FROM THE U.S. STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE ESTABLISHED AGAINST OUR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS PARTLY OFFSET BY STATE AND FOREIGN TAXES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, IF ANY, BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE 2018 REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS CAPITAL MARKETS. OUR PRIMARY CASH NEEDS ARE FUNDING WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS, MEETING OUR DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, PAYING AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE TAX RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR NEW STORES AND RELATED LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF OUR WORKING CAPITAL ARE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY  WILL GENERATE SUFFICIENT  CASH FLOWS TO MEET OUR OBLIGATIONS DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ISSUED.

PURCHASES OF APPAREL ARE SENSITIVE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE LEVEL OF CONSUMER SPENDING, INCLUDING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE LEVEL OF DISPOSABLE CONSUMER  25  INCOME, CONSUMER DEBT, INTEREST RAT  ES AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS THE IMPACT  OF  ADVERSE WEATHER  CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, FLUCTUATIONS IN  THE AMOUNT OF  SALES IN ANY FISCAL QUARTER ARE AFFECTED BY THE TIMING OF SEASONAL WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS AND OTHER EVENTS AFFECTING DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER  SALES; AS SUCH, THE FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTER MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF RESULTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR. WE EXPECT SUCH SEASONALITY TO CONTINUE.  INFLATION  WHILE INFLATION MAY IMPACT OUR SALES, COST OF GOODS SOLD AND EXPENSES, WE BELIEVE THE EFFECTS OF INFLATION ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY MEASURE THE IMPACT OF INFLATION, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT HAS NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY INFLATION IN THE FUTURE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR DISCUSSION OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RELIES ON OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS SET FORTH IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, WHICH ARE PREPARED BASED ON CERTAIN CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO VARYING DEGREES OF UNCERTAINTY. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT THESE ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE BASED ON REASONABLE MEASUREMENT CRITERIA, ACTUAL FUTURE EVENTS CAN AND OFTEN DO RESULT IN OUTCOMES MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $4,485,000 ON NET SALES OF $26,893,000 COMPARED TO A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $5,034,000 ON NET SALES OF $22,569,000 IN THE SAME PERIOD IN 2018.  NET SALES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 INCREASED BY $4,324,000, A 19.2% INCREASE, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  NET SALES INCREASED LARGELY BECAUSE THE COMPANY STARTED THE YEAR WITH AN ORDER BACKLOG THAT WAS $4,200,000 HIGHER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR.    APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASE IN SELLING PRICE AND THE BALANCE DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME.  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPANY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SELLING PRICES TO COMPENSATE FOR SEVERE COST INCREASES INCURRED DURING LAST FISCAL YEAR.  THESE INCREASES INCLUDED THE EFFECT OF STEEL TARIFFS, TARIFFS ON PRODUCT FROM CHINA, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER COSTS.  IN ADDITION, THE PRICE INCREASE WAS INTENDED TO COVER ANTICIPATED COST INCREASES FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDING JANUARY 31, 2020.  THE AMOUNT OF PRICE INCREASE VARIED BASED UPON THE TYPE OF PRODUCT AND COMPETITIVE CONSIDERATIONS, BUT NO PRODUCT INCREASED BY LESS THAN 10%.  IMPACT OF THIS PRICE INCREASE DID NOT FULLY IMPACT FIRST QUARTER SALES, AS THE MAJORITY OF FIRST QUARTER SALES WERE FROM THE BEGINNING BACKLOG OF ORDERS, WHICH WERE RECEIVED BEFORE THE PRICE INCREASE.  THE IMPACT OF THE PRICE INCREASE WILL BE MORE IMPACTFUL DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS.  ORDER RATES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 18.2% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  ORDER RATES WERE VERY SLOW FOR THE MONTHS OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH, WITH YEAR-TO-DATE ORDERS THROUGH MARCH BEING 27% LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  ORDER RATES FOR APRIL AND MAY WHICH ARE SEASONALLY HIGHER THAN FEBRUARY AND MARCH WERE 2% LOWER THAN PRIOR YEAR.  BECAUSE THESE ORDERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DELIVERED IN THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL IS NOT IN SESSION, ORDER BACKLOG AT APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 22.0%.  BACKLOG AT APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $39,254,000 COMPARED TO $50,136,000 AT APRIL 30, 2018 AND $39,553,000 AT APRIL 30, 2017.  GROSS MARGIN FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES TO 33.8% IN THE CURRENT QUARTER COMPARED TO 34.1% IN THE PRIOR QUARTER.  THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOUR COMPONENTS.  FIRST, THE COMPANY INCREASED COMPENSATION FOR FACTORY EMPLOYEES, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE OF PRESSURES FROM INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGE AND OTHER PRESSURES IN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION.  SECOND, THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED INCREASED MATERIAL COSTS FOR CERTAIN COMMODITIES, PARTICULARLY STEEL AND IMPORTED COMPONENTS FROM CHINA.  THIRD, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS INCREASED SELLING PRICES TO RECOVER THESE COST INCREASES, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION FOR SHIPMENTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER WERE FROM ORDERS PLACED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PRIOR TO THE PRICE INCREASE.  FOURTH, FACTORY PRODUCTION LEVELS WERE APPROXIMATELY 13% LOWER FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR IN RESPONSE TO SLOW ORDER RATES.  THE REDUCED PRODUCTION LEVELS ADVERSELY IMPACTED FACTORY EFFICIENCY.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $527,000 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR BUT DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES.  THE INCREASE IN SPENDING IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO VARIABLE SELLING AND SERVICE COSTS.  INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOR THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 IS COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 WAS 31.6% COMPARE TO 29.0% FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS MORE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THERE ARE TWO COMPONENTS OF THE INCREASE.  FIRST, THE COMPANY HAS BORROWED MORE MONEY TO FINANCE PRODUCTION OF INVENTORY IN ANTICIPATION OF INCREASED SUMMER SHIPPING ACTIVITY.  SECOND, EXPENSE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INTEREST RATES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER AT APRIL 30, 2019 THAN AT APRIL 30, 2018 DUE TO INCREASED SALES DURING THE QUARTER RESULTING FROM THE BACKLOG AT JANUARY 31, 2019.  DUE TO THE SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, THE COMPANY TRADITIONALLY BUILDS LARGE QUANTITIES OF INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR IN ANTICIPATION OF SEASONALLY HIGH SUMMER SHIPMENTS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY INCREASED INVENTORY BY APPROXIMATELY $16.2 MILLION COMPARED TO JANUARY 31, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $4.2 MILLION LESS THAN WHAT WAS ADDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.  THIS REDUCTION WAS IN PART TO COMPENSATE FOR A LARGER BEGINNING INVENTORY BALANCE AT JANUARY 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND IN RESPONSE TO SLOWER ORDER RATES.  AT APRIL 30, 2019 INVENTORY WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN DOLLARS DUE TO INCREASED RAW MATERIAL PRICES BUT LOWER IN UNIT VOLUME.  THE INCREASE IN INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR WAS FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION (\"PNC\").  16  BORROWING UNDER THE COMPANY'S REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC AT APRIL 30, 2019 IS APPROXIMATELY $1.9 MILLION HIGHER COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER LAST YEAR.  THE INCREASE IN BORROWING IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  ACCRUAL BASIS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $884,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $613,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE BEING FINANCED THROUGH THE COMPANY'S CREDIT FACILITY WITH PNC.  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 WAS $18,286,000 COMPARED TO $16,992,000 FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN CASH USED WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH THE COMPANY'S UNUSED BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER ITS REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT WITH PNC WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND THE COMPANY'S DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  APPROXIMATELY $4,000,000 WAS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING AS OF APRIL 30, 2019.  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES ARE OUTLINED IN ITS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019.  ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019, THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU NO. 2016-02-  LEASES (TOPIC 842)  , USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH AND APPLYING THE TRANSITIONAL RELIEF ALLOWING ENTITIES TO INITIALLY APPLY THE REQUIREMENTS AT THE ADOPTION DATE BY RECOGNIZING A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF ADOPTION. CONSEQUENTLY, RESULTS AND DISCLOSURES FOR THE REPORTING PERIODS BEGINNING ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 ARE REPORTED AND PRESENTED UNDER ASC 842, WHILE PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS, AND DISCLOSURES ARE NOT ADJUSTED AND CONTINUE TO BE REPORTED AND PRESENTED UNDER ASC 840,  LEASES  . IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS PERMITTED UNDER THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE WITHIN THE NEW STANDARD, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS, ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO CARRY FORWARD THE HISTORICAL LEASE CLASSIFICATION. FURTHER, THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT TO APPLY THE HINDSIGHT PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, WHICH ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO FORGO REASSESSING THE LEASE TERM AT ADOPTION. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR LEASES WITH AN ORIGINAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN A PURCHASE OPTION AS SHORT-TERM LEASES.  THE COMPANY DETERMINES IF AN ARRANGEMENT IS A LEASE AT INCEPTION. OPERATING LEASES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE LESSEE ARE INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE (\u201cROU\u201d) ASSETS, OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES, AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY FINANCE LEASES, AS A LESSEE, AND NO LEASES FOR WHICH IT IS THE LESSOR.  ROU ASSETS REPRESENT THE RIGHT TO USE AN UNDERLYING ASSET FOR THE LEASE TERM AND LEASE LIABILITIES REPRESENT OUR OBLIGATION TO MAKE LEASE PAYMENTS ARISING FROM THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AT COMMENCEMENT DATE BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM IS 5.72 YEARS. AS MOST OF THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASES DO NOT PROVIDE AN IMPLICIT RATE, WE USE OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE BASED ON THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT COMMENCEMENT DATE IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF LEASE PAYMENTS. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE IS ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE THE INTEREST RATE ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS WITH SIMILAR TERMS AND PAYMENTS USING COMPANY SPECIFIC CREDIT SPREADS. THE COMPANY USES THE IMPLICIT RATE WHEN READILY DETERMINABLE. THE INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE USED IS 6.39%. THE OPERATING LEASE ROU ASSET ALSO INCLUDES ANY LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AND EXCLUDES LEASE INCENTIVES. THE COMPANY\u2019S LEASE TERMS INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE THE LEASE ONLY WHEN IT IS REASONABLY CERTAIN THAT WE WILL EXERCISE THAT OPTION.  LEASE EXPENSE FOR OPERATING LEASE PAYMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM  THE COMPANY HAS LEASE AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR AS PART OF A COMBINED LEASE.  ADOPTION OF THE NEW STANDARD RESULTED IN THE RECORDING OF ROU ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $23.9 MILLION AND $25.6 MILLION RESPECTIVELY, AS OF FEBRUARY 1, 2019. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ADDITIONAL LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES, NET OF THE DEFERRED TAX IMPACT, WAS DUE TO PREVIOUS DEFERRED RENT BALANCES THAT WERE REMOVED AS PART OF THE ADOPTION OF TOPIC 842. THE STANDARD DID NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AND HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIGHER SALES BY THE COGENT OFFSET BY LOWER SALES BY SKKYNET JAPAN DIVISION.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE WAS $681,724 AND $1,129,328 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $538,923 AND $1,060,566 FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018.

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING LOSS DURING THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER  OPTION EXPENSE IN THE 2019 PERIODS OVER THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018 AND DECREASED EXPENSES IN CONSULTING, SALARIES, AND OFFICE EXPENSES.  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTH PERIODS ENDING APRIL 30, 2019, WAS EXPENSE OF $937AND INCOME OF $5,500 COMPARED TO OTHER EXPENSE OF $18,960 AND $39,420 FOR THE SAME PERIODS IN 2018 DUE TO CURRENCY CHANGES.

OLAREGEN IS LAUNCHING AN FDA-510(K) CLEARED WOUND CARE PRODUCT.  OVERVIEW  OF BUSINESS  NGDX  DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  OUR  MAJORITY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS LLC (\u201cNGDX\u201d), FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, IS IN THE BUSINESS  OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT  OF CARE LEVEL WITH RESULTS AS SOON AS 10-15 MINUTES. WE MANUFACTURE AND SELL RAPID DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY  EXPRESS PLATFORMS AS WELL AS CASSETTE DEVICES BASED ON CUSTOMARY DESIGNS USED GENERALLY IN THE INDUSTRY.  SINCE  ITS FOUNDING, NGDX HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AND CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AN EXPANDING LINE OF RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TESTS (RDTS) INCLUDING THOSE  FOR THE FOLLOWING INFECTIOUS DISEASES SUCH AS HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) \u2013 1\u20442 W/P24AB, TUBERCULOSIS-XT, MALARIA,  HEPATITIS, SYPHILIS, TYPHOID, DENGUE AND OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.  TODAY,  WE HAVE DEVELOPED A SUBSTANTIAL LINE OF RDT\u2019S KNOWN AS READY TO \u201cGO-TO-MARKET.\u201d  DUE  TO THE POTENTIAL INFECTIOUS CHARACTER OF THE WHOLE BLOOD TEST SAMPLE, OUR EXPRESS SERIES OF RDTS ARE DESIGNED TO PERFORM AND DELIVER  TEST RESULTS WHILE SEALED WITHIN THE EXPRESS HOUSING, CAREFULLY CONTROLLING THE POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS TEST SAMPLE. THIS DESIGN  HELPS TO INCREASE OUR ABILITY TO CONTROL THE POSSIBILITY OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION. MOST OF OUR COMPETITORS\u2019 PRODUCTS, WHILE  INEXPENSIVE, ARE NOT AS USER-FRIENDLY ALLOWING FOR INCREASED USER-ERROR AND REQUIRES SUBSTANTIALLY MORE TRAINING AND HAVE GREATER  RISK OF CROSS-CONTAMINATION.  WE  HAVE BEEN DESIGNING AND ENGINEERING DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT INCORPORATE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES OF RAPID TEST STRIPS FOR USE IN OUR  EXPRESS SERIES OF DEVICES AND WHICH YIELD A RAPID RESPONSE FOR POINT-OF-CARE PATIENT TESTING AND TREATMENT.  EACH  RDT INCORPORATES AN ACCURATE TEST STRIP THAT HAS BEEN STRIPED WITH SPECIFIC ANTIGENS OR ANTIBODIES COMBINED IN A PROPRIETARY COCKTAIL  AND THEN INCORPORATED INTO AN EASY-TO-USE AND USER-FRIENDLY DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE NGDX DELIVERY SYSTEMS INCLUDE OUR STANDARD \u201cCASSETTE\u201d  DESIGN, OUR PATENTED \u201cEXPRESS\u201d HOUSING DEVICE AS WELL AS OUR NEW \u201cEXPRESS II\u201d.  EACH  SYSTEM DELIVERS ITS OWN ADVANTAGES WHICH ENHANCE THE USE, APPLICATION AND PERFORMANCE OF EACH DIAGNOSTIC. THIS EASE OF USE IN  THE EXPRESS DELIVERY SYSTEMS ENSURE THAT OUR RDTS PERFORM EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY PROVIDING THE MOST ACCURATE AND REPEATABLE  TEST RESULTS AVAILABLE WHILE, AT THE SAME TIME, MINIMIZING THE TRANSFERENCE OF A POTENTIALLY INFECTED BLOOD SAMPLE.  THE  COMPANY MAINTAINS A FEDERAL DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) REGISTERED FACILITY IN MIRAMAR, FLORIDA AND IS CERTIFIED UNDER BOTH ISO9001  AND ISO13485 FOR THE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE IN-VITRO DEVICES. APPROVAL OF OUR HIV RAPID TEST  HAS BEEN ISSUED BY THE UNITED STATES AGENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (USAID). ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS QUALIFIED  FOR AND CARRY THE EUROPEAN UNION \u201cCE\u201d MARK, WHICH ALLOW US TO ENTER INTO CE MEMBER COUNTRIES SUBJECT TO INDIVIDUAL  COUNTRY REQUIREMENTS. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE TWO MALARIA RAPID TESTS APPROVED UNDER WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) GUIDELINES. OUR  NGDX PRODUCTS HAVE ALSO RECEIVED REGISTRATIONS AND APPROVALS ISSUED BY OTHER FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. NGDX IS CURRENTLY IN THE PLANNING  PHASE FOR ENTERING INTO THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED, WHO \u201cPRE-QUALIFIED APPROVAL\u201d PROCESS FOR OTHER NGDX TESTS. THIS PROCESS  ALLOWS EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF RAPID TESTS, REDUCING THE CURRENT 24-30 MONTH PROCESS DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 6-9 MONTHS. WHO APPROVAL  IS NECESSARY FOR OUR PRODUCTS TO BE USED IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHICH RELY UPON THE EXPERTISE OF THE WHO, AS WELL AS FOR NGO FUNDING  FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS.  38  PHARMACY  AND MSO BUSINESS  ON  OCTOBER 3, 2018, WE ACQUIRED FROM VENETO THE OPERATING ASSETS OF SYSTEM DISPENSING PHARMACIES, (B) A CENTRAL ADJUDICATING PHARMACY,  (C) A WHOLESALE PHARMACEUTICAL PURCHASING COMPANY, AND (D) AN IN-NETWORK LABORATORY.  ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACQUIRED VENETO\u2019S MANAGEMENT SERVICES ORGANIZATION (MSO) BUSINESS AND TWO ADDITIONAL ANCILLARY SERVICES.

GENEREX  HISTORICAL BUSINESS  WE  HAVE HISTORICALLY ENGAGED PRIMARILY IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES. OUR PRIMARY FOCUS  AT THE PRESENT TIME IS OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF FORMULATIONS OF LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS TO THE ORAL (BUCCAL)  CAVITY USING A HAND-HELD AEROSOL APPLICATOR. THROUGH OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ANTIGEN, WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR FOCUS TO INCLUDE  IMMUNOMEDICINES INCORPORATING PROPRIETARY VACCINE FORMULATIONS. ON JANUARY 18, 2017, WE ACQUIRED A MAJORITY OF THE EQUITY INTERESTS  IN NUGENEREX DIAGNOSTICS LLC (\u201cNGDX\u201d), FORMERLY HEMA DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEMS, LLC. ON DECEMBER 1, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE  REMAINDER OF THE NGDX EQUITY INTERESTS FOR NOMINAL CONSIDERATION PROVIDED THAT THE GENEREX STOCK AND WARRANTS ISSUED TO THE NGDX  EQUITY OWNERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE INITIAL ACQUISITION HAVE A SPECIFIED VALUE AND WE HAVE REGISTERED FOR RESALE THE COMPANY\u2019S  SHARES ISSUED TO THE NGDX EQUITY OWNERS. NGDX IS IN THE BUSINESS OF DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, AND DISTRIBUTING OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL  DIAGNOSTICS FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT OF CARE LEVEL WITH RESULTS AS SOON AS 10-15 MINUTES. NGDX MANUFACTURES  AND SELLS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC DEVICES BASED UPON OUR OWN PROPRIETARY EXPRESS TECHNOLOGY AS WELL AS CASSETTE DEVICES BASED ON CUSTOMARY  DESIGNS USED GENERALLY IN THE INDUSTRY. WE INTEND TO FOCUS ON NGDX\u2019S BUSINESS AND IN IDENTIFYING OTHER AREAS FOR EXPANSION,  BUT DO NOT INTEND TO DISCONTINUE OUR PRE-ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES.  WE  BELIEVE THAT OUR BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY IS A PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS APPLICATION TO MANY LARGE MOLECULE DRUGS AND PROVIDES  A CONVENIENT, NON-INVASIVE, ACCURATE AND COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADMINISTER SUCH DRUGS. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED SEVERAL LARGE MOLECULE  DRUGS AS POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING ESTROGEN, HEPARIN, MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES, HUMAN GROWTH HORMONE AND FERTILITY  HORMONES, BUT TO DATE HAVE FOCUSED OUR DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS PRIMARILY ON ONE PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM, AN  INSULIN FORMULATION ADMINISTERED AS A FINE SPRAY INTO THE ORAL CAVITY USING OUR PROPRIETARY HAND-HELD AEROSOL SPRAY APPLICATOR  KNOWN AS RAPIDMISTTM.  OUR  SUBSIDIARY, ANTIGEN, CONCENTRATES ON DEVELOPING PROPRIETARY VACCINE FORMULATIONS THAT WORK BY STIMULATING THE IMMUNE SYSTEM TO  EITHER ATTACK OFFENDING AGENTS (I.E., CANCER CELLS, BACTERIA, AND VIRUSES) OR TO STOP ATTACKING BENIGN ELEMENTS (I.E., SELF-PROTEINS  AND ALLERGENS). OUR IMMUNOMEDICINE PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON TWO PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES AND ARE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT.  PRIOR TO EXHAUSTING OUR FUNDS, WE CONTINUED CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF ANTIGEN\u2019S SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE VACCINES DESIGNED TO STIMULATE  A POTENT AND SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE AGAINST TUMORS EXPRESSING THE HER-2/NEU ONCOGENE FOR PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST  CANCER IN A PHASE II CLINICAL TRIAL AND PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER AND AGAINST AVIAN INFLUENZA IN TWO PHASE I CLINICAL TRIALS.  WE ALSO INITIATED AN ADDITIONAL PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL IN PATIENTS WITH EITHER BREAST OR OVARIAN CANCER.  THE SYNTHETIC  VACCINE TECHNOLOGY HAS CERTAIN ADVANTAGES FOR PANDEMIC OR POTENTIALLY PANDEMIC VIRUSES, SUCH AS THE H5N1 AVIAN AND H1N1 SWINE  FLU.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COLLABORATIONS WITH CLINICAL INVESTIGATORS AT ACADEMIC CENTERS TO ADVANCE THESE TECHNOLOGIES.  39  WE  OPERATE IN THREE SEGMENTS. OUR HISTORICAL BUSINESS OPERATES IN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGIES  FOR METABOLIC AND IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES. NGDX OPERATES IN THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF IN-VITRO MEDICAL DIAGNOSTIC  DEVICES (RDTS) ADMINISTERED AT THE POINT OF CARE LEVEL. OUR SUBSIDIARY, NUGENEREX DISTRIBUTION SOLUTIONS 2, LLC, WHICH ACQUIRED  THE VENETO ASSETS, OPERATES IN PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES.  ACCOUNTING  FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS  OUR  MAJOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE THE REFINEMENT OF OUR PLATFORM BUCCAL DELIVERY TECHNOLOGY, OUR BUCCAL INSULIN PROJECT  (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) AND ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES.  WE  DID NOT EXPEND ANY MATERIAL RESOURCES ON OUR BUCCAL INSULIN (GENEREX ORAL-LYNTM) OR OTHER ORAL DELIVERY PRODUCTS IN THE FISCAL  QUARTERS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018 DUE TO LACK OF FUNDS. THE COMPLETION OF FURTHER LATE-STAGE TRIALS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED  STATES MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FUNDS THAN WE CURRENTLY HAVE ON HAND.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, WE PAID $342,000 TO NSABP FOR CLINICAL TRIALS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  RELATING TO ANTIGEN\u2019S PEPTIDE IMMUNE THERAPEUTIC VACCINES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES DUE TO OUR LACK OF CASH. ONE ANTIGEN  VACCINE IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE II CLINICAL TRIALS IN THE UNITED STATES INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH HER-2/NEU POSITIVE BREAST CANCER,  AND WE HAVE COMPLETED A PHASE I CLINICAL TRIAL FOR AN ANTIGEN VACCINE FOR H5N1 AVIAN INFLUENZA WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AT THE LEBANESE-CANADIAN  HOSPITAL IN BEIRUT. ANTIGEN\u2019S PROSTATE CANCER VACCINE BASED ON AE37 HAS BEEN TESTED IN A COMPLETED (AUGUST 2009) PHASE I  CLINICAL TRIAL IN GREECE.  DURING  THE NINE MONTHS APRIL 30, 2019 AND 2018, NGDX EXPENDED $443,504 AND $380,781 ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RELATING TO ITS RAPID  DIAGNOSTIC TESTS. NGDX EXPECTS TO EXPEND RESOURCES ON ITS RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST DURING THE REMAINDER FISCAL YEAR ENDING JULY 31,  2019.  BECAUSE  OF VARIOUS UNCERTAINTIES, WE CANNOT PREDICT THE TIMING OF COMPLETION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF OUR BUCCAL INSULIN OR ANTIGEN\u2019S  PEPTIDE IMMUNOTHERAPEUTIC VACCINES OR RELATED TECHNOLOGIES. THESE UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE THE SUCCESS OF CURRENT STUDIES NET OPERATING  LOSSES ATTRIBUTED TO NGDX, OUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE REQUIRED FINANCING AND THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL EVEN  IF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE COMPLETED AND SUCCESSFUL, OUR ABILITY TO ENTER INTO COLLABORATIVE MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTIES, AND THE SUCCESS OF SUCH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS. FOR THE SAME REASONS, WE CANNOT  PREDICT WHEN ANY PRODUCTS MAY BEGIN TO PRODUCE NET CASH INFLOWS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THERE  ARE NO MATERIAL CHANGES FROM THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES SET FORTH IN \u201cMANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d OF OUR FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2018 FILED WITH THE SEC ON OCTOBER  26, 2018, EXCEPT AS FOLLOWS.  WE  HAVE ADOPTED A SEQUENCING POLICY WHEREBY, IN THE EVENT THAT RECLASSIFICATION OF CONTRACTS FROM EQUITY TO ASSETS OR LIABILITIES  IS NECESSARY PURSUANT TO ASC 815 DUE TO OUR INABILITY TO DEMONSTRATE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT AUTHORIZED SHARES, SHARES WILL BE ALLOCATED  ON THE BASIS OF THE EARLIEST ISSUANCE DATE OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE INSTRUMENTS, WITH THE EARLIEST GRANTS RECEIVING THE FIRST ALLOCATION  OF AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES, AND ALL FUTURE INSTRUMENTS BEING CLASSIFIED AS A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF  INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES OR DIRECTORS.  OUR  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  IT REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  40  WE  CONSIDER CERTAIN ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES TO  BE CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  GOING  CONCERN.  AS SHOWN IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WE HAVE NOT BEEN PROFITABLE  AND HAVE REPORTED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO CONTINUE  TO OPERATE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.  THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IMPAIRMENT  OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  . MANAGEMENT REVIEWS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING  AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS.  IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS HAS OCCURRED BASED UPON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, THE LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN THE  CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  INTANGIBLE  ASSETS  . WE HAVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO PATENTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE RELATED ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND WHETHER  OR NOT THESE ASSETS ARE IMPAIRED INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WE  USE AN ESTIMATE OF UNDISCOUNTED OPERATING INCOME AND RELATED CASH FLOWS OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE, MARKET CONDITIONS AND  OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE ASSET. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR THEIR RELATED ASSUMPTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE,  WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AGAINST THESE ASSETS  INVENTORY.  INVENTORIES, WHICH CONSIST OF BOTH RAW MATERIALS AND FINISHED GOODS, IS VALUED AT THE LOWER OF COST, DETERMINED BY THE FIRST-IN,  FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET VALUE. INVENTORY COSTS ARE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF PRODUCT, LABOR, FREIGHT AND DUTY. THE COMPANY WRITES  DOWN INVENTORY FOR ESTIMATED OBSOLESCENCE EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST OF INVENTORY AND THE ESTIMATED MARKET VALUE  BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDING APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A  WRITE DOWN OF INVENTORY FOR $645,351 RELATED TO OBSOLESCENCE WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS COST OF GOODS SOLD.  SHARE-BASED  COMPENSATION.  MANAGEMENT DETERMINES VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 718, COMPENSATION \u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES  VALUE OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TO NON-EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH AND ASC 505, EQUITY-BASED PAYMENTS TO NON-EMPLOYEES.  DERIVATIVE  WARRANT LIABILITY  .  FASB ASC 815, DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING, REQUIRES ALL DERIVATIVES TO BE RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED  INTERIM CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2008. AS A RESULT, CERTAIN  DERIVATIVE WARRANT LIABILITIES (NAMELY THOSE WITH A PRICE PROTECTION FEATURE) ARE NOW SEPARATELY VALUED AS OF AUGUST 1, 2009 AND  ACCOUNTED FOR ON OUR BALANCE SHEET, WITH ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. ON OUR CONDENSED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED  BALANCE SHEETS AS OF APRIL 30, 2019 AND JULY 31, 2018, WE USED THE BINOMIAL LATTICE MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE  WARRANTS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS OF THE BINOMIAL LATTICE OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCLUDE THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK, THE EXERCISE PRICE  OF THE WARRANTS, APPLICABLE VOLATILITY RATES, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATES, EXPECTED DIVIDENDS AND THE INSTRUMENT\u2019S REMAINING  TERM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION PROVIDES INFORMATION THAT WE BELIEVE IS RELEVANT TO AN ASSESSMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE  THREE  MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019  . IT SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-Q AND OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AS OF, AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY IS A NEVADA-BASED, GOLD AND SILVER MINING EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION COMPANY WITH EXTENSIVE, CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY IN THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK AND SILVER CITY MINING DISTRICTS (COLLECTIVELY, THE \u201cCOMSTOCK DISTRICT\u201d) AND ADDITIONAL MINING, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES LOCATED IN STOREY AND LYON COUNTIES, NEVADA. THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT IS LOCATED WITHIN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE BASIN AND RANGE PROVINCE OF NEVADA, NEAR RENO AND CARSON CITY. THE COMPANY BEGAN ACQUIRING PROPERTIES AND DEVELOPING PROJECTS IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT IN 2003. SINCE THEN, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK DISTRICT, SECURED PERMITS, BUILT AN INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROUGHT EXPLORATION PROJECTS INTO PRODUCTION.  THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES NOW OWN OR CONTROL APPROXIMATELY  9,358  ACRES OF MINING CLAIMS AND PARCELS IN THE BROADER COMSTOCK DISTRICT AND SURROUNDING AREA. THE ACREAGE INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY  2,396  ACRES OF PATENTED CLAIMS AND SURFACE PARCELS (PRIVATE LANDS) AND APPROXIMATELY  6,962  ACRES OF UNPATENTED MINING CLAIMS (PUBLIC LANDS), WHICH THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT (\u201cBLM\u201d) ADMINISTERS. THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS IS ON AMERICAN FLAT ROAD, IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA AND JUST SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY, NEVADA  BECAUSE OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT\u2019S HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE, THE GEOLOGY IS WELL KNOWN AND HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY STUDIED BY THE COMPANY, OUR ADVISORS AND MANY INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE GEOLOGY THROUGH VIGOROUS SURFACE MAPPING AND DRILL HOLE LOGGING. THE VOLUME OF GEOLOGIC DATA IS IMMENSE, PARTICULARLY IN THE LUCERNE AND DAYTON RESOURCE AREAS. WE HAVE AMASSED A LARGE LIBRARY OF HISTORIC DATA AND DETAILED SURFACE MAPPING OF COMSTOCK DISTRICT PROPERTIES AND CONTINUE TO OBTAIN HISTORIC INFORMATION FROM PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SOURCES. WE INTEGRATE THIS DATA WITH INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OUR RECENT MINING OPERATIONS, TO TARGET GEOLOGICAL PROSPECTIVE EXPLORATION AREAS AND PLAN EXPLORATORY DRILLING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING EXPANDED SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND DRILLING.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES EVALUATING AND ACQUIRING PROPERTIES, EXPANDING ITS FOOTPRINT AND EVALUATING ALL OF OUR EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EXPLORATION, DEVELOPMENT AND MINING. THE NEAR-TERM GOAL OF OUR BUSINESS PLAN IS TO MAXIMIZE INTRINSIC STOCKHOLDER VALUE REALIZED, PER SHARE, BY CONTINUING TO ACQUIRE AND DEVELOP MINERALIZED AND POTENTIALLY MINERALIZED PROPERTIES, EXPLORING, DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING QUALIFIED RESOURCES (MEASURED, INDICATED AND INFERRED) AND RESERVES (PROVEN AND PROBABLE) THAT ENABLE THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPERTIES THROUGH EXTENDED, LONG-LIVED MINE PLANS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE, INCLUDING MINE PLANS FOR BOTH THE DAYTON AND LUCERNE RESOURCE AREAS, WITH BOTH SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES.  OUR DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND THE ADJACENT SPRING VALLEY EXPLORATION TARGETS ARE LOCATED IN LYON COUNTY, NEVADA, APPROXIMATELY SIX MILES SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY. ACCESS TO THE PROPERTIES IS BY STATE ROUTES 341 AND 342, BOTH PAVED ROADS.  OUR LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA IS LOCATED IN STOREY COUNTY, NEVADA, APPROXIMATELY THREE MILES SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY AND 30 MILES SOUTHEAST OF RENO. THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA WAS HOST TO THE COMPANY\u2019S MOST-RECENT TEST MINING OPERATIONS FROM 2012 THROUGH 2015. THE PROCESSING FACILITY IS IN AMERICAN FLAT, APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE WEST OF LUCERNE.  THE COMPANY ACHIEVED INITIAL PRODUCTION AND ITS FIRST POUR OF GOLD AND SILVER ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012. THE COMPANY CEASED MINING IN 2015 AND CONCLUDED PROCESSING IN 2016. FROM 2012, THROUGH 2016, THE COMPANY MINED AND PROCESSED APPROXIMATELY 2.6 MILLION TONS OF MINERALIZED MATERIAL, AND PRODUCED 59,515 OUNCES OF GOLD AND 735,252 OUNCES OF SILVER.  21  FIGURE 1 - COMSTOCK MINING'S LAND POSITION IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT  22  CURRENT PROJECTS  THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED MANY EXPLORATION TARGETS ON ITS LAND HOLDINGS IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, BUT HAS FOCUSED, TO DATE, ON THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA (INCLUDING SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND EXPLORATION). WE ARE WORKING TO DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVE EXPLORATION PLANS FOR THE REMAINING AREAS, WHICH INCLUDE THE SPRING VALLEY GROUP, OCCIDENTAL GROUP, AND GOLD HILL GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS. EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES WILL PROCEED SUBSEQUENT TO AND IN SOME CASES CONCURRENT WITH THE ONGOING EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAYTON AND LUCERNE RESOURCE AREAS.  THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA IS SOUTH OF VIRGINIA CITY IN LYON COUNTY, NEVADA. IT GENERALLY INCLUDES THE HISTORIC DAYTON, KOSSUTH AND ALHAMBRA PATENTS, INCLUDING THE OLD DAYTON CONSOLIDATED MINE WORKINGS, SOUTH TO WHERE THE KOSSUTH PATENT CROSSES STATE ROUTE 341. THE HISTORIC DAYTON MINE WAS THE LAST MEANINGFUL UNDERGROUND MINING OPERATION IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, BEFORE BEING CLOSED AFTER THE WAR PRODUCTION BOARD PUBLISHED LIMITATION ORDER L-208, 7 F. R. 7992 ON OCTOBER 8, 1942, THAT CLOSED DOWN ALL GOLD MINING OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS TERRITORIES. THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA RANKS AS ONE OF THE COMPANY\u2019S TOP EXPLORATION AND POTENTIAL MINE DEVELOPMENT TARGETS. IN JANUARY 2014, THE LYON COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS APPROVED STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN AND ZONING CHANGES ON THE DAYTON, KOSSUTH AND ALHAMBRA MINING PATENTS AND OTHER PROPERTIES LOCATED IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, ENABLING A MORE PRACTICAL, COMPREHENSIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR MINING. GEOLOGICAL STUDIES AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING ARE CURRENTLY UNDERWAY UTILIZING DATA FROM EXTENSIVE METALLURGICAL TESTING AND ASSESSMENT DURING 2017, 30,818 FEET OF ADDITIONAL DRILLING COMPLETED IN 2015, GEOPHYSICAL ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION COMPLETED IN 2013, AND EXTENSIVE GEOLOGICAL DATA FROM PRE-2013, DRILL PROGRAMS.  THE SPRING VALLEY GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS LIES ADJACENT TO THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AT THE SOUTHERN END OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT, WHERE THE MINERALIZED STRUCTURES, TRENDING TO THE SOUTH FROM THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, LIE MOSTLY CONCEALED BENEATH A VENEER OF SEDIMENT GRAVELS. SPRING VALLEY INCLUDES THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE KOSSUTH PATENTED CLAIM AND THE DONDERO, DANEY AND NEW DANEY CLAIMS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY\u2019S PLACER MINING CLAIMS IN SPRING VALLEY AND GOLD CANYON.  THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE COMPANY\u2019S EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS SINCE 2007. IT INCLUDES THE PREVIOUSLY MINED BILLIE THE KID, HARTFORD AND LUCERNE MINING PATENTS, AND EXTENDS EAST AND NORTHEASTERLY TO THE AREA OF THE HISTORIC WOODVILLE (SOUTHERN-MOST OF THE HISTORIC COMSTOCK BONANZAS), SUCCOR AND LAGER BEER PATENTS AND NORTH TO THE HISTORIC JUSTICE AND KEYSTONE MINES. THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA IS APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE ALONG STRIKE, WITH EXPLORED WIDTHS FROM 600 TO 1,800 FEET, REPRESENTING LESS THAN THREE PERCENT OF THE LAND HOLDINGS CONTROLLED BY THE COMPANY. THE LUCERNE IS THE SITE OF OUR PREVIOUS MINING ACTIVITIES AND ONGOING EXPLORATION PROGRAM, AND THE COMPANY HOLDS THE KEY MINING PERMITS REQUIRED TO RESUME SURFACE OR UNDERGROUND MINING OF THIS AREA.  OUR LUCERNE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES INCLUDED OPEN PIT GOLD AND SILVER TEST MINING FROM 2004, THROUGH 2006, AND FROM LATE 2012 THROUGH 2015. AS DEFINED BY THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\u201cSEC\u201d) INDUSTRY GUIDE 7, WE HAVE NOT YET ESTABLISHED ANY PROVEN OR PROBABLE RESERVES AT OUR LUCERNE MINE.  ON JANUARY 24, 2019, THE \u201cCOMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH TONOGOLD (THE \u201cTONOGOLD AGREEMENT\u201d). UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL SELL TONOGOLD ITS INTERESTS IN COMSTOCK MINING LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF COMSTOCK (\u201cCML\u201d) WHOSE SOLE ASSETS ARE THE LUCERNE MINE PROPERTIES AND RELATED PERMITS. UPON CLOSING, THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD WILL TERMINATE THE OPTION AGREEMENT (THE \u201cOPTION AGREEMENT\u201d), DATED OCTOBER 3, 2017.  THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR CML IS  $15 MILLION  , PLUS TONOGOLD WILL ALSO GUARANTEE THE COMPANY\u2019S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP INTEREST IN NORTHERN COMSTOCK LLC, WHO LEASES CERTAIN MINERAL PROPERTIES IN THE LUCERNE AREA, AND ASSUME CERTAIN RECLAMATION LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS A  1.5%  NET SMELTER RETURN ROYALTY ON THE LUCERNE PROPERTIES.  THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT REQUIRES THAT TONOGOLD GUARANTEE THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS IN NORTHERN COMSTOCK LLC (\"NORTHERN COMSTOCK\"), RELIEVING$8 MILLION IN FUTURE LEASE AND RECLAMATION OBLIGATIONS.  TONOGOLD HAS PAID THE COMPANY  $2.4 MILLION  IN NON-REFUNDABLE CASH DEPOSITS, AS OF MAY 3, 2019, OF THE TOTAL $11.5 MILLION OF THE CASH COMPONENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.  THE REMAINING $3.5 MILLION, IN THE FORM OF CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES OF TONOGOLD, WAS RECEIVED ON JUNE 7, 2019.  THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ALSO AGREED THAT COMMENCING UPON THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF CML, IT WILL ENTER INTO A NEW OPTION AGREEMENT TO LEASE ITS PERMITTED AMERICAN FLAT MINING PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TO TONOGOLD FOR CRUSHING, LEACHING AND PROCESSING MATERIAL FROM THE LUCERNE MINE. UNDER THIS NEW OPTION AGREEMENT, TONOGOLD WILL BE REQUIRED TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY FOR AN ADDITIONAL  $1.1 MILLION  PER YEAR TO MAINTAIN THE PROCESSING FACILITY LEASE OPTION. IF SUCH OPTION IS EXERCISED, TONOGOLD WILL THEN PAY THE COMPANY A RENTAL FEE OF  $1 MILLION  PER YEAR PLUS  $1  PER PROCESSED TON, IN ADDITION TO ALL  23  THE COSTS OF OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE FACILITY, UP TO AND UNTIL THE FIRST  $15 MILLION  IN RENTAL FEES ARE PAID, AND THEN STEPPING DOWN TO  $1 MILLION  PER YEAR AND  $0.50  PER PROCESSED TON FOR THE NEXT  $10 MILLION  PAID TO THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO AGREED, UPON THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF CML, TO ENTER INTO A  TEN  -YEAR MINERAL LEASE FOR ADDITIONAL MINERAL PROPERTIES IN STOREY COUNTY, NEVADA, GRANTING TONOGOLD THE RIGHT TO EXPLORE, DEVELOP AND MINE THESE PROPERTIES. TONOGOLD WILL ASSUME APPROXIMATELY  $100,000  IN ANNUAL COSTS FOR THESE PROPERTIES AND WILL ASSUME WORK COMMITMENTS TOTALING MORE THAN  $200,000  IN 2019. THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A  3%  NET SMELTER RETURN ROYALTY ON THESE ADDITIONAL LEASED PROPERTIES, WHICH WILL BE REDUCED TO  1.5%  ONE YEAR AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT OF MINING OPERATIONS. THE LEASE IS RENEWABLE FOR AN ADDITIONAL  TEN  -YEAR TERM.  THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT WOULD REPLACE THE OCTOBER 2017 OPTION AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD. THE OCTOBER 2017 OPTION AGREEMENT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT CLOSES.  ON APRIL 30, 2019, THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ENTERED INTO THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT (\"AMENDMENT)\"), WHICH ALLOWS TONOGOLD THE OPTION TO EXTEND THE CLOSING UNTIL AUGUST 30, 2019, UPON THE PAYMENT OF THREE ADDITIONAL $1 MILLION NON-REFUNDABLE DEPOSITS AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE AMENDMENT REQUIRES TONOGOLD TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY THE MONTHLY INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURE (GF COMSTOCK 2) BEGINNING ON MAY 31, 2019, THROUGH THE LATEST POSSIBLE CLOSING OF AUGUST 30, 2019.  ON MAY 22, 2019, THE COMPANY AND TONOGOLD ENTERED INTO THE SECOND PURCHASE AGREEMENT AMENDMENT (\"SECOND AMENDMENT\"), WHICH ALLOWED TONOGOLD TO FORGO FUNDING THE REMAINING $0.7 MILLION IN CASH PAYMENTS DUE IN MAY, 2019, AS REQUIRED IN THE FIRST AMENDMENT. THE TOTAL CASH CONSIDERATION FOR THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT REMAINS AT $11.5 MILLION IN CASH. THE SECOND AMENDMENT REQUIRED THAT TONOGOLD ISSUE THE COMPANY $3.5 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES (\"PREFERRED SHARES\"), SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PRICING CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS. TONOGOLD ALSO ISSUED AN ADDITIONAL $0.4 MILLION IN PREFERRED SHARES AS A COMMITMENT FEE.  THE PREFERRED SHARES WERE ISSUED ON JUNE 7, 2019.  THE OCCIDENTAL GROUP AND GOLD HILL GROUP OF EXPLORATION TARGETS REPRESENT LONGER-TERM EXPLORATION TARGET AREAS THAT CONTAIN MANY HISTORIC MINING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE OVERMAN, CON IMPERIAL, CALEDONIA, AND YELLOW JACKET MINES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CONSOLIDATION OF THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT HAS PROVIDED US WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO UTILIZE THE HISTORICAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO IDENTIFY DRILLING TARGETS WITH SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL.  24  FIGURE 2 - COMSTOCK MINING'S PROPERTY AND MINERAL LEASES IN THE COMSTOCK DISTRICT  25  EXPLORATION & DEVELOPMENT  THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM, DISTRICT-WIDE PLANS CONTEMPLATE THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC, IDENTIFIED GEOLOGICAL TARGET AREAS ACROSS THE DISTRICT, WHICH THE COMPANY HAS GROUPED INTO THE LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA, THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREAS, AND SPRING VALLEY, OCCIDENTAL, AND GOLD HILL GROUPS OF EXPLORATION TARGETS. THESE EXPLORATION TARGETS REPRESENT OVER 7 MILES OF MINERALIZED STRIKE LENGTH, WITH CURRENT AND HISTORICAL GRADES OF GOLD AND SILVER.  FIGURE 3 - GENERAL OVERVIEW OF PRIORITY EXPLORATION TARGETS  26  LUCERNE RESOURCE AREA  IN DECEMBER, 2018, THE COMPANY RECEIVED UNANIMOUS APPROVAL FROM THE STOREY COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS TO EXTEND ITS LANDMARK SPECIAL USE PERMIT (\u201cSUP\u201d) FOR MINING AND PROCESSING FOR THE LUCERNE MINE PROJECT FOR THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE, 20-YEAR TERM, EXTENDING THE ORIGINAL, 10-YEAR PERMIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2034. THIS PERMIT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT, PROGRESSIVE AND COLLABORATIVE PERMIT APPROVALS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S HISTORY, AND ITS EXTENSION STRENGTHENS THE FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE GROWTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PARTNER IN LUCERNE\u2019S DEVELOPMENT, TONOGOLD RESOURCES, INC.  THE AMENDMENT SIGNIFICANTLY EXTENDS THE DURATION OF THE PERMITTED AND ALLOWABLE USES FOR THE ENTIRE LUCERNE MINE PROJECT, INCLUDING THE LUCERNE MINE AND RESOURCE AREA AND THE FULLY PERMITTED AMERICAN FLAT PROCESSING AREA. THE PERMIT APPLIES TO BOTH SURFACE AND UNDERGROUND MINING, PROCESSING, MILLING, EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND OTHER ANCILLARY USES.  AS DESCRIBED IN THE CURRENT PROJECTS SECTION, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL THE LUCERNE PROPERTIES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL SELL ITS INTERESTS IN THE LUCERNE PROPERTIES AND RELATED PERMITS.  DAYTON RESOURCE AREA  THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADVANCE THE DAYTON PROJECT TO FULL FEASIBILITY, WITH A PRODUCTION READY MINE PLAN WITHIN TWO YEARS OF COMMENCING THAT WORK. THIS WORK HAS NOT YET COMMENCED. THE PLAN INCLUDES EXPANDING THE CURRENT RESOURCE AT THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND CONTINUING SOUTHERLY INTO SPRING VALLEY WITH INCREMENTAL EXPANSION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE EXPLORATION AND DEFINITION DRILLING OF TARGETS IDENTIFIED BY THE PRIOR CONVENTIONAL PERCUSSION, RC AND DIAMOND CORE DRILL PROGRAMS AND MAGNETIC, IP AND RESISTIVITY GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS (SEE FIGURE 4).  THE COMPANY HAS RETAINED THE INDEPENDENT MINING ADVISORY FIRM OF BEHRE DOLBEAR TO PRODUCE A NATIONAL INSTRUMENT 43-101 (\u201cNI 43-101\u201d) COMPLIANT TECHNICAL REPORT FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN 2019. THE REPORTING SCOPE INCLUDES AN UPDATED, ROBUST MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE, PLANS FOR EXPANDING AND FURTHER DEVELOPING THE MINERAL RESOURCE, AND MOST OF THE PREREQUISITE DATA FOR A SUBSEQUENT PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT (\u201cPEA\u201d). THE PEA IS THE FIRST MAJOR STEP IN DETERMINING OVERALL ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT.  THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED A MINERAL RESOURCE FOR DAYTON AS PART OF A BROADER TECHNICAL REPORT FOR THE COMSTOCK MINE PROJECT, BUT THIS NEW, BEHRE DOLBEAR COMMISSIONED TECHNICAL REPORT REPRESENTS THE FIRST STAND-ALONE NI 43-101 TECHNICAL REPORT TO BE PUBLISHED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA. SINCE OUR LAST DAYTON RESOURCE ESTIMATE, THE COMPANY HAS.  \u2022  INCREASED THE DAYTON PROJECT PROPERTY POSITION, BOTH MINING CLAIMS AND PRIVATE LAND, INCLUDING MORE THAN 350 ACRES OF CONTIGUOUS PRIVATE LANDS SUITABLE FOR A DEDICATED MINERAL PROCESSING SITE;  \u2022  ACHIEVED A LANDMARK, LYON COUNTY MASTER PLAN AND ZONING CHANGE THAT BROADENED THE POTENTIAL LAND USES AND RESTORED MINING AS AN APPROPRIATE USE FOR THE HISTORIC MINING PATENTS;  \u2022  SUBMITTED OUR PROJECT ESTIMATES FOR DUE DILIGENCE REVIEWS BY SRK CONSULTING IN BOTH RENO AND DENVER OFFICES;  \u2022  RESTORED SEVERAL HISTORIC DAYTON MINE PORTALS FOR SAFE EXPLORATION OF THE ACCESSIBLE MINE WORKINGS;  \u2022  COMPLETED UNDERGROUND GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE ACCESSIBLE MINE WORKINGS AND COMPLETED UNDERGROUND SAMPLING;  \u2022  COMPLETED SIGNIFICANT ASSAYING AND OTHER ANALYSIS FOR FURTHERING THE GEOLOGIC INTERPRETATION;  \u2022  IDENTIFIED NEW, BROADER MINERALIZED ZONES AND STRUCTURES;  \u2022  DRILLED 408 SHALLOW HOLES TOTALING 30,819 FEET, IDENTIFYING NEW MINERALIZED STRUCTURES COVERED BY SHALLOW ALLUVIUM;  \u2022  IMPROVED, MEANINGFULLY, THE GEOLOGIC MAPPING OF THE AREA;  \u2022  EXPANDED TRIALS BY CYCLADEX, A STRATEGIC INVESTEE, TESTING THEIR PATENTED, CYCLADEXTRIN LIXIVIANT, A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR OUR DAYTON MATERIALS; AND  \u2022  COMMENCED TRIALS WITH ITRONICS, INC., USING THEIR KAM-THIO METALLURGICAL RECOVERY PROCESSES, ANOTHER POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR OUR DAYTON MATERIALS.  THE NEW INFORMATION IS SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPLETELY UPDATED, DETAILED, THREE-DIMENSIONAL MODEL OF THE DAYTON PROJECT. THE COMPANY\u2019S TECHNICAL STAFF IS CURRENTLY COMPILING A DETAILED STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK FOR THE NEW RESOURCE MODEL. THE DETAILED INTERPRETATION IS LEADING TO A LIST OF HIGHLY PROSPECTIVE DRILL TARGETS TO FURTHER DEFINE AND EXPAND THE MINERAL RESOURCE.  27  IN-HOUSE DAYTON ENGINEERING AND MINE PLANNING HAVE RESULTED IN PROFILING VARIOUS ECONOMIC SHELLS WITH MULTIPLE CUTOFF GRADE SCENARIOS. MULTIPLE LAYOUT PLANS FOR THE MINE AND CORRESPONDING PROCESSING FACILITIES HAVE BEEN CONCEPTUALLY DEVELOPED AND LOCATED ON LANDS 100% PRIVATELY HELD BY THE COMPANY, THUS SIMPLIFYING AND SHORTENING THE CRITICAL PERMITTING CHAIN. THE NEW TECHNICAL REPORT WILL PROVIDE NOT ONLY A NEW RESOURCE ESTIMATE, BUT ALSO A PHASED DRILLING PLAN FOR FURTHER DEFINING AND EXPANDING THE RESOURCE FOR SUSTAINABLE, PROFITABLE MINING.  DAYTON METALLURGY  THE DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL HAS BEEN SUBJECTED TO METALLURGICAL TESTING BY INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES AS WELL AS IN THE COMPANY\u2019S ON-SITE LAB. COLUMN TESTS WERE CONDUCTED BY MCCLELLAND LABORATORIES IN 2011 ON MEDIUM GRADE AND HIGH GRADE COMPOSITES FROM THE DAYTON PIT AREA, AT 1\u201d AND 1\u20442\u201d CRUSH SIZES FOR EACH SAMPLE. THE GOLD RECOVERY AFTER 154 DAYS AVERAGED 86.7% FOR GOLD AND 47.4% FOR SILVER. THE FINAL REPORT STATED THAT AT THE END OF THE TEST, THE CURVES HAD FLATTENED, BUT RECOVERY WAS STILL INCREASING.  IN EARLY 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S IN-HOUSE LAB RAN COLUMN TESTS ON BULK SAMPLES FROM THREE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA: GLORY HOLE MID-GRADE, GLORY HOLE HIGH-GRADE, AND DAYTON ADIT. TWO COLUMNS WERE LOADED FROM EACH BULK SAMPLE. THE RECOVERY AFTER 74 DAYS AVERAGED 84% FOR GOLD AND 55% FOR SILVER. THE METAL RECOVERY HAD NOT STOPPED AFTER 74 DAYS, BUT THE DAILY INCREMENTAL INCREASES WERE BELOW THE COMPANY\u2019S ANALYTICAL DETECTION LIMITS.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO TEST ALTERNATIVE, GREENER TECHNOLOGIES FOR PROCESSING THE MINERALIZED MATERIAL FROM THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA. THIS INCLUDES TRIALS BY CYCLADEX, INC., A STRATEGIC INVESTEE, IN PART FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION, FOR EXTENSIVE TESTING OF THEIR PATENTED, CYCLADEXTRIN LIXIVIANT, A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEGUN TRIALS WITH ITRONICS, INC., TO TEST THEIR KAM-THIO METALLURGICAL RECOVERY PROCESSES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CYANIDE HEAP LEACHING FOR PROCESSING THE DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL. PREVIOUS TRIALS BY ITRONICS SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS FOR RECOVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL THE RESIDUAL SILVER FROM THE COMPANY\u2019S PREVIOUSLY LEACHED MATERIAL. THE COMPANY DELIVERED A BULK SAMPLE OF HIGHER-GRADE, DAYTON MINERALIZED MATERIAL TO ITRONICS IN AUGUST. ITRONICS HAS BEGUN TESTING WITH TWO CLEAR OBJECTIVES: FIRST, TO MODEL THE SAME PROCESS FLOW SHEET THAT THEY DEVELOPED FOR PROCESSING THE PREVIOUSLY LEACHED MATERIAL, AND SECOND, TO TEST THE ABILITY OF THE KAM-THIO LIQUID TO RECOVER SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGES OF GOLD AS WELL AS SILVER. A FINAL RESULT FROM THE TESTING WILL BE A PROPOSED PROCESSING FLOW SHEET AND SCREENING LEVEL ECONOMICS FOR USE IN THE PRELIMINARY ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE.  THE ONGOING TESTING OF ALTERNATIVE TECHNOLOGIES UNDERPINS THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMITMENT TO RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE. A BREAKTHROUGH WITH ANY OF THESE CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES COULD RESULT IN HIGHER, FASTER RECOVERIES WITH REDUCED WASTE, AS WELL AS A STREAMLINED PERMITTING PROCESS AND LOWER LONG-TERM RECLAMATION COSTS.  28  FIGURE 4 - DAYTON AND SPRING VALLEY MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICS WITH INTERPRETED VEINS AND STRUCTURES  29  DAYTON - SPRING VALLEY GROUP TARGETS  SPRING VALLEY IS SOUTH OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA, EXTENDING TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF STATE ROUTE 341. THE VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS AND STRUCTURAL CONTROLS OF THE MINERALIZATION DEFINED TO DATE FOR THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA ARE KNOWN TO CONTINUE SOUTH INTO SPRING VALLEY. POTENTIALLY ECONOMIC GOLD MINERALIZATION HAS BEEN INTERCEPTED IN SEVERAL WIDELY SPACED HOLES DRILLED DURING PRIOR SPRING VALLEY DRILLING PROGRAMS.  GROUND MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS IDENTIFIED A LINEAR ANOMALOUS CORRIDOR, DEFINED BY A SERIES OF RELATIVE MAGNETIC LOWS. ALTERED VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BY LIMITED DRILLING AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL MINERALIZED ZONES, THE GLOBAL DAYTON RESOURCE FOOT PRINT IS OUTLINED WITH REFERENCE TO THE TECHNICAL REPORT AUTHORED BY BEHRE DOLBEAR IN JANUARY 2013. THE EXPLORATION OF SPRING VALLEY WILL INCLUDE PHASED DRILLING PROGRAMS THAT WILL CONTINUE SOUTHERLY FROM SR 341 TO THE HISTORIC DANEY MINE SITE (FIGURE 5), WITH A POTENTIAL STRIKE LENGTH OF APPROXIMATELY 9,600 FEET.  FIGURE 5 - DAYTON AND SPRING VALLEY GROUP TARGETS  30  THE TECHNICAL STAFF REVIEWED HISTORIC GEOLOGIC AND GEOPHYSICAL STUDIES AND PRIOR DRILL PROGRAMS THAT FOCUSED UPON THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND EXTENSIONS SOUTH INTO SPRING VALLEY. THE FEW DRILL HOLES THAT WERE COMPLETED IN SPRING VALLEY INTERCEPTED ALTERED MIOCENE VOLCANIC ROCK KNOWN TO HOST THE ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE. SPECIFIC DRILL HOLES THAT ENCOUNTERED HIGHLY MINERALIZED ZONES ARE HIGHLIGHTED ON FIGURE 4. COLLECTIVELY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED AND ARE TARGETED FOR FUTURE DRILLING. THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA HAS OPEN ENDED ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DRILL HOLES TO DELINEATE THE GEOMETRY FOR MINE PLANNING. SOUTH OF THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA THE LIMITED DRILLING COUPLED WITH THE GEOPHYSICAL INTERPRETATION INDICATES THE TARGETED EXPLORATION MODEL EXTENDS AN ADDITIONAL 8,000 FEET (LENGTH OF GEOPHYSICAL MAGNETIC SURVEY) INTO SPRING VALLEY.  GROUND MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS IDENTIFIED A LINEAR ANOMALOUS CORRIDOR, DEFINED BY A SERIES OF RELATIVE MAGNETIC LOWS. ALTERED VOLCANIC HOST ROCKS HAVE BEEN INTERCEPTED BY LIMITED DRILLING AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL MINERALIZED ZONES. SELECTED DRILL HOLE INTERCEPTS ARE HIGHLIGHTED (SEE FIGURE 4). THE MID-LEVEL MAGNETIC LOWS DEFINE A ZONE (UP TO 500 FEET WIDE) BEGINNING AT THE DAYTON RESOURCE AND CONTINUING SOUTHERLY APPROXIMATELY 8,000 FEET (LENGTH OF GEOPHYSICAL MAGNETIC SURVEY) TOWARDS THE DANEY PATENT. THE ZONE IS FURTHER DEFINED BY THE TRACE OF INTERPRETED NORTH/SOUTH TRENDING VEIN SWARMS DEPICTED ON FIGURE 4. IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA THE INCREASED DENSITY OF THE VEIN SWARMS WITH INTERSECTING CROSS STRUCTURES HAS BEEN INDICATIVE TO HOST THE HIGHER GRADES AND LARGER VOLUMES OF ECONOMIC MINERALIZATION. THIS SCENARIO IS PART OF THE EXPLORATION MODEL AND HAS GENERATED A MULTIPLE DRILL TARGET ENVIRONMENT.  THE SPRING VALLEY EXPLORATION PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO TARGET AREAS THAT HAVE SIMILAR MAGNETIC SIGNATURES OF KNOWN ECONOMIC GRADE MINERALIZATION. THE MAGNETIC GEOPHYSICAL SURVEY WAS FURTHER STUDIED AND A STRUCTURAL INTERPRETATION WAS DEVELOPED THAT ILLUSTRATED MULTIPLE CROSS CUTTING STRUCTURES (COLORED GREEN) THAT ARE OBLIQUE TO THE SOUTHERLY PROJECTED NORTH/SOUTH VEIN TREND (COLORED RED), REFER TO FIGURE 4. THOUGH RARE DUE TO ALLUVIAL COVER, THE OUTCROPPING QUARTZ VEINS AND OUTCROPPING CROSSCUTTING STRUCTURES HAD DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSTIC MAGNETIC SIGNATURES. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE STRUCTURES AND VEINS WERE DERIVED BY CONNECTING THESE SPECIFIC MAGNETIC ATTRIBUTES AS IDENTIFIED ON EACH 25-METER SPACED SURVEY LINE. SIMILAR STRUCTURES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE DAYTON RESOURCE AREA AND WERE FOUND TO BE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC GRADES OF MINERALIZATION.  PELEN-SUTRO TUNNEL COMPANY ACQUISITION  IN JANUARY 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED 1,475,410 SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK AS INITIAL PAYMENT TO ACQUIRE 25% OF THE TOTAL MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS OF PELEN, LLC. PELEN, LLC IS THE 100% OWNER OF THE HISTORIC SUTRO TUNNEL COMPANY THAT OWNS THE TOWN OF SUTRO, THE HISTORIC 6-MILE SUTRO TUNNEL, THE FEDERAL LAND GRANTS AND MINING RIGHTS SPANNING 1,000 FEET ON EACH SIDE OF THE 6-MILE SPAN, THE RIGHTS TO THE TUNNEL\u2019S WATER AND THE PATENTED MINING CLAIMS AND PRIVATE LANDS ON GOLD HILL.  THE PURCHASE OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS WILL CLOSE BY DECEMBER 31, 2019, ONCE THE SELLER OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS HAS RECEIVED TOTAL CASH PROCEEDS OF AT LEAST $585,000 EITHER THROUGH SALE OF THE RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK RECEIVED OR THROUGH ADDITIONAL CASH PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY. IF ALL OF THE SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK HAVE BEEN SOLD BY THE SELLER OF THE MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS AND THE AGGREGATE PROCEEDS RECEIVED ARE LESS THAN $585,000, THEN THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE SHORTFALL IN EITHER ADDITIONAL SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK OR CASH, AT THE COMPANY\u2019S ELECTION.  THE COMPANY ISSUED 1,758,181 ADDITIONAL SHARES IN NOVEMBER, 2018.  NON-MINING REAL ESTATE  ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL THE INDUSTRIAL PARK AND WATER RIGHTS, FOR A CASH PURCHASE PRICE OF  $7.2 MILLION  . AFTER CLOSING, THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A RIGHT TO RECEIVE  3%  OF THE AMOUNT OF THE CARRIED INTEREST THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE FUND THAT PURCHASED SUCH PARTY IS DUE TO RECEIVE AFTER ALL COSTS, EXPENSES, INVESTOR HURDLES AND RETURNS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE GROSS PROCEEDS ARISING FROM ANY GAIN WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROPERTY BY THE BUYER.  DOWNTOWN SILVER SPRINGS, LLC, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, HOLDS A CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF APPROXIMATELY  160  ACRES OF CENTRALLY LOCATED LAND IN SILVER SPRINGS, NEVADA. ON FEBRUARY 25, 2019, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS RIGHTS UNDER THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT FOR  $2.5 MILLION  , AS ADJUSTED, DOLLAR FOR DOLLAR, FOR ANY ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS MADE BY THE PURCHASER OF THE OPTION TO THE SELLER OF THE PROPERTY, ON BEHALF OF DTSS. AFTER CLOSING, THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN A RIGHT TO RECEIVE  3%  OF THE AMOUNT OF THE CARRIED INTEREST THAT THE GENERAL PARTNER OF THE FUND THAT PURCHASED SUCH PROPERTY IS DUE TO RECEIVE AFTER ALL COSTS, EXPENSES, INVESTOR HURDLES AND RETURNS ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE GROSS PROCEEDS ARISING FROM ANY GAIN WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROPERTY BY THE BUYER.  31  THE GOLD HILL HOTEL IS LISTED FOR SALE FOR $1 MILLION. THE GOLD HILL HOTEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY CASH POSITIVE OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE DANEY RANCH IS LISTED FOR SALE FOR $3.9 MILLION.  OUTLOOK  OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES ARE PLANNED AT $3.8 MILLION, WITH APPROXIMATELY $1.2 MILLION OF THAT AMOUNT CURRENTLY BEING REIMBURSED UNDER THE EXISTING TONOGOLD OPTION AGREEMENT. WE ANTICIPATE AN ADDITIONAL $1 MILLION IN ANNUALIZED SAVINGS, OR A TOTAL OF $2.2 MILLION ANNUALLY, UPON CLOSING THE TONOGOLD AGREEMENT, ON OR BEFORE AUGUST 31, 2019. THIS WOULD RESULT IN AN EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF THE ENTIRETY OF OUR APPROXIMATELY $7.9 MILLION  OUTSTANDING SENIOR SECURED DEBENTURE OBLIGATION, ELIMINATING MORE THAN $1 MILLION OF ANNUALIZED INTEREST EXPENSE.  THE COMPANY\u2019S 2019 PLANS INCLUDE ADVANCING THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF CERTAIN MINING AND PROCESSING TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COLLABORATED ON, WITH PARTNERS SUCH AS HTX TECHNOLOGIES INC., CYCLADEX INC. AND ITRONICS, AND ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MERCURY RECLAMATION AND RECOVERIES, THAT PRESENT NEARER TERM REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES, ENHANCE OUR POTENTIAL PROJECT ECONOMIC FEASIBILITIES AND PRESENT ADDITIONAL REVENUE OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMPANY HAS ALSO COMMENCED COLLABORATING ON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANNING ACTIVITIES IN SILVER CITY ASSOCIATED WITH DAYTON MINE PLANNING. THE COMPANY ALSO PLANS ON UPDATING DAYTON\u2019S CURRENT RESOURCE ESTIMATE AND COMMENCE ACTIVITIES FOR OBTAINING THE LOCAL PERMITS FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT IN 2019. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO CONTINUE EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES SOUTHERLY INTO SPRING VALLEY WITH INCREMENTAL EXPLORATION PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDE EXPLORATION AND DEFINITION DRILLING OF TARGETS IDENTIFIED BY GEOPHYSICAL SURVEYS, SURFACE MAPPING, PRIOR DRILLING AND DEEPER GEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS THAT ALL LEAD TO PUBLISHING AN UPDATED, NI 43-101 COMPLIANT, MINERAL RESOURCE ESTIMATE FOR THE DAYTON PROJECT AND EXPANDED EXPLORATION IN SPRING VALLEY IN 2019.

DESCRIPTION  OF BUSINESS  BACKGROUND  WELLNESS  CENTER USA, INC. (\u201cWCUI\u201d OR THE \u201cCOMPANY\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED IN JUNE 2010 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF  NEVADA. THE COMPANY INITIALLY ENGAGED IN ONLINE SPORTS AND NUTRITION SUPPLEMENTS MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY  EXPANDED INTO ADDITIONAL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE AND MEDICAL SECTORS THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, INCLUDING PSORIA-SHIELD INC.  (\u201cPSI\u201d), NATIONAL PAIN CENTERS, INC. (\u201cNPC\u201d) AND STEALTHCO INC. (\u201cSCI\u201d), D/B/A STEALTH MARK,  INC. ON AUGUST 11, 2017, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO SELL 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF NPC, WHICH  HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION ON THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2016.  THE  COMPANY CURRENTLY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: (I) DISTRIBUTION OF TARGETED ULTRA VIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY  DEVICES FOR DERMATOLOGY; AND (II) AUTHENTICATION AND ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE SEGMENTS ARE OPERATED, RESPECTIVELY,  THROUGH PSI AND SCI.  PSI  PSI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JUNE 17, 2009. ON AUGUST 24, 2012, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF STOCK IN PSI. PSI IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND OPERATED BY PSORIA DEVELOPMENT COMPANY  LLC, AN ILLINOIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY (\u201cPDC\u201d), A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN WCUI/PSI AND THE MEDICAL ALLIANCE, INC.,  A FLORIDA CORPORATION (\u201cTMA\u201d).  17  ON  NOVEMBER 15, 2018, PSI AND TMA ENTERED INTO A WITHDRAW AND MUTUAL RELEASE AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THEIR JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT.  ON THE DATE OF TERMINATION, THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES OF THE JOINT VENTURE TOTALED  TO $405,383. UPON TERMINATION, DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY WROTE-OFF THE NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST\u2019S  SHARE OF THE ACCUMULATED LOSSES AND RECORDED A LOSS FROM DECONSOLIDATION OF NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST OF $405,383.  IN  DECEMBER 2018, PSI ENTERED INTO A JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT WITH GEN2 TO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, LICENSING AND/OR SALE OF  PSI TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS. THE JOINT VENTURE WILL BE CONDUCTED THROUGH NEO. PSI AND GEN2 WILL BE THE MEMBERS OF NEO, OWNING  50.5% AND 36.0%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE UNITS ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION OF NEO. AN ADDITIONAL 13.5% OF SUCH UNITS  WILL BE RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE AS INCENTIVES FOR KEY EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS. UNTIL SUCH SHARES ARE DISTRIBUTED, THE COMPANY  CONTROLS 68% OF THE JOINT VENTURE AND GEN2 THE REMAINING 32%. PSI AND GEN2 WILL MANAGE NEO\u2019S DAY-TO-DAY OPERATIONS. PSI  WILL CONTRIBUTE PSI TECHNOLOGY TO NEO AND GEN2 WILL CONTRIBUTE $700,000. REPAYMENT OF THE $700,000 INVESTMENT BY GEN2 WILL BEGIN  THROUGH AND UPON THE DATE WHICH NEO HAS REALIZED AND RETAINED CUMULATIVE NET INCOME/DISTRIBUTABLE CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF $300,000.  DISTRIBUTIONS THEREAFTER WILL BE MADE TO PSI, GEN2 AND OTHER MEMBERS IN PROPORTION TO THEIR RESPECTIVE UNIT OWNERSHIP, AT THE  TIMES AND IN THE MANNER DETERMINED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE MANAGERS, IN THEIR SOLE DISCRETION. GEN2 CONSISTS OF ACCREDITED INVESTORS,  AND INVESTMENT PARTICIPATION FROM SEVERAL WCUI OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS, INCLUDING CALVIN R. O\u2019HARROW AND ROY M. HARSCH.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, GEN2 HAD RECEIVED $475,000 OF INVESTMENTS TO CONTRIBUTE TO NEO AND THE COMPANY RECORDED ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE  OF $323,000 TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN-CAPITAL AND $152,000 TO NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019,  NEO RECORDED A NET LOSS OF $2,006 RELATING TO ITS OPERATIONS.  PSI  DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS A TARGETED ULTRAVIOLET (\u201cUV\u201d) PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE CALLED THE PSORIA-LIGHT. THE PSORIA-LIGHT  IS DESIGNATED FOR USE IN TARGETED PUVA PHOTOCHEMISTRY AND UVB PHOTOTHERAPY AND IS DESIGNED TO TREAT CERTAIN SKIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING  PSORIASIS, VITILIGO, ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA), SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS, AND LEUKODERMA.  PSORIASIS,  ECZEMA, AND VITILIGO, ARE COMMON SKIN CONDITIONS THAT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO TREAT, AND OFTEN CAUSE THE CLIENT SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOSOCIAL  STRESS. CLIENTS MAY UNDERGO A VARIETY OF TREATMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE SKIN CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ROUTINE CONSUMPTION OF SYSTEMIC  AND BIOLOGIC DRUG THERAPIES WHICH ARE HIGHLY TOXIC, REDUCE SYSTEMIC IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTION, AND COME WITH A HOST OF CHEMOTHERAPY-LIKE  SIDE EFFECTS. ULTRAVIOLET (UV) PHOTOTHERAPY IS A CLINICALLY VALIDATED ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR THESE DISORDERS.  TRADITIONALLY,  \u201cNON-TARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED BY LAMPS THAT EMITTED EITHER UVA OR UVB LIGHT TO BOTH DISEASED AND  HEALTHY SKIN. WHILE SUNBLOCKS OR OTHER UV BARRIERS MAY BE USED TO PROTECT HEALTHY SKIN, THE UV ADMINISTERED IN THIS MANNER MUST  BE LOW DOSAGE TO AVOID EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE OF HEALTHY TISSUE. TODAY, \u201cTARGETED\u201d UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES ADMINISTER  MUCH HIGHER DOSAGES OF LIGHT ONLY TO AFFECTED TISSUE, RESULTING IN \u201cCLEARANCE\u201d IN THE CASE OF PSORIASIS AND ECZEMA,  AND \u201cREPIGMENTATION\u201d IN THE CASE OF VITILIGO, AT MUCH FASTER RATES THAN NON-TARGETED (LOW DOSAGE) UV TREATMENTS.  TARGETED  UV TREATMENTS ARE TYPICALLY ADMINISTERED TO SMALLER TOTAL BODY SURFACE AREAS, AND ARE THEREFORE USED TO TREAT THE MOST INTENSE  PARTS OF A CLIENT\u2019S DISEASE. NON-TARGETED UV TREATMENT IS TYPICALLY USED AS A FOLLOW-UP AND FOR MAINTENANCE, CAPABLE OF  TREATING LARGE SURFACES OF THE BODY. EXCIMER LASER DEVICES (UVB AT 308NM) ARE EXPENSIVE AND CONSUME DANGEROUS CHEMICALS (XENON  AND CHLORINE). MERCURY LAMP DEVICES (UVB AND/OR UVA) REQUIRE EXPENSIVE LAMP REPLACEMENTS REGULARLY AND REQUIRE SPECIAL DISPOSAL  (DUE TO MERCURY CONTENT). ADDITIONALLY, MERCURY LAMP DEVICES TYPICALLY DELIVER WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT BELOW 300NM. WHILE WITHIN  THE UVB SPECTRUM, IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT WAVELENGTHS BELOW 300NM PRODUCE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE \u201cSUNBURN\u201d TYPE SIDE EFFECTS  THAN DO WAVELENGTHS BETWEEN 300 AND 320NM WITHOUT IMPROVEMENT IN THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT.  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT IS A TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE THAT PRODUCES UVB LIGHT BETWEEN 300 AND 320 NM AS WELL AS UVA LIGHT BETWEEN  350 AND 395NM. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE CONSUMPTION OF DANGEROUS CHEMICALS OR REQUIRE SPECIAL ENVIRONMENTAL DISPOSAL, AND IS COST EFFECTIVE  FOR CLINICIANS, WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN INCREASED PATIENT ACCESS TO THIS TYPE OF TREATMENT. IT HAS SEVERAL UNIQUE AND ADVANCED  FEATURES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE NON-TARGETED AND TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICES THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING  USED BY DERMATOLOGISTS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THESE FEATURES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE UTILIZATION OF DEEP NARROW-BAND  UVB (\u201cNB-UVB\u201d) LEDS AS LIGHT SOURCES; THE ABILITY TO PRODUCE BOTH UVA OR NB-UVB THERAPEUTIC WAVELENGTHS; AN INTEGRATED  HIGH RESOLUTION DIGITAL CAMERA AND CLIENT RECORD INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES; THE ABILITY TO EXPORT TO AN EXTERNAL USB MEMORY DEVICE  A PDF FILE OF TREATMENT INFORMATION INCLUDING A PATENT PENDING GRAPH THAT INCLUDES DIGITAL IMAGES PLOTTED AGAINST USER TRACKED  METRICS WHICH CAN BE SUBMITTED TO IMPROVE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS; AN ACCESSORY PORT AND ABILITY TO UPDATE SOFTWARE; EASE OF PLACEMENT  AND PORTABILITY; ADVANCED TREATMENT SITE DETECTION SAFETY SENSOR; INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE SUPPORT; A WARRANTY WHICH INCLUDES THE  UV LAMP(S); AND A NON-CHANGEABLE TREATMENT LOG (THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE HIPPA INFORMATION).  18  THE  PSORIA-LIGHT CONSISTS OF THREE COMPONENTS: A BASE CONSOLE, A COLOR DISPLAY WITH TOUCHSCREEN CONTROL, AND A HAND-HELD DELIVERY  DEVICE WITH A CONDUIT (OR TETHER) BETWEEN THE HANDHELD DEVICE AND THE BASE CONSOLE. PSI REQUIRES CLEARANCE BY THE UNITED STATES  FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (\u201cFDA\u201d) TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL AS PERMISSION FROM  TUV SUD AMERICA INC., PSI\u2019S NOTIFIED BODY, TO AFFIX THE CE MARK TO THE PSORIA-LIGHT IN ORDER TO MARKET AND SELL THE DEVICE  IN COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION.  TO  OBTAIN FDA CLEARANCE AND PERMISSION TO AFFIX THE CE MARK, PSI WAS REQUIRED TO CONDUCT EMC AND ELECTRICAL SAFETY TESTING, WHICH  IT COMPLETED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. PSI RECEIVED FDA CLEARANCE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2011 (NO. K103540) AND WAS GRANTED PERMISSION  TO AFFIX THE CE MARK ON NOVEMBER 10, 2011. IN ITS 510(K) APPLICATION WITH THE FDA (APPLICATION NUMBER K103540), PSI ASSERTED THAT  THE PSORIA-LIGHT WAS \u201cSUBSTANTIALLY EQUIVALENT\u201d IN INTENDED USE AND TECHNOLOGY TO TWO PREDICATE DEVICES, THE X -TRAC  EXCIMER LASER, WHICH HAS WIDE ACCEPTANCE IN THE MEDICAL BILLING LITERATURE AND HAS A LARGE INSTALLED BASE IN THE U.S., AND THE  DUALIGHT, ANOTHER COMPETING TARGETED UV PHOTOTHERAPY DEVICE.  PSI  HAS ESTABLISHED AN ISO 13485 COMPLIANT QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE PSORIA-LIGHT, WHICH WAS FIRST AUDITED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.  THIS SYSTEM IS INTENDED TO ENSURE PSI DEVICES WILL BE MANUFACTURED IN A CONTROLLED AND RELIABLE ENVIRONMENT AND THAT ITS RESOURCES  FOLLOW SIMILAR PRACTICES AND IS REQUIRED FOR SALES IN COUNTRIES REQUIRING A CE MARK. PSI HAS ALSO RECEIVED CERTIFIED SPACE TECHNOLOGY  DESIGNATION FROM THE SPACE FOUNDATION, BASED ON PSI\u2019S INCORPORATION OF ESTABLISHED NASA-FUNDED LED TECHNOLOGY.  PSI  BEGAN PSORIA-LIGHT BETA DEPLOYMENT IN JANUARY 2012. IT IS CURRENTLY OPERATING AT A LOSS, AND THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS BUSINESS  DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND STRATEGIES WILL EVER BE SUCCESSFUL. PSI\u2019S SUCCESS DEPENDS UPON THE ACCEPTANCE BY HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS  AND CLIENTS OF PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT AS A PREFERRED METHOD OF TREATMENT FOR PSORIASIS AND OTHER UV-TREATABLE SKIN CONDITIONS.  PSORIA-LIGHT TREATMENT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL TO CLIENTS, WITHOUT DEMONSTRABLE HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS OR SAFETY ISSUES,  AS EVIDENCED BY MORE THAN 10,000 TREATMENTS COMPLETED ON MORE THAN 1,000 CLIENTS, DOMESTICALLY AND MEXICO, SINCE 2012. IN ORDER  FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE PSI OPERATIONS, IT WILL NEED ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND IT WILL HAVE TO SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATE INTEGRATION  OF PSI OPERATIONS WITHOUT MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTING CONTINUATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER COMPANY OPERATIONS.  SCI  SCI  WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF ILLINOIS ON MARCH 18, 2014. SCI ACQUIRED CERTAIN STEALTH MARK ASSETS ON APRIL  4, 2014 AND OPERATES AS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. IT IS A TENNESSEE-BASED PROVIDER OF: A) STEALTH MARK ENCRYPTION  AND AUTHENTICATION SOLUTIONS OFFERING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES WITHIN THE SECURITY AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT VERTICAL SECTORS  (MICROPARTICLES)  ,  AND B) ADVANCED DATA INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFERING PROPRIETARY, UNPRECEDENTED, AND ACTIONABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES,  AND AGENCIES ON A GLOBAL SCALE (  ACTIVEDUTYTM).

SCI  DELIVERS THE CLIENT A COMPLETE, SIMPLE TO USE, EASY TO IMPLEMENT, AND COST EFFECTIVE TURNKEY SYSTEM THAT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT  TO COMPROMISE. SCI\u2019S TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE AND INTELLIGENT MICROPARTICLE MARKS THAT  ARE UNDUPLICATABLE AND UNDETECTABLE TO THE HUMAN EYE. THESE TAGGANTS ARE CREATED WITH PROPRIETARY MATERIALS THAT CREATE UNIQUE  NUMERICAL CODES THAT ARE ASSIGNED MEANING BY THE CLIENT AND ARE MACHINE READABLE WITHOUT THE USE OF RARE EARTH OR CHEMICAL TRACERS.  THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN COVERT AND OVERT OPERATIONS WITH EASY TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY AND DO-IT-YOURSELF IN-THE-FIELD FORENSIC  CALIBER VERIFICATION.  19  IN  APRIL 2018, THE COMPANY\u2019S SUBSIDIARY, SCI, CONCLUDED LICENSING OF A PATENT FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT IS THE NEXT GENERATION OF  STEALTH MARK. WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS AT THE OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABS, THE PATENT SIGNIFIES DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT  WILL GENERATE AN INVISIBLE MARKING SYSTEM WITH ATTRIBUTES CURRENTLY UNAVAILABLE IN THE ANTI-COUNTERFEIT MARKETPLACE TODAY. THE  FORMULA AND TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN SHOWN THROUGH EXTENSIVE TESTING TO BE RESILIENT TO MANUFACTURING PROCESSES AND CAN BE USED ON  A WIDE RANGE OF MATERIALS FROM WOVEN AND NON-WOVEN FABRICS, CARDBOARD, METAL, CONCRETE, PLASTICS, LEATHER, WOOD, AND PAPER. IN  ADDITION, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INFORMATION THAT CAN BE ENCODED WITH THE SYSTEM MAKES COUNTERFEITING DIFFICULT.  ACTIVEDUTYTM  SCI\u2019S  ACTIVEDUTYTM DATA INTELLIGENCE SERVICES OFFER UNIQUE, UNPRECEDENTED, ACTIONABLE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIES, COMPANIES, AND AGENCIES  ON A GLOBAL SCALE. COMPRISED OF A SUITE OF POWERFUL ANALYTICAL TOOLS, INCLUDING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOCIAL-PSYCHOLOGY,  THE SERVICE PROVIDES TIMELY AND ACTIONABLE INTELLIGENCE TO CLIENTS.

THE  PROPRIETARY ALGORITHMIC ARCHITECTURE OF ACTIVEDUTYTM CREATES THE FIRST SYSTEMIC REPORTING MECHANISM TO DELIVER STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL  RESULTS SUPPORTED BY AN INTENSE WORLDWIDE ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR. THE ACTIVEDUTYTM GLOBAL FRAMEWORK IS HEURISTIC  IN NATURE, CAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING BIG DATA ACROSS THE DIGITAL SPECTRUM AND SPEAKS ALL THE MAJOR LANGUAGES. UP UNTIL NOW, THERE  HAS NOT EXISTED A UNIFIED SYSTEM THAT COULD ACTIVELY MEASURE THIS LIFECYCLE THAT IS A COLLECTION OF DISCREET AND SEEMINGLY RANDOM  BEHAVIORS OF CRIMINALS ANYWHERE WITHIN THE DIGITAL DOMAIN. CRIMINALS CHANGE THEIR IDENTITIES BUT NOT THEIR BASIC BEHAVIORS.  DURING  THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT, SCI WAS MANAGED BY ITS CEO, RICKY HOWARD. MR. HOWARD BROUGHT TO SCI OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE  IN OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT AND EXECUTIVE POSITIONS IN A VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES RANGING FROM ENTREPRENEURIAL STARTUPS TO FORTUNE 500  COMPANIES.

LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  ACCOMPANYING CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE REALIZATION  OF ASSETS AND THE SETTLEMENT OF LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. AS REFLECTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING  CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET GENERATED SIGNIFICANT REVENUES AND HAS INCURRED RECURRING  NET LOSSES. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY INCURRED A NET LOSS OF $1,158,398 AND USED CASH IN OPERATIONS  OF $685,290, AND HAD A SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 DEFICIT OF $1,078,563 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019. THESE FACTORS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT  THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT  UPON THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS AND IMPLEMENT ITS STRATEGIES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE  ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IN  ADDITION, THE COMPANY\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, IN ITS REPORT ON THE COMPANY\u2019S SEPTEMBER 30,  2018 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, HAS RAISED SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  AT  MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD CASH ON HAND IN THE AMOUNT OF $62,170. THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT  ON THE COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE AND RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL SOON TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS  AND REPAY ITS LIABILITIES ARISING FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS WHEN THEY COME DUE. SINCE INCEPTION, WE HAVE FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS  PRIMARILY THROUGH EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO RELY ON THESE SOURCES OF CAPITAL IN THE FUTURE. DURING  THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $743,250 THROUGH SHORT-TERM LOANS, CONTRIBUTIONS OF CAPITAL BY A JOINT  VENTURE PARTNER AND THE SALE OF COMMON STOCK. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, LOANS PAYABLE TO OFFICERS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF $324,250 WERE  OUTSTANDING. ALL OF THE LOANS ARE UNSECURED, HAVE AN INTEREST RATE OF EIGHT PERCENT AND ARE DUE ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE.  AT MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING CONVERTIBLE NOTE OF $110,000 THAT WAS PAST DUE, BUT ON APRIL 2, 2019, WAS CONVERTED  INTO SHARES OF THE COMPANY\u2019S COMMON STOCK.  NO  ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT ANY FUTURE FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, THAT IT WILL BE ON TERMS THAT ARE SATISFACTORY  TO THE COMPANY.

MBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 DECREASED FROM THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN PRICING PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN SALES OF HIGH-VALUE MANAGED NAND PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS. MBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED FROM THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES OF HIGH-VALUE MANAGED NAND PRODUCTS AND MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS, WHICH MORE THAN OFFSET DECLINES IN PRICING. SBU OPERATING MARGIN FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DECLINED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN PRICING, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS AND INCREASES IN SALES VOLUMES. SBU OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2019 AND 2018 WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY FIXED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERUTILIZATION OF OUR SHARE OF IMFT'S CAPACITY. EBU OPERATING INCOME FOR THE THIRD QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED FROM THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018 AS A RESULT OF DECLINES IN PRICING AND HIGHER R&D COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTIONS.  OPERATING EXPENSES AND OTHER  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2018. SG&A EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 4% HIGHER, AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CONSULTING FEES AND LEGAL COSTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  R&D EXPENSES VARY PRIMARILY WITH THE NUMBER OF DEVELOPMENT WAFERS PROCESSED, THE COST OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT DEDICATED TO NEW PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND PERSONNEL COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE LEAD TIMES NECESSARY TO MANUFACTURE OUR PRODUCTS, WE TYPICALLY BEGIN TO PROCESS WAFERS BEFORE COMPLETION OF PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY TESTING. DEVELOPMENT OF A PRODUCT IS DEEMED COMPLETE WHEN IT IS QUALIFIED THROUGH REVIEWS AND TESTS FOR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY. R&D EXPENSES CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF PRODUCT QUALIFICATION.  R&D EXPENSES FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2019 WERE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED AS COMPARED TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019 AND  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2018. R&D EXPENSES FOR THE FIRST  NINE  MONTHS OF 2019 WERE 16% HIGHER AS COMPARED TO THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2018 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN REIMBURSEMENTS FROM OUR R&D COST-SHARING ARRANGEMENTS, INCREASES IN VOLUMES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRE-QUALIFICATION WAFERS, INCREASES IN DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN CAPITAL SPENDING, AND INCREASES IN LABOR COSTS.  WE SHARE THE COST OF CERTAIN PRODUCT AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UNDER DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS WITH PARTNERS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS TO JOINTLY DEVELOP 3D NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES WITH INTEL. OUR R&D EXPENSES WERE REDUCED BY REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THESE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER ARRANGEMENTS OF  $6 MILLION  IN THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , $23 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AND $53 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF  2018  . THE DECREASE IN R&D REIMBURSEMENTS IN THE THIRD AND SECOND QUARTERS OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN OUR JOINT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WITH INTEL FOR 3D NAND AND 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGIES. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2018, WE AND INTEL AGREED TO INDEPENDENTLY DEVELOP SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS OF 3D NAND. OUR 3D NAND JOINT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT WITH INTEL WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE AND INTEL WILL NO LONGER JOINTLY DEVELOP 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGY BEYOND THE SECOND GENERATION. WE EXPECT DEVELOPMENT OF THE SECOND GENERATION OF 3D XPOINT TECHNOLOGY TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020.  30  INCOME TAXES  OUR INCOME TAX (PROVISION) BENEFIT CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING.

THE REPATRIATION TAX AND OUR DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS WERE ALSO REDUCED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2019 DUE TO TAX ACT-RELATED LAW CHANGES. OUR PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX AND THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIOD OF 2018 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FOREIGN MINIMUM TAX.  WE OPERATE IN A NUMBER OF TAX JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITES STATES, INCLUDING SINGAPORE, WHERE WE HAVE TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH EXPIRE IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT VARIOUS DATES THROUGH 2034, THAT ARE CONDITIONAL, IN PART, UPON MEETING CERTAIN BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND EMPLOYMENT THRESHOLDS. THE EFFECT OF TAX INCENTIVE ARRANGEMENTS REDUCED OUR TAX PROVISION BY  $71 MILLION  (BENEFITING OUR DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY  $0.06  ) FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF  2019  , $244 MILLION ($0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019, AND  $527 MILLION  (  $0.43  PER DILUTED SHARE) FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER OF 2018.  OTHER  INTEREST INCOME FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 INCREASED 44% AND 72% AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE  THIRD  QUARTER AND FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019 DECREASED 64% AND 70% AS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING PERIODS OF 2018, RESPECTIVELY, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF CAPITAL SPENDING.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \u2013 EQUITY PLANS, OTHER OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, AND OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\" NOTES.  31  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR PRIMARY SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY ARE CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND FINANCING OBTAINED FROM CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. WE ARE CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING ALTERNATIVES FOR EFFICIENTLY FUNDING OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND ONGOING OPERATIONS.

THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND INVOLVE RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS AS TO FUTURE EVENTS THAT MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. ACTUAL OUTCOMES AND RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM WHAT IS EXPRESSED OR FORECAST IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES, SOME OF WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL, INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY VOLATILE, NEGATIVE OR UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE CONDITIONS ON OUR CLIENTS\u2019 BUSINESSES AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON GENERATING AND MAINTAINING ONGOING, PROFITABLE CLIENT DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH THE ADAPTATION AND EXPANSION OF OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ONGOING CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND OFFERINGS, AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SUCH DEMAND OR AN INABILITY TO RESPOND TO THE EVOLVING TECHNOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CLIENT DEMAND AROUND THE WORLD AND ATTRACT AND RETAIN PROFESSIONALS WITH STRONG LEADERSHIP SKILLS, OUR BUSINESS, THE UTILIZATION RATE OF OUR PROFESSIONALS AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  WE COULD FACE LEGAL, REPUTATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS IF WE FAIL TO PROTECT CLIENT AND/OR ACCENTURE DATA FROM SECURITY BREACHES OR CYBERATTACKS.  \u2022  THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, AND WE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.  \u2022  CHANGES IN OUR LEVEL OF TAXES, AS WELL AS AUDITS, INVESTIGATIONS AND TAX PROCEEDINGS, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION OR ENFORCEMENT, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.  \u2022  OUR PROFITABILITY COULD MATERIALLY SUFFER IF WE ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, IF WE ARE UNABLE TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, IF OUR COST-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE UNSUCCESSFUL OR IF WE EXPERIENCE DELIVERY INEFFICIENCIES.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  \u2022  AS A RESULT OF OUR GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE OPERATIONS AND OUR GROWTH STRATEGY TO CONTINUE GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION, WE ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CERTAIN RISKS.  \u2022  OUR BUSINESS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE INCUR LEGAL LIABILITY.  \u2022  OUR WORK WITH GOVERNMENT CLIENTS EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS INHERENT IN THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING ENVIRONMENT.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MANAGE THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR SIZE, WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE OUR BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.  \u2022  IF WE DO NOT SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE AND DEVELOP OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH KEY ALLIANCE PARTNERS OR IF WE FAIL TO ANTICIPATE AND ESTABLISH NEW ALLIANCES IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN BUSINESS AND EMPLOYEES MAY DEPEND ON OUR REPUTATION IN THE MARKETPLACE.  \u2022  WE MIGHT NOT BE SUCCESSFUL AT ACQUIRING, INVESTING IN OR INTEGRATING BUSINESSES, ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES OR DIVESTING BUSINESSES.  \u2022  IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT OR ENFORCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR IF OUR SERVICES OR SOLUTIONS INFRINGE UPON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR WE LOSE OUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OF OTHERS, OUR BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.  \u2022  CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING STANDARDS OR IN THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS WE MAKE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PREPARATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  \u2022  MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS INCLUDE PAYMENTS THAT LINK SOME OF OUR FEES TO THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE OR BUSINESS TARGETS AND/OR REQUIRE US TO MEET SPECIFIC SERVICE LEVELS. THIS COULD INCREASE THE VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND IMPACT OUR MARGINS.  \u2022  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND SHARE PRICE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROLS.  \u2022  WE MIGHT BE UNABLE TO ACCESS ADDITIONAL CAPITAL ON FAVORABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF WE RAISE EQUITY CAPITAL, IT MAY DILUTE OUR SHAREHOLDERS\u2019 OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN US.  \u2022  WE ARE INCORPORATED IN IRELAND AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR ASSETS IS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT, IT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO ENFORCE CIVIL LIABILITY PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES. WE MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRITICISM AND NEGATIVE PUBLICITY RELATED TO OUR INCORPORATION IN IRELAND.  \u2022  IRISH LAW DIFFERS FROM THE LAWS IN EFFECT IN THE UNITED STATES AND MIGHT AFFORD LESS PROTECTION TO SHAREHOLDERS.

THE LEVEL OF REVENUES WE ACHIEVE IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER MARKET-LEADING SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS AND TO DEPLOY SKILLED TEAMS OF PROFESSIONALS QUICKLY AND ON A GLOBAL BASIS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND LEVELS OF BUSINESS CONFIDENCE. THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY AND ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IN MANY MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD, WHICH MAY IMPACT OUR BUSINESS. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE IMPACT OF THIS VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY AND SEEK TO MANAGE OUR COSTS IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. THERE ALSO CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, INCLUDING THE EURO, U.K. POUND AND JAPANESE YEN. UNFAVORABLE FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES HAVE HAD AND COULD HAVE IN THE FUTURE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.  EFFECTIVE SEPTEMBER 1, 2018, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\u201cFASB\u201d) ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (\u201cASU\u201d) NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606). IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION, WE PRESENT TOTAL REVENUES AND NO LONGER REPORT REVENUES BEFORE REIMBURSEMENTS (NET REVENUES). THIS CHANGE HAS NO IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME BUT DOES AFFECT RATIOS CALCULATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, SUCH AS OPERATING MARGIN. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT THE FISCAL 2019 PRESENTATION. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 1 (BASIS OF PRESENTATION) TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNDER ITEM 1, \u201cFINANCIAL STATEMENTS.\u201d  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  4%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  8%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  .

DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CONTINUED TO BE STRONG, RESULTING IN GROWTH ACROSS ALL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  , REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN RESOURCES, STRONG IN PRODUCTS, COMMUNICATION, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE, AND SOLID IN FINANCIAL SERVICES. WE EXPERIENCED VERY STRONG GROWTH IN GROWTH MARKETS, STRONG GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA AND SOLID GROWTH IN EUROPE. REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY WAS VERY STRONG IN OUTSOURCING AND STRONG IN CONSULTING DURING THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  . WHILE THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT REMAINED COMPETITIVE, WE EXPERIENCED PRICING IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL AREAS OF OUR BUSINESS. WE USE THE TERM \u201cPRICING\u201d TO MEAN THE CONTRACT PROFITABILITY OR MARGIN ON THE WORK THAT WE SELL.  IN OUR CONSULTING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  3%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  7%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES, STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE AND PRODUCTS AND MODEST GROWTH IN COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES  . OUR CONSULTING REVENUE GROWTH CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY STRONG DEMAND FOR DIGITAL-, CLOUD- AND SECURITY-RELATED SERVICES AND ASSISTING CLIENTS WITH THE ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DELIVER COST SAVINGS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, AS WELL AS PROJECTS TO INTEGRATE THEIR GLOBAL OPERATIONS AND GROW AND TRANSFORM THEIR BUSINESSES.  IN OUR OUTSOURCING BUSINESS, REVENUES FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  INCREASED  5%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  10%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUES FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  6%  IN U.S. DOLLARS AND  9%  IN LOCAL CURRENCY COMPARED TO THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  . OUTSOURCING REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS LED BY VERY STRONG GROWTH IN RESOURCES, PRODUCTS AND COMMUNICATIONS, MEDIA & TECHNOLOGY, STRONG GROWTH IN FINANCIAL SERVICES AND SOLID GROWTH IN HEALTH & PUBLIC SERVICE. WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMAND TO ASSIST CLIENTS WITH THE OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF DIGITAL-RELATED SERVICES AND CLOUD ENABLEMENT. IN ADDITION, CLIENTS CONTINUE TO BE FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMING THEIR OPERATIONS TO IMPROVE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFICIENCY.  AS WE ARE A GLOBAL COMPANY, OUR REVENUES ARE DENOMINATED IN MULTIPLE CURRENCIES AND MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN FAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE HIGHER. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAINST OTHER CURRENCIES, RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION, OUR REVENUES, REVENUE GROWTH AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN U.S. DOLLARS MAY BE LOWER.  THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED AGAINST VARIOUS CURRENCIES DURING THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  COMPARED TO THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  , RESULTING IN UNFAVORABLE CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND U.S. DOLLAR REVENUE GROWTH THAT WAS APPROXIMATELY  5%  AND  4%  LOWER, RESPECTIVELY, THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY. ASSUMING THAT EXCHANGE RATES STAY WITHIN RECENT  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RANGES FOR THE REMAINDER OF  FISCAL 2019  , WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR FULL  FISCAL 2019  REVENUE GROWTH IN U.S. DOLLARS WILL BE APPROXIMATELY  3%  LOWER IN U.S. DOLLARS THAN OUR REVENUE GROWTH IN LOCAL CURRENCY.  THE PRIMARY CATEGORIES OF OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE COST OF SERVICES, SALES AND MARKETING AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. COST OF SERVICES IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE COST OF CLIENT-SERVICE PERSONNEL, WHICH CONSISTS MAINLY OF COMPENSATION, SUBCONTRACTOR AND OTHER PERSONNEL COSTS, AND NON-PAYROLL COSTS ON OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS. COST OF SERVICES INCLUDES A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES SUCH AS: CONTRACT DELIVERY; RECRUITING AND TRAINING; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT; AND INTEGRATION OF ACQUISITIONS. SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY: COMPENSATION COSTS FOR BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES; MARKETING- AND ADVERTISING-RELATED ACTIVITIES; AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE COSTS FOR NON-CLIENT-FACING PERSONNEL, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, OFFICE SPACE AND CERTAIN ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS.  UTILIZATION FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  91%  , CONSISTENT WITH  THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE CONTINUE TO HIRE TO MEET CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND.  WE PROACTIVELY PLAN AND MANAGE THE SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF OUR WORKFORCE AND TAKE ACTIONS AS NEEDED TO ADDRESS CHANGES IN THE ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, GIVEN THAT COMPENSATION COSTS ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR OPERATING EXPENSES. BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED FUTURE DEMAND, WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HEADCOUNT, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH SERVE OUR CLIENTS, TO APPROXIMATELY  482,000  AS OF  MAY 31, 2019  , COMPARED  TO APPROXIMATELY  449,000  AS OF  MAY 31, 2018  . THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OUR HEADCOUNT REFLECTS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR OUR SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS HEADCOUNT ADDED IN CONNECTION WITH ACQUISITIONS. ATTRITION, EXCLUDING INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS, FOR THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  WAS  18%  , UP FROM  17%  IN THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018  . WE EVALUATE VOLUNTARY ATTRITION, ADJUST LEVELS OF NEW HIRING AND USE INVOLUNTARY TERMINATIONS AS MEANS TO KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN CLIENT DEMAND. IN ADDITION, WE ADJUST COMPENSATION IN CERTAIN SKILL SETS AND GEOGRAPHIES IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN APPROPRIATE NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR PERSONNEL, COMPENSATION INCREASES  BECOME EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1ST OF EACH FISCAL YEAR.  WE STRIVE TO ADJUST PRICING AND/OR THE MIX OF RESOURCES TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF COMPENSATION INCREASES ON OUR GROSS MARGIN. OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR REVENUES AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OUR MARGIN COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO: KEEP OUR SUPPLY OF SKILLS AND RESOURCES IN BALANCE WITH CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR AMOUNTS OF SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS CLIENTS ARE DEMANDING; RECOVER INCREASES IN COMPENSATION; DEPLOY OUR EMPLOYEES GLOBALLY ON A TIMELY BASIS; MANAGE ATTRITION; AND/OR EFFECTIVELY ASSIMILATE AND UTILIZE NEW EMPLOYEES.

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES, DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2019  INCREASED  $0.46  COMPARED WITH THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2018  , DUE TO AN INCREASE OF  $0.37  FROM HIGHER REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS,  $0.05  FROM LOWER WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING,  $0.04  FROM LOWER NON-OPERATING EXPENSE AND  $0.01  FROM A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

IN GENERAL  WE PRESENTLY SELL OUR ANCILLARY GAMING  PRODUCTS IN THE UNITED STATES BUT CONTEMPLATE SELLING AND LEASING OUR PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE.  WE ARE CONTROLLED BY TWO INDIVIDUALS (OUR  PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) WHO DEVOTE APPROXIMATELY 25 HOURS A WEEK EACH OF THEIR TIME TO THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS OBTAINED THE LICENSE  FOR THE MANUFACTURING, SALE, MARKETING AND LICENSING OF THE FOUR ROULETTE PATENTS, AND CERTAIN OTHER PATENTS, WE HAVE NOT YET APPLIED  TO ANY STATE GAMING COMMISSION(S) TO SEEK APPROVAL TO SELL ANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS NOT, AS OF YET, ARRANGED FOR ANY  LINES OF CREDIT, AND WE HAVE NO COMMITMENTS, WRITTEN OR ORAL, FROM OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR SHAREHOLDERS TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH  ADVANCES, LOANS OR OTHER FUNDING FOR OUR OPERATIONS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRED MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES  AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ON AN ON-GOING  BASIS, WE EVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES, BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE  UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOES  NOT HAVE THE NECESSARY WORKING CAPITAL TO SUPPORT EXISTING OPERATIONS THROUGH 2018 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS HAD MINIMAL REVENUES AND  ACCUMULATED DEFICIT OF $897,156 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2018. OUR PRIMARY CAPITAL SOURCE WILL BE LOANS FROM STOCKHOLDERS. WE ARE SEEKING  TO DEVELOP AND MARKET THE PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES, MANUFACTURE AND SELL GAMING EQUIPMENT THAT WILL GENERATE CASH FROM OPERATIONS.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE INCURRED A LOSS AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED  EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLIANCE WITH THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.

WE ALSO PLAN TO FILE ALL REQUIRED  PERIODIC REPORTS AND TO MAINTAIN OUR STATUS AS A FULLY-REPORTING COMPANY UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

NO SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN MADE BY MANAGEMENT,  THE PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS OR OTHER STOCKHOLDERS, AND WE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS, PROPOSALS, ARRANGEMENTS OR UNDERSTANDINGS WITH  RESPECT TO THE SALE OR ISSUANCE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES.
