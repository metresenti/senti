IN FEBRUARY 2012, WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS  TO NO LONGER PURSUE OUR ORIGINAL BUSINESS PLAN (THE SALE OF CUSTOM FRAMED ARTWORK, ART ACCESSORIES AND INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTING)  AND, IN APRIL 2012, WE BECAME ACTIVE IN THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.  EFFECTIVE  SEPTEMBER 2, 2016, WE FORMALLY CHANGED OUR NAME TO PETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION, PURSUANT TO THE FILING OF A STATEMENT OF CONVERSION  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF COLORADO AND A CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF TEXAS, AUTHORIZED BY THE  PLAN OF CONVERSION WHICH WAS APPROVED BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS AT OUR APRIL 14, 2016, ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, EACH OF WHICH  ARE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14A, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION ON MARCH 23, 2016. IN ADDITION TO THE CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION FILING, WE FILED A CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION FILING  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF TEXAS (CORRECTING CERTAIN ERRORS IN OUR ORIGINALLY FILED CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION) ON AUGUST 24,  2016.  AS  PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ALTHOUGH THE STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE PLAN OF CONVERSION AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, PURSUANT TO WHICH OUR CORPORATE  JURISDICTION WAS TO BE CHANGED FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO TO THE STATE OF TEXAS BY MEANS OF A PROCESS CALLED A \\u201cCONVERSION\\u201d  AND OUR NAME WAS TO BE CHANGED TO \\u201cPETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION\\u201d, THOSE FILINGS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY MADE AND THE CONVERSION  DID NOT BECOME LEGALLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2016. SPECIFICALLY, ON JUNE 15, 2016, THE COMPANY FILED A CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION  WITH THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE, AFFECTING THE CONVERSION AND THE NAME CHANGE, AND INCLUDING A CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION AS A  CONVERTED TEXAS CORPORATION; HOWEVER, THE STATEMENT OF CONVERSION WAS NOT FILED WITH THE STATE OF COLORADO UNTIL A LATER DATE.  AS A RESULT, AND BECAUSE FINRA AND THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (DTC) HAD ADVISED US THAT THEY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONVERSION  OR NAME CHANGE, OR UPDATE SUCH RELATED INFORMATION IN THE MARKETPLACE UNTIL WE BECAME CURRENT IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS WITH THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THEY HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW AND APPROVE SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT THE  CONVERSION AND NAME CHANGE WERE NOT LEGALLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2016.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FILINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND FINRA AND THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (DTC) FORMALLY RECOGNIZING AND REFLECTING  THE EVENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE MARKETPLACE, THE COMPANY HAS FORMALLY CONVERTED FROM A COLORADO CORPORATION TO A TEXAS CORPORATION,  AND HAS FORMALLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO \\u201cPETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION\\u201d.  TWO  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS WERE MADE IN 2015 AND ADDITIONAL WORKING INTERESTS IN THE SAME PROPERTIES WERE ACQUIRED IN 2016 AND 2017,  AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, IN FEBRUARY 2018, WE ACQUIRED  BOW ENERGY LTD. AND ITS ASSETS (\\u201cBOW\\u201d), PROVIDED THAT IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE DIVESTED BOW, EACH AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER  DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW. DURING 2018, WE ACQUIRED AN AGGREGATE OF A 28% WORKING INTEREST IN  PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 41,526 ACRES LOCATED IN THE LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL, AND CUTHBERT FIELDS, LOCATED IN SOUTHWEST  SASKATCHEWAN AND EASTERN ALBERTA, CANADA, AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW.  17  PLAN  OF OPERATION  SINCE  2015, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CLEARLY DEFINED STRATEGY TO ACQUIRE, ENHANCE AND REDEVELOP HIGH-QUALITY, RESOURCE IN PLACE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON ACQUISITIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES AND CANADA WHILE ACTIVELY PURSUING OUR STRATEGY TO  OFFER LOW-COST OPERATIONAL SOLUTIONS IN ESTABLISHED OIL AND GAS REGIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR MIX OF ASSETS-OIL-IN-PLACE CONVENTIONAL  PLAYS, LOW-RISK RESOURCE PLAYS AND THE REDEVELOPMENT OF OUR LATE-STAGE PLAYS IS A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUED GROWTH AND FUTURE  REVENUE GROWTH.  OUR  STRATEGY IS TO ACQUIRE LOW RISK, CONVENTIONALLY PRODUCING OIL FIELDS. THIS STRATEGY ALLOWS US TO INCORPORATE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO  MINIMIZE RISK AND MAXIMIZE THE RECOVERABILITY OF EXISTING RESERVOIRS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  CAUSED BY EXPLORATORY DEVELOPMENT.  OUR  ACTIVITIES WILL PRIMARILY BE DEPENDENT UPON AVAILABLE FINANCING.  OIL  AND GAS LEASES ARE CONSIDERED REAL PROPERTY. TITLE TO PROPERTIES WHICH WE MAY ACQUIRE WILL BE SUBJECT TO LANDOWNER\\u2019S ROYALTIES,  OVERRIDING ROYALTIES, CARRIED WORKING AND OTHER SIMILAR INTERESTS AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS CUSTOMARY IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY,  TO LIENS FOR CURRENT TAXES NOT YET DUE, LIENS FOR AMOUNTS OWING TO PERSONS OPERATING WELLS, AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES. AS IS CUSTOMARY  IN THE INDUSTRY, IN THE CASE OF UNDEVELOPED PROPERTIES, LITTLE INVESTIGATION OF RECORD TITLE WILL BE MADE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION  (OTHER THAN A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF LOCAL RECORDS). HOWEVER, DRILLING TITLE OPINIONS MAY BE OBTAINED BEFORE COMMENCEMENT OF DRILLING  OPERATIONS.  MINERVA-ROCKDALE  FIELD  THE  MINERVA-ROCKDALE FIELD, WHICH IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES NORTHEAST OF AUSTIN, TEXAS, WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1921 AND IS  APPROXIMATELY 50 SQUARE MILES IN SIZE. THE MAIN PRODUCING FORMATION FOR THIS FIELD IS THE UPPER CRETACEOUS NAVARRO GROUP OF SANDS  AND SHALES. THE NAVARRO IS TYPICALLY SUBDIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PRODUCING ZONES FROM THE UPPERMOST \\u201cA\\u201d AND \\u201cB\\u201d  SANDS TO THE LOWER \\u201cC\\u201d AND \\u201cD\\u201d SANDS. THE \\u201cB\\u201d SAND IS THE PRIMARY PRODUCING ZONE. THESE SANDS  ARE COMMONLY FINE GRAINED AND POORLY SORTED AND WERE DEPOSITED CLOSE TO A SHORELINE DURING A CYCLE OF MARINE REGRESSION.  IN  APRIL 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LEASE PERTAINING TO A 423-ACRE TRACT IN MILAM COUNTY, TEXAS, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ORIGINAL 200 ACRE LEASE. THE COMPANY ISSUED 500,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS CONSIDERATION FOR A 100% WORKING INTEREST (83.33%  NET REVENUE INTEREST) IN SUCH LEASE.  IN  AUGUST 2013, WE BECAME AN OIL AND GAS OPERATOR AND TOOK OVER THE OPERATION OF 100% OF OUR WELLS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF  2014, THE COMPANY HIRED JOVIAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION (\\u201cJOVIAN\\u201d) TO SURVEY THE OPERATIONS AND WELL PERFORMANCE AT THE  NOACK FIELD. THEIR REPORT IDENTIFIED PARAFFIN BUILDUP PROBLEMS IN THE WELL BORES AND GATHERING LINES AS THE MAIN PRODUCTION ISSUE  FOR THE COMPANY TO OVERCOME. IN DECEMBER 2014, THE COMPANY SIGNED AN OPERATING AGREEMENT WITH JOVIAN TO ASSUME FULL OPERATIONAL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NOACK FIELD UNDER A FIXED FEE AGREEMENT OF $10,000 PER MONTH FOR FULL OPERATING FIELD SERVICES. ON MARCH  1, 2015, THE COMPANY HIRED ZEL C. KHAN, OUR CURRENT CEO AND DIRECTOR, WHO IS A STOCKHOLDER AND FORMER EMPLOYEE OF JOVIAN. THE  CEO AND PRESIDENT OF JOVIAN IS QUINTEN BEASLEY, OUR FORMER DIRECTOR (RESIGNED OCTOBER 31, 2018).  DURING  THE PERIOD FROM OUR INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT DRILL ANY OIL OR GAS WELLS. DURING THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2012, WE DRILLED AND COMPLETED SIX (6) OIL WELLS. DURING 2013, THE COMPANY DRILLED AND COMPLETED THREE (3) WELLS OF WHICH ONE  (1) WAS CONVERTED TO AN INJECTION WELL. DURING 2014, THE COMPANY DRILLED SEVEN (7) NEW WELLS. IN 2015, SIX (6) OF THE WELLS WERE  COMPLETED, FIVE (5) WELLS PRODUCED, ONE (1) DID NOT PRODUCE, AND ONE (1) WELL WAS NOT COMPLETED. DURING 2016, THE COMPANY HAD  THREE (3) WELLS PRODUCING, TEN (10) WELLS TO WORKOVER, WITH ONE (1) INJECTION WELL, ONE (1) THAT DID NOT PRODUCE, AND ONE (1)  WELL NOT COMPLETED. DURING 2017, THE COMPANY HAD FOUR (4) WELLS PRODUCING, TEN (10) WELLS TO WORKOVER, WITH ONE (1) INJECTION  WELL, AND ONE (1) WELL NOT COMPLETED. DURING 2018, THE COMPANY HAD SIX (6) WELLS PRODUCING, EIGHT (8) WELLS TO WORKOVER, WITH  ONE (1) INJECTION WELL, AND ONE (1) WELL NOT COMPLETED. DURING 2019 TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAD SIX (6) WELLS PRODUCING, EIGHT (8)  WELLS TO WORKOVER, WITH ONE (1) INJECTION WELL, AND ONE (1) WELL NOT COMPLETED.  18  ON  NOVEMBER 1, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT (\\u201cPSA\\u201d) WITH CROSSROADS PETROLEUM L.L.C.  AND HOUSTON GULF ENERGY (\\u201cHGE\\u201d) TO SELL 100% WORKING INTEREST IN THE NOACK FIELD ASSETS LOCATED IN MILAM COUNTY, TEXAS  (THE \\u201cNOACK ASSETS\\u201d). THE SALE AGREEMENT INCLUDED CUSTOMARY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES. HGE AGREED  TO PAY $375,000 FOR THE NOACK ASSETS PLUS $5,000 PER MONTH, ON A MONTH-TO-MONTH BASIS, UNTIL THEY ARE GRANTED OFFICIAL OPERATORSHIP  BY THE RAILROAD COMMISSION, THE PAYMENT PLAN WAS AS FOLLOWS: (A) A $13,500 DEPOSIT WHICH WAS MADE ON OCTOBER 12, 2018; (B) $121,500  WHICH WAS PAID ON NOVEMBER 7, 2018, (C) $60,000 WHICH WAS PAID ON FEBRUARY 8, 2019; (D) $65,000 WHICH WAS PAID ON FEBRUARY 28,  2019; AND (E) $125,000 WHICH WAS DUE MARCH 31, 2019 AND WAS NOT PAID. THE SALE HAD AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF NOVEMBER 1, 2018. UNTIL  PAID IN FULL, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED A SECURED LIEN AGAINST THE ASSETS SOLD WHICH COULD BE FORECLOSED UPON AFTER A 30-DAY CURE  PERIOD. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT ON THE PROPERTY OF $2,322,255 ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, TO WRITE IT DOWN TO ITS SALE PRICE.  UPON SALE, THE COMPANY DERECOGNIZED THE COST AND ACCUMULATED DEPLETION AND IMPAIRMENT WITH NO GAIN OR LOSS AND REMOVED THE CARRYING  VALUE OF THE ARO OF $246,263 FROM THE COST POOL OF THE UNITED STATES PROPERTIES. AS OF MARCH 31, 2019, THE BALANCE RECEIVABLE  FOR THE SALE OF $120,000 IS INCLUDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.  HGE  DEFAULTED ON THE PSA AS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND THE COMPANY TOOK PROPER MEASURES TO FORECLOSE ON THE NOACK ASSETS ON APRIL 3, 2019  AND RECLAIMED TITLE TO THE PROPERTY. THE PROPERTY WAS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD TO FLOWTEX ENERGY L.L.C. FOR $400,000 WITH AN EFFECTIVE  CLOSING DATE OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2019. THE SALE AGREEMENT INCLUDES CUSTOMARY INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES. AS PER THE  SALE AGREEMENT, A $20,000 DEPOSIT WAS RECEIVED ON AUGUST 15, 2019 AND A $355,000 PAYMENT ON AUGUST 30, 2019; A $25,000 PAYMENT  IS DUE ON AUGUST 30, 2020.  SLICK  UNIT DUTCHER SANDS (\\u201cSUDS\\u201d) FIELD  THE  SUDS OILFIELD CONSISTS OF 2,600 ACRES LOCATED IN CREEK COUNTY, OKLAHOMA AND CARRIES A 76.5% NET REVENUE INTEREST (NRI). THE FIRST  OIL PRODUCER WAS COMPLETED IN 1918 BY STANDARD OIL OF OHIO (\\u201cSOHIO\\u201d), WHICH AT THAT TIME WAS OWNED BY JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER.  BY 1959, APPROXIMATELY 14,000,000 BARRELS OF OIL HAD BEEN RECOVERED AT AN AVERAGE WELL DEPTH OF 3,100 FEET AND OVER 100 WELLS  IN PRODUCTION. THROUGH A SERIES OF EVENTS, THE INFRASTRUCTURE HAD DETERIORATED, AND THE FIELD SUFFERED A LOT OF NEGLECT. SINCE  2011, JOVIAN HAS INVESTED AN ESTIMATED $1.6 MILLION INTO THE RESTORATION OF THE FIELD; REBUILDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND PUTTING  WELLS BACK IN PRODUCTION. TO DATE, 22 WELLS HAVE BEEN WORKED OVER AND 9 ARE FULLY OPERATIONAL WITH CONSIDERABLE RESERVES REMAINING.  THE  COMPANY HAS DEVELOPED A NEW WELL DRILL PLAN ALONGSIDE ITS CONSULTANT GEOLOGIST, RKR SERVICES COMPANY, LLC. (\\u201cRKR\\u201d).  RKR INTERPRETED THE INITIAL POTENTIAL FLOW MAP, THE NET DUTCHER SANDS MAP, AND THE TOP OF DUTCHER SAND STRUCTURE MAP FOR THE OPTIMUM  LOCATIONS OF FIVE PROPOSED NEW DRILL WELLS IN THE SUDS FIELD. THE NEW WELL LOCATIONS ARE SITUATED IN THOSE LOCATIONS WHERE OIL  SATURATIONS ARE PROJECTED TO BE THE HIGHEST. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO DRILL THESE 5 WELLS IN THE 1  ST  QUARTER OF 2020,  FUNDING PERMITTED.  SUDS  10% ACQUISITION  THE  COMPANY ACQUIRED A 10% WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD LOCATED IN CREEK COUNTY, OKLAHOMA ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2015, IN EXCHANGE  FOR 10,586,805 SHARES OF RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK. BASED ON THE THEN CURRENT MARKET VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK, $0.068 PER SHARE,  THE PRICE PAID WAS $719,903 OR $4.77 DOLLARS PER BARREL OF OIL (BBL). THROUGH THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RESERVE  BASE BY APPROXIMATELY 151,000 BBLS OF (1P) PROVEN RESERVES. CONCURRENTLY WITH THE PURCHASE, JOVIAN AGREED TO ASSIGN TO THE COMPANY  THE RIGHT TO BE THE OPERATOR OF RECORD OF THE SUDS FIELD, GOVERNED BY AN AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PROFESSIONAL LANDMEN (AAPL) STANDARD  JOINT OPERATING AGREEMENT (JOA).  SUDS  90% ACQUISITION  ON  THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 90% NET WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD AS A RESULT OF TWO  SEPARATE AGREEMENTS, PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT AND THE SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT, BOTH BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND JOVIAN.  THE  COMPANY ISSUED TWO NOTES FOR A COMBINED VALUE OF $4,000,000 IN EXCHANGE FOR A CUMULATIVE 50% WORKING INTEREST IN SUDS. A PROMISSORY  NOTE TO JOVIAN FOR $1,000,000 WAS EXECUTED BEARING INTEREST AT 5% AND DUE ON DECEMBER 31, 2016 RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF A  50% WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD. THE PROMISSORY NOTE WAS SECURED BY A 12.5% UNDIVIDED WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD.  IN ADDITION, A PRODUCTION PAYMENT NOTE WAS EXECUTED FOR THE SAME 50% WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD. THIS NOTE WAS FOR $3,000,000,  PAID OUT OF TWENTY PERCENT (20%) OF THE 50% UNDIVIDED INTEREST OF NET REVENUES RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO  THE SUDS FIELD ASSETS. THE PRODUCTION PAYMENT NOTE WAS SECURED BY A 12.5% UNDIVIDED WORKING INTEREST IN THE SUDS FIELD.  19  THE  COMPANY ISSUED 24,308,985 SHARES OF ITS RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK TO JOVIAN TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 40% WORKING INTEREST OWNERSHIP  OF SUDS. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SHARES EQUATES TO A $4,373,186 VALUE, BASED ON THE $0.1799 PER SHARE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON  STOCK ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2016 (THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE TRANSACTION).

THE  COMBINATION OF THE TWO TRANSACTIONS RESULTED IN AN $88,755 LOSS WHICH WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2017. THE EXTINGUISHMENT  OF TRANCHE 2 WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2017, WITH NO IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS.  THE  COMPANY IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A 5 WELL DRILL PROGRAM WHERE 5 INFILL LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED ALREADY AND ARE PLANNED TO  BE DRILLED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FUNDING PERMITTING.  TWIN  LAKES SAN ANDRES UNIT (\\u201cTLSAU\\u201d) FIELD  TLSAU  IS LOCATED 45 MILES FROM ROSWELL, CHAVES COUNTY, NEW MEXICO AND CONSISTS OF 4,864 ACRES WITH 130 WELLS. THE LAST INDEPENDENT RESERVE  REPORT PREPARED BY MKM ENGINEERING ON DECEMBER 31, 2018, REFLECTS APPROXIMATELY 1.6 MILLION BARRELS OF PROVEN OIL RESERVES REMAINING  FOR THE 100% WORKING INTEREST.

PETROLIA OWNS A 100% WORKING INTEREST IN THE FIELD AND IS THE DESIGNATED  OPERATOR.  TLSAU  15% ACQUISITION  ON  NOVEMBER 4, 2015, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 15% NET WORKING INTEREST IN THE TLSAU FIELD LOCATED IN CHAVES COUNTY, NEW MEXICO (THE  \\u201cNET WORKING INTEREST\\u201d) AND ALL OPERATING EQUIPMENT ON THE FIELD. THROUGH THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY INCREASED  ITS RESERVE BASE BY APPROXIMATELY 384,800 BBLS OF (1P) PROVEN RESERVES. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO ASSIGNED ALL RIGHTS TO BE THE OPERATOR  OF THE TLSAU UNIT UNDER A STANDARD OPERATING AGREEMENT.  20  THE  TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THE NET WORKING INTEREST AND EQUIPMENT RIGHTS WAS $196,875 OR $0.52 PER BARREL OF  OIL (BBL) AND WAS PAID TO BLUE SKY NM, INC. (\\u201cBSNM\\u201d). THE COMPANY PAID $50,000 IN CASH AND GAVE A PROMISSORY NOTE  IN THE AMOUNT OF $146,875. THE $50,000 WAS PAID BY THE CEO OF THE COMPANY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY AND RECORDED AS A SHAREHOLDER  ADVANCE. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE $50,000 ADVANCE WAS CONVERTED INTO 800,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT $0.06 PER SHARE AND WARRANTS TO  PURCHASE 800,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT HAVE SINCE EXPIRED AS THEY HAD A THREE (3) YEAR TERM AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $0.10.

WITH THE INCLUSION OF THE NOTE RECEIVABLE, THE PRICE PER BARREL WOULD HAVE  BEEN $1.33 DOLLARS PER BARREL OF OIL (BBL).  TLSAU  25% ACQUISITION  ON  SEPTEMBER 1, 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL 25% WORKING INTEREST OWNERSHIP IN THE TLSAU FIELD IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE  ISSUANCE OF 3,500,000 SHARES OF ITS RESTRICTED COMMON STOCK TO AN UNRELATED PARTY. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF THE SHARES EQUATES TO  A $350,000 VALUE, BASED ON THE $0.10 PER SHARE MARKET PRICE OF PETROLIA\\u2019S SHARES ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2016. AFTER THE PURCHASE,  THE COMPANY OWNED A TOTAL WORKING INTEREST OWNERSHIP OF 40%. THE FINAL PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION OF THE TRANSACTION IS AS FOLLOWS.

AS A RESULT OF THIS TRANSACTION, PETROLIA  NOW OWNS A 100% WORKING INTEREST IN TLSAU. CONSIDERATION OF $465,788 WAS GIVEN IN EXCHANGE FOR DEAD AIM\\u2019S WORKING INTEREST.  THE CONSIDERATION INCLUDES THE FORGIVENESS OF THE BSNM NOTE OF $316,800 (WITH A $1.3 MILLION FACE VALUE) WHICH WE ACQUIRED IN  NOVEMBER 2015 AND THE WRITE-OFF OF $148,988 OF DEAD AIM\\u2019S OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TO PETROLIA. DEAD AIM ASSUMED  LIABILITY (PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION) FOR THE FORGIVENESS OF THE ORBIT PETROLEUM INC BANKRUPTCY ESTATE (\\u201cOPBE\\u201d) NOTE  THAT THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED.  SINCE  THE ACQUISITION OF THIS FIELD, THE COMPANY HAS WORKED ON VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND COMPLIANCE ITEMS REQUIRED BY THE  NEW MEXICO ENERGY DEPARTMENT. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS WORKED OVER TWENTY-ONE (21) WELLS. AS OF THE END OF THE 3  RD  QUARTER  OF 2019, THE COMPANY HAS RESUMED ITS WORKOVER PLAN TO BRING ADDITIONAL WELLS ONLINE AND UPDATE THE GENERAL FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE,  SUCH AS ELECTRIC LINES, FLOW LINES AND ROADWAYS.  THE  COMPANY IS ACTIVELY SEEKING A PARTNERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THE SAN ANDRES FORMATION AT THIS LEASE.  ASKARII  RESOURCES, LLC  EFFECTIVE  FEBRUARY 1, 2016, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 100% OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING INTERESTS OF ASKARII RESOURCES LLC (\\u201cASKARII\\u201d),  A PRIVATE TEXAS BASED OIL & GAS SERVICE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ASKARII BY ISSUING ONE (1) MILLION RESTRICTED SHARES  OF COMMON STOCK. BASED ON THE THEN MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK OF $0.05 PER SHARE, THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF  THE TRANSACTION WAS $50,000.  ASKARII,  WHILE DORMANT FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, HAS A SIGNIFICANT HISTORY WITH MAJOR OIL COMPANIES PROVIDING SERVICES BOTH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE-  GULF OF MEXICO. USING ASKARII, THE COMPANY PLANS TO ENGAGE IN THE OIL FIELD SERVICE BUSINESS AS WELL AS THE LEASING OF FIELD RELATED  HEAVY EQUIPMENT. IT IS ALSO CONTEMPLATED THAT ASKARII WILL RESEARCH VARIOUS ENHANCED OIL RECOVERY (EOR) TECHNOLOGIES AND METHODS  WHICH IT CAN USE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S OIL FIELDS.  BOW  ENERGY LTD., A RELATED PARTY  ON  FEBRUARY 27, 2018, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES IN BOW ENERGY LTD., WHICH HAS CONTRACTS COVERING A TOTAL  LAND POSITION IN INDONESIA OF 948,029 NET ACRES.  EFFECTIVE  ON AUGUST 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND CLOSED THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY A SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT WITH BLUE  SKY RESOURCES LTD. (\\u201cBLUE SKY\\u201d AND THE \\u201cEXCHANGE AGREEMENT\\u201d) TO SELL BOW ENERGY LTD. WHILE RETAINING A  20% INTEREST IN BOW\\u2019S SUBSIDIARY, BOW ENERGY INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS INC.

THE 70,807,417 SHARES  RETURNED TO TREASURY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED.  CANADIAN  PROPERTIES \\u2013 LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL AND CUTHBERT FIELDS  EFFECTIVE  ON JUNE 29, 2018, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 25% WORKING INTEREST IN APPROXIMATELY 41,526 ACRES LOCATED IN THE LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL,  AND CUTHBERT FIELDS, LOCATED IN SOUTHWEST SASKATCHEWAN AND EASTERN ALBERTA, CANADA (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\u201cCANADIAN PROPERTIES\\u201d  AND THE \\u201cWORKING INTEREST\\u201d). THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES CURRENTLY ENCOMPASS 64 SECTIONS, WITH 240 OIL AND 12 NATURAL  GAS WELLS CURRENTLY PRODUCING ON THE PROPERTIES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL IDLE WELLS WITH POTENTIAL FOR REACTIVATION AND  34 SECTIONS OF UNDEVELOPED LAND (APPROXIMATELY 21,760 ACRES). THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES AND THE WORKING INTEREST WERE ACQUIRED FROM  BLUE SKY (A RELATED PARTY, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE). BLUE SKY HAD PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED AN 80% WORKING INTEREST FROM GEOROX RESOURCES  INC., WHO HAD ACQUIRED THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES FROM CONA RESOURCES LTD.  ON  SEPTEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (\\u201cMOU\\u201d) WITH BLUE SKY TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS  TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 3% WORKING INTEREST IN THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES, INCREASING OUR WORKING INTEREST TO 28%. TOTAL CONSIDERATION  PAID FROM THE COMPANY TO BLUE SKY FOR THE ADDITIONAL 3% WORKING INTEREST WAS $150,000.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  REVENUES  OUR  OIL AND GAS REVENUE REPORTED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $819,340, AN INCREASE OF $789,360 FROM THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. A TOTAL OF $796,776 OF THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NEW OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANADIAN  PROPERTIES WHICH WERE ACQUIRED AFTER MARCH 31, 2018. REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR U.S. PROPERTIES TOTALED $22,564.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING  EXPENSES DECREASED BY $756,766, TO $1,240,514 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $1,997,280 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED OVER THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF $1,567,416  IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM HIGHS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE DECREASE WAS  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES OF $621,383 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR $186,058, BOTH RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION  OF THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES ON JUNE 29, 2018.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSE)  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE GAIN DECREASED BY $35,913, TO $17,425 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $53,338 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE RESULTED FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AGAINST THE CANADIAN  DOLLAR.  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, BY  $9,162. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN DEBT CARRIED DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  THE  COMPANY INCURRED A GAIN OF $19,075 FOR THE THREE-MONTH ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, RELATING TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE  LIABILITIES. A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED UPON ISSUING CANADIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED WARRANTS TO A DEBT HOLDER. THE GAIN  RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM TIME DECAY.  22  THE  COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS ON RELATED PARTY DEBT SETTLEMENT OF $203,349 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RELATING TO ACCRUED  SALARIES. NO SUCH LOSS WAS INCURRED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  THE  COMPANY INCURRED A LOSS OF $32,999,330 FOR THE THREE-MONTH ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION OF BOW ENERGY LTD.  NO SUCH LOSS WAS INCURRED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  NET  INCOME (LOSS)  NET  LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $413,600, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $35,146,405 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS IS DUE TO THE LOSS ON DISPOSITION OF BOW ENERGY LTD. OF $32,999,330,  WHICH WAS INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018, TO MARCH 31, 2019.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF $338,411 AND TOTAL ASSETS OF $12,586,952. OUR TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $2,736,319 AND OUR TOTAL LIABILITIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $5,024,938. WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL  OF $2,397,908 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  OUR  MATERIAL ASSET BALANCES ARE MADE UP OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND RELATED EQUIPMENT. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES ARE ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES, MAINLY CONSISTING OF ACCRUED OFFICER SALARIES OF $1,840,239,  IN ADDITION TO ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND NOTE PAYABLES OF $1,546,386 AND $1,640,375, RESPECTIVELY (SEE \\u201cPART I \\u2013  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 5. NOTES PAYABLE\\u201d, ABOVE FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS).  NET  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $190,283 AND $309,075 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN NET LOSS.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $120,000 AND $3,784 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FUNDS USED TO ACQUIRE THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $67,188 AND $231,880 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REPAYMENTS OF THE NOTES PAYABLE OF $156,330. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT SELL SECURITIES, WHILE THE COMPANY RAISED $238,675 DURING THE PRIOR COMPARATIVE PERIOD THROUGH  THE SALE OF SECURITIES.  THE  COMPANY CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT A NEGATIVE CASH FLOW OF APPROXIMATELY $35,000 PER MONTH WHICH RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR  ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. MANAGEMENT IS PURSUING SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO SECURE FUNDING TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AT  BOTH THE SUDS AND TLSAUS FIELDS WHICH TOGETHER WITH ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY REDUCE THE COMPANY\\u2019S  MONTHLY CASH SHORTFALL. THE TOTAL AMOUNT REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE IS APPROXIMATELY $500,000. THE SALE  OF THE NOACK FIELD AND THE ADDITION OF THE REVENUE FROM OUR 28% OWNERSHIP OF THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES HAS ENHANCED CASHFLOW AND  ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR SUDS AND TLSAU DEVELOPMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY HAS RESUMED WORKOVER ACTIVITIES AT SUDS  AND TLSAU AND EXPECTS PROGRESS TO CONTINUE PAST THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FUNDING PERMITTING.  THE  COMPANY HAS SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE PLAN TO GENERATE PROFITS BY WORKING OVER EXISTING WELLS AND DRILLING PRODUCTIVE OIL OR GAS  WELLS. HOWEVER, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO WORKOVER OR DRILL NEW WELLS THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES, THROUGH  LOANS FROM THIRD PARTIES OR FROM THIRD PARTIES WILLING TO PAY OUR SHARE OF DRILLING AND COMPLETING THE WELLS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY  COMMITMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS FROM ANY PERSON TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE  WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NEED TO CEASE OPERATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE CAPITAL NEEDED  TO DRILL OIL OR GAS WELLS NOR THAT ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ANY WELLS  WHICH WE MAY DRILL MAY NOT BE PRODUCTIVE OF OIL OR GAS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ACTIONS PRESENTLY BEING TAKEN TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL  FUNDING PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN  PREPARED ASSUMING THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ACCOUNT  FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY. MOVING FORWARD WE MAY SELL CERTAIN OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE FUNDS TO SUPPORT  OUR OPERATIONS AND FUTURE PLANNED OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS.  23  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT  ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OR CHANGE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  TRENDS  AFFECTING FUTURE OPERATIONS  THE  FACTORS THAT WILL MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE (I) THE SALE PRICES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS,  (II) THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION FROM OIL OR GAS WELLS IN WHICH WE HAVE AN INTEREST, AND (III) LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR REVENUES  WILL ALSO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OIL OR GAS PRODUCTION THROUGH EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  ACTIVITIES, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING TO COMPLETE SUCH ACTIVITIES.  IT  IS EXPECTED THAT OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH FLOW WILL BE FROM THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES  WHICH ARE DEPLETING ASSETS. CASH FLOW FROM THE SALE OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DEPENDS UPON THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCTION AND THE  PRICE OBTAINED FOR THE PRODUCTION. AN INCREASE IN PRICES WILL PERMIT US TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS TO A GREATER EXTENT WITH INTERNALLY  GENERATED FUNDS, MAY ALLOW US TO OBTAIN EQUITY FINANCING MORE EASILY OR ON BETTER TERMS, AND LESSENS THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING  FINANCING. HOWEVER, PRICE INCREASES HEIGHTEN THE COMPETITION FOR OIL AND GAS PROSPECTS, INCREASE THE COSTS OF EXPLORATION AND  DEVELOPMENT, AND, BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL PRICE DECLINES, INCREASE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES  DURING TIMES THAT PRICES ARE AT HIGHER LEVELS.  A  DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS PRICES (I) WILL REDUCE THE CASH FLOW INTERNALLY GENERATED BY THE COMPANY WHICH IN TURN WILL REDUCE THE  FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR EXPLORING FOR AND REPLACING OIL AND GAS RESERVES, (II) WILL INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING EQUITY AND  DEBT FINANCING AND WORSEN THE TERMS ON WHICH SUCH FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, (III) WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OIL AND GAS PROSPECTS  WHICH HAVE REASONABLE ECONOMIC TERMS, (IV) MAY CAUSE US TO PERMIT LEASES TO EXPIRE BASED UPON THE VALUE OF POTENTIAL OIL AND GAS  RESERVES IN RELATION TO THE COSTS OF EXPLORATION, (V) MAY RESULT IN MARGINALLY PRODUCTIVE OIL AND GAS WELLS BEING ABANDONED AS  NON-COMMERCIAL, AND (VI) MAY INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING FINANCING. HOWEVER, PRICE DECLINES REDUCE THE COMPETITION FOR  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCE THE PRICES PAID FOR LEASES AND PROSPECTS. DURING THE LAST 5 MONTHS, OIL PRICES  HAVE TRENDED UPWARD TO APPROXIMATELY $58.00 PER BARREL.  OTHER  THAN THE FOREGOING, WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY TRENDS, EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES THAT WILL HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO HAVE,  A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR SALES, REVENUES OR EXPENSES.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  SEE  NOTE 2 TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THE 2018 ANNUAL REPORT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. SEE  NOTE 2 TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT  ON FORM 10-Q FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE IMPACT OF RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION  OF ANY NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.  GOING  CONCERN  \\u2013 THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE  REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED CUMULATIVE  NET LOSSES SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND REQUIRES CAPITAL FOR ITS CONTEMPLATED OPERATIONAL AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO TAKE PLACE. THE  COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES IS UNKNOWN.  THE OBTAINMENT OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTEMPLATED PLAN OF OPERATIONS, AND  ITS TRANSITION, ULTIMATELY, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF PROFITABLE OPERATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE  ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVE THESE FACTORS RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN. THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME  OF THESE AFOREMENTIONED UNCERTAINTIES.  24\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"Petrolia Energy Corp\", \"CIK\": 1368637, \"Date\": \"2020-01-02T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"BBLS\", \"Name\": \"Rockdale Resources Corp\", \"Exchange\": \"OTCBB\", \"SIC\": 5020.0, \"Business\": \"TX\", \"Incorporated\": \"CO\", \"IRS\": 861061005.0, \"key\": \"20200102BBLS\", \"labelr1\": -1.1111111111110967, \"labelr2\": -35.95505617977528, \"labelr3\": -12.280701754385962, \"labelr4\": 0.0, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.58465195, \"prof1\": 0.41534808, \"return1&2\": 1.3746566791510613, \"return1&2&3\": 1.5434741660643492, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.5434741660643492, \"return2\": 1.3595505617977528, \"return1\": 1.0111111111111108, \"return3\": 1.1228070175438596, \"return4\": 1.0, \"1_day_return\": -1.111111111111096, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.2400679238013329, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3544, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9901320365303656, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9901320365303656, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9876703240228577, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9929401294386996, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9918971375439343}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3545, \"level_0\": 3638, \"index\": 41888, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

GOODWILL OF $893,000 RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THE ACQUISITION IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.  THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.8 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION.  INTEGRATED IS LOCATED IN SOUTH ELGIN, ILLINOIS AND GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $20.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR ITS FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE ACQUISITION CREATED ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY\\u2019S HIGH COLOR COMMERCIAL PRINT PRODUCT LINE.  ON JULY 31, 2018, THE COMPANY ISSUED AN AGGREGATE OF 829,126 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OF THE COMPANY, PAR VALUE $2.50 PER SHARE, TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT BUSINESS FORMS, INC., D/B/A WRIGHT BUSINESS GRAPHICS (\\u201c  WRIGHT  \\u201d), AS PARTIAL CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACQUISITION BY THE COMPANY OF ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY INTERESTS OF WRIGHT PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, DATED JULY 16, 2018 (THE \\u201c  MERGER AGREEMENT  \\u201d).  THE COMPANY SHARES ISSUED TO THE FORMER STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT REPRESENTED AGGREGATE CONSIDERATION UNDER THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $16.2 MILLION AT THE TIME OF ISSUANCE.  AN ADDITIONAL $19.7 MILLION WAS PAID IN CASH TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF WRIGHT, SUBJECT TO A FINAL WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT, AND $2.6 MILLION WAS PAID TO PAY-OFF OUTSTANDING DEBT.  THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED AS A PART OF THIS MERGER IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

ON APRIL 30, 2018, WE ACQUIRED THE ASSETS OF ALLEN-BAILEY TAG & LABEL (\\u201c  ABTL  \\u201d), A TAG AND LABEL OPERATION LOCATED IN NEW YORK, FOR $4.7 MILLION IN CASH PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF TRADE PAYABLES, SUBJECT TO A WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENT.  IN ADDITION, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION OF UP TO $500,000 IS PAYABLE TO THE SELLERS IF CERTAIN SALES LEVELS ARE MAINTAINED OVER THE THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE CLOSING.  ABTL GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS ACQUISITION TO BE IMMATERIAL.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MANUFACTURING, DESIGNING, AND SELLING BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER PRINTED BUSINESS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPERATE 62 MANUFACTURING PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN 21 STRATEGICALLY LOCATED STATES.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE BUSINESS PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE ARE CUSTOM AND SEMI-CUSTOM PRODUCTS, CONSTRUCTED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZES, COLORS, NUMBER OF PARTS, AND QUANTITIES ON AN INDIVIDUAL JOB BASIS, DEPENDING UPON THE CUSTOMERS\\u2019 SPECIFICATIONS.  21  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  THE PRODUCTS SOLD INCLUDE SNAP SETS, CONTINUOUS FORMS, LASER CUT SHEET  S, TAGS, LABELS, ENVELOPES, INTEGRATED PRODUCTS, JUMBO ROLLS AND PRESSURE SENSITIVE PRODUCTS IN SHORT, MEDIUM AND LONG RUNS UNDER THE FOLLOWING LABELS: ENNIS\\u00ae, ROYAL BUSINESS FORMS\\u00ae, BLOCK GRAPHICS\\u00ae, SPECIALIZED PRINTED FORMS\\u00ae, 360O CUSTOM LABELS  SM  , COLORW  ORX\\u00ae, ENFUSION\\u00ae, UNCOMPROMISED CHECK SOLUTIONS\\u00ae, VERSASEAL\\u00ae, AD CONCEPTS  SM  , FORMSOURCE LIMITED  SM  , STAR AWARD RIBBON COMPANY\\u00ae, WITT PRINTING\\u00ae, B&D LITHO\\u00ae, GENFORMS\\u00ae, PRINTGRAPHICS\\u00ae, CALIBRATED FORMS\\u00ae, PRINTXCEL\\u00ae, PRINTEGRA\\u00ae, FALCON BUSINESS FORMS  SM  , FORMS M  ANUFACTURERS  SM  , MUTUAL GRAPHICS\\u00ae, TRI-C BUSINESS FORMS  SM  , MAJOR BUSINESS SYSTEMS  SM  , INDEPENDENT PRINTING  SM  , HOOSIER DATA FORMS\\u00ae, HAYES GRAPHICS\\u00ae, WRIGHT BUSINESS GRAPHICS  SM  , WRIGHT 360  SM  , INTEGRATED PRINT & GRAPHICS  SM  , AND THE FLESH COMPANY  SM  . WE ALSO SELL  THE ADAMS MCCLURE\\u00ae BRAND (WHICH PROVIDES POINT OF PURCHASE ADVERTISING FOR LARGE FRANCHISE AND FAST FOOD CHAINS, AS WELL AS KITTING AND FULFILLMENT); THE ADMORE\\u00ae, FOLDER EXPRESS\\u00ae, AND INDEPENDENT FOLDERS\\u00ae BRANDS (WHICH PROVIDE PRESENTATION FOLDERS AND DOC  UMENT FOLDERS); ENNIS TAG & LABEL  SM  (WHICH PROVIDES CUSTOM PRINTED, HIGH PERFORMANCE LABELS AND CUSTOM AND STOCK TAGS); ALLEN-BAILEY TAG & LABEL  SM  , ATLAS TAG & LABEL\\u00ae, KAY TOLEDO TAG\\u00ae, AND SPECIAL SERVICE PARTNERS\\u00ae (SSP) (WHICH PROVIDES CUSTOM AND STOCK TA  GS AND LABELS); TRADE ENVELOPES\\u00ae, BLOCK GRAPHICS\\u00ae, WISCO\\u00ae, AND NATIONAL IMPRINT CORPORATION\\u00ae (WHICH PROVIDE CUSTOM AND IMPRINTED ENVELOPES) AND NORTHSTAR\\u00ae AND GENERAL FINANCIAL SUPPLY\\u00ae (WHICH PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND SECURITY DOCUMENTS).  WE SELL PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS TO MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. NORTHSTAR COMPUTER FORMS, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (WHERE A DISTRIBUTOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR AVAILABLE TO THE END-USER).  ADAMS MCCLURE, LP, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, WHERE SALES ARE GENERALLY THROUGH ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  THE PRINTING INDUSTRY GENERALLY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS EITHER DIRECTLY TO END USERS, A MARKET DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS R.R. DONNELLEY AND SONS, STAPLES, INC., STANDARD REGISTER CO. (A SUBSIDIARY OF TAYLOR CORPORATION), AND CENVEO, INC., OR, LIKE THE COMPANY, THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND DISTRIBUTOR GROUPS. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC STATISTICAL INFORMATION, TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHARE OF THE TOTAL BUSINESS PRODUCTS MARKET, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTING PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT, RANGING IN SIZE FROM SINGLE EMPLOYEE-OWNED OPERATIONS TO MULTI-PLANT ORGANIZATIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIC LOCATIONS AND BUYING POWER PERMIT US TO COMPETE ON A FAVORABLE BASIS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTOR MARKET ON COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS SERVICE, QUALITY, AND PRICE.  DISTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY DONE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, INCLUDING BUSINESS FORMS DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, DIRECT MAIL, COMMERCIAL PRINTERS, PAYROLL AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOFTWARE COMPANIES, AND ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  RAW MATERIALS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF A WIDE VARIETY OF WEIGHTS, WIDTHS, COLORS, SIZES, AND QUALITIES OF PAPER FOR BUSINESS PRODUCTS PURCHASED PRIMARILY FROM ONE MAJOR SUPPLIER AT FAVORABLE PRICES BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS.  BUSINESS PRODUCTS USAGE IN THE PRINTING INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY NOT SEASONAL. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTION OF THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS FORMS INDUSTRY ARE THE PREDOMINANT FACTORS IN QUARTERLY VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.  BUSINESS CHALLENGES  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  THE CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  22  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \\u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOG  IES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A PORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A PROACTIVE BASIS  WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS.  IN  ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PRESSURE SEAL PRODUCT  S, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MOLD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \\u2013 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 RESULTED IN THE DISSIPATION OF THE PRICING ADVANTAGE THAT FOREIGN IMPORTS HAD OVER DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS, WHICH IN TURN LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  THESE FACTORS GIVE DOMESTIC PAPER SUPPLIERS MORE PRICING POWER SINCE THEY CAN CONTROL THE SUPPLY OF PAPER BY ELIMINATING CAPACITY OR CHANGING THE PRODUCTS PRODUCED ON THEIR LARGE PAPER MACHINES.  DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY LEFT THE MARKET, WHETHER PLANNED (I.E., SWITCHING OF PRODUCTS TO ALTERNATIVE PAPER PRODUCTS) OR UNPLANNED (I.E., BANKRUPTCY).  CONSEQUENTLY, EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE RESULTED DURING THE LATTER PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL GRADES.  GIVEN THESE LEVELS, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRACTICE, SUPPLIERS RAISED PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE LATTER PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND EARLY PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIES.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS BEGAN TO FLOW BACK INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING OF DOMESTIC DEMAND, RESULTED IN RENEWED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, SPOT PRICING BECAME VERY COMPETITIVE.  THE UNCOATED PAPER MARKET HAS BALANCED SOMEWHAT, BUT OVERALL DEMAND REMAINS WEAK, AND MILLS HAVE DROPPED BACK TO MORE NORMAL OPERATING LEVELS.  WITH MORE CAPACITY SHUTS/CONVERSIONS PLANNED EXPECTATIONS ARE OPERATING RATES WILL SUSTAIN IN THE LOWER 90S.  WITH DECLINING DEMAND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, COMBINED WITH RISING IMPORTS, FALLING EXPORTS AND A MORE BALANCED MARKET, PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE UNTIL AT LEAST THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2021.  COATED PAPER DEMAND HAS DROPPED CONSIDERABLY AND, EVEN WITH SEVERAL MAJOR CAPACITY CLOSURES, OPERATING RATES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN LOW DURING THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, DESPITE A RECENT UP-TICK. CONTINUED CLOSURES/CONVERSIONS ARE EXPECTED BUT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE ENOUGH TO COMPLETELY BALANCE THE MARKET.  IMPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP WITH DEMAND, BUT THE HIGH DOLLAR COULD PUSH IMPORTS EVEN HIGHER WHICH COULD LEAD PRESSURE ON COATED PAPER PRICING.  HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \\u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DISTRIBUTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS WE HAVE HAD WITH OUR CUSTOMERS HISTORICALLY, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, ULTIMATELY WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.

OUR NET SALES WERE $114.9 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $108.1 MILLION FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $6.8 MILLION, OR 6.3%.  RECENT INCREASES IN FOREIGN IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICINGS LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF INTEGRATED (COMPLETED IN MARCH 2019) AND FLESH (COMPLETED IN JULY 2019) ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET ON GOING TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTION AND OTHER CHANGES.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $12.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $6.7 MILLION FROM $74.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 TO $81.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OR 9.0%. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\\u201c  MARGIN  \\u201d) WAS $33.8 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER, OR 29.5% OF NET SALES, COMPARED TO $33.8 MILLION, OR 31.2% OF NET SALES, FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OUR MARGINS CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR.    WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE MARGIN OF OUR OTHER PLANTS CONTINUES TO BE APPROXIMATELY 31.3%, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INTEGRATE THESE ACQUISITIONS INTO OUR BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201c  SG&A  \\u201d) EXPENSES WERE $19.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $19.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, A SLIGHT DECREASE OF $0.1 MILLION, OR 0.5%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 17.2% AND 18.5% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION.  AS PART OF OUR ON-GOING CORPORATE STRATEGY, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MORE FULLY LEVERAGE OUR SG&A EXPENSES.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $4,000 NET LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $193,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR\\u2019S QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $14.1 MILLION, OR 12.3% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $14.0 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONAL INCOME BY $1.1 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME WAS $180,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $114,000 EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS NEGLIGIBLE DUE TO THE PAYOFF OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER IN THIS FISCAL YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  25  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  NET EARNINGS.  NET EARNINGS, DUE TO THE FACTORS ABOVE, WERE $10.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $10.4 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE Q  UARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, A SLIGHT INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION.  NET E  ARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.41, COMPARED TO $0.40 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES WERE $331.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $300.1 MILLION FOR SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $31.6 MILLION, OR 10.5 %.  THE RECENT INCREASE IN SUPPLY OF CHEAPER FOREIGN PAPER IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICING LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  EACH OF THESE FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES.  IN PARTICULAR, OUR COMPETITION WAS ABLE TO BE MORE PRICE-COMPETITIVE DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAPER MATERIALS, AND SOME OF OUR SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WEATHER ISSUES.  OUR ACQUISITIONS POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $45.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $232.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $205.8 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $26.9 MILLION, OR 13.1%. OUR MARGIN WAS $99.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OR 29.8%.  THIS COMPARES TO 31.4% FOR THE SAME NINE MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  OUR MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED FOR THE MOST PART BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO THE NUMEROUS RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES TAKEN LAST YEAR, SOME OF WHICH COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY PASSED THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMER.  DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR, TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS WHICH COULD BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMER DUE TO APPORTIONMENT OF PAPER, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICALLY PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PASS THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\\u2019 ABILITIES TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  WE BELIEVE THESE PRICE INCREASES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THE EXCESS COSTS ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR UNTIL MATERIAL COSTS DECLINE IN THE MARKETPLACE.  RECENTLY, DUE TO CURRENT PRICING LEVELS AND THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS HAVE INCREASED AND CREATED EXCESS SUPPLY.  THIS HISTORICALLY HAS LED TO SOME NORMALIZATION/STABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE WHICH IS STARTING TO BE SEEN AS MATERIAL PRICES BECOME SOFTER.  OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST YEAR HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS AS WE TRANSITION THEM INTO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM. WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE MARGINS FROM OUR OTHER PLANTS CONTINUED TO BE ABOVE 31.5% DURING THE PERIOD, COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS AT THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED PLANTS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  OUR SG&A EXPENSES WERE $59.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $55.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF 7.1%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, THE SG&A EXPENSES WERE 17.8% AND 18.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ACQUISITIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. AS PART OF OUR ON-GOING CORPORATE STRATEGY, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MORE FULLY LEVERAGE OUR SG&A EXPENSES.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $4,000 NET LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $199,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $39.9 MILLION, OR 12.0% OF SALES, AS COMPARED TO $39.2 MILLION, OR 13.1% OF SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS, DURING THE PERIOD IMPACTED OUR OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE PERIOD WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION LESS THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO THE PAYOFF OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER IN THIS FISCAL YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  26  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  NET EARNINGS.  NET E  ARNINGS WERE $29.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $29.2 MILLION  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $0.5 MILLION.  NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $1.14, COMPARED TO $1.14 FOR THE SAME NINE MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON OUR CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY EXTENDED PURSUANT TO OUR SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \\u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \\u201d), TO MEET CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE PAYMENTS TO VENDORS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT REPAYMENTS AND RELATED INTEREST PAYMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN, WHICH COVERS APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR AGGREGATE EMPLOYEES (THE \\u201c  PENSION PLAN  \\u201d), AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NOVEMBER 30,  FEBRUARY 28,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $106,500  $134,542  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $61,313  $88,442  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $28.0 MILLION OR 20.8%, FROM $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO $106.5 MILLION AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.3 TO 1.0 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO 3.8 TO 1.0 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CURRENT RATIO WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $30.0 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ASC 842, WHICH INCREASED OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES BY $5.6 MILLION.  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $44,433  $36,667  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(21,469  )  $(30,855  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(50,093  )  $(21,224  )  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $7.7 MILLION FROM $36.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 TO $44.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: I) A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AND II) A $7.9 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR INVENTORIES.  THESE INCREASES IN OUR CASH WERE OFFSET BY A $2.8 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $9.4 MILLION FROM $30.9 MILLION TO $21.5 MILLION USED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.0 MILLION LESS USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS $8.7 MILLION LESS USED IN OUR ACQUISITIONS OF INTEGRATED AND FLESH IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IN COMPARISON TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF ABTL AND WRIGHT IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST FISCAL YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  WE USED AN ADDITIONAL $28.9 MILLION IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  WE USED $30.0 MILLION TO PAY LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, BUT PAID NO LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.  IN ADDITION, AN ADDITIONAL $0.9 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  WE USED $2.5 MILLION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $4.6 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, A DIFFERENCE OF $2.1 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY, WITH A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSE OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (A) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (B) THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET LEVERAGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING  27  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS  THAN 2.50:1.00.  ALL CALCULATIONS ARE MADE BASED ON GAAP EXISTING AT THE TIME THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ENTERED INTO.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND THE COMPANY HAD  $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $99.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL AS ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED.  PENSION PLAN \\u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN.  THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\\u201c  ERISA  \\u201d).  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT (HATFA) IN AUGUST 2014, WHICH EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE DISCOUNT RATES MANDATED FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A PLAN\\u2019S BENEFIT LIABILITY AND ANNUAL COST OF ACCRUALS, OUR MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION PLAN IS ZERO FOR THE PENSION PLAN YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020. ASSUMING A STABLE FUNDING STATUS, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $1.3 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  HOWEVER, CHANGES IN ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURNS OR IN DISCOUNT RATES COULD CHANGE THIS AMOUNT SIGNIFICANTLY.  WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019. AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDED AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD A NET PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION.  INVENTORIES  \\u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \\u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE WITHIN OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \\u2013  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 2, 2019, AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR THEN ENDED, THE RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ALL CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010K OF PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 2, 2019.  MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW  PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE \\u201cCOMPANY\\u201d) DIRECTLY IMPORTS MERCHANDISE FROM MANY COUNTRIES, AND SELLS A WIDE VARIETY OF DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE, CANDLES, HOUSEWARES, GIFTS AND SEASONAL PRODUCTS IN RETAIL STORES THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA AND ONLINE AT PIER1.COM. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS ONE OPERATING SEGMENT. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY OPERATED 942 STORES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 AND 39 WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 1, 2018, ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SEASONALITY FACTORS IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS. HISTORICALLY, THE STRONGEST SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER AND CONTINUING THROUGH DECEMBER.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, NET SALES DECREASED 13.3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR THIRD QUARTER AND COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 11.4% COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019; THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE SHIFT OF CERTAIN HOLIDAY SELLING DAYS, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR\\u2019S FISCAL THIRD QUARTER, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 650 BASIS POINTS. THE IMPACT OF THIS TIMING SHIFT IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER TRAFFIC. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $110.3 MILLION, OR 30.8% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $130.5 MILLION, OR 31.6% OF SALES, IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, A DECREASE OF 80 BASIS POINTS. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASED PROMOTIONAL AND CLEARANCE ACTIVITY COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AS WELL AS 190 BASIS POINTS OF DELEVERAGE IN STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS DUE TO LOWER SALES. THE COMPANY REMAINS ON TRACK TO REALIZE APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201cSG&A\\u201d) COST CUTTING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2020, BUT CONTINUES TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION AND ADVISORY COSTS, WHICH REDUCED THE BOTTOM-LINE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN COST CUTTING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  OPERATING LOSS FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $53.3 MILLION, OR (14.8%) OF SALES, COMPARED TO $28.9 MILLION, OR (7.0%) OF SALES, FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY REPORTED A NET LOSS OF $59.0 MILLION, OR $(14.15) PER SHARE, WHICH INCLUDES TRANSFORMATION COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO PROFESSIONAL FEES, AND A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $14.1 MILLION RELATED TO IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED STORE ASSETS, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $50.4 MILLION, OR $(12.49) PER SHARE, FOR THE THIRD  QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. PER SHARE FIGURES REFLECT THE COMPANY\\u2019S 1-FOR-20 REVERSE STOCK SPLIT EFFECTED ON JUNE 20, 2019. EBITDA (EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $(41.0) MILLION AND INCLUDES THE TRANSFORMATION COSTS AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGE REFERRED TO ABOVE. THIS COMPARES TO EBITDA OF $(16.9) MILLION IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. SEE \\u201cRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\u201d BELOW.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD $11.1 MILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, $189.5 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER ITS SENIOR SECURED TERM LOAN FACILITY, $96.0 MILLION OF CASH BORROWINGS UNDER ITS $350 MILLION SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (\\u201cREVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d), $50.0 MILLION OF BORROWINGS UNDER ITS FIRST-IN, LAST-OUT TRANCHE (\\u201cFILO TRANCHE\\u201d) AND $14.2 MILLION IN CASH BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER LOANS SECURED BY COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (\\u201cCOLI\\u201d).

RIESBECK WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS THE CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE COMPANY. CHERYL A. BACHELDER, THE COMPANY\\u2019S FORMER INTERIM CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, STEPPED DOWN FROM THE COMPANY AND WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPOINTED DONNA N. COLACO TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.  AS PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF EVALUATING A FULL RANGE OF STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES. THAT WORK IS ONGOING, WITH NO FORMAL CONCLUSION AT THIS TIME.  17  IN ORDER TO BETTER ALIGN ITS BUSINESS WITH THE CURRENT OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REDUCE ITS STORE FOOTPRINT BY UP TO 450 LOCATIONS. TO REFLECT THE REVISED STORE FOOTPRINT, THE  COMPANY ALSO PLANS TO CLOSE CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND  REDUCE  ITS CORPORATE EXPENSES, INCLUDING HEADCOUNT.  SEE  PART II, ITEM 5.

IN ADDITION, COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES INCLUDE ALL ORDERS PLACED ONLINE OUTSIDE OF A STORE. REMODELED OR RELOCATED STORES ARE INCLUDED IF THEY MEET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. THOSE CRITERIA INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: THE NEW STORE IS WITHIN A SPECIFIED DISTANCE SERVING THE SAME MARKET, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN STORE SIZE, AND NO SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP OR GAP BETWEEN THE STORE CLOSING AND REOPENING. SUCH STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES CALCULATION IN THE FIRST FULL MONTH AFTER THE REOPENING. IF A RELOCATED OR REMODELED STORE DOES NOT MEET THE ABOVE CRITERIA, IT IS EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION UNTIL IT MEETS THE COMPANY\\u2019S ESTABLISHED DEFINITION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  NET SALES \\u2013  NET SALES CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF SALES TO RETAIL CUSTOMERS, NET OF DISCOUNTS, RETURNS AND SALES TAX, BUT ALSO INCLUDED DELIVERY REVENUES, WHOLESALE SALES AND ROYALTIES, AND GIFT CARD BREAKAGE. NET SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $358.4 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 13.3%, COMPARED TO $413.2 MILLION FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE COMPANY OPERATED 45 FEWER STORES THAN AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 11.4%, COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER TRAFFIC. NET SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 WERE $977.3 MILLION, A DECREASE OF 14.3%, COMPARED TO $1.140 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERIOD OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED 12.5%, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR. THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES WAS A RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE CUSTOMER SPEND PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S MERCHANDISE MIX, AS WELL AS DECREASED STORE TRAFFIC. SEE  NOTE 6  OF THE  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  SALES AT THE COMPANY\\u2019S CANADIAN STORES ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY CONVERSION RATES.

GIVEN THE COMPANY\\u2019S CURRENT CASH POSITION, EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT REGARDING ITS ABILITY TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OBLIGATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS TAKING A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO SUPPORT ITS ONGOING TRANSFORMATION INCLUDING COST CUTTING, LOWERING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SEEKING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND REDUCING ITS STORE FOOTPRINT INCLUDING RELATED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND CORPORATE HEADQUARTER SUPPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY AS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COMPLETION OR SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE WOULD ALLEVIATE OR ELIMINATE THE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT. HOWEVER, AS THE ACTIONS ABOVE HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED OR FULLY EXECUTED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THEY CANNOT BE DEEMED PROBABLE OF MITIGATING SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT. ACCORDINGLY, SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT IS DEEMED TO EXIST ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IF THE COMPANY\\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM INCLUDES A QUALIFICATION OR EXCEPTION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IN ITS AUDIT REPORT AND OPINION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WITHOUT AN AMENDMENT FROM ITS LENDERS, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER EXISTING DEBT AGREEMENTS WOULD BE TRIGGERED.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\\u2019S MANAGEMENT CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THE EFFECT INFLATION MAY HAVE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  21\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"PIER 1 IMPORTS INC/DE\", \"CIK\": 278130, \"Date\": \"2020-01-06T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"PIR\", \"Name\": \"Pier 1 Imports Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 5700.0, \"Business\": \"TX\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 751729843.0, \"key\": \"20200106PIR\", \"labelr1\": -8.59903381642511, \"labelr2\": -17.970401691331933, \"labelr3\": -3.092783505154642, \"labelr4\": -6.9148936170212725, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.61726457, \"prof1\": 0.38273543, \"return1&2\": 1.281147164261421, \"return1&2&3\": 1.3207702724344548, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.412100131698539, \"return2\": 1.1797040169133193, \"return1\": 1.085990338164251, \"return3\": 1.0309278350515465, \"return4\": 1.069148936170213, \"1_day_return\": -8.599033816425106, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.2463911090262204, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3547, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9474578587524283, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9406974547768474, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.980581918264967, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9936552740678004, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9901235560436701}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3550, \"level_0\": 3643, \"index\": 37155, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES  OVERVIEW  AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO LESSEN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS MATERIAL TO NIKE, INC. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON THE UNDERLYING NET EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WHERE EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, OUR PROGRAM HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY IS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM OR STRATEGY FROM WHAT WAS DISCLOSED WITHIN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  REFER TO  NOTE 4 \\u2014 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  AND  NOTE 9 \\u2014 RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT EACH REPORTED PERIOD END.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE TRANSACTIONS WHICH SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.  \\u2022  PRODUCT COSTS \\u2014 PRODUCT PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE TRANSACTING ENTITY AND FACTORY INPUT COSTS FROM THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN FACTORIES.  \\u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES \\u2014 A PORTION OF OUR NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPEAN OPERATIONS ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G., THE BRITISH POUND) BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE SALES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.  \\u2022  OTHER COSTS \\u2014 NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, ALSO GENERATE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK, THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT.  \\u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\u2014 OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND MAY ALSO ELECT TO USE CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE REMAINING EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES, NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES AND OTHER COSTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.  TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  MANY OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS, OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  WITHIN  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  . THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED  REVENUES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $233 MILLION AND $546 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $347 MILLION AND $318 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION AND $152 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $73 MILLION AND $43 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  MANAGEMENT GENERALLY IDENTIFIES HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKETS AS THOSE MARKETS WHOSE CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD EXCEEDS 100%. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY WITHIN OUR APLA OPERATING SEGMENT IS OPERATING IN A HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKET. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019  , THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY CHANGED FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN FUTURE PERIODS BASED ON CURRENT RATES.  MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING, CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS AT NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER U.S. GAAP. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND/OR OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THE VARIABILITY OF THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THE COMBINATION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD. HEDGES OF THE PURCHASE OF U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.  WE ESTIMATE THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  HAD AN UNFAVORABLE  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $77 MILLION AND $92 MILLION ON OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOW ACTIVITY  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  WAS AN INFLOW OF  $1,306 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $2,825 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME  , ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, GENERATED  $2,906 MILLION  OF OPERATING CASH INFLOW FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $2,652 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  OF  $1,600 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF  $173 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PARTIALLY IMPACTED BY THE NET CHANGE IN CASH COLLATERAL WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AS A RESULT OF HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  , CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM COUNTERPARTIES DECREASED $167 MILLION AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $236 MILLION DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019  . REFER TO THE CREDIT RISK SECTION OF NOTE 9 \\u2014 RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY INCREASES IN  INVENTORY  AND  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, WHICH DECREASED  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  BY  $345 MILLION  AND  $244 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY HIGHER PAYMENTS RELATED TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION FOR EMPLOYEES.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WAS AN OUTFLOW OF  $788 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $245 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  , DRIVEN BY THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING SALES, MATURITIES AND PURCHASES) RESULTED IN A CASH OUTFLOW OF  $157 MILLION  COMPARED TO AN INFLOW OF  $381 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  WAS AN OUTFLOW OF  $1,868 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO  $3,290 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  , WITH THE DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD REFLECTING LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES AND AN INCREASE IN  NOTES PAYABLE  , PRIMARILY DUE TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  DURING THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE REPURCHASED  22.0 MILLION  SHARES OF NIKE'S CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR  $1,917 MILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $87.13  PER SHARE) UNDER THE FOUR-YEAR,  $15 BILLION  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2018. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD REPURCHASED  33.6 MILLION  SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.9 BILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $86.30  PER SHARE) UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT FUNDING OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL COME FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXCESS CASH AND/OR PROCEEDS FROM DEBT.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JULY 23, 2019, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (THE \\u201cSHELF\\u201d) WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) WHICH PERMITS US TO ISSUE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. THE SHELF EXPIRES ON JULY 23, 2022.  ON AUGUST 16, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS WHICH PROVIDES FOR UP TO $2 BILLION OF BORROWINGS, WITH THE OPTION TO INCREASE BORROWINGS UP TO $3 BILLION IN TOTAL UPON LENDER APPROVAL. THE FACILITY MATURES ON AUGUST 16, 2024, WITH A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION PRIOR TO ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, PROVIDED THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL IT EXTEND BEYOND AUGUST 16, 2026. THIS FACILITY REPLACES THE PRIOR $2 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON AUGUST 28, 2015, WHICH WOULD HAVE MATURED AUGUST 28, 2020. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  AND MAY 31, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF AA- AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN-OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS IN THE SYNDICATE, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $2 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT ANY POINT WAS $841 MILLION. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD $300 MILLION IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE OF 1.63%. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31,  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2019. WE MAY CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT SECURITIES DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1+ AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.  TO DATE, IN  FISCAL 2020  , WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CREDIT MARKETS OR INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS; HOWEVER, FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING  $3.5 BILLION  , PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTMENT GRADE TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT RISK. WHILE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES HAVE VARYING DURATIONS, AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DAYS TO MATURITY OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO WAS 32 DAYS.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO  NOTE 1 \\u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS INVOLVED IN THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DESCRIBED IN THE \\u201cMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u201d SECTION OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K HAVE THE GREATEST POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, SO WE CONSIDER THESE TO BE OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THE ESTIMATES WE USE IN APPLYING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE ARE NOT CURRENTLY AWARE OF ANY REASONABLY LIKELY EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD RESULT IN MATERIALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS BEING REPORTED.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"NIKE, Inc.\", \"CIK\": 320187, \"Date\": \"2020-01-07T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"NKE\", \"Name\": \"Nike Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 3021.0, \"Business\": \"OR\", \"Incorporated\": \"OR\", \"IRS\": 930584541.0, \"key\": \"20200107NKE\", \"labelr1\": -0.22597759874238946, \"labelr2\": -0.06893156080747727, \"labelr3\": -0.5715411903823396, \"labelr4\": 1.2487611496531128, \"pred\": 1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.4919448, \"prof1\": 0.5080551999999999, \"return1&2\": 0.9970524661033604, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9913539005698566, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.0037335429357437, \"return2\": 0.9993106843919252, \"return1\": 0.997740224012576, \"return3\": 0.9942845880961766, \"return4\": 1.0124876114965309, \"1_day_return\": -0.22597759874238846, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.26777097708862063, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3550, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0140789744413548, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9539415101996981, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9772306188447505, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9985266206683524, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9957147185316606}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3553, \"level_0\": 3646, \"index\": 52194, \"text\": \"ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS SECTION INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS RELEVANT TO AN ASSESSMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AND THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  GENERAL  FOUNDED IN 1906, SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. (\\u201cSSI\\u201d), AN OREGON CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\\u2019S LARGEST RECYCLERS OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP METAL, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AND A MANUFACTURER OF FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS.  OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL AND REPORTING STRUCTURE INCLUDES TWO OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING (\\u201cAMR\\u201d) BUSINESS AND THE CASCADE STEEL AND SCRAP (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) BUSINESS.  AMR SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL IN BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS. AMR ACQUIRES, PROCESSES AND RECYCLES AUTO BODIES, RAIL CARS, HOME APPLIANCES, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, MANUFACTURING SCRAP AND CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION SCRAP THROUGH  ITS 90  AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES. OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF AUTO BODIES IS OUR OWN NETWORK OF RETAIL AUTO PARTS STORES, WHICH OPERATE UNDER THE COMMERCIAL BRAND-NAME PICK-N-PULL. AMR PROCURES SALVAGED VEHICLES AND SELLS SERVICEABLE USED AUTO PARTS FROM THESE VEHICLES THROUGH ITS  51  SELF-SERVICE AUTO PARTS STORES LOCATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN CANADA. UPON ACQUIRING A SALVAGED VEHICLE, WE REMOVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS, ALUMINUM WHEELS AND BATTERIES FOR SEPARATE PROCESSING AND SALE PRIOR TO PLACING THE VEHICLE IN OUR RETAIL LOT. AFTER RETAIL CUSTOMERS HAVE REMOVED DESIRED PARTS FROM A VEHICLE, WE MAY REMOVE REMAINING MAJOR COMPONENT PARTS CONTAINING FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO WHOLESALERS. THE REMAINING AUTO BODIES ARE CRUSHED AND SHIPPED TO OUR METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES TO BE SHREDDED OR SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES WHERE GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE ECONOMICAL. AMR THEN PROCESSES MIXED AND LARGE PIECES OF SCRAP METAL INTO SMALLER PIECES BY CRUSHING, TORCHING, SHEARING, SHREDDING AND SORTING, RESULTING IN SCRAP METAL PIECES OF A SIZE, DENSITY AND METAL CONTENT REQUIRED BY CUSTOMERS TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION NEEDS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS INCLUDES PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS MATERIALS THROUGH AUTOMATED AND MANUAL PROCESSES INTO VARIOUS SUB-CLASSIFICATIONS, EACH OF WHICH HAS A VALUE AND METAL CONTENT USED BY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR END PRODUCTS. AMR USES A VARIETY OF SHREDDING AND SEPARATION SYSTEMS TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS AND SORT RECYCLED SCRAP METAL.  CSS OPERATES A STEEL MINI-MILL IN MCMINNVILLE, OREGON THAT PRODUCES A RANGE OF FINISHED STEEL LONG PRODUCTS SUCH AS REINFORCING BAR (REBAR) AND WIRE ROD. THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ITS PRODUCTS IS FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL. CSS\\u2019S STEEL MILL OBTAINS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS SCRAP METAL RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS FROM ITS INTEGRATED METALS RECYCLING AND JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS. CSS\\u2019S METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS COMPRISE A COLLECTION, SHREDDING AND EXPORT OPERATION IN PORTLAND, OREGON, FOUR FEEDER YARD OPERATIONS LOCATED IN OREGON AND SOUTHERN WASHINGTON, AND ONE METALS RECYCLING JOINT VENTURE OWNERSHIP INTEREST. ADDITIONALLY, CSS PURCHASES SMALL VOLUMES OF FERROUS SCRAP METAL FROM AMR AND SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL PRIMARILY INTO THE EXPORT MARKET.  WE USE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO MEASURE OUR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CORPORATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE TO OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO SHARED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ALLOCATED FROM CORPORATE TO THE SEGMENTS. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF EXPENSE FOR MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THAT BENEFIT BOTH REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CERTAIN ITEMS TO SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BECAUSE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFORMATION IN ITS MEASUREMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. SUCH UNALLOCATED ITEMS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES, CHARGES (NET OF RECOVERIES) RELATED TO LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, AND PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS. BECAUSE OF THE UNALLOCATED INCOME AND EXPENSE, THE OPERATING INCOME OF EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT DOES NOT REFLECT THE OPERATING INCOME THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT WOULD REPORT AS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY, NET OF TAX, FROM THE RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR RECYCLED METAL IN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS AND ON THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AVAILABLE TO BE PROCESSED AT OUR FACILITIES. WE RESPOND TO CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES FOR PROCESSED METAL BY SEEKING TO ADJUST PURCHASE PRICES FOR UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING INCOME. WE BELIEVE WE GENERALLY BENEFIT FROM SUSTAINED PERIODS OF STABLE OR RISING RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES, WHICH ALLOW US TO BETTER MAINTAIN OR INCREASE BOTH OPERATING INCOME AND UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL FLOW INTO OUR FACILITIES. WHEN RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES DECLINE, EITHER SHARPLY OR FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD, OUR OPERATING MARGINS TYPICALLY COMPRESS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  OUR DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES ON BOTH THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF THE U.S. (IN EVERETT, MASSACHUSETTS; PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND; OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA; TACOMA, WASHINGTON; AND PORTLAND, OREGON) AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES (IN KAPOLEI, HAWAII AND SALINAS, PUERTO RICO) ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY MEET THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR RECYCLED FERROUS METAL BY ENABLING US TO SHIP BULK CARGOES TO STEEL MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. OUR EXPORTS OF NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL ARE SHIPPED IN CONTAINERS THROUGH VARIOUS PUBLIC DOCKS TO SPECIALTY STEELMAKERS, FOUNDRIES, ALUMINUM SHEET AND INGOT MANUFACTURERS, COPPER REFINERIES AND SMELTERS, BRASS AND BRONZE INGOT MANUFACTURERS, WIRE AND CABLE PRODUCERS, WHOLESALERS, AND OTHER RECYCLED METAL PROCESSORS GLOBALLY. WE ALSO TRANSPORT BOTH FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS BY TRUCK, RAIL AND BARGE IN ORDER TO TRANSFER SCRAP METAL BETWEEN OUR FACILITIES FOR FURTHER PROCESSING, TO LOAD SHIPMENTS AT OUR EXPORT FACILITIES, AND TO MEET REGIONAL DOMESTIC DEMAND.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE MANUFACTURE OF WHICH USES INTERNALLY SOURCED FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL AS THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK, AS WELL AS OTHER RAW MATERIALS. OUR STEEL MILL IN OREGON SELLS TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA.  OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS FOR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL AND FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL IN OUR DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND VARYING DEMAND FOR USED AUTO PARTS FROM OUR SELF-SERVICE RETAIL STORES. CERTAIN OF THESE FACTORS ARE INFLUENCED, TO A DEGREE, BY THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL CHANGES INCLUDING SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND INHIBIT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY UTILIZING OUR PRODUCTS, SCRAP METAL COLLECTION AT OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS IN OUR YARDS, AND RETAIL ADMISSIONS AND PARTS SALES AT OUR AUTO PARTS STORES. FURTHER, TRADE ACTIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANY RETALIATION BY AFFECTED COUNTRIES, AND LICENSING AND INSPECTION REQUIREMENTS CAN IMPACT THE LEVEL OF PROFITABILITY ON SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, IMPEDE OR RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO SELL TO CERTAIN EXPORT MARKETS OR REQUIRE US TO DIRECT OUR SALES TO ALTERNATIVE MARKET DESTINATIONS, WHICH CAN CAUSE OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE.  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WE GENERATED CONSOLIDATED REVENUES OF  $406 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020,  A DECREASE  OF  28%  FROM THE $564 MILLION OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO  SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS PRODUCTS, IN BOTH EXPORT AND DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND REDUCED SALES VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THESE DECREASES WERE DRIVEN BY WEAKER MARKET CONDITIONS FOR RECYCLED METALS GLOBALLY PRIMARILY DUE TO SOFTER DEMAND FOR FINISHED STEEL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE MARKET FOR CERTAIN RECYCLED NONFERROUS PRODUCTS RESULTING FROM CHINESE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND TARIFFS. MARKET SELLING PRICES FOR FERROUS RECYCLED METAL DECLINED SHARPLY BY APPROXIMATELY $60 PER TON, OR APPROXIMATELY 20%, BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2019, BEFORE PARTIALLY RECOVERING IN NOVEMBER. COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS PRODUCTS AT AMR DECREASED BY 28% AND FERROUS SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 10%, REFLECTING WEAKER DEMAND GLOBALLY AND REDUCED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES DUE TO THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT. NONFERROUS REVENUES AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 14% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AS NONFERROUS AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES AND SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 8% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY. S  TEEL REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  DECREASED BY 24% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS AND DECREASED SALES VOLUMES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING LOSS  WAS $(8) MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO INCOME OF $23 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING LOSS WAS  $(4) MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO INCOME OF $23 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME FOR EACH PERIOD EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, NET OF RECOVERIES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES. SEE THE RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME IN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE END OF THIS ITEM 2.  AMR REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF  $(2) MILLION  , COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $23 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE SHARPLY  DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT DURING MOST OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 HAD A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING MARGINS AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR FOR THE PERIOD. FERROUS METAL SPREADS AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 20% AND AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR AMR\\u2019S NONFERROUS JOINT PRODUCTS THAT ARE RECOVERED FROM THE SHREDDING PROCESS, COMPRISING PRIMARILY ZORBA, DECREASED BY 12%, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. IN THE SHARPLY DECLINING COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENT, AVERAGE INVENTORY COSTS DID NOT DECREASE AS QUICKLY AS PURCHASE  COSTS FOR SCRAP METAL, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR. IN ADDITION, THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER PROCESSED VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE MARKET CONDITIONS ON AMR\\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  CSS REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF  $4 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $12 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT FOR FINISHED STEEL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FINISHED STEEL AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES DECLINED  $104  PER TON,  OR 14%,  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH LED TO A  COMPRESSION OF FINISHED STEEL MARGINS AS DECREASES IN SELLING PRICES OUTPACED THE REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. THE EFFECTS OF FINISHED STEEL MARGIN COMPRESSION WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES. CSS OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 REFLECTED HIGHER FINISHED STEEL MARGINS COMPARED TO THE CURRENT QUARTER, SUPPORTED BY THE HIGHER AND RISING PRICE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201cSG&A\\u201d) EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY  $5 MILLION  , OR 9%, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6 MILLION  DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING FROM LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER AT AMR.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE INVESTED $24 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AT SEVERAL OF OUR MAJOR EXPORT FACILITIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL DELIVER BENEFITS TO OUR PROFITABILITY BEGINNING IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $125 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING $60 MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, INCLUDING ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND TO SUPPORT VOLUME INITIATIVES AND OTHER GROWTH PROJECTS.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  NET LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SSI SHAREHOLDERS IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  $(7) MILLION  ,  OR  $(0.26)  PER  DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $16 MILLION  , OR  $0.57  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. ADJUSTED NET LOSS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SSI SHAREHOLDERS IN THE  FIRST QUARTER  OF FISCAL  2020  WAS  $(5) MILLION  ,  OR  $(0.17)  PER  DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF  $17 MILLION  , OR  $0.59  PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.

AMR SEGMENT REVENUES  REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  DECREASED  BY 28% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO  SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS PRODUCTS, IN BOTH EXPORT AND DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND REDUCED SALES VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  THESE DECREASES WERE DRIVEN BY WEAKER MARKET CONDITIONS FOR RECYCLED METALS GLOBALLY PRIMARILY DUE TO SOFTER DEMAND FOR FINISHED STEEL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE MARKET FOR CERTAIN RECYCLED NONFERROUS PRODUCTS. MARKET SELLING PRICES FOR FERROUS RECYCLED METAL DECLINED SHARPLY BY APPROXIMATELY $60 PER TON, OR APPROXIMATELY 20%, BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND EARLY OCTOBER 2019, BEFORE PARTIALLY RECOVERING IN NOVEMBER. COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR SHIPMENTS OF FERROUS PRODUCTS AT AMR DECREASED BY 28% AND FERROUS SALES VOLUMES DECREASED BY 10%, REFLECTING WEAKER DEMAND GLOBALLY AND REDUCED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES DUE TO THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT.  NONFERROUS REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  DECREASED  BY 14% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AS NONFERROUS AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES AND SALES VOLUMES  DECREASED BY 8% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY.  AMR SEGMENT OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME  OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS $(2) MILLION COMPARED TO $23 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE SHARPLY  DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT DURING MOST OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 HAD A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING MARGINS AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR FOR THE PERIOD. FERROUS METAL SPREADS AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 20% AND AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR AMR\\u2019S NONFERROUS JOINT PRODUCTS THAT ARE RECOVERED FROM THE SHREDDING PROCESS, COMPRISING PRIMARILY ZORBA, DECREASED BY 12%, COMPARED TO THE  PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. IN THE SHARPLY DECLINING COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENT, AVERAGE INVENTORY COSTS DID NOT DECREASE AS QUICKLY AS PURCHASE COSTS FOR SCRAP METAL, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR. IN ADDITION, THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER PROCESSED VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE MARKET CONDITIONS ON AMR\\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED $8 MILLION IN POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A LIMITED-DURATION CONTRACT, WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AT THE END OF FISCAL 2019, AND WHICH HAD PROVIDED A HIGH MARGIN SOURCE OF SUPPLY.  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.

CSS SEGMENT REVENUES  REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  DECREASED  BY  $36 MILLION  , OR 28% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER REFLECTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, LOWER FINISHED STEEL SALES  VOLUMES AND DECREASED SALES OF FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL.  CSS SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME  OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL  2020  WAS $4 MILLION COMPARED TO $12 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT FOR FINISHED STEEL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FINISHED STEEL AVERAGE NET  SELLING PRICES DECLINED $104 PER TON, OR 14%, COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH LED TO A  COMPRESSION OF FINISHED STEEL MARGINS AS DECREASES IN SELLING PRICES OUTPACED THE REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. THE EFFECTS OF FINISHED STEEL MARGIN COMPRESSION WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES. CSS OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 REFLECTED HIGHER FINISHED STEEL MARGINS COMPARED TO THE CURRENT QUARTER, SUPPORTED BY THE HIGHER AND RISING PRICE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME.  CORPORATE EXPENSE  CORPORATE SG&A EXPENSE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY $3 MILLION, OR 24%, COMPARED  TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY  DUE TO DECREASED EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING FROM LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS. THE LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS PRIMARILY REFLECT THE REDUCED EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  IN ORDER TO MITIGATE THE WEAKER PRICE ENVIRONMENT IN THE FERROUS AND NONFERROUS MARKETS, IN FISCAL 2019 WE IMPLEMENTED PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AIMED AT DELIVERING $35 MILLION IN ANNUAL BENEFITS PRIMARILY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTION COST EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCTIONS IN SG&A EXPENSE. OF THE TOTAL, APPROXIMATELY 75% OF THE TARGETED BENEFITS ARE IN AMR WITH THE REMAINDER SPLIT BETWEEN CSS AND CORPORATE. FOR FISCAL 2019, WE ACHIEVED APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN BENEFITS AS A RESULT OF THESE INITIATIVES, WITH THE FULL AMOUNT EXPECTED TO BE ACHIEVED IN FISCAL 2020. OUR FIRST QUARTER FISCAL 2020 PERFORMANCE REFLECTS ACHIEVEMENT OF THE FULL QUARTERLY RUN RATE OF THESE INITIATIVES. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL 2020 WE ALSO INITIATED AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES AIMED AT FURTHER REDUCING OUR ANNUAL OPERATING EXPENSES AT CORPORATE, AMR AND CSS, MAINLY THROUGH REDUCTIONS IN NON-TRADE PROCUREMENT SPEND, INCLUDING OUTSIDE AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, LOWER EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES AND OTHER NON-HEADCOUNT MEASURES. WE ARE TARGETING $15 MILLION IN REALIZED BENEFITS IN FISCAL 2020 FROM THESE ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES.  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  WE EXPECT TO INCUR AGGREGATE ESTIMATED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED  COSTS  OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THESE INITIATIVES  , THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED IN FISCAL 2020 AND TO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE CASH PAYMENTS  . THE ESTIMATED CHARGES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS OF $2 MILLION,  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  COSTS OF $1 MILLION,  AND A LOSS  ASSOCIATED WITH A LEASE CONTRACT TERMINATION OF $1 MILLION.  INCOME TAX  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS A BENEFIT OF  27.8%  COMPARED TO AN EXPENSE OF 19.8% FOR THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS HIGHER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE OF 21% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE OFFICERS\\u2019 COMPENSATION AND OTHER EXPENSES, AS WELL AS THE AGGREGATE IMPACT OF STATE TAXES, ON THE PROJECTED ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE APPLIED TO THE QUARTERLY RESULTS.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY, SUPPLEMENTED BY CURRENT CASH ON HAND AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES.  SOURCES AND USES OF CASH  WE HAD CASH BALANCES OF  $10 MILLION  AND $12 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. CASH BALANCES ARE INTENDED TO BE USED PRIMARILY FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. WE USE EXCESS CASH ON HAND TO REDUCE AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, DEBT WAS $128 MILLION COMPARED TO $105 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019, AND DEBT, NET OF CASH, WAS $119 MILLION AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $93 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019 (REFER TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE END OF THIS ITEM 2).  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $11 MILLION, COMPARED TO NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $12 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  SOURCES OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED A $28 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF SALES AND COLLECTIONS AND A $12 MILLION  DECREASE  IN INVENTORIES DUE TO  LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND THE TIMING OF PURCHASES AND SALES.  USES OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED A $29 MILLION  DECREASE  IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE PRIMARILY DUE  TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS AND  A $11 MILLION  DECREASE  IN ACCRUED PAYROLL AND RELATED LIABILITIES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE  PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED UNDER OUR FISCAL 2019 PLANS.  USES OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED A $28 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF SALES AND COLLECTIONS AND A $27 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCRUED PAYROLL AND RELATED LIABILITIES DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED UNDER OUR FISCAL 2018 PLANS. SOURCES OF CASH OTHER THAN FROM EARNINGS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 INCLUDED A $10 MILLION DECREASE IN INVENTORIES PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND THE IMPACT OF TIMING OF PURCHASES AND SALES.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $24 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $25 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF  $24 MILLION  TO UPGRADE OUR EQUIPMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR INVESTMENTS IN ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY-RELATED ASSETS, COMPARED TO $27 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING  ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $10 MILLION, COMPARED TO $44 MILLION IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020 INCLUDED $22 MILLION IN NET BORROWINGS OF DEBT, COMPARED TO $61 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD (REFER TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE END OF THIS ITEM 2). USES OF CASH IN THE FIRST THREE  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  MONTHS  OF FISCAL  2020  AND  2019  INCLUDED  $6 MILLION  FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS  . CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2019 ALSO INCLUDED  $4 MILLION  FOR SHARE REPURCHASES.  DEBT  OUR SENIOR SECURED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES, WHICH PROVIDE FOR REVOLVING LOANS OF $700 MILLION AND C$15 MILLION, MATURE IN AUGUST 2023 PURSUANT TO A CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH BANK OF AMERICA, N.A., AS ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, AND OTHER LENDERS PARTY THERETO. INTEREST RATES ON OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE BASED, AT OUR OPTION, ON EITHER THE LONDON INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (\\u201cLIBOR\\u201d), OR THE CANADIAN EQUIVALENT FOR C$ LOANS, PLUS A SPREAD OF BETWEEN 1.25% AND 2.75%, WITH THE AMOUNT OF THE SPREAD BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO, OR THE GREATER OF (A) THE PRIME RATE, (B) THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE PLUS 0.50%, OR (C) THE DAILY RATE EQUAL TO ONE-MONTH LIBOR PLUS 1.75%, IN EACH CASE PLUS A SPREAD OF BETWEEN ZERO AND 1.50% BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO. IN ADDITION, COMMITMENT FEES ARE PAYABLE ON THE UNUSED PORTION OF THE CREDIT FACILITIES AT RATES BETWEEN 0.15% AND 0.45% BASED ON A PRICING GRID TIED TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA RATIO.  WE HAD BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES OF  $119 MILLION  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND $97 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 31, 2019. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE ON AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITIES WAS  3.25%  AND 3.78% AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND AUGUST 31, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  WE USE THE CREDIT FACILITIES TO FUND WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT CONTAINS VARIOUS REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND FINANCIAL AND OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS WHICH LIMIT (SUBJECT TO CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS) OUR ABILITY TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INCUR OR SUFFER TO EXIST CERTAIN LIENS, MAKE INVESTMENTS, INCUR OR GUARANTY ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS, ENTER INTO CONSOLIDATIONS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, AND SALES OF ASSETS, MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS AND OTHER RESTRICTED PAYMENTS, CHANGE THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS, ENGAGE IN TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES AND ENTER INTO RESTRICTIVE AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING AGREEMENTS THAT RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES TO MAKE DISTRIBUTIONS. THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT INCLUDE (A) A CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, DEFINED AS THE FOUR-QUARTER ROLLING SUM OF CONSOLIDATED ADJUSTED EBITDA LESS DEFINED MAINTENANCE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES DIVIDED BY CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGES AND (B) A CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO, DEFINED AS CONSOLIDATED FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS DIVIDED BY THE SUM OF CONSOLIDATED NET WORTH AND CONSOLIDATED FUNDED INDEBTEDNESS.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CONSOLIDATED FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO WAS REQUIRED TO BE NO LESS THAN 1.50 TO 1.00 AND WAS  2.74  TO 1.00 AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019. THE CONSOLIDATED LEVERAGE RATIO WAS REQUIRED TO BE NO MORE THAN 0.55 TO 1.00 AND WAS  0.18  TO 1.00 AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ARE GUARANTEED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES. THE CREDIT FACILITIES AND THE RELATED GUARANTEES ARE SECURED BY SENIOR FIRST PRIORITY LIENS ON CERTAIN OF OUR AND OUR SUBSIDIARIES\\u2019 ASSETS, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.  WHILE WE EXPECT TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANTS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO SO IN THE EVENT MARKET CONDITIONS OR OTHER NEGATIVE FACTORS WHICH ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION LEAD TO A TREND OF CONSOLIDATED NET LOSSES. IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN AMENDMENT OR WAIVER FROM OUR LENDERS, A BREACH OF A FINANCIAL COVENANT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ALLOW THE LENDERS TO EXERCISE REMEDIES UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, THE MOST SEVERE OF WHICH IS THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY UNDER OUR COMMITTED BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF THE AMOUNTS OWED UNDER THE AGREEMENT. IN SUCH CASE, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE FUNDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE FUNDS, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $24 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $27 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $125 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING $60 MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, INCLUDING ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND TO SUPPORT VOLUME INITIATIVES AND OTHER GROWTH PROJECTS, USING CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  BUILDING ON OUR COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING AND OPERATING OUR BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FACILITIES THAT IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR PARAGRAPH, WE  INVESTED $3 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020,  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $15 MILLION FOR  SUCH PROJECTS IN FISCAL  2020  . THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN STORM WATER SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES THAT OWN OR OPERATE OR FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED SITES WHICH ARE PART OF OR ADJACENT TO THE PORTLAND HARBOR SUPERFUND SITE (THE \\u201cSITE\\u201d). SEE NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS MATTER, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES. WE BELIEVE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF COSTS WHICH WE ARE LIKELY TO OR WHICH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS WE INCUR FOR DEFENSE (INCLUDING PRE-REMEDIAL DESIGN INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES), REMEDIAL DESIGN, REMEDIAL ACTION AND MITIGATION FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THOSE POLICIES WILL COVER ALL OF THE COSTS WHICH WE MAY INCUR. SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTFLOWS IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO THE SITE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COULD RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY.  DIVIDENDS  ON  NOVEMBER 6, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF $0.1875 PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.75 PER COMMON SHARE. THE DIVIDEND WAS PAID ON NOVEMBER 29, 2019.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  PURSUANT TO OUR AMENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE EXISTING AUTHORIZATION REMAINING UNDER THE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO APPROXIMATELY  759 THOUSAND SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHEN WE DEEM SUCH REPURCHASES TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, SUCH AS TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TO OFFSET DILUTION RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CASH NEEDS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK.  ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, CREDIT FACILITIES AND EQUITY OFFERINGS HAVE FINANCED OUR ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER FINANCING NEEDS.  WE GENERALLY BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ANY SUCH SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO ITEM 303 OF REGULATION S-K UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING WORKERS\\u2019 COMPENSATION AND PERFORMANCE BONDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD  $10 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DESCRIBED IN THE \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES RESULTING FROM ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. REFER TO NOTE 3  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  - LEASES  IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS UPON ADOPTION.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  DEBT, NET OF CASH  DEBT, NET OF CASH IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN (I) THE SUM OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (I.E., TOTAL DEBT) AND (II) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

COMPANY AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOSCIENCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING COMPANY FOR OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \\u201cTECHNOLOGY\\u201d) AND WERE INCORPORATED IN 2004 IN NEVADA. OUR TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY INGESTION METHODS, LOWER OVERALL DOSING AND HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S FOOD SCIENCES ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPRIETARY NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS, AND THE PRODUCTION OF ENHANCED FOOD PRODUCTS UNDER OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT BRANDS, VIPOVATM, LEXARIA ENERGYTM, TURBOCBDTM AND CHRGD+TM. THE COMPANY\\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IS BELIEVED TO IMPROVE TASTE, RAPIDITY AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT INCLUDE CANNABINOIDS, VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS), NICOTINE AND OTHER MOLECULES COMPARED TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LIPOPHILIC ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY. ALL OF LEXARIA\\u2019S CONSUMER PRODUCT GOODS ARE MADE WITH COMMONLY AVAILABLE FOOD GRADE INGREDIENTS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS AND FULFILLMENT CENTERS.  LEXARIA HOPES TO REDUCE OTHER COMMON, BUT LESS HEALTHY ADMINISTRATION METHODS SUCH AS SMOKING, AS INDUSTRY SEGMENTS EMBRACE THE BENEFITS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION IN NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS MORE THAN 50 PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING WORLDWIDE. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION, THE QUANTITY OF PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL VARY CONTINUOUSLY AS EACH APPLICATION ADVANCES OR STALLS. LEXARIA IS ALSO FILING NEW PATENT APPLICATIONS FOR NOVEL NEW DISCOVERIES THAT ARISE FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S R&D PROGRAMS AND, DUE TO THE INHERENT UNPREDICTABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT IF OR HOW OFTEN SUCH NEW APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE FILED.  AS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  PAGE 15 OF 24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CURRENT BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS PLAN IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH LICENSEES FOR OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN EXCHANGE FOR UP FRONT AND/OR STAGED LICENSING FEES OVER TIME. SECONDARILY AND MORE GENERALLY, WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ENHANCED FUNCTIONAL FOOD AND SUPPLEMENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS; TO INVESTIGATE EXPANSIONS AND ADDITIONS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO; AND TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS. THIS INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IF AND WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO.  OUR CURRENT PATENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PATENT FAMILY GRANTS RELATING TO: INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO LEXARIA\\u2019S METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE, AND THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (\\u201cAPIS\\u201d) ENCOMPASSING ALL CANNABINOIDS INCLUDING CBD AND THC, FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PAIN MEDICATIONS (\\u201cNSAIDS\\u201d); AND NICOTINE.

TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH, OUR COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND COSTS OF OUR PROJECTS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE HAVE FILED FOR PATENT PROTECTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS, HUMAN HORMONES SUCH AS ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE AND MORE.  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS.  THE COMPANY CLOSED A NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES FOR A TOTAL OF 1,823,745 UNITS PRICED AT $0.45 EACH. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE COMMON SHARE AND ONE SHARE PURCHASE WARRANT. EACH WARRANT SHALL ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS AT A PRICE OF $0.80 PER SHARE UNTIL THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE, AND THEREAFTER AT A PRICE OF $1.20 UNTIL THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY PAID $3,937.50 AND ISSUED 8,750 BROKER WARRANTS. THE BROKER WARRANTS HAVE A TERM OF 24 MONTHS AND ARE EACH EXERCISABLE INTO ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY AT A PRICE OF $0.80 PER SHARE UNTIL THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE, AND THEREAFTER AT A PRICE OF $1.20 UNTIL THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BROKER WARRANTS WAS DETERMINED TO BE $1,850, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A SHARE ISSUANCE COST WITHIN ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL FOR A NET EFFECT OF $NIL.  THE UNITS WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION EXEMPTIONS EITHER BY WAY OF THE INVESTOR BEING AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPLETION OF AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR CERTIFICATION, PURSUANT TO REGULATION D, RULE 506 (B), OR A PERSON REPRESENTING THAT HE IS NOT A US PERSON OR ACTING ON BEHALF OF A US PERSON, PURSUANT TO REGULATION S, RULE 903, WHO PURCHASED THE SECURITIES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION AND WILL BEAR THE REQUIRED REGULATORY HOLD PERIOD LEGENDS.  SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30, 2019, 110,000 OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED FOR A TOTAL OF $11,000.  PAGE 16 OF 24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $107,463 (2018 $96,973) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2019. SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH API. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF EACH API.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY FOCUSES ON NEW R&D PROGRAMS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE METHODS TO INTEGRATE NANOEMULSIFICATION CHEMISTRY TECHNIQUES TOGETHER WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY AND TO FURTHER ENHANCE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION RATES WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPAND THE TYPES AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT FORM FACTORS INTO WHICH ITS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE APPLIED. DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, R&D BUDGETS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES (US GAAP). PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. WE BELIEVE THAT UNDERSTANDING THE BASIS AND NATURE OF THE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVED WITH THE FOLLOWING ASPECTS OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS CRITICAL TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIALS.  CAPITAL ASSETS  CAPITAL ASSETS ARE STATED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR USEFUL LIVES OR BY UNITS OF PRODUCTION.  PATENTS  CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS REPRESENT LEGAL COSTS INCURRED TO ESTABLISH PATENTS. WHEN PATENTS REACH A MATURE STAGE, ANY ASSOCIATED LEGAL COSTS ARE COMPRISED MOSTLY OF MAINTENANCE FEES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PATENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PATENT.  REVENUE RECOGNITION  PRODUCT REVENUE  REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF ALTERNATIVE HEALTH PRODUCTS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS UPON SHIPMENT. THE COMPANY REPORTS ITS SALES NET OF THE AMOUNT OF ACTUAL SALES RETURNS. SALES TAX COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS IS EXCLUDED FROM NET SALES.  PAGE 17 OF 24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  LICENSING REVENUE FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR LICENSE FEES AT A POINT IN TIME FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGY DEHYDRATECH FOR INFUSING APIS, TO THE LICENSEE, WHICH TYPICALLY OCCURS ON DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTATION.  USAGE FEES FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE FOR USAGE FEES WHEN USAGE OF OUR DEHYDRATECH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OCCURS BY LICENSEES INFUSING AN API INTO ONE OR MORE OF THEIR PRODUCT LINES FOR SALE.  GOING CONCERN  WE HAVE SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THE CONTINUATION OF OUR COMPANY AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON OUR COMPANY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS AND/OR RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENT RELATING TO THE RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION OF RECORDED ASSET AMOUNTS OR THE AMOUNT AND CLASSIFICATION OF LIABILITIES THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OUR COMPANY DISCONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS AND NET CAPITAL DEFICIENCY RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR OUR PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018  OUR NET LOSS AND COMPREHENSIVE LOSS AND THE CHANGES BETWEEN THOSE PERIODS FOR THE RESPECTIVE ITEMS ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

LICENSING REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON EXPANDED LICENCE AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO RECOGNISING THE IP TERRITORY LICENSING FEE, AND EXISTING LICENSES GENERATING USAGE FEES. INCREASING ONGOING USAGE FEES ARE EXPECTED AS LICENSEES BEGIN OR RAMP UP PRODUCTS OR WHEN CONTRACTED MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS BECOME DUE.  INCREASES IN REVENUES ARE EXPECTED DURING THE 2020 CALENDAR YEAR.  OUR LICENSING REVENUES CONSIST OF IP LICENSING FEES FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE TECHNOLOGY AT THE SIGNING OF DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY. THE ADDITIONAL LICENSING FEES INCLUDE PAYMENTS DUE UPON TRANSFER OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND INSTALLMENT PAYMENTS THAT ARE RECEIVABLE WITHIN 12 MONTHS (NOTE 7).  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED WITHIN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: $51,750 (NOVEMBER 2018 $19,902) OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING REVENUE AND $10,332 (2018 $2,307) IN PRODUCT AND OTHER REVENUES.

SALES  GREYSTONE\\u2019S  PRIMARY FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY PLASTIC PALLETS TO ITS EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHILE CONTINUING ITS MARKETING EFFORTS TO BROADEN  ITS CUSTOMER BASE. GREYSTONE\\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS. GREYSTONE\\u2019S MARKETING IS CONDUCTED THROUGH CONTRACT DISTRIBUTORS, ITS PRESIDENT AND OTHER EMPLOYEES.

THE INCREASE  IN PALLET SALES IN FISCAL YEAR 2020 OVER 2019 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SALES GROWTH WITHIN GREYSTONE\\u2019S LARGEST  CUSTOMERS WHICH INCLUDED A NEW CUSTOMER IN FISCAL YEAR 2020.

THE DECREASE IN SPREADS WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ($19.4 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($13.2 MILLION) AND FREIGHT EXPENSE ($217,000).  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\\u201d) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED 12.1% TO $5.7 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES, FROM $6.5 MILLION, OR 6.3% OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELATIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($871,000). THE VALUE OF THE POLICIES INCREASED $339,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $532,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.  OTHER INCOME  OTHER INCOME OF $829,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A NET GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($709,000).  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED TO 22.7% FROM 23.5% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO CHANGES IN PERMANENT BOOK VERSUS TAX DIFFERENCES.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET EARNINGS  NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED TO $555,000 ($0.03 PER SHARE) FROM $4.1 MILLION ($0.21 PER SHARE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $29,575  $(22,768  )  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (642  )  (5,663  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  -  (7  )  NET WORKING CAPITAL  133,959  125,265  TOTAL DEBT  -  -  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  -  -  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  $246,180  $245,382  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  100.0%  100.0%  TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL DEBT + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY)  $246,180  $245,382  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $29.6 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED $24.6 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $10.2 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, AN $8.8 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A $5.6 MILLION DECREASE IN INVENTORIES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS LARGELY RELATED TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES AND DECREASE IN SELLING PRICES. THE REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES USED $22.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL USED $31.2 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $25.1 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND A $21.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $15.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS AND HIGHER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES COMPOUNDED BY THE UNUSUALLY WET WEATHER.  WE MAY ELECT TO ADJUST OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WHILE A DOWNTURN IN THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ADVERSELY AFFECTS SALES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT GENERALLY REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED $642,000 OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO $5.7 MILLION DURING THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($5.6 MILLION) AND AN INCREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($560,000). CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED TO $600,000 FROM $6.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL UP TO $17.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON COST AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES IN ADDITION TO RECURRING MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.  OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY, PROVIDING US WITH THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OUTLAYS WHEN WARRANTED BASED ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES DID NOT PROVIDE OR USE ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH DURING THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR QUARTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $578,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $576,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  CASH MANAGEMENT  OUR CASH IS PRINCIPALLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH AT TIMES EXCEEDS FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. WE INVEST EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT BEAR MINIMAL RISK.  CREDIT FACILITY  WE HAVE A $100.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201cCREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) THAT IS USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, GENERAL CORPORATE AND GROWTH REQUIREMENTS. IN MAY 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED IN ITS ENTIRETY THE PREVIOUS AGREEMENT PERTAINING TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JUNE 2010. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER CHANGES, EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM MAY 13, 2020 TO MAY 15, 2024 AND PROVIDED FOR AN INCREMENTAL FEATURE WHEREBY ITS SIZE MAY BE INCREASED BY UP TO $50.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO OUR LENDER\\u2019S APPROVAL. ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT AMOUNT (CURRENTLY $100.0 MILLION) OR A BORROWING BASE AMOUNT THAT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, $71.7 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY WAS AVAILABLE AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALED $1.6 MILLION (SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE BELIEVE THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, NET CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY PROVIDED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR EXPECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO WEAKENING CONDITIONS IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND REDUCED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY NEED TO CURTAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, CEASE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DELAY OR RESTRICT SHARE REPURCHASES AND/OR REALIGN OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  SHOULD WE DETERMINE, AT ANY TIME, THAT WE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD EVALUATE THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF PURSUED, WOULD BE OBTAINED, OR IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET, FLEXIBLE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY POSITION US TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY  DEMAND IN OUR MARKETS IS BOTH SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL, DRIVEN BY THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, BUT CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INVENTORY POSITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. FROM A SEASONAL STANDPOINT, SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE YEAR WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE THE MOST CONDUCIVE TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, ASSUMING NORMAL SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. FROM A CYCLICAL STANDPOINT, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CORRELATED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFLATIONARY RISKS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET PRICES FOR OUR PRIMARY RAW MATERIAL, HOT-ROLLED CARBON STEEL WIRE ROD, AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, FREIGHT, ENERGY AND OTHER CONSUMABLES THAT ARE USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST OUR SELLING PRICES TO PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN THESE COSTS OR OFFSET THEM THROUGH VARIOUS COST REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE OUR SELLING PRICES DEPENDS ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THERE MAY BE PERIODS DURING WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN OUR COSTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO LOW-PRICED IMPORT COMPETITION SPURRED BY THE SECTION 232 TARIFF ON IMPORTED STEEL, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WE CONSUMED HIGHER COST INVENTORY THAT WAS PURCHASED IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN OUR RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND THE SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS, AS DESCRIBED BY ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K OF THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF REVENUES OR EXPENSES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF THESE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PLEASE REFER TO \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2013 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES FROM THOSE REPORTED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND ESTIMATED EFFECTS, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE EXPECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND THE WEATHER-RELATED DEFERRAL OF BUSINESS FROM LAST YEAR. THE INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS SHOULD BENEFIT FROM HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS INITIATIVES SUCH AS FUEL TAX INCREASES, BOND ISSUANCES AND OTHER BALLOT MEASURES TOGETHER WITH INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE FAST ACT AND SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES. THE LEADING INDICATORS AND INDUSTRY FORECASTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE, REFLECTING MODEST GROWTH FOR THE YEAR.  WE EXPECT BUSINESS CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING, HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE SURGE OF LOW-PRICED IMPORTS THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE IMPOSITION OF THE SECTION 232 TARIFF ON IMPORTS OF HOT-ROLLED STEEL WIRE ROD. IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF IMPORTS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS: CLOSELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR EXPENSES; ALIGNING OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES WITH DEMAND IN A PROACTIVE MANNER AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS TO MINIMIZE OUR CASH OPERATING COSTS; AND PURSUING FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OUR MANUFACTURING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT GRADUALLY INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF REDUCED OPERATING COSTS AND ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH. IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES THAT EXPAND OUR PENETRATION OF MARKETS WE CURRENTLY SERVE OR EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"INSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC\", \"CIK\": 764401, \"Date\": \"2020-01-16T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"IIIN\", \"Name\": \"Insteel Industries Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 3310.0, \"Business\": \"NC\", \"Incorporated\": \"NC\", \"IRS\": 560674867.0, \"key\": \"20200116IIIN\", \"labelr1\": 6.9490131578947425, \"labelr2\": 0.0, \"labelr3\": -0.2306805074971252, \"labelr4\": -3.1599229287090562, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5236972, \"prof1\": 0.47630277, \"return1&2\": 0.9305098684210524, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9326563733078372, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9621275958940578, \"return2\": 1.0, \"return1\": 0.9305098684210524, \"return3\": 1.0023068050749713, \"return4\": 1.0315992292870906, \"1_day_return\": 6.949013157894735, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.2422426817898649, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3572, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0694901315789473, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9832289635347436, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9992094607529791, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0220298714922647, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0166026580610665}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3573, \"level_0\": 3666, \"index\": 3638, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

HOWEVER, OUR MANAGEMENT DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND BELIEFS AND INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS.

MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES; THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE BY EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS; DISRUPTION OF OPERATIONS OR INCREASES IN EXPENSES DUE TO OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH LITIGATION OR  CAUSED BY CIVIL OR POLITICAL UNREST OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENT MANDATES; AND, THE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPETITION.  11  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JANUARY 13, 2011. WE ARE REFOCUSING AND PREPARING TO RELAUNCH THE COMPANY THROUGH A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC  ACQUISITIONS IN THE TEXTILE, SERVICE, AGRICULTURAL, AND/OR INDUSTRIAL SECTORS TO COMPLEMENT AND CAPTURE THE NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA AND NEW ZEALAND. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  REVENUES  THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUES WERE $0 FOR THE THREE-MONTH AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $63,702 AS COMPARED TO $7,667 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND  $84,501 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $26,950 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER CONSULTING FEES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ACQUISITION AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY HAS HAD ONLY NOMINAL OPERATIONS AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY CASH GENERATED FROM BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  WE FUNDED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES BY ISSUING NOTES TO RELATED AND UNRELATED PARTIES AND BORROWING LOANS FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE ALSO ISSUED CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $515,000.  OUR PLAN IS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS AND COMPLETE OUR ACQUISITION PROJECT.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL DEFICITS OF $209,278 AND $124,721, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OPERATING COSTS AND ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO  CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY OBTAINING ADEQUATE CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES UNTIL IT BECOMES PROFITABLE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL, IT COULD BE FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE  SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, THE COMPANY WILL NEED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RESOURCES. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLANS FOCUS ON A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN  SERVICE, AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES TO COMPLEMENT AND GROW ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY IS POSITIONING TO CAPTURE THE NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA. THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLANNED FOCUS IS ALSO ON ADDING VALUE THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT  DEVELOPMENT, EFFICIENT OPERATIONS, AND OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS WHILE MAINTAINING A LOW RISK PROFILE THROUGH PROJECT DIVERSIFICATION, ASTUTE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING IN SECURE JURISDICTIONS. TO OBTAIN SUCH RESOURCES FOR THE COMPANY  INCLUDE (I) OBTAINING CAPITAL FROM MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS MINIMAL OPERATING EXPENSES; (II) OBTAINING FUNDING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS DEBT AND/OR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (III) COMPLETING A  MERGER WITH OR ACQUISITION OF AN EXISTING OPERATING COMPANY.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCOMPLISHING ANY OF ITS PLANS.  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THIS UNCERTAINTY.  12  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $166,530 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $31,693  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 DUE TO THE DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSE OF $42,101.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $0.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $166,530. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $31,693 DUE TO PAYBACK OF A RELATED PARTY\\u2019S LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $42,101.  AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS  BASED ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND ZERO REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO NEED ADDITIONAL EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCING TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS DURING  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CURRENT CASH ON HAND WILL NOT FUND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH DECEMBER 2020.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT  BASIS. THE PREPARATION OF UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE  ESTIMATES. OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE AMORTIZATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK, AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  13  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07, \\u201cCOMPENSATION \\u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. ASU 2018-07 EXPANDS THE  SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. ASU 2018-07 ALSO CLARIFIES THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE (1) FINANCING TO THE  ISSUER OR (2) AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606). ASU 2018-07 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER  DECEMBER 15, 2018, INCLUDING INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF ASU 2018-07 IN THE QUARTER BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2019. THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-07 DOES NOT HAVE A  MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION OR DISCLOSURES.  IN AUGUST 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-13, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (\\u201cTOPIC 820\\u201d): DISCLOSURE FRAMEWORK - CHANGES TO THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT (\\u201cASU  2018-13\\u201d). THE ASU MODIFIES THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS IN TOPIC 820, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT, BY REMOVING CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY, MODIFYING EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO MEASUREMENT  UNCERTAINTY AND ADDING NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, SUCH AS DISCLOSING THE CHANGES IN UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR THE PERIOD INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR RECURRING LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS HELD AT THE END OF THE  REPORTING PERIOD AND DISCLOSING THE RANGE AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED TO DEVELOP LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES FOR ANNUAL REPORTING PERIODS AND INTERIM PERIODS  WITHIN THOSE ANNUAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2019. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2018-13 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OUR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 64% OR $14,015.

IF CONTINUED FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE UNAVAILABLE AT REASONABLE TERMS, THE COMPANY MAY  NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ITS PLAN OF OPERATIONS OR TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR UNAUDITED, CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OFF  BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ACCOUNTING  BASIS  OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS OF ACCOUNTING IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR COMPANY\\u2019S FISCAL YEAR END IS SEPTEMBER 30.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.  EARNINGS  (LOSS) PER SHARE  OUR  COMPANY ADOPTED FASB ASC 260,  EARNINGS PER SHARE  . BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR COMPANY\\u2019S  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR COMPANY\\u2019S NET LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE DILUTED  WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING IS  THE BASIC WEIGHTED NUMBER OF SHARES ADJUSTED AS OF THE FIRST OF THE YEAR FOR ANY POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE DEBT OR EQUITY. THERE WERE  NO DILUTIVE OR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  INCOME  TAXES  OUR  COMPANY ADOPTED FASB ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  , AT ITS INCEPTION. UNDER FASB ASC 740, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF  EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS,  AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY  DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES  IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE. DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE CHANGE DURING  THE PERIOD IN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. THE COMPONENTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE INDIVIDUALLY CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION  ALLOWANCE WHEN, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL  NOT BE REALIZED. A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS USED AND NO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES WERE RECOGNIZED AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  10  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS  THE  FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, AND NOTES PAYABLE APPROXIMATES THE CARRYING AMOUNT  OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM MATURITY.  USE  OF ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  RELATED  PARTIES  RELATED  PARTIES, WHICH CAN BE A CORPORATION, INDIVIDUAL, INVESTOR OR ANOTHER ENTITY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE RELATED IF THE PARTY HAS THE  ABILITY, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, TO CONTROL THE OTHER PARTY OR EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER OUR COMPANY IN MAKING FINANCIAL  AND OPERATING DECISIONS. COMPANIES ARE ALSO CONSIDERED TO BE RELATED IF THEY ARE SUBJECT TO COMMON CONTROL OR COMMON SIGNIFICANT  INFLUENCE. OUR COMPANY HAS THESE RELATIONSHIPS.  RECENT  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  OUR  COMPANY HAS ADOPTED ALL RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.

THE DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS OF $102, THE FAVORABLE IMPACT FROM THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION OF $41, THE FACILITY CLOSURE OF $29 THAT OCCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND POSITIVE CURRENCY IMPACTS OF $22, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALES VOLUMES OF $97 AND HIGHER OTHER COSTS OF $10. GROSS MARGIN OF  34.1%  INCREASED  480  BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING, LOWER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS, THE FACILITY CLOSURE THAT OCCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE NET OPERATING COSTS.  FACILITY CLOSURE  IN DECEMBER 2018, ONE OF OUR CUSTOMERS WAS SUBJECT TO A GOVERNMENT ENFORCED SHUTDOWN DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL REASONS. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $29.0 ($22.1 AFTER-TAX, OR $0.10 PER SHARE) DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF ONSITE ASSETS.

OPERATING MARGIN OF  24.9%  INCREASED  440  BP, PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING, THE PRIOR YEAR FACILITY CLOSURE, AND LOWER ENERGY AND NATURAL GAS COST PASS-THROUGH TO CUSTOMERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY UNFAVORABLE NET OPERATING COSTS.

OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, OF  $9.1  DECREASED  51%  , OR  $9.4  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON HEDGING ACTIVITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON CASH AND CASH ITEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NON-SERVICE PENSION INCOME.  NET INCOME AND NET INCOME MARGIN  NET INCOME OF  $488.9  INCREASED  37%  , OR  $131.9  , PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING AND HIGHER VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS FROM THE FACILITY CLOSURE AND THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE LOWER ENERGY PASS-THROUGH AND THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION CONTRIBUTED 230 BP.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EQUALS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DIVIDED BY INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  19.8%  AND  27.0%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE HIGHER 2019 TAX RATE REFLECTED A DISCRETE NET INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $40.6  RELATED TO IMPACTS FROM THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d). THE NET EXPENSE INCLUDED THE REVERSAL OF A NON-RECURRING  $56.2  ($.26 PER SHARE) BENEFIT RECORDED IN 2018 RELATED TO THE U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF  $15.6  (  $0.07  PER SHARE) TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND REDUCE THE TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2020.

ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (\\\"EPS\\\"), ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. ON A SEGMENT BASIS, THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED ABOVE, WE ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE PRESENTED BELOW TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT OUR NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS HAVE ON THE CALCULATION OF OUR ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS. FOR EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WE PRESENT BELOW A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY'S NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE INVESTORS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND OTHERS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES, WHEN VIEWED TOGETHER WITH FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS.  IN MANY CASES, NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN DISCLOSED ITEMS, OR \\u201cNON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS,\\u201d THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED CERTAIN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COST REDUCTION ACTIONS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND GAINS ON DISCLOSED TRANSACTIONS. THE READER SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE SIMILAR LOSSES OR GAINS IN THE FUTURE. READERS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF THESE MEASURES FROM ONE COMPANY TO ANOTHER.  THE TAX IMPACT ON OUR PRE-TAX NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX IMPACT OF OUR NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS. THESE TAX IMPACTS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF THE VARIOUS RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS AND THE TAXABILITY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS  THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS USED TO CALCULATE ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS, WHICH THE COMPANY VIEWS AS A KEY PERFORMANCE METRIC.

THE CREDIT AGREEMENT PROVIDES A SOURCE OF LIQUIDITY FOR THE COMPANY AND SUPPORTS ITS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY\\u2019S ONLY FINANCIAL COVENANT IS A MAXIMUM RATIO OF TOTAL DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITALIZATION NO GREATER THAN 70%. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AS OF  31 DECEMBER 2019  OR 30 SEPTEMBER 2019.  THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS MAINTAINED BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AS OF  31 DECEMBER 2019.  AS OF  31 DECEMBER 2019  , WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL OF THE FINANCIAL AND OTHER COVENANTS UNDER OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS.  ON 15 SEPTEMBER 2011, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $1,000 OF OUR OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK. DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  , WE DID NOT PURCHASE ANY OF OUR OUTSTANDING SHARES. AT  31 DECEMBER 2019  , $485.3 IN SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION REMAINED.  DIVIDENDS  ON 23 JANUARY 2019, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED THE SECOND QUARTER DIVIDEND OF $1.34 PER SHARE. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON 11 MAY 2020 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON 1 APRIL 2020.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER VARIOUS CONTRACTS, SUCH AS DEBT AGREEMENTS, LEASE AGREEMENTS, UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS, AND OTHER LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS.

THE DECREASE IN PENSION EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEAR  2020  RESULTED FROM LOWER INTEREST COST AND HIGHER EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER LOSS AMORTIZATION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF LOWER DISCOUNT RATES.  THE AMOUNT OF SERVICE COSTS CAPITALIZED IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR  S  2020  AND  2019  WERE NOT MATERIAL.  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED 31 DECEMBER  2018  , WE RECOGNIZED PENSION SETTLEMENT LOSSES OF  $1.0  TO ACCELERATE RECOGNITION OF A PORTION OF ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. THESE LOSSES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN \\\"OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\\\" ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS. PENSION SETTLEMENT LOSSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION PLAN. WE EXPECT TOTAL PENSION SETTLEMENT LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY  $5  TO $10 IN FISCAL YEAR  2020.  44  TABLE OF CONTENTS  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS VARIOUS FACTORS WHEN MAKING PENSION FUNDING DECISIONS, INCLUDING TAX, CASH FLOW, AND REGULATORY IMPLICATIONS. FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  31 DECEMBER 2019  AND  2018  , OUR CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNDED PENSION PLANS AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS FOR UNFUNDED PENSION PLANS WERE  $8.3  AND  $19.5  , RESPECTIVELY.

WE ARE NOT A PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IN ANY MATERIAL VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY. OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR LIQUIDITY.  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  WE HAVE RELATED PARTY SALES TO SOME OF OUR EQUITY AFFILIATES AND JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS AS WELL AS OTHER INCOME PRIMARILY FROM FEES CHARGED FOR USE OF AIR PRODUCTS' PATENTS AND TECHNOLOGY. SALES TO AND OTHER INCOME FROM RELATED PARTIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY  $90  AND  $100  FOR THE  THREE  MONTHS ENDED  31 DECEMBER 2019  AND  2018  , RESPECTIVELY.

REFER TO NOTE  16  ,  SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  , TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES THAT HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.  JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES OF UNCERTAINTIES ARE REQUIRED IN APPLYING OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN MANY AREAS. HOWEVER, APPLICATION OF POLICIES THAT MANAGEMENT HAS IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL PLACES SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE ON MANAGEMENT\\u2019S JUDGMENT, OFTEN AS THE RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. IF ACTUAL RESULTS WERE TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, THE REPORTED RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED. A DESCRIPTION OF OUR MAJOR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE IDENTIFIED AS CRITICAL, IS INCLUDED IN OUR  2019  FORM 10-K.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES TO OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR ESTIMATES DURING THE FIRST  THREE  MONTHS OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  THAT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGE IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q (\\u201c10-Q\\u201d), STARBUCKS CORPORATION IS REFERRED TO AS \\u201cSTARBUCKS,\\u201d THE \\u201cCOMPANY,\\u201d \\u201cWE,\\u201d \\u201cUS\\u201d OR \\u201cOUR.\\u201d  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE CHANGED THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND REVISED PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS THE RECLASSIFICATION OF OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS FROM COSTS OF SALES TO STORE OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $582.9  MILLION. WE ALSO MADE CERTAIN OTHER IMMATERIAL CHANGES. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME, OR NET EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 IS DERIVED FROM OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 (\\u201cFISCAL 2019\\u201d) INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 IN THE FISCAL 2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K (\\u201c10-K\\u201d). THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS 10-Q SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FOOTNOTES AND MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE 10-K.  THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 27, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL 2020\\u201d).  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LEASES UTILIZING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. AS A RESULT, THE PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION REPORTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE GUIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED.  AS PERMITTED UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WE ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWED US TO RETAIN OUR PRIOR CONCLUSIONS REGARDING LEASE IDENTIFICATION, CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. FOR OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL UNDERLYING CLASSES OF ASSETS. FOR OUR ADOPTION, WE DID NOT ELECT TO USE HINDSIGHT FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES. ADDITIONALLY, FOR SHORT-TERM LEASES WITH AN INITIAL LEASE TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS AND WITH PURCHASE OPTIONS WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN WILL NOT BE EXERCISED, WE ELECTED TO NOT RECORD RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS OR CORRESPONDING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECORD RENT EXPENSE FOR EACH SHORT-TERM LEASE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  THE NEW GUIDANCE HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET; HOWEVER, IT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. THE MOST MATERIAL IMPACT WAS THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS OF $8.4  BILLION, WITH CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $9.0  BILLION RELATING TO OUR OPERATING LEASES. EXISTING DEFERRED RENT AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $568.0  MILLION, PREVIOUSLY RECORDED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, WERE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR GROSS OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, PURSUANT TO THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE, WE DERECOGNIZED BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASE ASSETS, PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET, ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, THESE LEASES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS OPERATING LEASES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AND ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE, RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019. AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE, ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WITHIN SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DECREASED BY $17.3  MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DERECOGNITION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS.  SEE  NOTE 9  , LEASES, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FASB ON THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\\u201cAOCI\\u201d) WHICH PERMITS ENTITIES TO RECLASSIFY THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) FROM AOCI TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED PROSPECTIVELY WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019.  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED  IN DECEMBER 2019, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY REMOVING CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES. THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022. EARLY ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS PERMITTED. DEPENDING ON THE AMENDMENT, ADOPTION MAY BE APPLIED ON A RETROSPECTIVE, MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCE  FISCAL 2019  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE SOLD OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL BUSINESS IN THAILAND TO COFFEE CONCEPTS THAILAND, A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN MAXIM'S CATERERS LIMITED AND F&N RETAIL CONNECTION CO. LTD, CONVERTING THIS OPERATION TO A FULLY LICENSED MARKET. THIS TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $601.9  MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN NET GAINS RESULTING FROM DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE SOLD OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL BUSINESSES IN FRANCE AND THE NETHERLANDS TO ALSEA, S.A.B. DE C.V. CONVERTING THESE OPERATIONS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS. THESE TRANSACTIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NOTE 3.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  INTEREST RATES  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AND TREASURY LOCKS, WHICH ARE SYNTHETIC FORWARD SALES OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES SETTLED IN CASH BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AGREED-UPON TREASURY RATE AND THE PREVAILING TREASURY RATE AT SETTLEMENT. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE CASH SETTLED AT THE TIME OF THE PRICING OF THE RELATED DEBT. EACH DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT'S GAIN OR LOSS IS RECORDED IN AOCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED DEBT.  TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED DEBT DUE TO CHANGES IN THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. REFER TO  NOTE 8  DEBT, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  TO REDUCE CASH FLOW VOLATILITY FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE ENTER INTO FORWARD AND SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOWS OF ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS, INVENTORY PURCHASES, AND INTERCOMPANY BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUE, COST OF SALES, OR INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURES AFFECT NET EARNINGS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FORWARD CONTRACTS OR FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY EXPOSURE OF OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO NET EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED NET INVESTMENT IS EITHER SOLD OR SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED.  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO MITIGATE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF CERTAIN OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES; THESE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET.  COMMODITIES  DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO COFFEE FORWARD CONTRACTS, FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND COLLARS TO HEDGE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS UNDER OUR PRICE-TO-BE-FIXED GREEN COFFEE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN  NOTE 5,  INVENTORIES, OR OUR LONGER-DATED FORECASTED COFFEE DEMAND WHERE UNDERLYING FIXED PRICE AND PRICE-TO-BE-FIXED CONTRACTS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF SALES WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS NET EARNINGS.  DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO DAIRY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS UNDER OUR DAIRY PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND OUR FORECASTED DAIRY DEMAND. THE RESULTING GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF SALES WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS NET EARNINGS.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO MITIGATE THE PRICE UNCERTAINTY OF A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASES, INCLUDING DAIRY PRODUCTS, DIESEL FUEL AND OTHER COMMODITIES, WE ENTER INTO SWAP CONTRACTS, FUTURES AND COLLARS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

LEASES  THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE ADOPTION OF FASB'S NEW GUIDANCE ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LEASES.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LEASES ARE OPERATING LEASES FOR OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL STORE LOCATIONS. WE ALSO LEASE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ROASTING, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES AND OFFICE SPACE FOR CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. WE DO NOT ENTER INTO LEASE TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES.  WE CATEGORIZE LEASES AS EITHER OPERATING OR FINANCE LEASES AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE OF THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES, RENT HOLIDAYS, RENT ESCALATION CLAUSES AND/OR CONTINGENT RENT PROVISIONS. WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR TOGETHER AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL UNDERLYING CLASSES OF ASSETS.  WE RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE (\\u201cROU\\u201d) ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY FOR EACH OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS AT THE TIME OF LEASE INCEPTION. WE DO NOT RECORD LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BUT CONTINUE TO RECORD RENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. OUR LEASES OFTEN INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF LEASE TERM WHEN THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED.  OUR LEASE LIABILITY REPRESENTS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. GIVEN OUR POLICY ELECTION TO COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WE ALSO CONSIDER FIXED COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE (\\u201cCAM\\u201d) PART OF OUR FIXED FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS; THEREFORE, FIXED CAM IS ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR LEASE LIABILITY.  WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE INTEREST RATE IMPLICIT IN EACH OF OUR LEASES. THEREFORE, WE USE MARKET AND TERM-SPECIFIC INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE FOR A LEASE IS THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EXPECT TO PAY ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS TO BORROW AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER SIMILAR TERMS. BECAUSE WE DO NOT BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS, WE CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, THE RISK PROFILE AND FUNDING COST OF THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET OF THE LEASE, THE LEASE TERM AND THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE RATE TO REFLECT CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL. OUR CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE RATE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION INTEREST RATES WE PAY ON OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BONDS AS WELL AS QUOTED INTEREST RATES OBTAINED FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  TOTAL LEASE COSTS RECORDED AS RENT AND OTHER OCCUPANCY COSTS INCLUDE FIXED OPERATING LEASE COSTS, VARIABLE LEASE COSTS AND SHORT-TERM LEASE COSTS. MOST OF OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES REQUIRE WE PAY CERTAIN EXPENSES, SUCH AS CAM COSTS, REAL ESTATE TAXES AND OTHER EXECUTORY COSTS, OF WHICH THE FIXED PORTION IS INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE COSTS. WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE COSTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE COSTS, VARIABLE LEASE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS SALES IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED LEVELS AND ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN PROBABLE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR LEASE LIABILITY. OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY MATERIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF OUR LEASES ARE RELATED TO OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES, AND THEIR RELATED COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN STORE OPERATING EXPENSES.  THE ROU ASSET IS MEASURED AT THE INITIAL AMOUNT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY ADJUSTED FOR LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AT OR BEFORE THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE, INITIAL DIRECT COSTS, AND ANY TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED. FOR OPERATING LEASES, ROU ASSETS ARE REDUCED OVER THE LEASE TERM BY THE RECOGNIZED STRAIGHT-LINE LEASE EXPENSE LESS THE AMOUNT OF ACCRETION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY DETERMINED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. FOR FINANCE LEASES, ROU ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE LEASED ASSET OR THE LEASE TERM. INTEREST EXPENSE ON EACH FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY IS RECOGNIZED UTILIZING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. ROU ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS LONG-LIVED ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MONITOR FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY REQUIRE A REASSESSMENT OF ONE OF OUR LEASES AND DETERMINE IF A REMEASUREMENT IS REQUIRED.

PLAINTIFF SEEKS EQUITABLE RELIEF, INCLUDING PROVIDING WARNINGS TO CONSUMERS OF COFFEE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY PER VIOLATION OF PROPOSITION 65. THE PLAINTIFF ASSERTS THAT EVERY CONSUMED CUP OF COFFEE, ABSENT A COMPLIANT WARNING, IS EQUIVALENT TO A VIOLATION UNDER PROPOSITION 65.  THE COMPANY, AS PART OF A JOINT DEFENSE GROUP ORGANIZED TO DEFEND AGAINST THE LAWSUIT, DISPUTES THE CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFF. ACRYLAMIDE IS NOT ADDED TO COFFEE BUT IS PRESENT IN ALL COFFEE IN SMALL AMOUNTS (PARTS PER BILLION) AS A BYPRODUCT OF THE COFFEE BEAN ROASTING PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS ASSERTED MULTIPLE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. TRIAL OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE CASE COMMENCED ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2014, AND WAS LIMITED TO THREE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES SHARED BY ALL DEFENDANTS. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2015, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUED A FINAL RULING ADVERSE TO DEFENDANTS ON ALL PHASE 1 DEFENSES. TRIAL OF THE SECOND PHASE OF THE CASE COMMENCED IN THE FALL OF 2017. ON MAY 7, 2018, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUED A RULING ADVERSE TO DEFENDANTS ON THE PHASE 2 DEFENSE, THE COMPANY'S LAST REMAINING DEFENSE TO LIABILITY. ON JUNE 22, 2018, THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (OEHHA) PROPOSED A NEW REGULATION CLARIFYING THAT CANCER WARNINGS ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR COFFEE UNDER PROPOSITION 65. THE CASE WAS SET TO PROCEED TO A THIRD PHASE TRIAL ON DAMAGES, REMEDIES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES ON OCTOBER 15, 2018. HOWEVER, ON OCTOBER 12, 2018, THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL GRANTED THE DEFENDANTS REQUEST FOR A STAY OF THE PHASE 3 TRIAL.  ON JUNE 3, 2019, THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW (OAL) APPROVED THE COFFEE EXEMPTION REGULATION. THE REGULATION BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2019. ON JUNE 24, 2019, THE COURT OF APPEAL LIFTED THE STAY OF THE LITIGATION. A STATUS CONFERENCE BEFORE THE TRIAL JUDGE TO DISCUSS THE MOTIONS THAT EACH PARTY HAS FILED IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 23, 2020. AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, STARBUCKS BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY INCUR A LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LITIGATION IS REMOTE. ACCORDINGLY, NO LOSS CONTINGENCY WAS RECORDED FOR THIS MATTER.  STARBUCKS IS PARTY TO VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION CASES THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS, BUT, EXCEPT AS NOTED ABOVE, IS NOT CURRENTLY A PARTY TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NOTE 15.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, STARBUCKS HAD OVER 31,000 COMPANY-OPERATED AND LICENSED STORES, AN INCREASE OF 6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL A VARIETY OF CONSUMER-PACKAGED GOODS, OR CPG, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE GLOBAL COFFEE ALLIANCE ESTABLISHED WITH NESTLE\\u0301 AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND LONG-TERM GROWTH MODEL WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY NEW STORE OPENINGS, COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND MARGIN MANAGEMENT. COMPARABLE STORE SALES REPRESENT COMPANY-OPERATED STORES OPEN FOR 13 MONTHS OR LONGER AND EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019, OUR GLOBAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES GREW 5%.  WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: AMERICAS, INTERNATIONAL, AND CHANNEL DEVELOPMENT. NON-REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS AND UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSES ARE REPORTED WITHIN CORPORATE AND OTHER.  IN LATE JANUARY 2020, WE CLOSED MORE THAN HALF OF OUR STORES IN CHINA AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND MODIFY THE OPERATING HOURS OF ALL OF OUR STORES IN THE MARKET IN RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK OF THE CORONAVIRUS AND IN AN EFFORT TO HELP ENSURE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR PARTNERS (EMPLOYEES) AND OUR CUSTOMERS. THIS IS EXPECTED TO BE TEMPORARY.  GIVEN THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE DURATION OF BUSINESS DISRUPTION, REDUCED CUSTOMER TRAFFIC AND RELATED FINANCIAL IMPACT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AT THIS TIME BUT ARE EXPECTED TO MATERIALLY AFFECT OUR INTERNATIONAL SEGMENT AND CONSOLIDATED RESULTS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR OF FISCAL 2020.

THE GROWTH IN COMPANY-OPERATED STORES REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY A 5% INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES ($245 MILLION) AND INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM 919 NET NEW STARBUCKS  \\u00ae  COMPANY-OPERATED STORE OPENINGS, OR A 6% INCREASE, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS ($236 MILLION). PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE THE CONVERSIONS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THAILAND, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS DURING FISCAL 2019 ($92 MILLION).  LICENSED STORES REVENUE GROWTH ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET REVENUES ($55 MILLION), DRIVEN BY INCREASED PRODUCT AND ROYALTY REVENUES FROM OUR LICENSEES ($39 MILLION), PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE OPENING OF 1,008 NET NEW STARBUCKS  \\u00ae  LICENSED STORES, OR A 7% INCREASE, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND THE CONVERSIONS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THAILAND, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS ($21 MILLION).  OTHER REVENUES DECREASED $1 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING PRIOR YEAR PRODUCT SALES RELATED TO THE TAZO BRAND TRANSITION AGREEMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPANSION THROUGH THE GLOBAL COFFEE ALLIANCE.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATING EXPENSES  QUARTER ENDED  DEC 29,  2019  DEC 30,  2018  $CHANGE  DEC 29,  2019  DEC 30,  2018  AS A % OF TOTAL  NET REVENUES  COST OF SALES  $2,236.4  $2,175.8  $60.6  31.5%  32.8%  STORE OPERATING EXPENSES  2,821.5  2,586.8  234.7  39.8  39.0  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES  101.8  97.6  4.2  1.4  1.5  DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES  351.0  333.4  17.6  4.9  5.0  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  434.2  448.0  (13.8)  6.1  6.8  RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENTS  6.3  43.2  (36.9)  0.1  0.7  TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES  5,951.2  5,684.8  266.4  83.9  85.7  INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES  73.9  67.8  6.1  1.0  1.0  OPERATING INCOME  $1,219.8  $1,015.7  $204.1  17.2%  15.3%  STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A % OF COMPANY-OPERATED STORE REVENUES  48.8%  48.2%  QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 COMPARED WITH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018  COST OF SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET REVENUES DECREASED 130 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, PRIMARILY DUE TO SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCIES (APPROXIMATELY 90 BASIS POINTS).

STORE OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF COMPANY-OPERATED STORE REVENUES INCREASED 60 BASIS POINTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN WAGES AND BENEFITS (APPROXIMATELY 170 BASIS POINTS), LARGELY IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES LEVERAGE.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED $4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL COSTS TO DEVELOP AND GROW THE GLOBAL COFFEE ALLIANCE ($5 MILLION).  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $14 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING THE 2018 U.S STOCK AWARD GRANTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WHICH WAS FUNDED BY SAVINGS FROM THE TAX ACT AND VESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 ($23 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.  RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSES DECREASED $37 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING PRIOR YEAR SEVERANCE COSTS ($24 MILLION) AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN THE U.S ($10 MILLION) AND LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ($4 MILLION).  INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED $6 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COMPARABLE STORE SALES FROM OUR JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS IN SOUTH KOREA AND HIGHER INCOME FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN COFFEE PARTNERSHIP JOINT VENTURE.  THE COMBINATION OF THESE CHANGES RESULTED IN AN OVERALL INCREASE IN OPERATING MARGIN OF 190 BASIS POINTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES  QUARTER ENDED  DEC 29,  2019  DEC 30,  2018  $CHANGE  DEC 29,  2019  DEC 30,  2018  AS A % OF TOTAL  NET REVENUES  OPERATING INCOME  $1,219.8  $1,015.7  $204.1  17.2%  15.3%  INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET  15.9  24.8  (8.9)  0.2  0.4  INTEREST EXPENSE  (91.9)  (75.0)  (16.9)  (1.3)  (1.1)  EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES  1,143.8  965.5  178.3  16.1  14.6  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  258.5  205.1  53.4  3.6  3.1  NET EARNINGS INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  885.3  760.4  124.9  12.5  11.5  NET EARNINGS/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  (0.4)  (0.2)  (0.2)  \\u2014  \\u2014  NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO STARBUCKS  $885.7  $760.6  $125.1  12.5%  11.5%  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS  22.6%  21.2%  QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 COMPARED WITH QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2018  INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED $17 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCURRED ON LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUED IN MAY 2019.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 WAS 22.6% COMPARED TO 21.2% FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN FISCAL 2019. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING THE RELEASE OF INCOME TAX RESERVES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A U.S. TAX EXAMINATION (APPROXIMATELY 350 BASIS POINTS), LOWER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXCESS TAX BENEFIT (APPROXIMATELY 220 BASIS POINTS), LAPPING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR NESTLE\\u0301 TRANSACTION (APPROXIMATELY 130 BASIS POINTS) AND LAPPING OTHER IMMATERIAL TRUE-UPS.

WE ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO INTERNALLY FUND OPERATING NEEDS, MAKE SCHEDULED INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR BORROWINGS, MAKE ACQUISITIONS, AND RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY INCLUDES HIGHLY LIQUID AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT TREASURY SECURITIES (FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC) AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION OF CASH WAS HELD IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  BORROWING CAPACITY  OUR $2.0 BILLION UNSECURED 5-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201c2018 CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) AND OUR $1.0 BILLION UNSECURED 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201c364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH $150 MILLION MAY BE USED FOR ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, IS CURRENTLY SET TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 25, 2022. WE HAVE THE OPTION, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATED BANKS, TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT AMOUNT BY AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON LIBOR, AND, FOR U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASE RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY), IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN IS BASED ON THE BETTER OF (I) THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY MOODY'S AND STANDARD & POOR'S RATING AGENCIES AND (II) THE COMPANY'S FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, PURSUANT TO A PRICING GRID SET FORTH IN THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CURRENT APPLICABLE MARGIN IS 0.910% FOR EUROCURRENCY RATE LOANS AND 0.000% (NIL) FOR BASE RATE LOANS.  THE 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH NO AMOUNT MAY BE USED FOR ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, IS CURRENTLY SET TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 21, 2020. WE HAVE THE OPTION, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATED BANKS, TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT AMOUNT BY AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON LIBOR, AND, FOR U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASE RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY), IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN IS 0.920% FOR EUROCURRENCY RATE LOANS AND 0.000% (NIL) FOR BASE RATE LOANS.  BOTH CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, WHICH MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO COVER FINANCING EXPENSES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE COVENANTS RELATED TO OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WE MAY ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF $3.0 BILLION, WITH INDIVIDUAL MATURITIES THAT MAY VARY BUT NOT EXCEED 397 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO BE BACKSTOPPED BY AVAILABLE COMMITMENTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM MAY BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BUSINESS EXPANSION, PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD BORROWINGS OF $497.9 MILLION OUTSTANDING, NET OF UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  SEE  NOTE 8  ,  DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS 10-Q FOR DETAILS OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  THE INDENTURES UNDER WHICH ALL OF OUR SENIOR NOTES WERE ISSUED REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING LIMITS ON FUTURE LIENS AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ON CERTAIN MATERIAL PROPERTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE COVENANTS.  USE OF CASH  WE EXPECT TO USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT, TO INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NEW PRODUCT INNOVATIONS, RELATED MARKETING SUPPORT AND PARTNER AND DIGITAL INVESTMENTS, RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, AS WELL AS OTHER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO OUR CORE AND DEVELOPING BUSINESSES. FURTHER, WE MAY USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES TO MAKE PROPORTIONATE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR INVESTEES. WE MAY ALSO SEEK STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND FURTHER BUILD OUR BUSINESS IN SUPPORT OF OUR GROWTH-AT-SCALE AGENDA. ACQUISITIONS MAY INCLUDE INCREASING OUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN OUR INVESTEES. ANY DECISIONS TO INCREASE SUCH OWNERSHIP INTERESTS WILL BE DRIVEN BY VALUATION AND FIT WITH OUR OWNERSHIP STRATEGY.  WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING CASH AND INVESTMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY COMBINED WITH OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR BALANCE SHEET THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CORE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SIGNIFICANT NEW JOINT VENTURES, ACQUISITIONS AND/OR OTHER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OUTSIDE FUNDING. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE FUTURE. IN THIS REGARD, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, WITHIN TARGETED LEVELS, AS PART OF OUR PLANS TO FUND OUR CAPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CASH RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CASH POSITIONS AND OUR DETERMINATION OF INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF SUCH FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES AND U.S. STATE INCOME TAXES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR REPATRIATED FUNDS TO THE U.S. TO SATISFY DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $0.41 PER SHARE TO BE PAID ON FEBRUARY 21, 2020 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 6, 2020.  WE REPURCHASED 13.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $1.1 BILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2019 UNDER OUR ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, 16.2 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER CURRENT AUTHORIZATIONS.  OTHER THAN NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES, CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR NEW AND EXISTING STORES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND CORPORATE FACILITIES. TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION.  CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.8 BILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $2.4 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS.  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 TOTALED $0.4 BILLION, COMPARED TO CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $0.5 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019 TOTALED $1.1 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN FISCAL 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  IN MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE 10-K, WE DISCLOSED THAT WE HAD $28.2 BILLION IN TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR TOTAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS 10-Q OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  THERE HAS BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN OUR OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCUSSED IN MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE 10-K.  COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS  COMMODITY PRICE RISK REPRESENTS OUR PRIMARY MARKET RISK, GENERATED BY OUR PURCHASES OF GREEN COFFEE AND DAIRY PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. WE PURCHASE, ROAST AND SELL HIGH-QUALITY  ARABICA  COFFEE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND RISK ARISES FROM THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF GREEN COFFEE. IN ADDITION TO COFFEE, WE ALSO PURCHASE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES. THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMMODITIES DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE EXPECT COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY COFFEE, TO IMPACT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE PRODUCT SUPPLY IN ITEM 1 OF THE 10-K, AS WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF THE 10-K.  SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO MODERATE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, OF WHICH OUR FISCAL SECOND QUARTER TYPICALLY EXPERIENCES LOWER REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, AS OUR STORED VALUE CARDS ARE ISSUED TO AND LOADED BY CUSTOMERS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON, WE TEND TO HAVE HIGHER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. HOWEVER, SINCE REVENUES FROM OUR STORED VALUE CARDS ARE RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION AND NOT WHEN CASH IS LOADED, THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED. AS A RESULT OF MODERATE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR.

THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE USED TO INSPECT BAGGAGE, PARCELS, CARGO, PEOPLE, VEHICLES AND OTHER OBJECTS FOR WEAPONS, EXPLOSIVES, DRUGS, RADIOACTIVE AND NUCLEAR MATERIALS AND OTHER CONTRABAND. REVENUES FROM OUR SECURITY DIVISION ACCOUNTED FOR 63% AND 66% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  \\u200b  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  HEALTHCARE DIVISION.  THROUGH OUR HEALTHCARE DIVISION, WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, MARKET AND SERVICE PATIENT MONITORING AND DIAGNOSTIC CARDIOLOGY SYSTEMS INTERNATIONALLY FOR SALE PRIMARILY TO HOSPITALS AND MEDICAL CENTERS. OUR PRODUCTS MONITOR PATIENTS IN CRITICAL, EMERGENCY AND PERIOPERATIVE CARE AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL AND PROVIDE INFORMATION, THROUGH WIRED AND WIRELESS NETWORKS, TO PHYSICIANS AND NURSES WHO MAY BE AT THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE, IN ANOTHER AREA OF THE HOSPITAL OR EVEN OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL. REVENUES FROM OUR HEALTHCARE DIVISION ACCOUNTED FOR 16% AND 14% OF OUR TOTAL CONSOLIDATED REVENUES FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  \\u200b  OPTOELECTRONICS AND MANUFACTURING DIVISION.

GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, COUPLED WITH THE U.S. POLITICAL CLIMATE, HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY AND IMPACTED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY IN OUR SECURITY AND HEALTHCARE DIVISIONS. THE CURRENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR UK BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR ORDERS AND SALES OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL IN THE UK. WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THIS UNCERTAINTY WILL CONTINUE. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THAT THERE MAY BE A PERIOD OF DELAYED OR DEFERRED PURCHASING BY OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND EXPENSES. MANY OF THESE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  \\u200b  GLOBAL TRADE.  THE CURRENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO U.S. AND FOREIGN POLICIES RELATED TO GLOBAL TRADE AND TARIFFS, HAVE RESULTED IN UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE FUTURE STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. FURTHER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT SANCTIONS WOULD BE IMPOSED AGAINST CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS IN SELECT COUNTRIES. ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD.  HEALTHCARE CONSIDERATIONS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN PRIOR PERIODS BY DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN OUR HEALTHCARE DIVISION. THESE ISSUES MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS EFFORTS ADVANCED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OR MODIFY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY THAT HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \\u200b  EUROPEAN UNION THREAT DETECTION STANDARDS.  THE EU HAS IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS FOR ALL AIRPORTS WITHIN THE EU TO HAVE HOLD BAGGAGE SCREENING SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE EUROPEAN CIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCE (ECAC) STANDARD 3 BY SEPTEMBER 2020. HOWEVER, THIS DEADLINE COULD POTENTIALLY BE DELAYED. OUR SECURITY DIVISION'S REAL TIME TOMOGRAPHY (RTT) PRODUCT HAS PASSED THE ECAC EXPLOSIVE DETECTION SYSTEM STANDARD 3 THREAT DETECTION REQUIREMENT.  \\u200b  GOVERNMENT POLICIES.  OUR NET INCOME COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN U.S. OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TAX POLICIES, SUCH AS THE TAX ACT, THE IMPLICATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE OUR CURRENCY EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THE LIBOR INDEX IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCONTINUED BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021.

AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC.  CORPORATE OVERVIEW  ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC., (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARY, THE  \\u201cCOMPANY\\u201d OR \\u201cARCH\\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEVADA ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2009, UNDER  THE NAME \\u201cALMAH, INC.\\u201d. EFFECTIVE JUNE 26, 2013, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A MERGER (THE \\u201cMERGER\\u201d) WITH ARCH  BIOSURGERY, INC. (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC.), A MASSACHUSETTS CORPORATION (\\u201cABS\\u201d), AND ARCH ACQUISITION  CORPORATION (\\u201cMERGER SUB\\u201d), THE COMPANY\\u2019S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION,  PURSUANT TO WHICH MERGER SUB MERGED WITH AND INTO ABS AND ABS THEREBY BECAME THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT  OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABS, THE COMPANY ABANDONED ITS PRIOR BUSINESS PLAN AND CHANGED ITS OPERATIONS TO THE BUSINESS OF A BIOTECHNOLOGY  COMPANY. OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS.  FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, THE MERGER REPRESENTED A \\u201cREVERSE  MERGER\\u201d. ABS WAS DEEMED TO BE THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER IN THE TRANSACTION AND THE PREDECESSOR OF ARCH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACCUMULATED  DEFICIT AND THE HISTORICAL OPERATIONS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIOR TO THE  MERGER ARE THOSE OF ABS. ALL SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL  INFORMATION HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THAT OF ABS AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER ON JUNE 26, 2013, AND THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY BEFORE THE MERGER HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ABS BEFORE THE MERGER  IN THIS REPORT.  ABS WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  ON MARCH 6, 2006 AS CLEAR NANO SOLUTIONS, INC. ON APRIL 7, 2008, ABS CHANGED ITS NAME FROM CLEAR NANO SOLUTIONS, INC. TO ARCH THERAPEUTICS,  INC. EFFECTIVE UPON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, ABS CHANGED ITS NAME FROM ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. TO ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC.  20  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. WE  HAVE GENERATED NO REVENUES TO DATE AND ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATIONAL EFFORTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CORE  TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE DEVELOPING A NOVEL APPROACH TO STOP BLEEDING (\\u201cHEMOSTASIS\\u201d), CONTROL LEAKING (\\u201cSEALANT\\u201d)  AND MANAGE WOUNDS DURING SURGERY, TRAUMA AND INTERVENTIONAL CARE. ARCH IS DEVELOPING PRODUCTS BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE SELF-ASSEMBLING  BARRIER TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING CARE FASTER AND SAFER FOR PATIENTS. WE BELIEVE OUR TECHNOLOGY COULD SUPPORT  AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF STASIS AND BARRIER APPLICATIONS. OUR PLAN AND BUSINESS MODEL IS TO  DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT APPLY THAT CORE TECHNOLOGY FOR USE WITH BODILY FLUIDS AND TISSUES.  TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS PRINCIPALLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH  BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND UNITS CONSISTING OF ITS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (\\u201cCOMMON  STOCK\\u201d), AND WARRANTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE RELATING TO THE RESEARCH,  DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS POTENTIAL PRODUCTS. AS OF JANUARY 29, 2020, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT  CASH ON HAND WILL MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO  RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, OR BOTH, IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE  COMPANY, IF AT ALL. THEREFORE, THERE EXISTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  OUR FLAGSHIP DEVELOPMENT STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES, KNOWN COLLECTIVELY  AS THE AC5  \\u00ae  DEVICES (WHICH WE SOMETIMES REFER TO AS \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  \\u201d \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL GEL\\u201d, \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  SURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE\\u201d, \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  SURGICAL HEMOSTAT\\u201d,  \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE\\u201d, OR \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL HEMOSTAT\\u201d), ARE BEING  DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGICAL, WOUND AND INTERVENTIONAL CARE. THEY RELY ON OUR SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE (\\u201cSAP\\u201d)  TECHNOLOGY AND ARE BEING DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE HEMOSTASIS IN SKIN WOUNDS AND IN MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND OPEN SURGICAL PROCEDURES.  WE INTEND TO DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES BASED ON OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FOR USE IN A RANGE OF INDICATIONS. AC5 IS BEING  DESIGNED AS A PRODUCT CONTAINING SYNTHETIC BIOCOMPATIBLE PEPTIDES COMPRISING L-AMINO ACIDS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS NATURALLY  OCCURRING AMINO ACIDS. WHEN APPLIED TO A WOUND, AC5 INTERCALATES INTO THE INTERSTICES OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE WHERE IT SELF-ASSEMBLES  INTO A PHYSICAL, MECHANICAL NANOSCALE STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES A BARRIER TO LEAKING SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS BLOOD. AC5 MAY BE APPLIED  DIRECTLY AS A LIQUID, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE IT USER-FRIENDLY AND ABLE TO CONFORM TO IRREGULAR WOUND GEOMETRY. ADDITIONALLY,  AC5 DOES NOT POSSESS STICKY OR GLUE-LIKE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE ITS UTILITY IN SEVERAL SETTINGS,  INCLUDING MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES. FURTHER, IN CERTAIN SETTINGS, AC5 LENDS ITSELF TO A CONCEPT THAT WE CALL CRYSTAL  CLEAR SURGERYTM; THE TRANSPARENCY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AC5 MAY ENABLE A SURGEON TO OPERATE THROUGH IT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN  A CLEARER FIELD OF VISION AND PROPHYLACTICALLY STOP OR LESSEN BLEEDING AS IT STARTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS OF EARLY DATA FROM PRECLINICAL TESTS  AS WELL AS CERTAIN CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN QUICK AND EFFECTIVE HEMOSTASIS WITH THE USE OF AC5 RELATIVE TO THAT REPORTED  WITH OTHER TYPES OF HEMOSTATIC AGENTS, AND THAT TIME TO HEMOSTASIS IS COMPARABLE AMONG TEST SUBJECTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH  TEST SUBJECT HAD OR HAD NOT BEEN TREATED WITH THERAPEUTIC DOSES OF ANTICOAGULANT OR ANTIPLATELET MEDICATIONS, COMMONLY CALLED \\u201cBLOOD  THINNERS\\u201d. BASED ON TESTING RESULTS, WE BELIEVE THAT AC5 IS BIOCOMPATIBLE. ARCH THERAPEUTICS\\u2019 TECHNOLOGY HAS DEMONSTRATED  HEMOSTASIS IN LIVER AND OTHER ORGANS IN  IN VIVO  SURGICAL MODELS, INCLUDING RAPID HEMOSTASIS WITHIN 15 SECONDS. IN A RANGE  OF SMALL AND LARGE ANIMAL MODELS, OUR SAP COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO STOP BLEEDING, SEAL LEAKING, ALLOW FOR NORMAL HEALING,  AND MITIGATE INFLAMMATION WHILE BEING BIOCOMPATIBLE.  WE HAVE DEVOTED MUCH OF OUR OPERATIONAL EFFORT TO DATE TO THE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CORE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING SELECTING OUR INITIAL PRODUCT COMPOSITION, CONDUCTING SAFETY AND OTHER  RELATED TESTS, CONDUCTING A HUMAN TRIAL FOR SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF AC5, DEVELOPING METHODS FOR MANUFACTURING SCALE-UP, REPRODUCIBILITY,  AND VALIDATION, AND DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDERLYING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. MANUFACTURING  METHOD AND FORMULATION OPTIMIZATION AND VALIDATION ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF PEPTIDE DEVELOPMENT. MANUFACTURING AND FORMULATION OPTIMIZATION  FOR OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE DONE WITH EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AMONG OUR TEAM AND PARTNERS. THE PROCESSES  ARE FOCUSED ON OPTIMIZING TRADITIONAL PRODUCT PARAMETERS TO TARGET SPECIFICATIONS COVERING PERFORMANCE, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, PHYSICAL  APPEARANCE, STABILITY, AND HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, AMONG OTHERS. WE AND OUR PARTNERS INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR MANUFACTURING  PROCESSES AND FORMULATION METHODS CLOSELY, AS SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN BOTH SETTING AND REALIZING APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS MAY DIRECTLY  IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL TRIALS AS WE ESTABLISH AND EXECUTE OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS PLAN INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING GOALS.  \\u00b7  CONDUCTING BIOCOMPATIBILITY, PRE-CLINICAL, AND CLINICAL STUDIES ON AC5 AND RELATED PRODUCTS;  \\u00b7  EXPANDING AND MAINTAINING PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO;  \\u00b7  DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS TO MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, MARKET AND OTHERWISE COMMERCIALIZE AC5;  \\u00b7  OBTAINING REGULATORY CERTIFICATION OR CLEARANCE OF AC5 AND RELATED PRODUCTS IN THE EU, THE U.S., AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WE MAY DETERMINE;  \\u00b7  CONTINUING OR DEVELOPING ACADEMIC, SCIENTIFIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS TO COLLABORATE ON PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND  \\u00b7  DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN THE HEMOSTATIC, SEALANT, AND/OR OTHER FIELDS.  21  IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS GOALS, WE EXPECT TO  CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  \\u00b7  SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE MILESTONES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY AND OUR OPERATIONS GENERALLY;  \\u00b7  WORK WITH OUR LARGE SCALE MANUFACTURING PARTNERS TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION OF PRODUCT COMPLIANT WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (\\u201cCGMP\\u201d), WHICH ACTIVITIES WILL BE ONGOING AS WE SEEK TO ADVANCE TOWARD, ENTER INTO, AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASE COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES;  \\u00b7  FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT PLATFORM;  \\u00b7  PURSUE REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION;  \\u00b7  CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL REPORTING AND CONTROLS;  \\u00b7  SEEK COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS;  \\u00b7  EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO BY FILING NEW PATENT APPLICATIONS, OBTAINING ALLOWANCES ON CURRENTLY FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS, AND/OR ADDING TO OUR TRADE SECRETS IN SELF-ASSEMBLY, MANUFACTURING, ANALYTICAL METHODS AND FORMULATION, WHICH ACTIVITIES WILL BE ONGOING AS WE SEEK TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE PORTFOLIO;  \\u00b7  OBTAIN REGULATORY INPUT INTO SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNS;  \\u00b7  ASSESS OUR SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND SELECT PRODUCT CANDIDATES FOR ADVANCEMENT INTO DEVELOPMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS CASH ON HAND TO MEET ITS ANTICIPATED  CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, DEPENDING UPON ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM EU AND US REGULATORY  AUTHORITIES, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEFORE THEN. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, OUR ESTIMATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  POTENTIALLY COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IF A NUMBER OF RISKS RELATING TO CONDUCTING THESE ACTIVITIES WERE TO OCCUR, INCLUDING  WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING \\u201c  RISK FACTORS  \\u201d IN THIS FILING.  MERGER WITH ABS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES  AS NOTED EARLIER IN THIS DOCUMENT, ON JUNE 26, 2013, THE COMPANY  COMPLETED THE MERGER WITH ABS, PURSUANT TO WHICH ABS BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE MERGER,  EFFECTIVE MAY 24, 2013, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (\\u201cCOMMON STOCK\\u201d),  FROM 75,000,000 SHARES TO 300,000,000 SHARES AND EFFECTED A FORWARD STOCK SPLIT, BY WAY OF A STOCK DIVIDEND, OF ITS ISSUED AND  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A RATIO OF 11 SHARES TO EACH ONE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE. ALSO, IN CONTEMPLATION OF  THE MERGER, EFFECTIVE JUNE 5, 2013, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME FROM ALMAH, INC. TO ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND CHANGED THE TICKER  SYMBOL UNDER WHICH ITS COMMON STOCK TRADES ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD FROM \\u201cAACH\\u201d TO \\u201cARTH\\u201d.  22  LIGUIDITY  WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND HAVE GENERATED NO OPERATING  REVENUES TO DATE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE 510(K) PREMARKET NOTIFICATION FOR AC5 TM TOPICAL GEL HAS BEEN  REVIEWED AND CLEARED BY THE FDA, ALLOWING FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE MARKETED. WE DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR EFFORTS ON FUNDRAISING,  PLANNING AND CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, AND PRODUCT RESEARCH. FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $1,659,754 VERSUS A NET LOSS OF $2,600,237 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES,  INCLUDING REGULATORY APPROVAL AND PRODUCT RESEARCH, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.  THE LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING REGULATORY  APPROVAL AND PRODUCT RESEARCH, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY AND PATENT APPLICATION COSTS, GENERAL CORPORATE LEGAL EXPENSES AND BY AN ADJUSTMENT OF $832,413, TO THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $509, DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $1,321,648, COMPARED TO $1,322,157 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. CASH AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $843,059 TO $3,023,388 COMPARED TO $2,180,329 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  ON OCTOBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF REGISTERED  DIRECT OFFERING OF 14,285,714 UNITS, EACH UNIT CONSISTING OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK, AND A SERIES I WARRANT  (\\u201cSERIES I WARRANT\\u201d) TO PURCHASE A SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE COMBINED PURCHASE PRICE OF $0.175 PER UNIT. THE  SERIES I WARRANTS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $0.22 PER SHARE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE OFFERING CLOSED  ON OCTOBER 18, 2019. THE GROSS PROCEEDS TO ARCH FROM THE 2019 FINANCING WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION BEFORE DEDUCTING FINANCING  COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $333,000. PURSUANT TO THE ENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ALSO AGREED TO ISSUE TO THE PLACEMENT AGENT,  OR ITS DESIGNEES, WARRANTS TO PURCHASE UP TO 1,071,429 SHARES (THE \\u201cPLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS\\u201d). THE PLACEMENT AGENT  WARRANTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS THE SERIES I WARRANTS, EXCEPT THAT THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS  IS $0.21875 PER SHARE AND THE TERM OF THE PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS IS FIVE YEARS.

CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $2,134,762 TO  $2,167,162 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $32,400 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING RESULTED FROM $2,167,162 FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON  STOCK AND WARRANTS IN THE OCTOBER 2019 FINANCING. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING  RESULTED FROM $32,400 FROM THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 87,567 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  CASH REQUIREMENTS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES WILL INCREASE  SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND PURSUE OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS. AS OF JANUARY 29, 2020, WE BELIEVE  THAT OUR CURRENT CASH ON HAND WILL MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. NOTWITHSTANDING  THIS, DEPENDING UPON ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM EU AND US REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS  BEFORE WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. FURTHER, OUR ESTIMATES REGARDING OUR USE OF CASH COULD CHANGE IF WE ENCOUNTER UNANTICIPATED  DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER ISSUES ARISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING \\u201c  RISK FACTORS  \\u201d  IN THIS FILING, IN WHICH CASE OUR CURRENT FUNDS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS FOR THE PERIOD WE EXPECT.  WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND HAVE GENERATED NO OPERATING  REVENUES TO DATE. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY HAVE, NOR DO WE EXPECT IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO HAVE, REVENUE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR  OPERATIONS, AND WILL NEED TO OBTAIN ALL OF OUR NECESSARY FUNDING FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE DO NOT HAVE  ANY COMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE CAPITAL. SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE REQUIRED TO FUND OUR PLANNED OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR  TERM AND IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES RELATING TO OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCT CANDIDATE, SEEKING  REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THAT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATE WE MAY CHOOSE TO DEVELOP, COMMERCIALIZING ANY PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR  WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION, SEEKING TO LICENSE OR ACQUIRE NEW ASSETS OR BUSINESSES, AND MAINTAINING  OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PURSUING RIGHTS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON  COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE OR ACCEPTABLE TERMS WHEN NEEDED, OR AT ALL. WE ARE BOUND BY CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT  MAY LIMIT OR OTHERWISE IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE NEAR-TERM INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROVISIONS  IN THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OR ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO EFFECT ANY ISSUANCE BY THE COMPANY  OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OF COMMON STOCK OR SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE, EXERCISABLE OR EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON STOCK (OR A COMBINATION  OF UNITS THEREOF) INVOLVING A VARIABLE RATE TRANSACTION (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA) INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  AN EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT OR \\u201cAT-THE-MARKET\\u201d FINANCING FACILITY UNTIL THE THREE LEAD INVESTORS IN THE 2017 FINANCING  AND THE 2018 FINANCING COLLECTIVELY OWN LESS THAN 20% OF THE SERIES F WARRANTS AND SERIES G WARRANTS PURCHASED BY THEM PURSUANT  TO THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA. THESE RESTRICTIONS AND PROVISIONS COULD MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH  THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT OR THROUGH EQUITY ISSUANCES. IF WE CANNOT RAISE THE MONEY THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR  BUSINESS, WE WILL BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE WERE TO OCCUR,  THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WOULD FAIL AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.  AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, SINCE INCEPTION WE HAVE FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS  PRIMARILY THROUGH EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEEK TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL  FINANCING BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 OWNERSHIP WILL BE DILUTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE TERMS OF  SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE IN FUTURE CAPITAL-RAISING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR OUR NEW INVESTORS, AND IN PARTICULAR MAY  INCLUDE PREFERENCES, SUPERIOR VOTING RIGHTS AND THE ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS OR OTHER DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL  DILUTIVE EFFECTS. IF WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING BY INCURRING DEBT, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS  ON OUR OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF ANY LOAN OR CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE DEBT. FURTHER, OBTAINING ANY LOAN, ASSUMING  A LOAN WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WOULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS. WE MAY ALSO  SEEK FUNDING FROM COLLABORATION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT WE RELINQUISH POTENTIALLY VALUABLE  RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. MOREOVER,  REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SEEK TO RAISE CAPITAL, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN THOSE PURSUITS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT  BANKING FEES, LEGAL FEES, ACCOUNTING FEES, PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS. IN ADDITION, AS DESCRIBED  IN GREATER DETAIL UNDER THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED \\u201c  THE TERMS OF THE 2017 FINANCING AND 2018 FINANCING COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL  CHALLENGES ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE  ,\\u201d INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE 2017  SPA AND THE 2018 SPA IMPOSES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES.  25  GOING CONCERN  FROM INCEPTION, WE HAVE NOT EARNED OPERATING REVENUES FROM  SALES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND HAVE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL HAVE  CASH ON HAND INTO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON  RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND EVENTUALLY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THERE IS  SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OPERATIONS DISCONTINUE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES  PURSUANT TO CERTAIN DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SEC, THE  SEC DEFINES \\u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\u201d AS THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT,  SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY  UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED WITH  THIS FORM 10-Q INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC. A BIOTECHNOLOGY  COMPANY. ALL INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  THE COMPANY IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF ITS EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES, RAISING CAPITAL, ESTABLISHING CUSTOMER AND VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS, AND RECRUITING  NEW EMPLOYEES.  USE OF ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATES OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE  ESTIMATES.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES  INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360,  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  FOR ASSETS THAT ARE TO BE HELD AND USED, IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE  ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS IS LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IF IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO WRITE THE ASSET DOWN  TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS IS RECORDED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED  BASED ON QUOTED MARKET VALUES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPLICABLE. ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED  OF ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  WE EXPENSE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS,  INCLUDING COSTS OF FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS, IN THE PERIOD INCURRED  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) ASC TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION-STOCK  COMPENSATION  (\\u201cFASB ASC TOPIC 718\\u201d), WHICH REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF  EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ACCOUNT FOR NON-EMPLOYEE  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE OF FASB ASC TOPIC 505,  EQUITY  (\\u201cFASB ASC TOPIC 505\\u201d),  WHICH REQUIRES THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO NON-EMPLOYEES  OVER THEIR VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE PERIOD DURING WHICH SERVICES ARE RENDERED BY SUCH NON-EMPLOYEES. FASB ASC TOPIC  505 REQUIRES US TO RE-MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO NON-EMPLOYEES AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD DURING THE VESTING  PERIOD OR UNTIL SERVICES ARE COMPLETE.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 718, WE HAVE ELECTED TO USE  THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED AND WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION COST OF  SHARE-BASED AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT  AWARDS UTILIZING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL IS AFFECTED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS,  INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE AND EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY  DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT HISTORY OF MARKET PRICES OF THE COMMON STOCK, AND AS SUCH VOLATILITY WAS ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC 718-10-S99  COMPENSATION-STOCK COMPENSATION  (\\u201cASC 718-10-S99\\u201d). PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY\\u2019S  EXPECTED VOLATILITY WAS DERIVED FROM THE HISTORICAL DAILY CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE IT EXITED SHELL  COMPANY STATUS, AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL DAILY CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICE FOR THE PEER GROUPS AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE  JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY IS USING ITS HISTORICAL MARKET PRICES TO CALCULATE THE VOLATILITY OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THE LIFE TERM  FOR AWARDS USES THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR ALL \\u201cPLAIN VANILLA\\u201d OPTIONS, AS DEFINED IN ASC 718-10-S99 AND THE CONTRACTUAL  TERM FOR ALL OTHER EMPLOYEE AND NON-EMPLOYEE AWARDS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON OBSERVED INTEREST RATES  APPROPRIATE FOR THE TERMS OF OUR AWARDS. THE DIVIDEND YIELD ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON HISTORY AND THE EXPECTATION OF PAYING NO DIVIDENDS.  FORFEITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF GRANT AND REVISED, IF NECESSARY, IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHEN RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IS BASED ON AWARDS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY  EXPECTED TO VEST.  26  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  WE MEASURE BOTH FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  , INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. THE STANDARD CREATED A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE  INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE BROAD LEVELS AS FOLLOWS: LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES  (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES; LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED  WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY; AND LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE  INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN VIEWS ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  INCOME TAXES  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  , WE RECOGNIZE  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OR EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND/OR TAX RETURNS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOR LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS USING ENACTED  TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED  BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.  WE PROVIDE RESERVES FOR POTENTIAL PAYMENTS OF TAX TO VARIOUS  TAX AUTHORITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS WILL BE INCURRED  RELATED TO THESE MATTERS AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY DETERMINABLE.  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS WARRANTS AND OTHER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER EQUITY OR LIABILITIES BASED UPON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROVISIONS OF EACH INSTRUMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH  FASB ASC TOPIC 815,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING  . WARRANTS CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF  ISSUANCE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR VALUATION ARE MADE. WARRANTS CLASSIFIED  AS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND OTHER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT REQUIRE SEPARATE ACCOUNTING AS LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED  ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE AND WILL BE REVALUED ON EACH SUBSEQUENT  BALANCE SHEET DATE UNTIL SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE EXERCISED OR EXPIRE, WITH ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS  RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME OR EXPENSE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE LIABILITIES USING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND ASSUMPTIONS  THAT ARE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WARRANTS OR INSTRUMENTS ON THE VALUATION DATE, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS FOR  FUTURE FINANCINGS, EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, YIELD, AND RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE  VALUE. THE COST OF INVENTORIES COMPRISES EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN ACQUIRING THE INVENTORIES, THE COST OF CONVERSION AND OTHER COSTS  INCURRED IN BRINGING THEM TO THEIR EXISTING LOCATION AND CONDITION. THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND FINISHED GOODS  AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE DETERMINED ON A FIRST IN FIRST OUT (FIFO) BASIS. WHEN DETERMINING NET REALIZABLE VALUE, APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION  IS GIVEN TO OBSOLESCENCE, EXCESSIVE LEVELS, DETERIORATION, AND OTHER FACTORS IN EVALUATING NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2018-07, \\u201cCOMPENSATION\\u2014STOCK  COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718) IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING\\u201d WAS ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) IN JUNE 2018. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ADDRESS ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND FOR INTERIM  PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2018-07  DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND  THE IMPACT WAS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU 2016-02, \\u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\\u201d WAS ISSUED  BY THE FASB IN FEBRUARY 2016. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO RECOGNIZE MOST OPERATING LEASES BY RECORDING A RIGHT-TO-USE  ASSET AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITY. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR FISCAL  YEARS, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02  DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND  THE IMPACT WAS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS ONE OPERATING LEASE AND AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE THE REMAINING TERM WAS LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE  OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,  LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  27\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"Arch Therapeutics, Inc.\", \"CIK\": 1537561, \"Date\": \"2020-01-30T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"ARTH\", \"Name\": \"Arch Therapeutics Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"OTCBB\", \"SIC\": 5531.0, \"Business\": \"L2\", \"Incorporated\": \"NV\", \"IRS\": 460524102.0, \"key\": \"20200130ARTH\", \"labelr1\": 0.0, \"labelr2\": -2.97872340425531, \"labelr3\": -1.3157894736842115, \"labelr4\": -13.333333333333336, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.6048225, \"prof1\": 0.39517748, \"return1&2\": 1.0297872340425531, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0433370660694288, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.182448674878686, \"return2\": 1.0297872340425531, \"return1\": 1.0, \"return3\": 1.013157894736842, \"return4\": 1.1333333333333333, \"1_day_return\": 0.0, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.308677590684675, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3593, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9456364854304243, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9376082561540495, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.8960792721814268, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9900762536557943, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9787739196841426}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3599, \"level_0\": 3694, \"index\": 33520, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

INTRODUCTION  THE FOLLOWING SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAVCO INDUSTRIES, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES' (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\\"COMPANY\\\" OR \\\"CAVCO\\\") CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT. REFERENCES TO \\\"NOTE\\\" OR \\\"NOTES\\\" PERTAIN TO THE NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  HEADQUARTERED IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND PRODUCES FACTORY-BUILT HOMES PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AND COMPANY-OWNED RETAILERS, PLANNED COMMUNITY OPERATORS AND RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPERS. THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES, BASED ON REPORTED WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS, MARKETED UNDER A VARIETY OF BRAND NAMES INCLUDING CAVCO, FLEETWOOD, PALM HARBOR, FAIRMONT, FRIENDSHIP, CHARIOT EAGLE, LEXINGTON AND DESTINY. THE COMPANY IS ALSO ONE OF THE LEADING PRODUCERS OF PARK MODEL RVS, VACATION CABINS AND SYSTEMS-BUILT COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES, AS WELL AS MODULAR HOMES. CAVCO'S FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, COUNTRYPLACE ACCEPTANCE CORP. (\\\"COUNTRYPLACE\\\"), IS AN APPROVED FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (\\\"FANNIE MAE\\\") AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (\\\"FREDDIE MAC\\\") SELLER/SERVICER AND A GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUER THAT OFFERS CONFORMING MORTGAGES, NON-CONFORMING MORTGAGES AND HOME-ONLY LOANS TO PURCHASERS OF FACTORY-BUILT HOMES. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, STANDARD CASUALTY CO. (\\\"STANDARD CASUALTY\\\"), PROVIDES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE TO OWNERS OF MANUFACTURED HOMES.  COMPANY GROWTH  FROM ITS INCEPTION IN 1965, CAVCO TRADITIONALLY SERVED AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKETS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH MANUFACTURED HOME PRODUCTION. DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1997 TO 2000, CAVCO WAS PURCHASED BY, AND BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF, CENTEX CORPORATION, WHICH OPERATED THE COMPANY UNTIL 2003, WHEN CAVCO BECAME A STAND-ALONE PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY TRADED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL CVCO.  THE COMPANY HAS STRATEGICALLY EXPANDED ITS FACTORY OPERATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF INDUSTRY COMPETITORS. THIS HAS ENABLED CAVCO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKET ON A NATIONAL BASIS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE PURCHASE OF THE FLEETWOOD AND PALM HARBOR ASSETS IN AUGUST 2009 AND APRIL 2011, RESPECTIVELY, INCREASED HOME PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND PROVIDED FOR VERTICAL INTEGRATION THROUGH ENTRY INTO FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRY. THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPANDED THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC REACH AT A NATIONAL LEVEL BY ADDING FACTORIES AND RETAIL LOCATIONS SERVING THE NORTHWEST, WEST, SOUTH, SOUTH CENTRAL AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS.  THE PURCHASES OF CHARIOT EAGLE, FAIRMONT, LEXINGTON AND DESTINY, IN MARCH 2015, MAY 2015, APRIL 2017 AND AUGUST 2019, RESPECTIVELY, PROVIDED ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPACITY, INCREASED HOME PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES AND FURTHER STRENGTHENED THE COMPANY'S MARKET IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL PROVINCES IN CANADA.  THE COMPANY OPERATES  20  HOMEBUILDING FACILITIES LOCATED IN MILLERSBURG AND WOODBURN, OREGON; NAMPA, IDAHO; RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA; PHOENIX AND GOODYEAR, ARIZONA; AUSTIN, FORT WORTH, SEGUIN AND WACO, TEXAS; MONTEVIDEO, MINNESOTA; NAPPANEE, INDIANA; LAFAYETTE, TENNESSEE; LEXINGTON, MISSISSIPPI; MARTINSVILLE AND ROCKY MOUNT, VIRGINIA; DOUGLAS AND MOULTRIE, GEORGIA; AND OCALA AND PLANT CITY, FLORIDA. THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMES PRODUCED ARE SOLD TO, AND DISTRIBUTED BY, INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND CONTROLLED RETAIL OPERATIONS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S HOMES ARE SOLD THROUGH  39  COMPANY-OWNED U.S. RETAIL LOCATIONS.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED ON A DECENTRALIZED BASIS, WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THE HOME OFFICE. THIS DECENTRALIZATION ENABLES THE COMPANY'S OPERATORS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO LOCAL MARKET DEMAND, BE MORE CUSTOMER FOCUSED AND HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO MAKE SWIFT DECISIONS, WHILE STILL BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND STRIVES TO IMPROVE DESIGNS, PRODUCTION METHODS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON GAINING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AMONG ITS OPERATIONS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL.  COMPANY OUTLOOK  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A CONSERVATIVE COST STRUCTURE IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD ADDED VALUE INTO ITS HOMES AND HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO MAINTAIN A SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, INCLUDING OUR POSITION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHOULD HELP US AVOID LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND ENABLE US TO ACT EFFECTIVELY AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES.  THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND UTILIZE LOCAL MARKET RESEARCH TO DESIGN HOMES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE FLOOR PLANS AND DESIGNS TO FULFILL SPECIFIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS. BY OFFERING A FULL RANGE OF HOMES FROM ENTRY-LEVEL MODELS TO LARGE CUSTOM HOMES AND WITH THE ABILITY TO ENGINEER DESIGNS IN-HOUSE, THE COMPANY CAN ACCOMMODATE VIRTUALLY ANY CUSTOMER REQUEST. IN ADDITION TO HOMES BUILT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL MANUFACTURING HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS (\\\"HUD CODE\\\") PROMULGATED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (\\\"HUD\\\"), THE COMPANY ALSO CONSTRUCTS MODULAR HOMES THAT CONFORM TO STATE AND LOCAL CODES, PARK MODEL RVS AND CABINS AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT MANY OF ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  THE COMPANY SEEKS OUT NICHE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHERE ITS DIVERSE PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOM BUILDING CAPABILITIES PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR GREEN BUILDING INITIATIVES INVOLVE THE CREATION OF AN ENERGY EFFICIENT ENVELOPE AND HIGHER UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS. THESE HOMES PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, TYPICALLY LOWER UTILITY COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO BUILDS HOMES DESIGNED TO USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND. FROM BAMBOO FLOORING AND TANKLESS WATER HEATERS TO SOLAR-POWERED HOMES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DIVERSE AND TAILORED TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER INTERESTS. INNOVATION IN HOUSING DESIGN IS A FORTE OF THE COMPANY AND IT CONTINUES TO INTRODUCE NEW MODELS AT COMPETITIVE PRICE POINTS WITH EXPRESSIVE INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS THAT COMPLEMENT HOME STYLES IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED ON THE RELATIVELY LOW COST ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURED HOME OWNERSHIP, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY COMPETED WITH RENTAL HOUSING'S MONTHLY PAYMENT AFFORDABILITY. RENTAL HOUSING ACTIVITY IS REPORTED TO HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A DECLINE IN TENANT HOUSING VACANCY RATES AND A CORRESPONDING RISE IN RENTAL RATES. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHER MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, MAY CAUSE SOME RENTERS TO BECOME BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING MANUFACTURED HOMES.  FURTHER, WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL RISE IN DEMAND FOR RENTAL HOUSING, THE COMPANY HAS REALIZED A LARGER PROPORTION OF ORDERS AND INTEREST FROM DEVELOPERS AND COMMUNITY OWNERS FOR NEW MANUFACTURED HOMES INTENDED FOR USE AS RENTAL HOMES, ALTERNATIVE DWELLING UNITS AND SEASONAL LIVING. THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS OF THESE BUYERS AND VALUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UNITS THAT ARE WELL SUITED FOR THESE PURPOSES.  CAVCO MAINTAINS A BACKLOG OF ORDERS FROM ITS NETWORK OF LICENSED DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY CANCEL ORDERS PRIOR TO PRODUCTION WITHOUT PENALTY. ACCORDINGLY, UNTIL THE PRODUCTION OF A PARTICULAR UNIT HAS COMMENCED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS BACKLOG TO BE FIRM ORDERS. THE BACKLOG OF SALES ORDERS AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  $115 MILLION  IN TOTAL COMPARED TO  $166 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 29, 2018  . WHILE ORDER BACKLOG LEVELS VARY PER FACTORY, THE CURRENT BACKLOG LEVEL IN TOTAL IS CONSIDERED HEALTHY. A HEALTHY BACKLOG IS INDICATIVE OF THE GENERAL ABILITY TO COORDINATE EFFICIENT FACTORY PRODUCTION SCHEDULES, TIMELY OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS BASED ON PRODUCT MIX AND ACHIEVE THE UNIT COMPLETION TIMEFRAME EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG AT  DECEMBER 29, 2018  WAS ELEVATED AS A RESULT OF EXCESSIVE ORDER VOLUME FROM INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTORS. THE HIGH ORDER RATES MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN IN PART BY WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN CONCERNS ABOUT MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INVENTORY LEVELS IN A PERIOD WHERE DISTRIBUTORS MAY HAVE PERCEIVED UNDERLYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEMAND TO BE ACCELERATING FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ORDER VOLUME GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BY WORKING TO INCREASE ITS PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES AND ADJUSTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MANAGE ITS PRODUCTION LEVELS AND WORKFORCE SIZE IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS WHILE ENSURING EFFICIENT USE OF ITS PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS WAGE RATES OF ITS PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES AND HAS ESTABLISHED OTHER MONETARY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO MORE EXTENSIVELY USE ON-LINE RECRUITING TOOLS, UPDATE RECRUITMENT BROCHURES AND IMPROVE THE APPEARANCE AND APPEAL OF ITS PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES AND REDUCE ANNUALIZED TURNOVER RATES. EVEN WITH THESE CHALLENGES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ABILITY TO HELP MEET THE OVERALL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOAN PROGRAMS WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS THAT INDEPENDENT FINANCIERS THEN LEND TO DISTRIBUTORS TO FINANCE RETAIL INVENTORIES OF ITS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DIRECT COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR FINANCING HOMES (SEE NOTE  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT IN COMMERCIAL LOANS HELPS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MANUFACTURED HOME FINANCING TO DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS. PARTICIPATION IN WHOLESALE FINANCING IS HELPFUL TO THESE CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PRODUCT EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS. THESE INITIATIVES SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO EXPAND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, THESE INITIATIVES DO EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THIS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY FINANCING PARTNERS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE LACK OF AN EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET FOR MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS LENDING TO MANUFACTURED HOME BUYERS RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES FOR LOANS SECURED BY MANUFACTURED HOMES COMPARED TO THOSE FOR SITE-BUILT HOMES. THIS CONTINUES TO CONSTRAIN INDUSTRY GROWTH. THE COMPANY IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO DEVELOP SECONDARY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND EXPAND LENDING AVAILABILITY IN THE INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY-BASED LENDING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE HOME-ONLY FINANCING TO NEW RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES. OUR MORTGAGE SUBSIDIARY ALSO DEVELOPS AND INVESTS IN HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS TO GROW SALES OF HOMES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION POINTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT GROWING ITS INVESTMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN HOME-ONLY LENDING MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SALES GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT, AS WELL AS PROVIDE A MEANS THAT COULD LEAD TO INCREASED HOME SALES FOR ITS FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING THROUGH INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE FAVORABLE LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE (\\\"GSE\\\") ACTION TO ADDRESS THE MORTGAGE FINANCING NEEDS OF BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE GSES TO COMPLY WITH A \\\"DUTY TO SERVE\\\" THE UNDERSERVED MARKETS SPECIFIED IN THE FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS ACT OF 1992, AS AMENDED BY THE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008. MANUFACTURED HOUSING IS ONE OF THE SPECIFIED UNDERSERVED MARKETS. IN DECEMBER 2017, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC RELEASED THEIR FINAL UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS THAT DESCRIBE, WITH SPECIFICITY, THE ACTIONS THEY WILL TAKE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD TO FULFILL THEIR \\\"DUTY TO SERVE\\\" OBLIGATIONS. THESE PLANS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. EACH OF THE THREE-YEAR PLANS OFFERS AN ENHANCED MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCT THROUGH THEIR \\\"MH ADVANTAGE\\\" AND \\\"CHOICEHOME\\\" PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY, THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN THE LATTER PART OF CALENDAR 2018. SMALL-SCALE PILOT PROGRAMS FOR THE PURCHASE OF HOME-ONLY LOANS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE GSE\\u2019S UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS. IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE GSE\\u2019S UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THEIR REGULATOR, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, AND THEIR APPROVAL IS NOT ASSURED. EXPANSION OF THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR LENDING THROUGH THE GSES COULD SUPPORT FURTHER DEMAND FOR HOUSING, AS LENDING OPTIONS WOULD LIKELY BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE TO HOME BUYERS. ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS AREA, MEANINGFUL POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE FORM OF INCREASED HOME ORDERS HAS YET TO BE REALIZED.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, HUD ANNOUNCED A TOP-TO-BOTTOM REVIEW OF ITS MANUFACTURED HOUSING RULES AS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO IDENTIFY REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, OVERLY BURDENSOME, OR EXCESSIVELY COSTLY GIVEN THE CRITICAL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN ADDITION, ON JUNE 25, 2019, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ALLEVIATE BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATED A WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL ON ELIMINATING REGULATORY BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CONSISTING OF MEMBERS FROM EIGHT FEDERAL AGENCIES AND CHAIRED BY THE HUD SECRETARY. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO TIMELINE ESTABLISHED, IF CERTAIN CHANGES ARE MADE, THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF HOME BUYERS.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM EXCESSIVE POLICY CLAIMS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING PERIODS OF INCLEMENT WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL SPRING STORMS OR FALL HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN TEXAS WHERE MOST OF ITS POLICIES ARE UNDERWRITTEN. WHERE APPLICABLE, LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED BY REINSURANCE CONTRACTS IN PLACE AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S LOSS MITIGATION STRUCTURE.  AS DISCLOSED IN PART II, ITEM 1,  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  , THE COMPANY AND JOSEPH STEGMAYER, THE COMPANY'S FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S (\\\"SEC\\\") DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO TRADING IN STOCK OF ANOTHER PUBLIC COMPANY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS MATTER THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. THOSE COSTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES FOR MR. STEGMAYER PURSUANT TO HIS INDEMNITY AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE \\\"AUDIT COMMITTEE\\\") CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION LED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND OTHER ADVISERS IN RELATION TO THIS INQUIRY. THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMPANY'S AUDITORS, LISTING EXCHANGE AND THE SEC STAFF. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE INTERNAL RECORDS AND PERSONNEL AVAILABLE TO THE SEC STAFF AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE COOPERATING WITH THE SEC ON THIS MATTER.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS A RESULT OF THIS INQUIRY, THE COMPANY INCURRED  $0.9 MILLION  AND  $2.5 MILLION  IN LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR RELATED COSTS PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWED THE SUFFICIENCY OF ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND AS A RESULT, CAVCO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MADE A DECISION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL DIRECTOR AND OFFICER (\\\"D&O\\\") LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THESE NEW 22-MONTH POLICIES WERE IMPLEMENTED DECEMBER 21, 2018. TOTAL PREMIUMS PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FOR THESE POLICIES WERE $15.3 MILLION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $6.3 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL D&O POLICY PREMIUM EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND EXPECTS TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION PER QUARTER IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FROM THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE POLICY PREMIUMS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF MAINTAINING ADEQUATE D&O INSURANCE FOR THE COMPANY.  INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  ACCORDING TO DATA REPORTED BY THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INSTITUTE, INDUSTRY HOME SHIPMENTS DECREASED  2.9%  FOR THE FIRST  11  MONTHS OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SOME OF THIS DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION OF DISASTER-RELIEF HOMES FOR THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2018 THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN CALENDAR YEAR 2019. DURING CALENDAR YEAR  2018  , THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INDUSTRY SHIPPED APPROXIMATELY  97,000  HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES, AN INCREASE OF  4.3%  OVER THE APPROXIMATELY  93,000  UNITS SHIPPED IN  2017  . THROUGH 2018, ANNUAL SHIPMENTS HAVE INCREASED EACH YEAR SINCE CALENDAR YEAR 2009 WHEN 50,000 HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES WERE SHIPPED, THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE THE INDUSTRY BEGAN RECORDING STATISTICS IN 1959. WHILE SHIPMENTS OF HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES HAVE IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS, THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO HISTORICAL SHIPMENT STATISTICS.  \\\"FIRST-TIME\\\" AND \\\"MOVE-UP\\\" BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE HISTORICALLY AMONG THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PURCHASERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG THESE GROUPS AND OTHER POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS WHO FAVOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE STRONG. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS EVIDENT AMONG MANUFACTURED HOME BUYERS INTERESTED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS FOR SEASONAL OR RETIREMENT LIVING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND NOW APPEAR TO BE LESS HESITANT TO COMMIT TO A NEW HOME PURCHASE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES SALES GROWTH IS MOST ACHIEVABLE WHEN EMPLOYMENT AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE STRONG.  THE TWO LARGEST MANUFACTURED HOUSING CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS, YOUNG ADULTS AND THOSE WHO ARE AGE 55 AND OLDER, ARE BOTH GROWING. THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO EXPAND BY APPROXIMATELY  11.8 MILLION  BETWEEN  2020  AND  2025  . YOUNG ADULTS BORN FROM 1976 TO 1995, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS GEN Y, REPRESENT A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. LATE-STAGE GEN Y IS APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE LARGER THAN THE NEXT AGE CATEGORY BORN FROM 1966 TO 1975, GEN X, AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PEAK HOME-BUYING YEARS. GEN Y REPRESENTS PRIME FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS WHO MAY BE ATTRACTED BY THE AFFORDABILITY, SUSTAINABILITY, DIVERSITY AND LOCATION FLEXIBILITY OF FACTORY-BUILT HOMES. THE AGE 55 AND OLDER CATEGORY IS REPORTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION. THIS GROUP IS SIMILARLY INTERESTED IN THE VALUE PROPOSITION; HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALSO MOTIVATED BY THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND LOW MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS OF SYSTEMS-BUILT HOMES, AND BY THE LIFESTYLE OFFERED BY PLANNED COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT FALL INTO THIS AGE GROUP.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  NET REVENUE.

NET REVENUE FROM THE OPERATIONS OF DESTINY HOMES WAS  $11.2 MILLION  AND  $17.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD IS A VOLATILE METRIC DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS. A PRIMARY FACTOR IS THE PRICE DISPARITY BETWEEN SALES OF HOMES TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, BUILDERS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS (\\\"WHOLESALE\\\") AND SALES OF HOMES TO CONSUMERS BY COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL CENTERS (\\\"RETAIL\\\"). WHOLESALE SALES PRICES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE HOME AND THE COST TO SHIP THE HOME FROM A HOMEBUILDING FACILITY TO THE HOME-SITE. RETAIL HOME PRICES INCLUDE THESE ITEMS AND RETAIL MARKUP, AS WELL AS ITEMS THAT ARE LARGELY SUBJECT TO HOME BUYER DISCRETION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INSTALLATION, UTILITY CONNECTIONS, SITE IMPROVEMENTS, LANDSCAPING AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES. CHANGES TO THE PROPORTION OF HOME SALES AMONG THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS IMPACTS THE OVERALL NET REVENUE PER HOME SOLD. FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY SOLD  9,222  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  2,231  HOMES RETAIL VERSUS  8,891  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  1,979  HOMES RETAIL IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FURTHER, FLUCTUATIONS IN NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, WHICH RESULTS FROM HOME BUYER TASTES AND PREFERENCES AS THEY SELECT HOME TYPES/MODELS, AS WELL AS OPTIONAL HOME UPGRADES WHEN PURCHASING THE HOME. THESE SELECTIONS VARY REGULARLY BASED ON CONSUMER INTERESTS, LOCAL HOUSING PREFERENCES AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PRODUCT PRICES ARE ALSO PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED FOR THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDED IN, AND LABOR USED TO PRODUCE, EACH HOME. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED, AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, VOLATILITY IN OVERALL NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD.  FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , FROM GREATER UNREALIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS IN THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO, AN INCREASE IN HOME LOAN SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME ON COMMERCIAL LOANS OUTSTANDING AND MORE INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IS MAINLY FROM A BENEFIT OF  $1.7 MILLION  FOR THE RECOGNITION OF CERTAIN TAX CREDITS UNDER THE 2020 APPROPRIATIONS BILL THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON DECEMBER 20, 2019.  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS  $16.3 MILLION  AND  $11.9 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY, FOR AN EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF  20.5%  COMPARED TO AN EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF  19.7%  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  . THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN THE PRIOR YEAR RELATES TO GREATER TAX BENEFITS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS, AS THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2018  INCLUDED A BENEFIT OF  $2.3 MILLION  , COMPARED TO A BENEFIT OF  $1.3 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , TOGETHER WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE FOR GROWTH FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH IN U.S. TREASURY AND OTHER MONEY MARKET FUNDS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF, OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN, BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS OTHER EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH AND HAVE OTHER IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE RECENT ACQUISITION OF DESTINY HOMES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. BECAUSE OF THE COMPANY'S SUFFICIENT CASH POSITION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HISTORICALLY SOUGHT EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN CREDIT FACILITIES FOR ITS HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, IT MAY NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH FINANCING WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL. IF THIS FINANCING WERE NOT AVAILABLE, IT COULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO REEVALUATE ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF ITS EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE EXACT NATURE OF ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PLANS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS CONDITIONS IN THE FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING INDUSTRY AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.  STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF CAVCO OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY REMAINS SUFFICIENT AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO CAVCO WILL BE RESTRICTED PER STATE REGULATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY (IN THOUSANDS).

CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS  INCREASED  BY  $22.9 MILLION  TO  $121.6 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 28, 2019  FROM  $98.7 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  . PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF CONSUMER LOANS PROVIDED  $117.1 MILLION  IN CASH, COMPARED TO  $96.7 MILLION  IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER LENDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOUSING, STATES MAY CLASSIFY MANUFACTURED HOMES FOR BOTH LEGAL AND TAX PURPOSES AS PERSONAL PROPERTY RATHER THAN REAL ESTATE. AS A RESULT, FINANCING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IS CHARACTERIZED BY SHORTER LOAN MATURITIES AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE ITEM IA, \\\"RISK FACTORS\\\" IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K.  CAVCO HAS ENTERED INTO COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF ITS PRODUCTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR WHOLESALE PURCHASES.

OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF HIGHER INVESTMENTS IN OUR NIKE DIRECT OPERATIONS AND HIGHER WAGE-RELATED EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RETAIL BRAND PRESENTATION AND SPORTS MARKETING COSTS.

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  GLOBAL BRAND DIVISIONS' LOSS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES INCREASED  6%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  FISCAL 2020  AS TOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE INCREASED. OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER WAGE-RELATED COSTS RESULTING FROM INVESTMENTS IN DATA AND ANALYTICS CAPABILITIES, DIGITAL COMMERCE PLATFORMS AND OUR INVESTMENTS IN A NEW ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING TOOL, ALL OF WHICH ARE IN AN EFFORT TO ACCELERATE OUR END-TO-END DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION. LOWER DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVERTISING AND MARKETING COSTS.

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  ON A CURRENCY-NEUTRAL BASIS, CONVERSE REVENUES INCREASED  15%  FOR THE  SECOND QUARTER  OF  FISCAL 2020  . THE INCREASE IN REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES IN ASIA AND EUROPE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE UNITED STATES. WHOLESALE REVENUES GREW  14%  PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND IN ASIA. DIRECT TO CONSUMER REVENUES INCREASED  20%  FUELED BY DIGITAL SALES GROWTH.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES  OVERVIEW  AS A GLOBAL COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WE ARE EXPOSED TO RISK ARISING FROM CHANGES IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. OUR PRIMARY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARISE FROM THE RECORDING OF TRANSACTIONS DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES AND THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS INTO U.S. DOLLARS.  OUR FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO LESSEN BOTH THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE GLOBAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK CENTRALLY ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS TO ADDRESS THOSE RISKS MATERIAL TO NIKE, INC. OUR HEDGING POLICY IS DESIGNED TO PARTIALLY OR ENTIRELY OFFSET THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ON THE UNDERLYING NET EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. WHERE EXPOSURES ARE HEDGED, OUR PROGRAM HAS THE EFFECT OF DELAYING THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS ON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; THE LENGTH OF THE DELAY IS DEPENDENT UPON HEDGE HORIZONS. WE DO NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING OR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES. AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S HEDGING PROGRAM OR STRATEGY FROM WHAT WAS DISCLOSED WITHIN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.  REFER TO  NOTE 4 \\u2014 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  AND  NOTE 9 \\u2014 RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION OF OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVES AT EACH REPORTED PERIOD END. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  39  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  WE CONDUCT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS CURRENCIES AND HAVE TRANSACTIONS WHICH SUBJECT US TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONAL FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES ARE.  \\u2022  PRODUCT COSTS \\u2014 PRODUCT PURCHASES DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF THE TRANSACTING ENTITY AND FACTORY INPUT COSTS FROM THE FOREIGN CURRENCY ADJUSTMENTS PROGRAM WITH CERTAIN FACTORIES.  \\u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES \\u2014 A PORTION OF OUR NIKE BRAND AND CONVERSE REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH EUROPEAN OPERATIONS ARE EARNED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE EURO (E.G., THE BRITISH POUND) BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AT A SUBSIDIARY THAT USES THE EURO AS ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. THESE SALES GENERATE A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE.  \\u2022  OTHER COSTS \\u2014 NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED COSTS, SUCH AS ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS, ALSO GENERATE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK, THOUGH TO A LESSER EXTENT.  \\u2022  NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES \\u2014 OUR GLOBAL SUBSIDIARIES HAVE VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, PRIMARILY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES, DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THESE BALANCE SHEET ITEMS ARE SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT WHICH MAY CREATE FLUCTUATIONS IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  WITHIN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES  TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WITHIN OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF NATURAL OFFSETS AND CURRENCY CORRELATIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE PORTFOLIO AND MAY ALSO ELECT TO USE CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE REMAINING EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON PROBABLE FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, INCLUDING CERTAIN PRODUCT COST EXPOSURES, NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED EXTERNAL SALES AND OTHER COSTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  CERTAIN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS USED TO MANAGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURE OF NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY DENOMINATED MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES SUBJECT TO RE-MEASUREMENT AND EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE NOT FORMALLY DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET.  TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  MANY OF OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OPERATE IN FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. FLUCTUATIONS IN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CREATE VOLATILITY IN OUR REPORTED RESULTS AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO TRANSLATE THE BALANCE SHEETS, OPERATIONAL RESULTS AND CASH FLOWS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES' NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BALANCE SHEETS INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING RESULTS IN A CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT TO  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  WITHIN  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  . THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED  REVENUES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $233 MILLION AND $546 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $347 MILLION AND $318 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSLATION OF OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  WAS A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION AND $152 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND A DETRIMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $73 MILLION AND $43 MILLION FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY.  MANAGEMENT GENERALLY IDENTIFIES HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKETS AS THOSE MARKETS WHOSE CUMULATIVE INFLATION RATE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD EXCEEDS 100%. MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY WITHIN OUR APLA OPERATING SEGMENT IS OPERATING IN A HYPER-INFLATIONARY MARKET. AS A RESULT, BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF  FISCAL 2019  , THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF OUR ARGENTINA SUBSIDIARY CHANGED FROM THE LOCAL CURRENCY TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS OF AND FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN FUTURE PERIODS BASED ON CURRENT RATES.  MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES  TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED REVENUES AND EXPENSES INTO U.S. DOLLARS FOR CONSOLIDATED REPORTING, CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES USE EXCESS CASH TO PURCHASE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS. THE VARIABLE FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED INVESTMENTS AT NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES CREATES A FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE THAT QUALIFIES FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER U.S. GAAP. WE UTILIZE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND/OR OPTIONS TO MITIGATE THE VARIABILITY OF THE FORECASTED FUTURE PURCHASES AND SALES OF THESE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENTS. THE COMBINATION OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT HAS THE EFFECT OF PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT ON NET EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE INVESTMENTS ARE SOLD. HEDGES OF THE PURCHASE OF U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.  WE ESTIMATE THE COMBINATION OF TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PROFITS FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESSES AND THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN  OTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET  HAD AN UNFAVORABLE  40  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT OF APPROXIMATELY $77 MILLION AND $92 MILLION ON OUR  INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES  FOR THE  THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  CASH FLOW ACTIVITY  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  WAS AN INFLOW OF  $1,306 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $2,825 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  NET INCOME  , ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, GENERATED  $2,906 MILLION  OF OPERATING CASH INFLOW FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $2,652 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  OF  $1,600 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF  $173 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  . THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS PARTIALLY IMPACTED BY THE NET CHANGE IN CASH COLLATERAL WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AS A RESULT OF HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2020  , CASH COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM COUNTERPARTIES DECREASED $167 MILLION AS COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF $236 MILLION DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF  FISCAL 2019  . REFER TO THE CREDIT RISK SECTION OF NOTE 9 \\u2014 RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY INCREASES IN  INVENTORY  AND  ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET  DUE TO BUSINESS GROWTH, WHICH DECREASED  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY OPERATIONS  BY  $345 MILLION  AND  $244 MILLION  , RESPECTIVELY. THE NET CHANGE IN WORKING CAPITAL WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY HIGHER PAYMENTS RELATED TO VARIABLE COMPENSATION FOR EMPLOYEES.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES  WAS AN OUTFLOW OF  $788 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , COMPARED TO  $245 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  , DRIVEN BY THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS (INCLUDING SALES, MATURITIES AND PURCHASES) RESULTED IN A CASH OUTFLOW OF  $157 MILLION  COMPARED TO AN INFLOW OF  $381 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019.  CASH PROVIDED (USED) BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  WAS AN OUTFLOW OF  $1,868 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  COMPARED TO  $3,290 MILLION  FOR THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2019  , WITH THE DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR PERIOD REFLECTING LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES AND AN INCREASE IN  NOTES PAYABLE  , PRIMARILY DUE TO BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  DURING THE  FIRST SIX MONTHS  OF  FISCAL 2020  , WE REPURCHASED  22.0 MILLION  SHARES OF NIKE'S CLASS B COMMON STOCK FOR  $1,917 MILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $87.13  PER SHARE) UNDER THE FOUR-YEAR,  $15 BILLION  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN JUNE 2018. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD REPURCHASED  33.6 MILLION  SHARES AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY  $2.9 BILLION  (AN AVERAGE PRICE OF  $86.30  PER SHARE) UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT FUNDING OF SHARE REPURCHASES WILL COME FROM OPERATING CASH FLOWS, EXCESS CASH AND/OR PROCEEDS FROM DEBT.  CAPITAL RESOURCES  ON JULY 23, 2019, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT (THE \\u201cSHELF\\u201d) WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) WHICH PERMITS US TO ISSUE AN UNLIMITED AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURITIES FROM TIME TO TIME. THE SHELF EXPIRES ON JULY 23, 2022.  ON AUGUST 16, 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH A SYNDICATE OF BANKS WHICH PROVIDES FOR UP TO $2 BILLION OF BORROWINGS, WITH THE OPTION TO INCREASE BORROWINGS UP TO $3 BILLION IN TOTAL UPON LENDER APPROVAL. THE FACILITY MATURES ON AUGUST 16, 2024, WITH A ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OPTION PRIOR TO ANY ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE, PROVIDED THAT IN NO EVENT SHALL IT EXTEND BEYOND AUGUST 16, 2026. THIS FACILITY REPLACES THE PRIOR $2 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON AUGUST 28, 2015, WHICH WOULD HAVE MATURED AUGUST 28, 2020. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  AND MAY 31, 2019, NO AMOUNTS WERE OUTSTANDING UNDER EITHER COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY.  WE CURRENTLY HAVE LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF AA- AND A1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY. IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO DECLINE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE UNDER OUR COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY WOULD INCREASE. CONVERSELY, IF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WERE TO IMPROVE, THE FACILITY FEE AND INTEREST RATE WOULD DECREASE. CHANGES IN OUR LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS WOULD NOT TRIGGER ACCELERATION OF MATURITY OF ANY THEN-OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS OR ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITY. UNDER THIS FACILITY, WE HAVE AGREED TO VARIOUS COVENANTS. THESE COVENANTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON OUR DISPOSAL OF FIXED ASSETS AND THE AMOUNT OF DEBT SECURED BY LIENS WE MAY INCUR. IN THE EVENT WE WERE TO HAVE ANY BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS FACILITY AND FAILED TO MEET ANY COVENANT, AND WERE UNABLE TO OBTAIN A WAIVER FROM A MAJORITY OF THE BANKS IN THE SYNDICATE, ANY BORROWINGS WOULD BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE WERE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH EACH OF THESE COVENANTS AND BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY WE WILL FAIL TO MEET ANY OF THESE COVENANTS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  LIQUIDITY IS ALSO PROVIDED BY OUR $2 BILLION COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT ANY POINT WAS $841 MILLION. AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD $300 MILLION IN BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE RATE OF 1.63%. NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF MAY 31,  41  TABLE OF CONTENTS  2019. WE MAY CONTINUE TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT SECURITIES DEPENDING ON GENERAL CORPORATE NEEDS. WE CURRENTLY HAVE SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS OF A1+ AND P1 FROM STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES, RESPECTIVELY.  TO DATE, IN  FISCAL 2020  , WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED DIFFICULTY ACCESSING THE CREDIT MARKETS OR INCURRED HIGHER INTEREST COSTS; HOWEVER, FUTURE VOLATILITY IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS MAY INCREASE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS OR AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE MARKETS.  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE HAD CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALING  $3.5 BILLION  , PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF DEPOSITS HELD AT MAJOR BANKS, MONEY MARKET FUNDS, COMMERCIAL PAPER, CORPORATE NOTES, U.S. TREASURY OBLIGATIONS, U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED ENTERPRISE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO BOTH CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE RISK. ALL OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTMENT GRADE TO MINIMIZE OUR CREDIT RISK. WHILE INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES HAVE VARYING DURATIONS, AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DAYS TO MATURITY OF OUR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO WAS 32 DAYS.  WE BELIEVE THAT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SOURCES OF FUNDS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDS IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS OF  NOVEMBER 30, 2019  , WE DID NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS REPORTED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2019.  NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO  NOTE 1 \\u2014 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  IN THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ARE BASED UPON OUR UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES US TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES AND EXPENSES AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2019, AND OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q).  OVERVIEW  MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY WHOSE MISSION IS TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION ON THE PLANET TO ACHIEVE MORE. WE STRIVE TO CREATE LOCAL OPPORTUNITY, GROWTH, AND IMPACT IN EVERY COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD. OUR PLATFORMS AND TOOLS HELP DRIVE SMALL BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY, LARGE BUSINESS COMPETITIVENESS, AND PUBLIC-SECTOR EFFICIENCY. THEY ALSO SUPPORT NEW STARTUPS, IMPROVE EDUCATIONAL AND HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND EMPOWER HUMAN INGENUITY.  WE GENERATE REVENUE BY OFFERING A WIDE RANGE OF CLOUD-BASED AND OTHER SERVICES TO PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES; LICENSING AND SUPPORTING AN ARRAY OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS; DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND SELLING DEVICES; AND DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES; DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; DATACENTER COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES; AND INCOME TAXES.  HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 COMPARED WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 INCLUDED.  \\u2022  COMMERCIAL CLOUD REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES MICROSOFT OFFICE 365 COMMERCIAL, MICROSOFT AZURE, THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF LINKEDIN, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS 365, AND OTHER COMMERCIAL CLOUD PROPERTIES, INCREASED 39% TO $12.5 BILLION.  \\u2022  OFFICE COMMERCIAL REVENUE INCREASED 16%, DRIVEN BY OFFICE 365 COMMERCIAL GROWTH OF 27%.  \\u2022  OFFICE CONSUMER REVENUE INCREASED 19%, AND OFFICE 365 CONSUMER SUBSCRIBERS INCREASED TO 37.2 MILLION.  \\u2022  LINKEDIN REVENUE INCREASED 24%.  \\u2022  DYNAMICS REVENUE INCREASED 12%, DRIVEN BY DYNAMICS 365 GROWTH OF 42%.  \\u2022  SERVER PRODUCTS AND CLOUD SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 30%, DRIVEN BY AZURE GROWTH OF 62%.  \\u2022  ENTERPRISE SERVICES REVENUE INCREASED 6%.  \\u2022  WINDOWS ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER LICENSING (\\u201cWINDOWS OEM\\u201d) REVENUE INCREASED 18%.  \\u2022  WINDOWS COMMERCIAL REVENUE INCREASED 25%.  \\u2022  SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE, EXCLUDING TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS, INCREASED 6%.  \\u2022  MICROSOFT SURFACE REVENUE INCREASED 6%.  \\u2022  XBOX CONTENT AND SERVICES REVENUE DECREASED 11%.  31  PART I  ITEM 2  INDUSTRY TRENDS  OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS AND USERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.  ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS  THE MARKETS FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARE DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE AND DEVICES, WHILE ALSO DEPLOYING COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD, AND IN SOME CASES, THE USER\\u2019S CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT OVER AN EXTENDED TIME IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVICES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAY DECREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.  OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT WORLDWIDE. WE COMPETE FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY BY OFFERING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT, BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, THE ABILITY TO GROW ONE\\u2019S CAREER ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC.  OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND EXPENSES. MANY OF THESE REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REVENUE AND EXPENSES. STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES REDUCED REPORTED REVENUE AND EXPENSES FROM OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  REFER TO RISK FACTORS (PART II, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-Q) FOR A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS.  SEASONALITY  OUR REVENUE FLUCTUATES QUARTERLY AND IS GENERALLY HIGHER IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. SECOND QUARTER REVENUE IS DRIVEN BY CORPORATE YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON SPENDING BY CONSUMERS, AND FOURTH QUARTER REVENUE IS DRIVEN BY THE VOLUME OF MULTI-YEAR ON-PREMISES CONTRACTS EXECUTED DURING THE PERIOD.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS  WE REPORT OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS: PRODUCTIVITY AND BUSINESS PROCESSES, INTELLIGENT CLOUD, AND MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING. THE SEGMENT AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN MD&A ARE PRESENTED ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING. ALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING BASIS AND ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d), ALONG WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL AND OTHER ACTIVITY, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER.

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS INCOME DECREASED DUE TO LOWER YIELDS ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED DUE TO CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND A DECREASE IN OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO DEBT MATURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER FINANCE LEASE EXPENSE. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS.  38  PART I  ITEM 2  SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED WITH SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018  INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS INCOME INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO BALANCES ON FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. INTEREST EXPENSE  DECREASED  DUE TO CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND A DECREASE IN OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT DUE TO DEBT MATURITIES  , OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER FINANCE LEASE EXPENSE  . NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS DECREASED DUE TO LOWER GAINS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER  GAINS ON  FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES.  INCOME TAXES  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 17% AND 19% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY, AND 17% AND 16% FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL NET CHARGE RELATED TO THE TCJA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019. THE INCREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN THE MIX OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES, OFFSET IN PART BY THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE PROVISIONAL NET CHARGE RELATED TO THE TCJA.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND AND PUERTO RICO, AND TAX BENEFITS RELATING TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.  UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS  WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (\\u201cIRS\\u201d) AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 IN FISCAL YEAR 2011. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE IRS WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT RELATED TO UNRESOLVED ISSUES FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. WE ALSO SETTLED A PORTION OF THE IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2009 IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, AND A PORTION OF THE IRS AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2010 TO 2013 IN FISCAL YEAR 2018. WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2013. WE EXPECT THE IRS TO BEGIN AN EXAMINATION OF TAX YEARS 2014 TO 2017 WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUES FOR THE IRS AUDITS RELATE TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WHEN THE MATTERS ARE RESOLVED. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2019, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTION OF EACH OF THESE AUDITS IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  NON-GAAP NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ARE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES WHICH EXCLUDE A NET CHARGE RELATED TO THE TCJA. WE BELIEVE THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES AID INVESTORS BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INSIGHT INTO OUR OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND HELP CLARIFY TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS. FOR COMPARABILITY OF REPORTING, MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS NON-GAAP MEASURES IN CONJUNCTION WITH GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS IN EVALUATING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES PRESENTED SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR, OR SUPERIOR TO, THE MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  39  PART I  ITEM 2  THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL RESULTS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS  CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $134.3 BILLION AND $133.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2019. EQUITY INVESTMENTS WERE $2.8 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND JUNE 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY INTENDED TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.  VALUATION  IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, AND MUTUAL FUNDS. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, AND MUNICIPAL SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY-DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.  A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.  40  PART I  ITEM 2  CASH FLOWS  CASH FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $1.9 BILLION TO $24.5 BILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH FROM CUSTOMERS, OFFSET IN PART BY AN INCREASE IN CASH USED TO PAY SUPPLIERS, INCOME TAXES, AND EMPLOYEES. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED $1.5 BILLION TO $19.1 BILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, MAINLY DUE TO OTHER FINANCING TO FACILITATE THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $659 MILLION TO $7.8 BILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, MAINLY DUE TO A $2.3 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $1.3 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS.  DEBT  WE ISSUE DEBT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE OR WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUNDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, ACQUISITIONS, AND REPAYMENT OF EXISTING DEBT. OUR LAST DEBT ISSUANCE OCCURRED IN FISCAL YEAR 2017. REFER TO NOTE 9 \\u2013 DEBT OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  UNEARNED REVENUE  UNEARNED REVENUE COMPRISES MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE RELATED TO VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE SOFTWARE ASSURANCE (\\u201cSA\\u201d) AND CLOUD SERVICES. UNEARNED REVENUE IS GENERALLY INVOICED ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CONTRACT PERIOD FOR MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES PAYMENTS FOR OTHER OFFERINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PAID IN ADVANCE AND EARN THE REVENUE WHEN WE TRANSFER CONTROL OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE OUTLINES THE EXPECTED FUTURE RECOGNITION OF UNEARNED REVENUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019.  (IN MILLIONS)  THREE MONTHS ENDING  MARCH 31, 2020  $12,879  JUNE 30, 2020  8,287  SEPTEMBER 30, 2020  3,871  DECEMBER 31, 2020  2,306  THEREAFTER  3,878  TOTAL  $31,221  IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN LICENSING TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD OR UPON CONSUMPTION, AS APPLICABLE.  SHARE REPURCHASES  FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, WE REPURCHASED 61 MILLION SHARES AND 81 MILLION SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR $8.6 BILLION AND $8.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THROUGH OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. ALL REPURCHASES WERE MADE USING CASH RESOURCES. REFER TO NOTE 14 \\u2013 STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  DIVIDENDS  REFER TO NOTE 14 \\u2013 STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 EQUITY OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  41  PART I  ITEM 2  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE AGREED TO COVER DAMAGES RESULTING FROM BREACHES OF CERTAIN SECURITY AND PRIVACY COMMITMENTS IN OUR CLOUD BUSINESS. IN EVALUATING ESTIMATED LOSSES ON THESE OBLIGATIONS, WE CONSIDER FACTORS SUCH AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND OUR ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. THESE OBLIGATIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL  WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS THAT ALIGN WITH OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATACENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMING YEARS TO SUPPORT GROWTH IN OUR CLOUD OFFERINGS. WE HAVE OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASES FOR DATACENTERS, CORPORATE OFFICES, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES, RETAIL STORES, AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES.  LIQUIDITY  AS A RESULT OF THE TCJA, WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY A ONE-TIME TRANSITION TAX ON DEFERRED FOREIGN INCOME NOT PREVIOUSLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAX. UNDER THE TCJA, THE TRANSITION TAX IS PAYABLE IN INTEREST-FREE INSTALLMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS, WITH 8% DUE IN EACH OF THE FIRST FIVE YEARS, 15% IN YEAR SIX, 20% IN YEAR SEVEN, AND 25% IN YEAR EIGHT. WE HAVE PAID TRANSITION TAX OF $3.2 BILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $1.2 BILLION DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019. THE REMAINING TRANSITION TAX OF $15.2 BILLION IS PAYABLE OVER THE NEXT SIX YEARS WITH A FINAL PAYMENT IN FISCAL YEAR 2026. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE ALSO PAID $3.7 BILLION RELATED TO THE TRANSFER OF INTANGIBLE PROPERTIES THAT OCCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  WE EXPECT EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS, AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, DEBT MATURITIES, MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND THE TRANSITION TAX RELATED TO THE TCJA, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  REFER TO NOTE 1 \\u2013 ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-Q) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT\\u2019S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.  42  PART I  ITEM 2  REVENUE RECOGNITION  OUR CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS OFTEN INCLUDE PROMISES TO TRANSFER MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO A CUSTOMER. DETERMINING WHETHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE CONSIDERED DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY VERSUS TOGETHER MAY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. WHEN A CLOUD-BASED SERVICE INCLUDES BOTH ON-PREMISES SOFTWARE LICENSES AND CLOUD SERVICES, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE SOFTWARE LICENSE IS CONSIDERED DISTINCT AND ACCOUNTED FOR SEPARATELY, OR NOT DISTINCT AND ACCOUNTED FOR TOGETHER WITH THE CLOUD SERVICE AND RECOGNIZED OVER TIME. CERTAIN CLOUD SERVICES, PRIMARILY OFFICE 365, DEPEND ON A SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF INTEGRATION, INTERDEPENDENCY, AND INTERRELATION BETWEEN THE DESKTOP APPLICATIONS AND CLOUD SERVICES, AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR TOGETHER AS ONE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. REVENUE FROM OFFICE 365 IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE CLOUD SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.  JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE STAND-ALONE SELLING PRICE (\\u201cSSP\\\") FOR EACH DISTINCT PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. WE USE A SINGLE AMOUNT TO ESTIMATE SSP FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT SOLD SEPARATELY, INCLUDING ON-PREMISES LICENSES SOLD WITH SA OR SOFTWARE UPDATES PROVIDED AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. WE USE A RANGE OF AMOUNTS TO ESTIMATE SSP WHEN WE SELL EACH OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SEPARATELY AND NEED TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE IS A DISCOUNT TO BE ALLOCATED BASED ON THE RELATIVE SSP OF THE VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.  IN INSTANCES WHERE SSP IS NOT DIRECTLY OBSERVABLE, SUCH AS WHEN WE DO NOT SELL THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE SEPARATELY, WE DETERMINE THE SSP USING INFORMATION THAT MAY INCLUDE MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS. WE TYPICALLY HAVE MORE THAN ONE SSP FOR INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DUE TO THE STRATIFICATION OF THOSE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY CUSTOMERS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. IN THESE INSTANCES, WE MAY USE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE SIZE OF THE CUSTOMER AND GEOGRAPHIC REGION IN DETERMINING THE SSP.  DUE TO THE VARIOUS BENEFITS FROM AND THE NATURE OF OUR SA PROGRAM, JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS THE PATTERN OF DELIVERY, INCLUDING THE EXERCISE PATTERN OF CERTAIN BENEFITS ACROSS OUR PORTFOLIO OF CUSTOMERS.  OUR PRODUCTS ARE GENERALLY SOLD WITH A RIGHT OF RETURN, WE MAY PROVIDE OTHER CREDITS OR INCENTIVES, AND IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WE ESTIMATE CUSTOMER USAGE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS VARIABLE CONSIDERATION WHEN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE TO RECOGNIZE. RETURNS AND CREDITS ARE ESTIMATED AT CONTRACT INCEPTION AND UPDATED AT THE END OF EACH REPORTING PERIOD IF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. CHANGES TO OUR ESTIMATED VARIABLE CONSIDERATION WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR THE PERIODS PRESENTED.  IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES  WE REVIEW DEBT INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, AND THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST. WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. IN ADDITION, WE CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.  EQUITY INVESTMENTS WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE IF A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT INDICATES THAT THE INVESTMENT IS IMPAIRED AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE. WE PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. WE ARE REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS. ONCE AN INVESTMENT IS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  43  PART I  ITEM 2  GOODWILL  WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.  APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.  THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS  COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO PRODUCTION. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.  LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES  THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  INCOME TAXES  THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITY\\u2019S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  44  PART I  ITEM 2  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. NET REALIZABLE VALUE IS THE ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE LESS ESTIMATED COSTS OF COMPLETION, DISPOSAL, AND TRANSPORTATION.

THE  INCREASE  IN OPERATING CASH PROVIDED IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS AND NET FAVORABLE CHANGE IN THE COMPONENTS OF WORKING CAPITAL WITHIN OPERATING ACTIVITIES, AS COMPARED TO THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018.  NET CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES CHANGED DUE TO THE TIMING OF PROCEEDS AND PURCHASES OF CORPORATE AND CLIENT FUNDS MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF  $257.3 MILLION  , LOWER PAYMENTS MADE RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS MADE RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS OF INTANGIBLES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019.  NET CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES CHANGED DUE TO A  NET INCREASE  IN CLIENT FUND OBLIGATIONS OF  $8,660.8 MILLION  , WHICH IS DUE TO THE TIMING OF IMPOUNDS FROM OUR CLIENTS AND PAYMENTS TO OUR CLIENTS' EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PAYEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MORE CASH RETURNED TO SHAREHOLDERS VIA DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, A REPAYMENT OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND A DECREASE OF NET PROCEEDS COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY REPURCHASE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS AUTHORIZED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHEN TO EXECUTE SHARE REPURCHASES, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, CASH BALANCES AND CASH FLOWS, ISSUANCES DUE TO EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ACTIVITY, AND MARKET CONDITIONS.  CAPITAL RESOURCES AND CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS  WE HAVE  $2.0 BILLION  OF SENIOR UNSECURED NOTES WITH MATURITY DATES IN 2020 AND 2025.  WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME REVISIT THE LONG-TERM DEBT MARKET TO REFINANCE EXISTING DEBT, FINANCE INVESTMENTS INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS FOR OUR GROWTH, AND MAINTAIN THE APPROPRIATE CAPITAL STRUCTURE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT VOLATILITY IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL AND CREDIT MARKETS WOULD NOT IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS THESE MARKETS ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US, OR AT ALL. SEE  NOTE 10  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR LONG-TERM FINANCING.  OUR U.S. SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS ARE SOMETIMES OBTAINED ON AN UNSECURED BASIS THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, RATHER THAN LIQUIDATING PREVIOUSLY-COLLECTED CLIENT FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO  $10.3 BILLION  IN AGGREGATE MATURITY VALUE. OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM IS RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD & POOR\\u2019S AND PRIME-1 (\\u201cP-1\\u201d) BY MOODY\\u2019S. THESE RATINGS DENOTE THE HIGHEST QUALITY COMMERCIAL PAPER SECURITIES.  MATURITIES OF COMMERCIAL PAPER CAN RANGE FROM OVERNIGHT TO UP TO 364 DAYS. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019  AND  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD  NO  COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWING OUTSTANDING.

THESE AGREEMENTS GENERALLY HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM OVERNIGHT TO UP TO FIVE BUSINESS DAYS. WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY BORROWED THROUGH THE USE OF REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS TO MEET SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS. AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019  THERE WERE  NO  OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. AT  JUNE 30, 2019  , THE COMPANY HAD  $262.0 MILLION  OF OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, WHICH WERE FULLY PAID IN EARLY JULY 2019.

WE HAVE A  $3.8 BILLION  ,  364  -DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT THAT MATURES IN  JUNE 2020  WITH A ONE YEAR TERM-OUT OPTION. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE A FIVE-YEAR  $2.75 BILLION  CREDIT FACILITY AND A FIVE-YEAR  $3.75 BILLION  CREDIT FACILITY MATURING IN  JUNE 2024  AND  JUNE 2023  , RESPECTIVELY, EACH WITH AN ACCORDION FEATURE UNDER WHICH THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENT CAN BE INCREASED BY  $500 MILLION  , SUBJECT TO THE AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS. THE PRIMARY USES OF THE CREDIT FACILITIES ARE TO PROVIDE LIQUIDITY TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND FUNDING FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, IF NECESSARY. WE HAD  NO  BORROWINGS THROUGH  DECEMBER 31, 2019  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CURRENTLY MEET ALL CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS TO BORROW THEREUNDER AND WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONDITIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM BORROWING PART OR ALL OF THE  $10.3 BILLION  AVAILABLE TO US UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT AGREEMENTS. SEE  NOTE 9  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR SHORT-TERM FINANCING INCLUDING CREDIT FACILITIES.  OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WITH UNDERLYING COLLATERAL OF SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES, ALTERNATIVE-A MORTGAGES, SUB-PRIME AUTO LOANS OR SUB-PRIME HOME EQUITY LOANS, COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, COLLATERALIZED LOAN OBLIGATIONS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS, DERIVATIVES, AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, STRUCTURED INVESTMENT VEHICLES OR NON-INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. WE OWN AAA-RATED SENIOR TRANCHES OF FIXED RATE AUTO LOAN, CREDIT CARD, EQUIPMENT LEASE AND RATE REDUCTION RECEIVABLES, SECURED PREDOMINANTLY BY PRIME COLLATERAL. ALL COLLATERAL ON ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IS PERFORMING AS EXPECTED. IN ADDITION, WE OWN SENIOR DEBT DIRECTLY ISSUED BY FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANKS AND FEDERAL FARM CREDIT BANKS.  OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS STRUCTURED TO ALLOW US TO AVERAGE OUR WAY THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE CYCLE BY LADDERING THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENTS OUT TO FIVE YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE EXTENDED PORTFOLIO) AND OUT TO TEN YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE LONG PORTFOLIO). THIS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS SUPPORTED BY OUR SHORT-TERM FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS NECESSARY TO SATISFY SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS. SEE  NOTE 6  OF OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENTS AND FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  WERE $94.1 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO $77.0 MILLION  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  . CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL  2020  ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $175 MILLION  , AS COMPARED TO $163 MILLION  IN FISCAL  2019.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS COMPRISED OF CORPORATE INVESTMENTS (CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES) AND CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS (FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN COLLECTED FROM CLIENTS BUT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REMITTED TO THE APPLICABLE TAX AUTHORITIES OR CLIENT EMPLOYEES).  41  OUR CORPORATE INVESTMENTS ARE INVESTED IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND HIGHLY LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THESE ASSETS ARE AVAILABLE FOR OUR REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND/OR ACQUISITIONS, AS WELL AS OTHER CORPORATE OPERATING PURPOSES. ALL OF OUR SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.  OUR CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS ARE INVESTED WITH SAFETY OF PRINCIPAL, LIQUIDITY, AND DIVERSIFICATION AS THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES. CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OBJECTIVES, WE ALSO SEEK TO MAXIMIZE INTEREST INCOME AND TO MINIMIZE THE VOLATILITY OF INTEREST INCOME.  CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN HIGHLY LIQUID, INVESTMENT-GRADE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, WITH A MAXIMUM MATURITY OF 10 YEARS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, AND MONEY MARKET SECURITIES AND OTHER CASH EQUIVALENTS.  WE UTILIZE A STRATEGY BY WHICH WE EXTEND THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO FOR FUNDS HELD FOR CLIENTS AND EMPLOY SHORT-TERM FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY OUR SHORT-TERM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS. OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY IS STRUCTURED TO ALLOW US TO AVERAGE OUR WAY THROUGH AN INTEREST RATE CYCLE BY LADDERING THE MATURITIES OF OUR INVESTMENTS OUT TO FIVE YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE EXTENDED PORTFOLIO) AND OUT TO TEN YEARS (IN THE CASE OF THE LONG PORTFOLIO). AS PART OF OUR CLIENT FUNDS INVESTMENT STRATEGY, WE USE THE DAILY COLLECTION OF FUNDS FROM OUR CLIENTS TO SATISFY OTHER UNRELATED CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS, RATHER THAN LIQUIDATING PREVIOUSLY-COLLECTED CLIENT FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN INVESTED IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. WE MINIMIZE THE RISK OF NOT HAVING FUNDS COLLECTED FROM A CLIENT AVAILABLE AT THE TIME SUCH CLIENT\\u2019S OBLIGATION BECOMES DUE BY IMPOUNDING, IN VIRTUALLY ALL INSTANCES, THE CLIENT\\u2019S FUNDS IN ADVANCE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENT OF SUCH CLIENT\\u2019S OBLIGATION. AS A RESULT OF THIS PRACTICE, WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINED THE REQUIRED LEVEL OF CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR OBLIGATIONS.  THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVING OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY RELATING TO OUR CLIENT FUNDS ASSETS.  SUCH RISKS INCLUDE LIQUIDITY RISK, INCLUDING THE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH OUR ABILITY TO LIQUIDATE, IF NECESSARY, OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IN A TIMELY MANNER IN ORDER TO SATISFY OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS. HOWEVER, OUR INVESTMENTS ARE MADE WITH THE SAFETY OF PRINCIPAL, LIQUIDITY, AND DIVERSIFICATION AS THE PRIMARY GOALS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO SATISFY ALL OF OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS.  WE ALSO BELIEVE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE RISK OF NOT HAVING SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO SATISFY OUR CLIENT FUNDS OBLIGATIONS BY CONSISTENTLY MAINTAINING ACCESS TO OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING OUR CORPORATE CASH BALANCES, AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  $10.3 BILLION  COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM (RATED A-1+ BY STANDARD AND POOR\\u2019S AND P-1 BY MOODY\\u2019S, THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE CREDIT RATINGS), AND OUR ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENT TRANSACTIONS AND AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER OUR  $10.3 BILLION  COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES. THE REDUCED AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING DURING PERIODS OF ECONOMIC TURMOIL, EVEN TO BORROWERS WITH THE HIGHEST CREDIT RATINGS, MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS SHORT-TERM DEBT MARKETS TO MEET THE LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION TO LIQUIDITY RISK, OUR INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.  WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CREDIT QUALITY, MATURITY, AND EXPOSURE LIMITS FOR OUR INVESTMENTS. THE MINIMUM ALLOWED CREDIT RATING AT TIME OF PURCHASE FOR CORPORATE, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT AGENCY AND CANADIAN PROVINCIAL BONDS IS BBB, FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES IS AAA, AND FOR MUNICIPAL BONDS IS A. THE MAXIMUM MATURITY AT TIME OF PURCHASE FOR BBB-RATED SECURITIES IS 5 YEARS, FOR SINGLE A RATED SECURITIES IS 7 YEARS, AND FOR AA-RATED AND AAA-RATED SECURITIES IS 10 YEARS. TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER MUST BE RATED A-1 AND/OR P-1. MONEY MARKET FUNDS MUST BE RATED AAA/AAA-MF.  42  DETAILS REGARDING OUR OVERALL INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ARE AS FOLLOWS.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE EARNINGS IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, THE AMOUNT OF INVESTED FUNDS AND THE OVERALL PORTFOLIO MIX BETWEEN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS MIX VARIES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR AND IS IMPACTED BY DAILY INTEREST RATE CHANGES. THE ANNUALIZED INTEREST RATES EARNED ON OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO  INCREASE  D FROM  2.1%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2018  TO  2.2%  FOR THE  SIX MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN BOTH SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES (E.G., OVERNIGHT INTEREST RATES OR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE) AND INTERMEDIATE-TERM INTEREST RATES OF 25 BASIS POINTS APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE INVESTMENT BALANCES AND ANY RELATED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY A $15 MILLION IMPACT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OVER THE ENSUING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2020  . A HYPOTHETICAL CHANGE IN ONLY SHORT-TERM INTEREST RATES OF 25 BASIS POINTS APPLIED TO THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES AND ANY RELATED SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN APPROXIMATELY A $5 MILLION IMPACT TO EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES OVER THE ENSUING TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDING  DECEMBER 31, 2020.  WE ARE EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK IN CONNECTION WITH OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES THROUGH THE POSSIBLE INABILITY OF THE BORROWERS TO MEET THE TERMS OF THE SECURITIES. WE LIMIT CREDIT RISK BY INVESTING IN INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES, PRIMARILY AAA-RATED AND AA-RATED SECURITIES, AS RATED BY MOODY\\u2019S, STANDARD & POOR\\u2019S, DBRS FOR CANADIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES, AND FITCH FOR ASSET-BACKED AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES. APPROXIMATELY  78%  OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES HELD A AAA-RATING OR AA-RATING AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019  . IN ADDITION, WE LIMIT AMOUNTS THAT CAN BE INVESTED IN ANY SECURITY OTHER THAN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND GOVERNMENT AGENCY, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT, AND UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT SECURITIES.  WE OPERATE AND TRANSACT BUSINESS IN VARIOUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS AND ARE THEREFORE EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK FROM CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES THAT COULD IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS. WE MANAGE OUR EXPOSURE TO THESE MARKET RISKS THROUGH OUR REGULAR OPERATING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND, WHEN DEEMED APPROPRIATE, THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. WE MAY USE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND NOT FOR TRADING PURPOSES.  43  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (\\u201cU.S. GAAP\\u201d).  THE PREPARATION OF THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES, JUDGMENTS, AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUES, EXPENSES, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES USED TO PREPARE THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER CURRENT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES.  ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT.

IN FEBRUARY 2012, WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR SHAREHOLDERS  TO NO LONGER PURSUE OUR ORIGINAL BUSINESS PLAN (THE SALE OF CUSTOM FRAMED ARTWORK, ART ACCESSORIES AND INTERIOR DESIGN CONSULTING)  AND, IN APRIL 2012, WE BECAME ACTIVE IN THE EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES.  EFFECTIVE  SEPTEMBER 2, 2016, WE FORMALLY CHANGED OUR NAME TO PETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION, PURSUANT TO THE FILING OF A STATEMENT OF CONVERSION  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF COLORADO AND A CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF TEXAS, AUTHORIZED BY THE  PLAN OF CONVERSION WHICH WAS APPROVED BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS AT OUR APRIL 14, 2016, ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS, EACH OF WHICH  ARE DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 14A, WHICH WAS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE  COMMISSION ON MARCH 23, 2016. IN ADDITION TO THE CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION FILING, WE FILED A CERTIFICATE OF CORRECTION FILING  WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE OF TEXAS (CORRECTING CERTAIN ERRORS IN OUR ORIGINALLY FILED CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION) ON AUGUST 24,  2016.  AS  PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ALTHOUGH THE STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED THE PLAN OF CONVERSION AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, PURSUANT TO WHICH OUR CORPORATE  JURISDICTION WAS TO BE CHANGED FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO TO THE STATE OF TEXAS BY MEANS OF A PROCESS CALLED A \\u201cCONVERSION\\u201d  AND OUR NAME WAS TO BE CHANGED TO \\u201cPETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION\\u201d, THOSE FILINGS WERE NOT IMMEDIATELY MADE AND THE CONVERSION  DID NOT BECOME LEGALLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2016. SPECIFICALLY, ON JUNE 15, 2016, THE COMPANY FILED A CERTIFICATE OF CONVERSION  WITH THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE, AFFECTING THE CONVERSION AND THE NAME CHANGE, AND INCLUDING A CERTIFICATE OF FORMATION AS A  CONVERTED TEXAS CORPORATION; HOWEVER, THE STATEMENT OF CONVERSION WAS NOT FILED WITH THE STATE OF COLORADO UNTIL A LATER DATE.  AS A RESULT, AND BECAUSE FINRA AND THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (DTC) HAD ADVISED US THAT THEY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THE CONVERSION  OR NAME CHANGE, OR UPDATE SUCH RELATED INFORMATION IN THE MARKETPLACE UNTIL WE BECAME CURRENT IN OUR PERIODIC FILINGS WITH THE  SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THEY HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW AND APPROVE SUCH TRANSACTIONS, WE TOOK THE POSITION THAT THE  CONVERSION AND NAME CHANGE WERE NOT LEGALLY EFFECTIVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2, 2016.  AS  A RESULT OF THE FILINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND FINRA AND THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY (DTC) FORMALLY RECOGNIZING AND REFLECTING  THE EVENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN THE MARKETPLACE, THE COMPANY HAS FORMALLY CONVERTED FROM A COLORADO CORPORATION TO A TEXAS CORPORATION,  AND HAS FORMALLY CHANGED ITS NAME TO \\u201cPETROLIA ENERGY CORPORATION\\u201d.  TWO  SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS WERE MADE IN 2015 AND ADDITIONAL WORKING INTERESTS IN THE SAME PROPERTIES WERE ACQUIRED IN 2016 AND 2017,  AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, IN FEBRUARY 2018, WE ACQUIRED  BOW ENERGY LTD. AND ITS ASSETS (\\u201cBOW\\u201d), PROVIDED THAT IN SEPTEMBER 2018, WE DIVESTED BOW, EACH AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER  DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW. DURING 2018, WE ACQUIRED AN AGGREGATE OF A 28% WORKING INTEREST IN  PROPERTIES CONSISTING OF APPROXIMATELY 41,526 ACRES LOCATED IN THE LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL, AND CUTHBERT FIELDS, LOCATED IN SOUTHWEST  SASKATCHEWAN AND EASTERN ALBERTA, CANADA, AS DESCRIBED IN GREATER DETAIL IN THE \\u201cPLAN OF OPERATION\\u201d SECTION BELOW.  17  PLAN  OF OPERATION  SINCE  2015, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A CLEARLY DEFINED STRATEGY TO ACQUIRE, ENHANCE AND REDEVELOP HIGH-QUALITY, RESOURCE IN PLACE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN FOCUSING ON ACQUISITIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES AND CANADA WHILE ACTIVELY PURSUING OUR STRATEGY TO  OFFER LOW-COST OPERATIONAL SOLUTIONS IN ESTABLISHED OIL AND GAS REGIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR MIX OF ASSETS-OIL-IN-PLACE CONVENTIONAL  PLAYS, LOW-RISK RESOURCE PLAYS AND THE REDEVELOPMENT OF OUR LATE-STAGE PLAYS IS A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR CONTINUED GROWTH AND FUTURE  REVENUE GROWTH.  OUR  STRATEGY IS TO ACQUIRE LOW RISK, CONVENTIONALLY PRODUCING OIL FIELDS. THIS STRATEGY ALLOWS US TO INCORPORATE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO  MINIMIZE RISK AND MAXIMIZE THE RECOVERABILITY OF EXISTING RESERVOIRS. THIS APPROACH ALLOWS US TO MINIMIZE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT  CAUSED BY EXPLORATORY DEVELOPMENT.  OUR  ACTIVITIES WILL PRIMARILY BE DEPENDENT UPON AVAILABLE FINANCING.  OIL  AND GAS LEASES ARE CONSIDERED REAL PROPERTY. TITLE TO PROPERTIES WHICH WE MAY ACQUIRE WILL BE SUBJECT TO LANDOWNER\\u2019S ROYALTIES,  OVERRIDING ROYALTIES, CARRIED WORKING AND OTHER SIMILAR INTERESTS AND CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS CUSTOMARY IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY,  TO LIENS FOR CURRENT TAXES NOT YET DUE, LIENS FOR AMOUNTS OWING TO PERSONS OPERATING WELLS, AND OTHER ENCUMBRANCES. AS IS CUSTOMARY  IN THE INDUSTRY, IN THE CASE OF UNDEVELOPED PROPERTIES, LITTLE INVESTIGATION OF RECORD TITLE WILL BE MADE AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION  (OTHER THAN A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF LOCAL RECORDS). HOWEVER, DRILLING TITLE OPINIONS MAY BE OBTAINED BEFORE COMMENCEMENT OF DRILLING  OPERATIONS.  MINERVA-ROCKDALE  FIELD  THE  MINERVA-ROCKDALE FIELD, WHICH IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES NORTHEAST OF AUSTIN, TEXAS, WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1921 AND IS  APPROXIMATELY 50 SQUARE MILES IN SIZE. THE MAIN PRODUCING FORMATION FOR THIS FIELD IS THE UPPER CRETACEOUS NAVARRO GROUP OF SANDS  AND SHALES. THE NAVARRO IS TYPICALLY SUBDIVIDED INTO SEVERAL PRODUCING ZONES FROM THE UPPERMOST \\u201cA\\u201d AND \\u201cB\\u201d  SANDS TO THE LOWER \\u201cC\\u201d AND \\u201cD\\u201d SANDS. THE \\u201cB\\u201d SAND IS THE PRIMARY PRODUCING ZONE. THESE SANDS  ARE COMMONLY FINE GRAINED AND POORLY SORTED AND WERE DEPOSITED CLOSE TO A SHORELINE DURING A CYCLE OF MARINE REGRESSION.  IN  APRIL 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A LEASE PERTAINING TO A 423-ACRE TRACT IN MILAM COUNTY, TEXAS, WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ORIGINAL 200 ACRE LEASE. THE COMPANY ISSUED 500,000 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS CONSIDERATION FOR A 100% WORKING INTEREST (83.33%  NET REVENUE INTEREST) IN SUCH LEASE.  IN  AUGUST 2013, WE BECAME AN OIL AND GAS OPERATOR AND TOOK OVER THE OPERATION OF 100% OF OUR WELLS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF  2014, THE COMPANY HIRED JOVIAN PETROLEUM CORPORATION (\\u201cJOVIAN\\u201d) TO SURVEY THE OPERATIONS AND WELL PERFORMANCE AT THE  NOACK FIELD. THEIR REPORT IDENTIFIED PARAFFIN BUILDUP PROBLEMS IN THE WELL BORES AND GATHERING LINES AS THE MAIN PRODUCTION ISSUE  FOR THE COMPANY TO OVERCOME. IN DECEMBER 2014, THE COMPANY SIGNED AN OPERATING AGREEMENT WITH JOVIAN TO ASSUME FULL OPERATIONAL  RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE NOACK FIELD UNDER A FIXED FEE AGREEMENT OF $10,000 PER MONTH FOR FULL OPERATING FIELD SERVICES. ON MARCH  1, 2015, THE COMPANY HIRED ZEL C. KHAN, OUR CURRENT CEO AND DIRECTOR, WHO IS A STOCKHOLDER AND FORMER EMPLOYEE OF JOVIAN. THE  CEO AND PRESIDENT OF JOVIAN IS QUINTEN BEASLEY, OUR FORMER DIRECTOR (RESIGNED OCTOBER 31, 2018).  DURING  THE PERIOD FROM OUR INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 31, 2011, WE DID NOT DRILL ANY OIL OR GAS WELLS. DURING THE YEAR-ENDED DECEMBER 31,  2012, WE DRILLED AND COMPLETED SIX (6) OIL WELLS. DURING 2013, THE COMPANY DRILLED AND COMPLETED THREE (3) WELLS OF WHICH ONE  (1) WAS CONVERTED TO AN INJECTION WELL. DURING 2014, THE COMPANY DRILLED SEVEN (7) NEW WELLS. IN 2015, SIX (6) OF THE WELLS WERE  COMPLETED, FIVE (5) WELLS PRODUCED, ONE (1) DID NOT PRODUCE, AND ONE (1) WELL WAS NOT COMPLETED. DURING 2016, THE COMPANY HAD  THREE (3) WELLS PRODUCING, TEN (10) WELLS TO WORKOVER, WITH ONE (1) INJECTION WELL, ONE (1) THAT DID NOT PRODUCE, AND ONE (1)  WELL NOT COMPLETED.

THE 70,807,417 SHARES  RETURNED TO TREASURY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CANCELLED.  CANADIAN  PROPERTIES \\u2013 LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL AND CUTHBERT FIELDS  EFFECTIVE  ON JUNE 29, 2018, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 25% WORKING INTEREST IN APPROXIMATELY 41,526 ACRES LOCATED IN THE LUSELAND, HEARTS HILL,  AND CUTHBERT FIELDS, LOCATED IN SOUTHWEST SASKATCHEWAN AND EASTERN ALBERTA, CANADA (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\u201cCANADIAN PROPERTIES\\u201d  AND THE \\u201cWORKING INTEREST\\u201d). THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES CURRENTLY ENCOMPASS 64 SECTIONS, WITH 240 OIL AND 12 NATURAL  GAS WELLS CURRENTLY PRODUCING ON THE PROPERTIES. ADDITIONALLY, THERE ARE SEVERAL IDLE WELLS WITH POTENTIAL FOR REACTIVATION AND  34 SECTIONS OF UNDEVELOPED LAND (APPROXIMATELY 21,760 ACRES). THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES AND THE WORKING INTEREST WERE ACQUIRED FROM  BLUE SKY (A RELATED PARTY, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE). BLUE SKY HAD PREVIOUSLY ACQUIRED AN 80% WORKING INTEREST FROM GEOROX RESOURCES  INC., WHO HAD ACQUIRED THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES FROM CONA RESOURCES LTD.  ON  SEPTEMBER 17, 2018, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (\\u201cMOU\\u201d) WITH BLUE SKY TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS  TO ACQUIRE AN ADDITIONAL 3% WORKING INTEREST IN THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES, INCREASING OUR WORKING INTEREST TO 28%. TOTAL CONSIDERATION  PAID FROM THE COMPANY TO BLUE SKY FOR THE ADDITIONAL 3% WORKING INTEREST WAS $150,000.  RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS  REVENUES  OUR  OIL AND GAS REVENUE REPORTED FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $819,340, AN INCREASE OF $789,360 FROM THE THREE MONTHS  ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. A TOTAL OF $796,776 OF THE INCREASE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NEW OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CANADIAN  PROPERTIES WHICH WERE ACQUIRED AFTER MARCH 31, 2018. REVENUES ASSOCIATED WITH OUR U.S. PROPERTIES TOTALED $22,564.  OPERATING  EXPENSES  OPERATING  EXPENSES DECREASED BY $756,766, TO $1,240,514 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $1,997,280 FOR THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED OVER THE COMPARATIVE PERIOD DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF $1,567,416  IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS FROM HIGHS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD ASSOCIATED WITH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE DECREASE WAS  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES OF $621,383 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO  THE PRIOR PERIOD AND AN INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION, DEPLETION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR $186,058, BOTH RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION  OF THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES ON JUNE 29, 2018.  OTHER  INCOME (EXPENSE)  FOREIGN  EXCHANGE GAIN DECREASED BY $35,913, TO $17,425 FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $53,338 FOR THE THREE  MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018. THE DECREASE RESULTED FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR AGAINST THE CANADIAN  DOLLAR.  INTEREST  EXPENSE INCREASED FOR THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, COMPARED TO THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, BY  $9,162. THE INCREASE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN DEBT CARRIED DURING THE RELEVANT PERIOD.  THE  COMPANY INCURRED A GAIN OF $19,075 FOR THE THREE-MONTH ENDED MARCH 31, 2019, RELATING TO THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE  LIABILITIES. A DERIVATIVE LIABILITY WAS RECOGNIZED UPON ISSUING CANADIAN DOLLAR DENOMINATED WARRANTS TO A DEBT HOLDER. THE GAIN  RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM TIME DECAY.  22  THE  COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS ON RELATED PARTY DEBT SETTLEMENT OF $203,349 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RELATING TO ACCRUED  SALARIES. NO SUCH LOSS WAS INCURRED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  THE  COMPANY INCURRED A LOSS OF $32,999,330 FOR THE THREE-MONTH ENDED MARCH 31, 2018, RELATING TO THE ACQUISITION OF BOW ENERGY LTD.  NO SUCH LOSS WAS INCURRED IN THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019.  NET  INCOME (LOSS)  NET  LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 WAS $413,600, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS OF $35,146,405 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  MARCH 31, 2018. THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE DECREASE IN NET LOSS IS DUE TO THE LOSS ON DISPOSITION OF BOW ENERGY LTD. OF $32,999,330,  WHICH WAS INCURRED DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018.  LIQUIDITY  AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE  FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD FROM DECEMBER 31, 2018, TO MARCH 31, 2019.  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF $338,411 AND TOTAL ASSETS OF $12,586,952. OUR TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF  MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $2,736,319 AND OUR TOTAL LIABILITIES AS OF MARCH 31, 2019 WERE $5,024,938. WE HAD NEGATIVE WORKING CAPITAL  OF $2,397,908 AS OF MARCH 31, 2019.  OUR  MATERIAL ASSET BALANCES ARE MADE UP OF OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND RELATED EQUIPMENT. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES ARE ACCOUNTS  PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES, INCLUDING AMOUNTS DUE TO RELATED PARTIES, MAINLY CONSISTING OF ACCRUED OFFICER SALARIES OF $1,840,239,  IN ADDITION TO ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND NOTE PAYABLES OF $1,546,386 AND $1,640,375, RESPECTIVELY (SEE \\u201cPART I \\u2013  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - NOTE 5. NOTES PAYABLE\\u201d, ABOVE FOR INFORMATION REGARDING OUTSTANDING DEBT OBLIGATIONS).  NET  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $190,283 AND $309,075 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCTIONS IN NET LOSS.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $120,000 AND $3,784 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FUNDS USED TO ACQUIRE THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES.  NET  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $67,188 AND $231,880 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  THE DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REPAYMENTS OF THE NOTES PAYABLE OF $156,330. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED  MARCH 31, 2019, THE COMPANY DID NOT SELL SECURITIES, WHILE THE COMPANY RAISED $238,675 DURING THE PRIOR COMPARATIVE PERIOD THROUGH  THE SALE OF SECURITIES.  THE  COMPANY CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT A NEGATIVE CASH FLOW OF APPROXIMATELY $35,000 PER MONTH WHICH RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT OUR  ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. MANAGEMENT IS PURSUING SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO SECURE FUNDING TO INCREASE PRODUCTION AT  BOTH THE SUDS AND TLSAUS FIELDS WHICH TOGETHER WITH ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL MAY REDUCE THE COMPANY\\u2019S  MONTHLY CASH SHORTFALL. THE TOTAL AMOUNT REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE IS APPROXIMATELY $500,000. THE SALE  OF THE NOACK FIELD AND THE ADDITION OF THE REVENUE FROM OUR 28% OWNERSHIP OF THE CANADIAN PROPERTIES HAS ENHANCED CASHFLOW AND  ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ALLOCATE FUNDS FOR SUDS AND TLSAU DEVELOPMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY HAS RESUMED WORKOVER ACTIVITIES AT SUDS  AND TLSAU AND EXPECTS PROGRESS TO CONTINUE PAST THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, FUNDING PERMITTING.  THE  COMPANY HAS SUFFERED RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. THESE CONDITIONS RAISE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY  TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. WE PLAN TO GENERATE PROFITS BY WORKING OVER EXISTING WELLS AND DRILLING PRODUCTIVE OIL OR GAS  WELLS. HOWEVER, WE WILL NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO WORKOVER OR DRILL NEW WELLS THROUGH THE SALE OF OUR SECURITIES, THROUGH  LOANS FROM THIRD PARTIES OR FROM THIRD PARTIES WILLING TO PAY OUR SHARE OF DRILLING AND COMPLETING THE WELLS. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY  COMMITMENTS OR ARRANGEMENTS FROM ANY PERSON TO PROVIDE US WITH ANY ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. IF ADDITIONAL FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE  WHEN NEEDED, WE MAY NEED TO CEASE OPERATIONS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN RAISING THE CAPITAL NEEDED  TO DRILL OIL OR GAS WELLS NOR THAT ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE AVAILABLE TO US ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. ANY WELLS  WHICH WE MAY DRILL MAY NOT BE PRODUCTIVE OF OIL OR GAS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ACTIONS PRESENTLY BEING TAKEN TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL  FUNDING PROVIDE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN  PREPARED ASSUMING THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN; NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO ACCOUNT  FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY. MOVING FORWARD WE MAY SELL CERTAIN OF OUR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES IN AN EFFORT TO RAISE FUNDS TO SUPPORT  OUR OPERATIONS AND FUTURE PLANNED OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS.  23  OFF-BALANCE  SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  AS  OF MARCH 31, 2019, WE HAD NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT  ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES OR CHANGE OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.  TRENDS  AFFECTING FUTURE OPERATIONS  THE  FACTORS THAT WILL MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BE (I) THE SALE PRICES OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS,  (II) THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION FROM OIL OR GAS WELLS IN WHICH WE HAVE AN INTEREST, AND (III) LEASE OPERATING EXPENSES. OUR REVENUES  WILL ALSO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE OIL OR GAS PRODUCTION THROUGH EXPLORATION AND DEVELOPMENT  ACTIVITIES, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING TO COMPLETE SUCH ACTIVITIES.  IT  IS EXPECTED THAT OUR PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF CASH FLOW WILL BE FROM THE PRODUCTION AND SALE OF CRUDE OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES  WHICH ARE DEPLETING ASSETS. CASH FLOW FROM THE SALE OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DEPENDS UPON THE QUANTITY OF PRODUCTION AND THE  PRICE OBTAINED FOR THE PRODUCTION. AN INCREASE IN PRICES WILL PERMIT US TO FINANCE OUR OPERATIONS TO A GREATER EXTENT WITH INTERNALLY  GENERATED FUNDS, MAY ALLOW US TO OBTAIN EQUITY FINANCING MORE EASILY OR ON BETTER TERMS, AND LESSENS THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING  FINANCING. HOWEVER, PRICE INCREASES HEIGHTEN THE COMPETITION FOR OIL AND GAS PROSPECTS, INCREASE THE COSTS OF EXPLORATION AND  DEVELOPMENT, AND, BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL PRICE DECLINES, INCREASE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF PRODUCING PROPERTIES  DURING TIMES THAT PRICES ARE AT HIGHER LEVELS.  A  DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS PRICES (I) WILL REDUCE THE CASH FLOW INTERNALLY GENERATED BY THE COMPANY WHICH IN TURN WILL REDUCE THE  FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR EXPLORING FOR AND REPLACING OIL AND GAS RESERVES, (II) WILL INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING EQUITY AND  DEBT FINANCING AND WORSEN THE TERMS ON WHICH SUCH FINANCING MAY BE OBTAINED, (III) WILL REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OIL AND GAS PROSPECTS  WHICH HAVE REASONABLE ECONOMIC TERMS, (IV) MAY CAUSE US TO PERMIT LEASES TO EXPIRE BASED UPON THE VALUE OF POTENTIAL OIL AND GAS  RESERVES IN RELATION TO THE COSTS OF EXPLORATION, (V) MAY RESULT IN MARGINALLY PRODUCTIVE OIL AND GAS WELLS BEING ABANDONED AS  NON-COMMERCIAL, AND (VI) MAY INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING FINANCING. HOWEVER, PRICE DECLINES REDUCE THE COMPETITION FOR  OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND CORRESPONDINGLY REDUCE THE PRICES PAID FOR LEASES AND PROSPECTS. DURING THE LAST 5 MONTHS, OIL PRICES  HAVE TRENDED UPWARD TO APPROXIMATELY $58.00 PER BARREL.  OTHER  THAN THE FOREGOING, WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANY TRENDS, EVENTS OR UNCERTAINTIES THAT WILL HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO HAVE,  A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR SALES, REVENUES OR EXPENSES.

GOING  CONCERN  \\u2013 THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON A GOING CONCERN BASIS, WHICH CONTEMPLATES THE  REALIZATION OF ASSETS AND THE SATISFACTION OF LIABILITIES IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED CUMULATIVE  NET LOSSES SINCE ITS INCEPTION AND REQUIRES CAPITAL FOR ITS CONTEMPLATED OPERATIONAL AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES TO TAKE PLACE. THE  COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL THROUGH THE FUTURE SALES OF COMMON STOCK AND OTHER SECURITIES IS UNKNOWN.  THE OBTAINMENT OF ADDITIONAL FINANCING, THE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTEMPLATED PLAN OF OPERATIONS, AND  ITS TRANSITION, ULTIMATELY, TO THE ATTAINMENT OF PROFITABLE OPERATIONS ARE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS. THE  ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVE THESE FACTORS RAISES SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING  CONCERN.

ABTL GENERATED APPROXIMATELY $12.0 MILLION IN SALES FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017.  MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THIS ACQUISITION TO BE IMMATERIAL.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  OUR MANAGEMENT BELIEVES WE ARE THE LARGEST PROVIDER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS IN THE UNITED STATES.  WE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF MANUFACTURING, DESIGNING, AND SELLING BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER PRINTED BUSINESS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY TO DISTRIBUTORS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES. WE OPERATE 62 MANUFACTURING PLANTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IN 21 STRATEGICALLY LOCATED STATES.  APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE BUSINESS PRODUCTS WE MANUFACTURE ARE CUSTOM AND SEMI-CUSTOM PRODUCTS, CONSTRUCTED IN A WIDE VARIETY OF SIZES, COLORS, NUMBER OF PARTS, AND QUANTITIES ON AN INDIVIDUAL JOB BASIS, DEPENDING UPON THE CUSTOMERS\\u2019 SPECIFICATIONS.  21  ENNIS, INC.

WE SELL PREDOMINANTLY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, AS WELL AS TO MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS. NORTHSTAR COMPUTER FORMS, INC., A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, GENERALLY LARGE BANKING ORGANIZATIONS (WHERE A DISTRIBUTOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE OR AVAILABLE TO THE END-USER).  ADAMS MCCLURE, LP, A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ALSO SELLS DIRECT TO A SMALL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, WHERE SALES ARE GENERALLY THROUGH ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  THE PRINTING INDUSTRY GENERALLY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS EITHER DIRECTLY TO END USERS, A MARKET DOMINATED BY A FEW LARGE MANUFACTURERS, SUCH AS R.R. DONNELLEY AND SONS, STAPLES, INC., STANDARD REGISTER CO. (A SUBSIDIARY OF TAYLOR CORPORATION), AND CENVEO, INC., OR, LIKE THE COMPANY, THROUGH A VARIETY OF INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS AND DISTRIBUTOR GROUPS. WHILE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF ADEQUATE PUBLIC STATISTICAL INFORMATION, TO DETERMINE THE COMPANY\\u2019S SHARE OF THE TOTAL BUSINESS PRODUCTS MARKET, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST PRODUCER OF BUSINESS FORMS, PRESSURE-SEAL FORMS, LABELS, TAGS, ENVELOPES, AND PRESENTATION FOLDERS IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRIBUTING PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS.  THERE ARE A NUMBER OF COMPETITORS THAT OPERATE IN THIS SEGMENT, RANGING IN SIZE FROM SINGLE EMPLOYEE-OWNED OPERATIONS TO MULTI-PLANT ORGANIZATIONS. WE BELIEVE OUR STRATEGIC LOCATIONS AND BUYING POWER PERMIT US TO COMPETE ON A FAVORABLE BASIS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTOR MARKET ON COMPETITIVE FACTORS, SUCH AS SERVICE, QUALITY, AND PRICE.  DISTRIBUTION OF BUSINESS FORMS AND OTHER BUSINESS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES IS PRIMARILY DONE THROUGH INDEPENDENT DEALERS, INCLUDING BUSINESS FORMS DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, DIRECT MAIL, COMMERCIAL PRINTERS, PAYROLL AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE SOFTWARE COMPANIES, AND ADVERTISING AGENCIES.  RAW MATERIALS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF A WIDE VARIETY OF WEIGHTS, WIDTHS, COLORS, SIZES, AND QUALITIES OF PAPER FOR BUSINESS PRODUCTS PURCHASED PRIMARILY FROM ONE MAJOR SUPPLIER AT FAVORABLE PRICES BASED ON THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS.  BUSINESS PRODUCTS USAGE IN THE PRINTING INDUSTRY IS GENERALLY NOT SEASONAL. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CONTRACTION OF THE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS FORMS INDUSTRY ARE THE PREDOMINANT FACTORS IN QUARTERLY VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS.  BUSINESS CHALLENGES  WE ARE ENGAGED IN AN INDUSTRY EXPERIENCING CONSOLIDATION OF SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL CHANNELS, PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE, PAPER SUPPLIER CAPACITY ADJUSTMENTS, AND INCREASED PRICING AND POTENTIAL SUPPLY ALLOCATIONS DUE TO DEMAND/SUPPLY CURVE IMBALANCE.  TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES HAVE MADE ELECTRONIC DISTRIBUTION OF DOCUMENTS, INTERNET HOSTING, DIGITAL PRINTING AND PRINT-ON-DEMAND VALID, COST-EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL CUSTOM-PRINTED DOCUMENTS AND CUSTOMER COMMUNICATIONS.  IMPROVED EQUIPMENT HAS BECOME MORE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR COMPETITORS DUE TO THE CONTINUED LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.  WE FACE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IN AN ALREADY OVER-SUPPLIED, PRICE-COMPETITIVE PRINT INDUSTRY.  THE CHALLENGES OF OUR BUSINESS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.  22  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  TRANSFORMATION OF OUR PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS  \\u2013  WHILE TRADITIONAL BUSINESS DOCUMENTS ARE ESSENTIAL IN ORDER TO CONDUCT BUSINESS, MANY ARE BEING REPLACED THROUGH THE USE OF CHEAPER PAPER GRADES OR IMPORTED PAPER, OR DEVALUED WITH ADVANCES IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOG  IES, CAUSING STEADY DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR A PORTION OF OUR CURRENT PRODUCT LINE.  TRANSFORMING OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE, VALUABLE SOLUTIONS THROUGH LOWER LABOR AND FIXED CHARGES TO OUR CUSTOMERS ON A PROACTIVE BASIS  WILL REQUIRE US TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN NEW AND EXISTING TECHNOLOGY AND TO DEVELOP KEY STRATEGIC BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS PRINT-ON-DEMAND SERVICES AND PRODUCT OFFERINGS THAT ASSIST CUSTOMERS IN THEIR TRANSITION TO DIGITAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS.  IN  ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AND NICHES THROUGH ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE ADDITION OF OUR ENVELOPE OFFERINGS, TAG OFFERINGS, FOLDER OFFERINGS, HEALTHCARE WRISTBANDS, SPECIALTY PACKAGING, DIRECT MAIL, PRESSURE SEAL PRODUCT  S, SECURE DOCUMENT SOLUTIONS, INNOVATIVE IN-MOLD LABEL OFFERINGS AND LONG-RUN INTEGRATED PRODUCTS WITH HIGH COLOR WEB PRINTING, WHICH PROVIDE US WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH AND DIFFERENTIATE US FROM OUR COMPETITION.  PRODUCTION CAPACITY AND PRICE COMPETITION WITHIN OUR INDUSTRY  \\u2013 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR DURING THE LATTER PORTION OF FISCAL YEAR 2018 AND FIRST HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 RESULTED IN THE DISSIPATION OF THE PRICING ADVANTAGE THAT FOREIGN IMPORTS HAD OVER DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS, WHICH IN TURN LED TO LOWER VOLUMES OF IMPORTED PAPER AND AN INCREASE IN DOMESTIC EXPORTS.  THESE FACTORS GIVE DOMESTIC PAPER SUPPLIERS MORE PRICING POWER SINCE THEY CAN CONTROL THE SUPPLY OF PAPER BY ELIMINATING CAPACITY OR CHANGING THE PRODUCTS PRODUCED ON THEIR LARGE PAPER MACHINES.  DURING THIS SAME PERIOD, SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY LEFT THE MARKET, WHETHER PLANNED (I.E., SWITCHING OF PRODUCTS TO ALTERNATIVE PAPER PRODUCTS) OR UNPLANNED (I.E., BANKRUPTCY).  CONSEQUENTLY, EVEN WITH SHRINKING DEMAND, A SUPPLY/DEMAND IMBALANCE RESULTED DURING THE LATTER PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, WITH MOST MILLS RUNNING IN EXCESS OF 90% OF CAPACITY ACROSS ALL GRADES.  GIVEN THESE LEVELS, CONSISTENT WITH HISTORICAL PRACTICE, SUPPLIERS RAISED PRICES MULTIPLE TIMES DURING THE LATTER PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND EARLY PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2020 ACROSS ALL FACETS OF THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS, FROM RAW MATERIALS TO SUPPLIES.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME PAPER GRADES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019 WERE PLACED ON ALLOCATIONS GIVEN THE TIGHT SUPPLY ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN OUR LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR MAJOR PAPER SUPPLIER, OUR FINANCIAL STRENGTH AND OUR SIZE, WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID MATERIAL DISRUPTIONS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019.  FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020, WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS BEGAN TO FLOW BACK INTO THE DOMESTIC MARKETPLACE.  THIS DEVELOPMENT, ALONG WITH CONTINUED SLOWING OF DOMESTIC DEMAND, RESULTED IN RENEWED MARKETING OF CERTAIN PAPER GRADES THAT PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN PLACED ON ALLOCATION.  CONSEQUENTLY, SPOT PRICING BECAME VERY COMPETITIVE.  THE UNCOATED PAPER MARKET HAS BALANCED SOMEWHAT, BUT OVERALL DEMAND REMAINS WEAK, AND MILLS HAVE DROPPED BACK TO MORE NORMAL OPERATING LEVELS.  WITH MORE CAPACITY SHUTS/CONVERSIONS PLANNED EXPECTATIONS ARE OPERATING RATES WILL SUSTAIN IN THE LOWER 90S.  WITH DECLINING DEMAND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, COMBINED WITH RISING IMPORTS, FALLING EXPORTS AND A MORE BALANCED MARKET, PRICES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE UNTIL AT LEAST THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL YEAR 2021.  COATED PAPER DEMAND HAS DROPPED CONSIDERABLY AND, EVEN WITH SEVERAL MAJOR CAPACITY CLOSURES, OPERATING RATES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN LOW DURING THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, DESPITE A RECENT UP-TICK. CONTINUED CLOSURES/CONVERSIONS ARE EXPECTED BUT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE ENOUGH TO COMPLETELY BALANCE THE MARKET.  IMPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP WITH DEMAND, BUT THE HIGH DOLLAR COULD PUSH IMPORTS EVEN HIGHER WHICH COULD LEAD PRESSURE ON COATED PAPER PRICING.  HOWEVER, REGARDLESS OF THESE FACTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CYCLICAL, WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR PRODUCT COSTS, THROUGH THE USE OF FORECASTING, PRODUCTION AND COSTING MODELS, AS WELL AS WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR DOMESTIC SUPPLIERS TO REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT COSTS, IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE EFFECTS ON OUR OPERATIONAL RESULTS.  IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO REDUCE AND LEVERAGE OUR FIXED COSTS.  CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS  \\u2013 OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DISTRIBUTORS, MANY OF WHICH ARE CONSOLIDATING OR ARE BEING ACQUIRED BY COMPETITORS.  WE CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN A MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS WE HAVE HAD WITH OUR CUSTOMERS HISTORICALLY, BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THESE CONSOLIDATIONS AND ACQUISITIONS, WHICH WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE, ULTIMATELY WILL IMPACT OUR MARGINS AND SALES.

OUR NET SALES WERE $114.9 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $108.1 MILLION FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $6.8 MILLION, OR 6.3%.  RECENT INCREASES IN FOREIGN IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICINGS LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  THE ACQUISITIONS OF INTEGRATED (COMPLETED IN MARCH 2019) AND FLESH (COMPLETED IN JULY 2019) ARE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR STRATEGY TO OFFSET ON GOING TECHNOLOGICAL DISRUPTION AND OTHER CHANGES.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $12.2 MILLION DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD INCREASED $6.7 MILLION FROM $74.3 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 TO $81.0 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OR 9.0%. OUR GROSS PROFIT MARGIN (\\u201c  MARGIN  \\u201d) WAS $33.8 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER, OR 29.5% OF NET SALES, COMPARED TO $33.8 MILLION, OR 31.2% OF NET SALES, FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OUR MARGINS CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY IMPACTED BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR.    WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE MARGIN OF OUR OTHER PLANTS CONTINUES TO BE APPROXIMATELY 31.3%, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY INTEGRATE THESE ACQUISITIONS INTO OUR BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OUR SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201c  SG&A  \\u201d) EXPENSES WERE $19.8 MILLION COMPARED TO $19.9 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, A SLIGHT DECREASE OF $0.1 MILLION, OR 0.5%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, SG&A EXPENSES WERE 17.2% AND 18.5% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $1.6 MILLION.  AS PART OF OUR ON-GOING CORPORATE STRATEGY, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MORE FULLY LEVERAGE OUR SG&A EXPENSES.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $4,000 NET LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $193,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE PRIOR YEAR\\u2019S QUARTER IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $14.1 MILLION, OR 12.3% OF NET SALES, AS COMPARED TO $14.0 MILLION, OR 12.9% OF NET SALES, FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  OUR ACQUISITIONS IMPACTED OUR OPERATIONAL INCOME BY $1.1 MILLION DURING THE QUARTER.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME WAS $180,000 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO $114,000 EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE CURRENT QUARTER WAS NEGLIGIBLE DUE TO THE PAYOFF OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER IN THIS FISCAL YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  25  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  NET EARNINGS.  NET EARNINGS, DUE TO THE FACTORS ABOVE, WERE $10.6 MILLION FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $10.4 MILLION FOR THE COMPARABLE Q  UARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR, A SLIGHT INCREASE OF $0.2 MILLION.  NET E  ARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.41, COMPARED TO $0.40 FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018  NET SALES.  OUR NET SALES WERE $331.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $300.1 MILLION FOR SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $31.6 MILLION, OR 10.5 %.  THE RECENT INCREASE IN SUPPLY OF CHEAPER FOREIGN PAPER IMPORTS, DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, UNSEASONAL WEATHER CONDITIONS IN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND CURRENT DOMESTIC PRICING LEVELS, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE ELEMENTS FOR A CHALLENGING MARKETPLACE.  EACH OF THESE FACTORS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES.  IN PARTICULAR, OUR COMPETITION WAS ABLE TO BE MORE PRICE-COMPETITIVE DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF CHEAPER MATERIALS, AND SOME OF OUR SALES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WEATHER ISSUES.  OUR ACQUISITIONS POSITIVELY IMPACTED OUR NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY $45.7 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  COST OF GOODS SOLD.  OUR COST OF GOODS SOLD WAS $232.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $205.8 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $26.9 MILLION, OR 13.1%. OUR MARGIN WAS $99.0 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, OR 29.8%.  THIS COMPARES TO 31.4% FOR THE SAME NINE MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  OUR MARGIN DURING THE PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED FOR THE MOST PART BY THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED IN THE LAST YEAR AND TO A LESSER EXTENT TO THE NUMEROUS RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES TAKEN LAST YEAR, SOME OF WHICH COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY PASSED THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMER.  DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR, TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS ALLOWED FOR MULTIPLE PRICE INCREASES ON RAW MATERIALS WHICH COULD BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE CUSTOMER DUE TO APPORTIONMENT OF PAPER, AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS.  HISTORICALLY PRICE INCREASES HAVE BEEN LESS FREQUENT, WHICH ALLOWED MANUFACTURERS THE ABILITY TO PASS THE REQUIRED PRICING ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  HOWEVER, THE SIZE AND NUMBER OF INCREASES HAVE IMPACTED MANUFACTURERS\\u2019 ABILITIES TO TIMELY PASS THESE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE END-USERS.  WE BELIEVE THESE PRICE INCREASES WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MARGINS UNTIL THE EXCESS COSTS ARE ABLE TO BE PASSED THROUGH TO THE MARKETPLACE, OR UNTIL MATERIAL COSTS DECLINE IN THE MARKETPLACE.  RECENTLY, DUE TO CURRENT PRICING LEVELS AND THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, IMPORTS HAVE INCREASED AND CREATED EXCESS SUPPLY.  THIS HISTORICALLY HAS LED TO SOME NORMALIZATION/STABILITY IN THE MARKETPLACE WHICH IS STARTING TO BE SEEN AS MATERIAL PRICES BECOME SOFTER.  OUR ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED DURING THE PAST YEAR HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE IMPACT ON OUR MARGINS AS WE TRANSITION THEM INTO OUR ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING SYSTEM. WITHOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED OVER THE PAST 18 MONTHS, THE MARGINS FROM OUR OTHER PLANTS CONTINUED TO BE ABOVE 31.5% DURING THE PERIOD, COMPARABLE TO HISTORICAL LEVELS.  ONCE WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULLY ANALYZE THE BUSINESS COST STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENT OUR COSTS SYSTEMS, WE BELIEVE MARGINS AT THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED PLANTS WILL IMPROVE TO NORMAL LEVELS.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE.  OUR SG&A EXPENSES WERE $59.1 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $55.2 MILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, OR AN INCREASE OF 7.1%.  AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES, THE SG&A EXPENSES WERE 17.8% AND 18.4% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY.  OUR ACQUISITIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR SG&A EXPENSES BY APPROXIMATELY $6.0 MILLION DURING THE NINE MONTH PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019. AS PART OF OUR ON-GOING CORPORATE STRATEGY, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO MORE FULLY LEVERAGE OUR SG&A EXPENSES.  GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS.  THE $4,000 NET LOSS FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  THE $199,000 NET GAIN FROM DISPOSAL OF ASSETS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE SALE OF AN UNUSED MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT.  INCOME FROM OPERATIONS.  OUR INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $39.9 MILLION, OR 12.0% OF SALES, AS COMPARED TO $39.2 MILLION, OR 13.1% OF SALES, FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  THE ACQUISITIONS, DURING THE PERIOD IMPACTED OUR OPERATING INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $4.0 MILLION.  OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).  OTHER INCOME FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $0.3 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $0.2 MILLION EXPENSE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  DURING THE CURRENT QUARTER, DUE TO OUR CASH BALANCE, OUR INTEREST INCOME WAS HIGHER THAN OUR INTEREST EXPENSE.  INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE PERIOD WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.3 MILLION LESS THAN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR DUE TO THE PAYOFF OF THE CREDIT FACILITY AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER IN THIS FISCAL YEAR.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS 26.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO 25.0% FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL TAX RATE THIS YEAR AS COMPARED TO LAST IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN OUR OVERALL EXPECTED STATE TAX RATE DUE TO CHANGES IN STATE APPORTIONMENT.  26  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  NET EARNINGS.  NET E  ARNINGS WERE $29.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $29.2 MILLION  FOR THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR, AN INCREASE OF $0.5 MILLION.  NET EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $1.14, COMPARED TO $1.14 FOR THE SAME NINE MONTH PERIOD LAST YEAR.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  WE RELY ON OUR CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND THE BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY EXTENDED PURSUANT TO OUR SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CREDIT AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME (THE \\u201c  CREDIT FACILITY  \\u201d), TO MEET CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS.  THE PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS OF OUR BUSINESS ARE PAYMENTS TO VENDORS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DEBT REPAYMENTS AND RELATED INTEREST PAYMENTS, CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR NONCONTRIBUTORY DEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLAN, WHICH COVERS APPROXIMATELY 16% OF OUR AGGREGATE EMPLOYEES (THE \\u201c  PENSION PLAN  \\u201d), AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.  WE EXPECT TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS SUPPLEMENTED BY OUR CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED TO COVER OUR OPERATING AND CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NOVEMBER 30,  FEBRUARY 28,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2019  WORKING CAPITAL  $106,500  $134,542  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  $61,313  $88,442  WORKING CAPITAL.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL DECREASED $28.0 MILLION OR 20.8%, FROM $134.5 MILLION AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO $106.5 MILLION AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR CURRENT RATIO, CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR CURRENT ASSETS BY OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES, DECREASED FROM 5.3 TO 1.0 AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019 TO 3.8 TO 1.0 AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR WORKING CAPITAL AND CURRENT RATIO WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REPAYMENT OF LONG-TERM DEBT OF $30.0 MILLION AND THE ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENT ASC 842, WHICH INCREASED OUR CURRENT LIABILITIES BY $5.6 MILLION.  NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $44,433  $36,667  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  $(21,469  )  $(30,855  )  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES  $(50,093  )  $(21,224  )  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $7.7 MILLION FROM $36.7 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 TO $44.4 MILLION FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019.  OUR INCREASED OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS IN COMPARISON TO THE COMPARABLE PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF TWO FACTORS: I) A $1.0 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, AND II) A $7.9 MILLION DECREASE IN OUR INVENTORIES.  THESE INCREASES IN OUR CASH WERE OFFSET BY A $2.8 MILLION INCREASE IN OUR PREPAID EXPENSES AND INCOME TAXES.  CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $9.4 MILLION FROM $30.9 MILLION TO $21.5 MILLION USED FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018 AND NOVEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.0 MILLION LESS USED FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AS WELL AS $8.7 MILLION LESS USED IN OUR ACQUISITIONS OF INTEGRATED AND FLESH IN THE CURRENT PERIOD IN COMPARISON TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF ABTL AND WRIGHT IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST FISCAL YEAR.  CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  WE USED AN ADDITIONAL $28.9 MILLION IN CASH FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  WE USED $30.0 MILLION TO PAY LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, BUT PAID NO LONG-TERM DEBT IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD LAST YEAR.  IN ADDITION, AN ADDITIONAL $0.9 MILLION WAS USED TO PAY DIVIDENDS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018.  WE USED $2.5 MILLION TO REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, COMPARED TO $4.6 MILLION TO REPURCHASE SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2018, A DIFFERENCE OF $2.1 MILLION.  CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S CREDIT FACILITY, WITH A SCHEDULED MATURITY DATE OF AUGUST 11, 2020, PROVIDES THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WITH UP TO $100.0 MILLION IN REVOLVING CREDIT, AS WELL AS A $20.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR THE ISSUANCE OF LETTERS OF CREDIT AND A $15.0 MILLION SUBLIMIT FOR SWING-LINE LOANS.  UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES CAN REQUEST UP TO THREE INCREASES IN THE AGGREGATE COMMITMENTS IN AN AGGREGATE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $50.0 MILLION.  THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY IMPOSE CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, MAKE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, ACQUISITIONS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS, AS WELL AS IMPOSE OTHER CUSTOMARY COVENANTS, SUCH AS REQUIRING THAT OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO NOT BE LESS THAN 1.25:1.00 AND OUR TOTAL LEVERAGE RATIO NOT EXCEED 3.00:1.00.  THE COMPANY MAY MAKE DIVIDENDS OR DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS SO LONG AS (A) NO EVENT OF DEFAULT HAS OCCURRED AND IS CONTINUING AND (B) THE COMPANY\\u2019S NET LEVERAGE RATIO BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER GIVING  27  ENNIS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  FORM 10-Q  FOR THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019  EFFECT TO ANY SUCH DIVIDEND OR DISTRIBUTION IS EQUAL TO OR LESS  THAN 2.50:1.00.  ALL CALCULATIONS ARE MADE BASED ON GAAP EXISTING AT THE TIME THE CREDIT FACILITY WAS ENTERED INTO.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY BEARS INTEREST AT THE LIBOR RATE PLUS A SPREAD RANGING FROM 1.0% TO 2.0%, WHICH RATE WAS 3.6% (3 MONTH LIBOR + 1.0%) AT FEBRUARY 28, 2019.  THE RATE IS DETERMINED BY OUR FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO OF TOTAL FUNDED DEBT TO EBITDA.  AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY HAD NO OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND THE COMPANY HAD  $0.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS, LEAVING APPROXIMATELY $99.3 MILLION AVAILABLE IN BORROWING CAPACITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY.  THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SECURED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR ASSETS (OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY), AS WELL AS ALL CAPITAL SECURITIES OF EACH OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES.  IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT AVAILABILITY UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COMPANY\\u2019S WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, SHOULD IT BE REQUIRED.  PENSION PLAN \\u2013  WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLAN.  THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE REQUIRED UNDER THE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974 (\\u201c  ERISA  \\u201d).  DUE TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT (HATFA) IN AUGUST 2014, WHICH EFFECTIVELY RAISES THE DISCOUNT RATES MANDATED FOR DETERMINING THE VALUE OF A PLAN\\u2019S BENEFIT LIABILITY AND ANNUAL COST OF ACCRUALS, OUR MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION TO THE PENSION PLAN IS ZERO FOR THE PENSION PLAN YEAR ENDING FEBRUARY 29, 2020. ASSUMING A STABLE FUNDING STATUS, WE WOULD EXPECT THAT OUR FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE IN LINE WITH OUR SERVICE COSTS, WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO BE BETWEEN $1.3 MILLION AND $1.5 MILLION PER YEAR.  HOWEVER, CHANGES IN ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURNS OR IN DISCOUNT RATES COULD CHANGE THIS AMOUNT SIGNIFICANTLY.  WE MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $3.0 MILLION TO OUR PENSION PLAN DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019. AS OUR PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FLUCTUATIONS IN MARKET VALUES COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT OUR FUNDING STATUS, ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES RECORDED AND FUTURE REQUIRED MINIMUM CONTRIBUTIONS.  AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD A NET PENSION ASSET RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET OF $0.6 MILLION.  INVENTORIES  \\u2013  WE BELIEVE OUR INVENTORY LEVELS ARE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR CUSTOMER DEMANDS AND WE ANTICIPATE HAVING ADEQUATE SOURCES OF RAW MATERIALS TO MEET FUTURE BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS IN EFFECT WITH PAPER SUPPLIERS THAT GOVERN PRICES, BUT DO NOT REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.  CERTAIN OF OUR REBATE PROGRAMS DO, HOWEVER, REQUIRE MINIMUM PURCHASE VOLUMES.  MANAGEMENT ANTICIPATES MEETING THE REQUIRED VOLUMES.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  \\u2013  WE EXPECT OUR CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, EXCLUSIVE OF CAPITAL REQUIRED FOR POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS, WILL BE WITHIN OUR HISTORICAL LEVELS OF BETWEEN $3.0 MILLION AND $5.0 MILLION.  TO DATE WE HAVE SPENT APPROXIMATELY $2.7 MILLION ON CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  WE EXPECT TO FUND THESE EXPENDITURES THROUGH EXISTING CASH FLOWS.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS & OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  \\u2013  THERE HAVE BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS SINCE FEBRUARY 28, 2019 THAT HAVE, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FOR THE 13 AND 39 WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, AS COMPARED TO THE 13 AND 39 WEEKS ENDED DECEMBER 1, 2018, SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q IN ITEM 1  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  . IN ADDITION, THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF MARCH 2, 2019, AND FOR THE FISCAL YEAR THEN ENDED, THE RELATED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ALL CONTAINED IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010K OF PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 2, 2019.  MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW  PIER 1 IMPORTS, INC. (TOGETHER WITH ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, THE \\u201cCOMPANY\\u201d) DIRECTLY IMPORTS MERCHANDISE FROM MANY COUNTRIES, AND SELLS A WIDE VARIETY OF DECORATIVE ACCESSORIES, FURNITURE, CANDLES, HOUSEWARES, GIFTS AND SEASONAL PRODUCTS IN RETAIL STORES THROUGHOUT THE U.S. AND CANADA AND ONLINE AT PIER1.COM. THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS AS ONE OPERATING SEGMENT. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, THE COMPANY OPERATED 942 STORES IN THE U.S. AND CANADA. THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE 13 AND 39 WEEKS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 1, 2018, ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF RESULTS TO BE EXPECTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BECAUSE OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SEASONALITY FACTORS IN THE RETAIL BUSINESS. HISTORICALLY, THE STRONGEST SALES OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRODUCTS HAVE OCCURRED DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER AND CONTINUING THROUGH DECEMBER.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, NET SALES DECREASED 13.3% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR THIRD QUARTER AND COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES DECREASED 11.4% COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019; THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE SHIFT OF CERTAIN HOLIDAY SELLING DAYS, WHICH WERE INCLUDED IN LAST YEAR\\u2019S FISCAL THIRD QUARTER, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 650 BASIS POINTS. THE IMPACT OF THIS TIMING SHIFT IS EXPECTED TO REVERSE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.  THE DECLINE IN COMPANY COMPARABLE SALES WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT OF LOWER TRAFFIC. GROSS PROFIT FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WAS $110.3 MILLION, OR 30.8% OF SALES, COMPARED TO $130.5 MILLION, OR 31.6% OF SALES, IN THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, A DECREASE OF 80 BASIS POINTS. THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT AS A PERCENTAGE OF SALES PRIMARILY REFLECTED INCREASED PROMOTIONAL AND CLEARANCE ACTIVITY COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AS WELL AS 190 BASIS POINTS OF DELEVERAGE IN STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS DUE TO LOWER SALES. THE COMPANY REMAINS ON TRACK TO REALIZE APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION OF SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201cSG&A\\u201d) COST CUTTING INITIATIVES FOR FISCAL 2020, BUT CONTINUES TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL TRANSFORMATION AND ADVISORY COSTS, WHICH REDUCED THE BOTTOM-LINE BENEFIT OF THE PROGRESS MADE IN COST CUTTING DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.

GIVEN THE COMPANY\\u2019S CURRENT CASH POSITION, EXPECTED OPERATING CASH FLOWS AND BORROWINGS AVAILABLE UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT REGARDING ITS ABILITY TO HAVE SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO FUND ITS OBLIGATIONS AND WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS THROUGH THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY IS TAKING A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO SUPPORT ITS ONGOING TRANSFORMATION INCLUDING COST CUTTING, LOWERING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, SEEKING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND REDUCING ITS STORE FOOTPRINT INCLUDING RELATED DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND CORPORATE HEADQUARTER SUPPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY AS THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COMPLETION OR SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED ABOVE WOULD ALLEVIATE OR ELIMINATE THE SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT. HOWEVER, AS THE ACTIONS ABOVE HAVE NOT BEEN FINALIZED OR FULLY EXECUTED AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THEY CANNOT BE DEEMED PROBABLE OF MITIGATING SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT. ACCORDINGLY, SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT IS DEEMED TO EXIST ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IF THE COMPANY\\u2019S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM INCLUDES A QUALIFICATION OR EXCEPTION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IN ITS AUDIT REPORT AND OPINION REGARDING THE COMPANY\\u2019S ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WITHOUT AN AMENDMENT FROM ITS LENDERS, AN EVENT OF DEFAULT UNDER EXISTING DEBT AGREEMENTS WOULD BE TRIGGERED.  IMPACT OF INFLATION  INFLATION HAS NOT HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY\\u2019S MANAGEMENT CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF THE EFFECT INFLATION MAY HAVE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.  21\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"PIER 1 IMPORTS INC/DE\", \"CIK\": 278130, \"Date\": \"2020-01-06T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"PIR\", \"Name\": \"Pier 1 Imports Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NYSE\", \"SIC\": 5700.0, \"Business\": \"TX\", \"Incorporated\": \"DE\", \"IRS\": 751729843.0, \"key\": \"20200106PIR\", \"labelr1\": -8.59903381642511, \"labelr2\": -17.970401691331933, \"labelr3\": -3.092783505154642, \"labelr4\": -6.9148936170212725, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.61726457, \"prof1\": 0.38273543, \"return1&2\": 1.281147164261421, \"return1&2&3\": 1.3207702724344548, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.412100131698539, \"return2\": 1.1797040169133193, \"return1\": 1.085990338164251, \"return3\": 1.0309278350515465, \"return4\": 1.069148936170213, \"1_day_return\": -8.599033816425106, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.2463911090262204, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3547, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9474578587524283, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9406974547768474, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.9825951619414509, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9936552740678004, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9901235560436701}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3549, \"level_0\": 3642, \"index\": 48380, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, PERPETUAL LICENSE SALES ARE LESS PREDICTABLE, FROM A TIMING STANDPOINT, THAN OTHER SOLUTIONS SOLD BY THE COMPANY.   THIS DECREASE FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LARGE PERPETUAL LICENSE SALE OF OUR ABSTRACTINGTM SOLUTION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO INFLUENCE SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, THE TIMING CAN BE DIFFICULT TO MANAGE AS SALES RESULT FROM OUR DISTRIBUTION PARTNERS OR, FROM EXISTING CUSTOMERS ADDING LICENSES.  ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE LESS CONTROL OVER THE TIMING OF CONTRACT CLOSE FOR PERPETUAL LICENSES. TERM LICENSE REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $231,000 AND $370,000, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS DUE TO LOST CUSTOMERS.  HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE  \\u2014 REVENUE FROM HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE SALES FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $46,000 AND $104,000, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FLUCTUATIONS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD ARE A FUNCTION OF CLIENT DEMAND FOR ANCILLARY SCANNERS AND COPIERS SUPPORTING THE COMPANY\\u2019S ECM BUSINESS.  PROFESSIONAL SERVICES  \\u2014 FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019, REVENUES FROM PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCREASED BY $49,000 AND $529,000, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS. THIS INCREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF COMPLETION OF A SEVERAL, LARGE, PROFESSIONAL SERVICES AGREEMENTS.   THE COMPANY HAD PREVIOUSLY RE-ASSIGNED CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL STAFF TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESS OF EVALUATOR.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO RETURN THESE STAFF TO BILLABLE PROJECTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, RESULTING IN HIGHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD.  AUDIT SERVICES  \\u2014 AUDIT SERVICES REVENUE FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $283,000 AND $425,000, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS.  THE COMPANY REALIZED HIGHER DEMAND FOR AUDIT SERVICES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2018, AND THAT HIGHER DEMAND HAS CONTINUED THROUGH THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2019.   THE COMPANY\\u2019S EXPERTISE, DEMONSTRATED AND SUPPORTED BY EVALUATOR, AND THE FACT THAT OUR PROFESSIONAL STAFF IS ONSHORE IS BELIEVED TO BE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE WITH REGARD TO THE AUDIT SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPECT HIGHER VOLUMES OF AUDIT SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 2019.  MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT  \\u2014  REVENUE FROM MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $224,000 AND $1,040,000, RESPECTIVELY, OVER THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICING PRESSURE AND CANCELLATIONS BY CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OF OUR LEGACY PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY ENTERPRISE  CONTENT MANAGEMENT (  ECM). THE CUSTOMER PRICING DIFFERENCE AND  RATE OF CUSTOMER CANCELLATIONS HAS NOT EXCEEDED THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE COMPANY HAS WORKED THE LAST 18 MONTHS TO NEGOTIATE MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENTS ON THE MAJORITY OF ITS CURRENT MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS COMPRISING ITS CURRENT, LEGACY REVENUE BASE. THIS HAS HAD THE IMPACT OF LOWERING REVENUES IN EXCHANGE FOR LONGER, SUSTAINED REVENUE. THE LOWER QUARTERLY REVENUES, AS COMPARED TO QUARTERLY REVENUES IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2019.  SOFTWARE AS A SERVICE (SAAS)  \\u2014 REVENUE FROM SAAS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 DECREASED BY $48,000 AND $96,000, RESPECTIVELY FROM THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS. THIS DECREASE RESULTED FROM CANCELLATIONS BY A FEW CUSTOMERS OF OUR LEGACY PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY OUR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE. THE GROWTH IN EVALUATOR REVENUE OVERCAME A PORTION OF THE REVENUE LOSS FROM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY IS EXPECTING NET REVENUE GROWTH AS EVALUATOR IS EXPECTED TO OVERCOME ANY LOSS OF REVENUE FROM FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.   THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE RECENT BOOKINGS OF EVALUATOR TO POSITIVELY IMPACT REVENUE INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020.  COST OF SALES  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS).

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, THE COMPANY HAS LOWER DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION DUE TO CERTAIN ASSETS BEING FULLY AMORTIZED AND IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS FROM PREVIOUS QUARTERS. FURTHER, FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE COMPANY HAD A NET REDUCTION IN CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AMORTIZATION EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $214,000 RELATED TO A CORRECTION OF AN IMMATERIAL ERROR (SEE NOTE 2).  COST OF SYSTEM SALES INCLUDES AMORTIZATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE EXPENDITURES AND THE COST OF THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS AS A RESULT OF ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED, INCLUDING OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE.  THE COST OF PROFESSIONAL SERVICES INCLUDES COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR PERSONNEL AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS FROM THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RELATED TO SAAS IMPLEMENTATIONS, FOR WHICH COSTS ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED RATABLY OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SAAS CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP.  THE COMPANY IS BENEFITING FROM THE EFFORT REQUIRED TO IMPLEMENT SAAS RELATED ENGAGEMENTS AS COMPARED TO THE LEGACY ON-PREMISE SOFTWARE IMPLEMENTATIONS. ON-PREMISE IMPLEMENTATIONS, AS WAS THE CASE WITH LEGACY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IMPLEMENTATIONS, TOOK LONGER AND INVOLVED MORE COST.  THE COST OF AUDIT SERVICES INCLUDES COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR AUDIT SERVICES PERSONNEL, AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS RELATED TO THE INCREASED VOLUMES (AND INCREASED REVENUE) FROM THE COMPARABLE PERIOD A YEAR AGO.   THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR THE NINE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE REDUCTION IN PERSONNEL.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S AUDIT SERVICES PERSONNEL UTILIZE EVALUATOR AND IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE PRODUCT MAKES THEM MORE PRODUCTIVE AND EFFICIENT.  THE COST OF MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT INCLUDES COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR CLIENT SUPPORT PERSONNEL AND THE COST OF THIRD-PARTY MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS. THE DECREASE IN EXPENSE FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN PERSONNEL COSTS AND A REDUCTION IN THIRD-PARTY MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS.  THE LOWER COST ASSOCIATED WITH THESE REDUCTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, AND BEYOND.  THE COST OF SAAS SOLUTIONS IS RELATIVELY FIXED, SUBJECT TO INFLATION FOR THE GOODS AND SERVICES IT REQUIRES. THE EXPENSE FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER, AS A RESULT OF HIGHER AMORTIZATION COST OF CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, AS COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS PERIODS. THIS IS A DIFFERENT TREND FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AMORTIZATION TRENDS OVERALL, AND FOR THE COMPANY\\u2019S OTHER PRODUCT CATEGORIES.  THE HIGHER AMORTIZATION FOR THE COMPANY\\u2019S SAAS PRODUCTS (THE DIFFERENT TREND) IS A RESULT OF THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT THAT THE COMPANY IS PUTTING INTO ITS NEWEST PRODUCT, EVALUATOR.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  THREE MONTHS ENDED  (IN THOUSANDS).

THE DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 FROM THE COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO A REDUCTION IN FACILITY COSTS, BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO REALIZE A BENEFIT FROM LOWER FACILITY COSTS AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, HOWEVER, SOME OF THOSE SAVINGS WERE ABSORBED BY HIGHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION, COSTS FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES (FINANCIAL AND LEGAL), AND CERTAIN TRANSACTION COSTS.  WE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THE COMPANY\\u2019S REDUCTION IN FACILITY COSTS DUE TO RELOCATION OF THE CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND SUBLEASING OF THE NEW YORK CITY OFFICE.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO SEE LESS OF THIS BENEFIT IN COMPARISON TO PRIOR YEARS, AS THE COSTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR WERE BEGINNING TO BE REALIZED, AND THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPECT HIGHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND PROFESSIONAL COSTS THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL YEAR 2019.  SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COMPENSATION AND RELATED BENEFITS AND REIMBURSABLE TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES RELATED TO OUR SALES AND MARKETING STAFF, AS WELL AS ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES, INCLUDING TRADE SHOWS. THE INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE SEVERAL FACTORS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED BY THE COMPANY, INCLUDING (I) THE APPOINTMENT OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S CHIEF REVENUE OFFICER, A SENIOR-LEVEL SALES OPERATIONS LEADER, AND ADDITIONAL MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ADVISORY BOARD, , (II) PAYMENTS TO SALES AGENTS, AND (III) COSTS RELATED TO THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPOINTMENTS REFERENCED IN (I), EACH OF WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES NOT INCURRED IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE COMPANY HAS RE-FOCUSED ITS SALES AND MARKETING DOLLARS.  THE TARGETED AND FOCUSED APPROACH HAS RESULTED IN DOLLARS THAT HAVE A HIGHER RETURN. HIGHER LEVELS OF SALES AND MARKETING COSTS SHOULD BE EXPECTED AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD VELOCITY DRIVEN, ENTREPRENEURIAL GROWTH TRAJECTORY.

TOTAL RESEARCH AND  26  TABLE OF CONTENTS  DEVELOPMENT COST FOR THE THREE- AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT FROM THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIODS.  THE COMPANY HAS STARTED AN INITIATIVE TO REDUCE ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS IT FOCUSES ON THE MIDDLE OF THE REVENUE CYCLE PRODUCTS, AND NO LONGER FOCUSES ON CERTAIN LEGACY PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE NEED FOR A FLATTER ORGANIZATION WITHIN ENGINEERING AND TO INCREASE VELOCITY AND VALUE IN THE CORE PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE COMPANY.  THE COMPANY IS SPENDING FEWER DOLLARS ON MAINTENANCE FOR ITS LEGACY PRODUCTS FROM ITS ENGINEERING GROUP AS THESE PRODUCTS HAVE ATTAINED MATURITY IN THE MARKETPLACE. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE 32% AND 33%, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF VACATING AND SUBLEASING THE OFFICE, WE RECORDED A $1,368,000 LOSS ON EXIT OF THE OPERATING LEASE IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2018, WHICH CAPTURES THE NET CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VACATED PREMISES, INCLUDING RECEIPTS OF RENT FROM OUR SUBLESSEE, AND THE LOSS INCURRED ON THE DISPOSALS OF FIXED ASSETS.

INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 FROM THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN CAPITALIZED INTEREST ON OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED SOFTWARE. THE HIGHER MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE FOR THE THREE AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF A ONE-TIME FINANCE COST ASSOCIATED WITH OUR WORK TO REFINANCE THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEBT ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COMPANY INCURRED COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE REFINANCING OF THE DEBT ARRANGEMENTS, AS WELL AS ONGOING COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH ITS EXISTING DEBT ARRANGEMENTS.  THE COSTS INCLUDE CONSULTING, LEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF THE LENDER ASSOCIATED WITH THE REFINANCING.  ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE VALUATION ADJUSTMENT TO THE MONTEFIORE LIABILITY (SEE NOTE 7 TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THROUGH MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSE.  PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  WE RECORDED TAX EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 OF $12,000 AND $2,000 RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 WE RECORDED TAX EXPENSE OF $16,000 AND $5,000, RESPECTIVELY. TAX EXPENSE IS COMPRISED OF ESTIMATED FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT NET OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE A FEDERAL TAX PAYER IN FISCAL YEAR 2019.  USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH GREATER INSIGHT, AND ALLOW FOR A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE INFORMATION USED BY MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ITS FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL DECISION-MAKING, THE COMPANY HAS SUPPLEMENTED THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED ON A GAAP BASIS IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010Q WITH THE FOLLOWING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES: EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE.  THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF COMPANY RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP. THE COMPANY COMPENSATES FOR SUCH LIMITATIONS BY RELYING PRIMARILY ON OUR GAAP RESULTS AND USING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES ONLY AS SUPPLEMENTAL DATA. WE ALSO PROVIDE A RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP TO GAAP MEASURES USED. INVESTORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THIS RECONCILIATION. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE UNDER GAAP AND ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARYING CALCULATIONS, THESE MEASURES, AS DEFINED BY US, MAY DIFFER FROM AND MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE  WE DEFINE: (I) EBITDA AS NET EARNINGS (LOSS) BEFORE NET INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION; (II) ADJUSTED EBITDA AS NET EARNINGS (LOSS) BEFORE NET INTEREST EXPENSE, INCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT), DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT DO NOT RELATE TO OUR CORE OPERATIONS; (III) ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN AS ADJUSTED EBITDA AS A PERCENTAGE OF GAAP NET REVENUE; AND (IV) ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE AS ADJUSTED EBITDA DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING. EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN AND ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE ARE USED TO FACILITATE A COMPARISON OF OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE ON A CONSISTENT BASIS FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD AND PROVIDE FOR A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING OUR BUSINESS THAN GAAP MEASURES ALONE. THESE MEASURES ASSIST MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD AND MAY BE USEFUL TO INVESTORS IN COMPARING OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE CONSISTENTLY OVER TIME AS THEY REMOVE THE IMPACT OF OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE (PRIMARILY INTEREST CHARGES), ASSET BASE (PRIMARILY DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION), ITEMS OUTSIDE THE CONTROL OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM (TAXES), AND EXPENSES THAT DO NOT RELATE TO OUR CORE OPERATIONS, INCLUDING TRANSACTION-RELATED EXPENSES (SUCH AS PROFESSIONAL AND ADVISORY SERVICES) AND OTHER COSTS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE NON-RECURRING. ADJUSTED EBITDA REMOVES THE IMPACT OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE NON-CASH ITEMS. ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE INCLUDES INCREMENTAL SHARES IN THE SHARE COUNT THAT ARE CONSIDERED ANTI-DILUTIVE IN A GAAP NET LOSS POSITION.  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT ALSO USE THESE MEASURES AS (I) ONE OF THE PRIMARY METHODS FOR PLANNING AND FORECASTING OVERALL EXPECTATIONS AND FOR EVALUATING, ON AT LEAST A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS, ACTUAL RESULTS AGAINST SUCH  28  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EXPECTATIONS; AND (II) AS A PERFORMANCE EVALUATION METRIC IN DETERMINING ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN EXECUTIVE AND ASSOCIATE INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.  OUR LENDER USES A MEASUREMENT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA MEASUREMENT DESCRIBED HEREIN TO ASSESS OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE LENDER UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES DELIVERY OF COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATES CERTIFYING COMPLIANCE WITH FINANCIAL COVENANTS, CERTAIN OF WHICH ARE BASED ON A MEASUREMENT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE ADJUSTED EBITDA MEASUREMENT REVIEWED BY OUR MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS.  EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN ARE NOT MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY UNDER GAAP, OR OTHERWISE, AND ARE NOT ALTERNATIVES TO CASH FLOW FROM CONTINUING OPERATING ACTIVITIES, DESPITE THE ADVANTAGES REGARDING THE USE AND ANALYSIS OF THESE MEASURES AS MENTIONED ABOVE. EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010Q, HAVE LIMITATIONS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS, AND YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER THESE MEASURES IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR ANALYSIS OF OUR RESULTS AS REPORTED UNDER GAAP; NOR ARE THESE MEASURES INTENDED TO BE MEASURES OF LIQUIDITY OR FREE CASH FLOW FOR OUR DISCRETIONARY USE. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF EBITDA, AND ITS VARIATIONS ARE.  \\u00b7  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT OUR CASH EXPENDITURES OR FUTURE REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS;  \\u00b7  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT CHANGES IN, OR CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR, OUR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS;  \\u00b7  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT THE INTEREST EXPENSE, OR THE CASH REQUIREMENTS TO SERVICE INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS UNDER OUR CREDIT AGREEMENT;  \\u00b7  EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT INCOME TAX PAYMENTS THAT WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE; AND  \\u00b7  ALTHOUGH DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ARE NON-CASH CHARGES, THE ASSETS BEING DEPRECIATED AND AMORTIZED OFTEN WILL HAVE TO BE REPLACED IN THE FUTURE, AND EBITDA DOES NOT REFLECT ANY CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH REPLACEMENTS.  ADJUSTED EBITDA HAS ALL THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF EBITDA. TO PROPERLY AND PRUDENTLY EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS, WE ENCOURAGE READERS TO REVIEW THE GAAP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010Q, AND NOT RELY ON ANY SINGLE FINANCIAL MEASURE TO EVALUATE OUR BUSINESS. WE ALSO STRONGLY URGE READERS TO REVIEW THE RECONCILIATION OF THESE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE IN THIS SECTION, ALONG WITH THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010Q.  THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH A RECONCILIATION OF EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA TO NET LOSS, THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP-BASED MEASURE, AS WELL AS ADJUSTED EBITDA PER DILUTED SHARE TO NET LOSS PER DILUTED SHARE. ALL OF THE ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE RECONCILIATION FROM EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA TO LOSS AND THE RELATED PER SHARE CALCULATIONS ARE EITHER RECURRING NON-CASH ITEMS, OR ITEMS THAT MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CONSIDER IN ASSESSING OUR ON-GOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN THE CASE OF THE NON-CASH ITEMS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO ASSESS OUR COMPARATIVE OPERATING PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE MEASURES WITHOUT SUCH ITEMS ARE LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO VARIANCES IN ACTUAL PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND OTHER EXPENSES THAT DO NOT RELATE TO OUR CORE OPERATIONS AND ARE MORE REFLECTIVE OF OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT OPERATING PERFORMANCE. IN THE CASE OF ITEMS THAT DO NOT RELATE TO OUR CORE  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OPERATIONS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT INVESTORS MAY FIND IT USEFUL TO ASSESS OUR OPERATING PERFORMANCE IF THE MEASURES ARE PRESENTED WITHOUT THESE ITEMS BECAUSE THEIR FINANCIAL IMPACT DOES NOT REFLECT ONGOING OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

IF A GAAP PROFIT IS EARNED IN THE REPORTED PERIODS, NO ADDITIONAL INCREMENTAL SHARES ARE ASSUMED.  APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GAAP REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNT OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS AN ACCOUNTING POLICY TO BE CRITICAL IF THE ACCOUNTING POLICY REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. A SUMMARY OF OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 2 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCLOSED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10\\u2010K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JANUARY 31, 2019, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 2, CORRECTION OF IMMATERIAL ERRORS, AND BELOW.  WE ADOPTED ASC 842 ON FEBRUARY 1, 2019 USING THE EFFECTIVE DATE TRANSITION METHOD. THIS METHOD REQUIRES US TO RECOGNIZE AN ADOPTION IMPACT AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE FEBRUARY 1, 2019 RETAINED EARNINGS BALANCE. PRIOR PERIOD BALANCES WERE NOT ADJUSTED UPON ADOPTION THIS STANDARD. THE STANDARD REQUIRES THAT LEASED ASSETS AND  30  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES BE RECOGNIZED WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS RIGHT-TO-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING OR FINANCING LEASE LIABILITIES. PLEASE REFER TO NOTE 3, \\u201cLEASES\\u201d, TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10\\u2010Q FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  OUR LIQUIDITY IS DEPENDENT UPON NUMEROUS FACTORS INCLUDING: (I) THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUES AND COLLECTION OF CONTRACTUAL AMOUNTS FROM CLIENTS, (II) AMOUNTS INVESTED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND (III) THE LEVEL OF OPERATING EXPENSES, ALL OF WHICH CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER-TO-QUARTER. OUR PRIMARY CASH REQUIREMENTS INCLUDE REGULAR PAYMENT OF PAYROLL AND OTHER BUSINESS EXPENSES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON DEBT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES GENERALLY INCLUDE COMPUTER HARDWARE AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO SUPPORT INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OR INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE SAAS DATA CENTER. OPERATIONS ARE FUNDED WITH CASH GENERATED BY OPERATIONS AND BORROWINGS UNDER OUR CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS ARE ADEQUATE TO FUND CURRENT OBLIGATIONS FOR THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AT OCTOBER 31, 2019 AND JANUARY 31, 2019 WERE $1,220,000 AND $2,376,000, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CASH DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL PERIOD IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF NORMAL SEASONALITY ON THE TIMING OF OUR LARGE MAINTENANCE INVOICES THAT ARE INVOICED TO CUSTOMERS AND PAID IN THE FOURTH QUARTER EVERY YEAR.  SEE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION BELOW.  THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO RAISE THE CAPITAL REQUIRED TO FUND FURTHER EXPANSION.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9, IN CONNECTION WITH ENTERING INTO THE LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 11, 2019, AND REPAID ALL OUTSTANDING AMOUNTS DUE THEREUNDER. PRIOR TO ITS TERMINATION, THE COMPANY HAD LIQUIDITY THROUGH THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED HEREIN. IN ORDER TO DRAW UPON THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT, THE COMPANY\\u2019S PRIMARY OPERATING SUBSIDIARY WAS REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH CUSTOMARY INFORMATION DELIVERY AND FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF AT LEAST $1,000,000. THE CREDIT AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE COMPANY ACHIEVE CERTAIN MINIMUM EBITDA LEVELS, CALCULATED PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT AGREEMENT AND MEASURED, AT ALL TIMES PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT, ON A QUARTER-END BASIS, OF AT LEAST THE REQUIRED AMOUNTS IN THE RELEVANT TABLE SET FORTH IN NOTE 4 TO OUR CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 HEREIN FOR THE APPLICABLE PERIOD SET FORTH THEREIN.  THE COMPANY HAS CONTINUING LIQUIDITY THROUGH ITS NEW LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON DECEMBER 11, 2019 WITH BRIDGE BANK, A DIVISION OF WESTERN ALLIANCE BANK, CONSISTING OF A $4,000,000 NEW TERM LOAN AND A $2,000,000 NEW REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, SEE NOTE 9. THE PROCEEDS FROM THE TERM LOAN WERE USED TO REPAY ALL OUTSTANDING BALANCES UNDER ITS EXISTING TERM LOAN WITH WELLS FARGO BANK. AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE NEW TERM LOAN SHALL BEAR INTEREST AT PER ANNUM RATE EQUAL TO THE HIGHER OF (A) THE PRIME RATE (AS PUBLISHED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) PLUS 1.50% OR (B) 6.50%. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT THE COMPANY SHALL MAKE INTEREST-ONLY PAYMENTS THROUGH THE TWELVE-MONTH ANNIVERSARY DATE AFTER WHICH THE COMPANY SHALL REPAY THE NEW TERM LOAN IN THIRTY-SIX EQUAL AND CONSECUTIVE INSTALLMENTS OF PRINCIPAL, PLUS MONTHLY PAYMENTS OF ACCRUED INTEREST.  THE NEW REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS A MATURITY DATE OF TWENTY-FOUR MONTHS AND ADVANCES SHALL BEAR INTEREST AT A PER ANNUM RATE EQUAL TO THE HIGHER OF (A) THE PRIME RATE (AS PUBLISHED IN THE WALL STREET JOURNAL) PLUS 1.25% OR (B) 6.25%. THE REVOLVING LINE OF CREDIT FACILITY CAN BE ADVANCED BASED UPON 80% OF ELIGIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, AS DEFINED IN THE LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT.  THE LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, INCLUDES FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL COVENANTS, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS THAT THE COMPANY SHALL NOT DEVIATE BY MORE THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT ITS REVENUE PROJECTIONS OVER A TRAILING THREE-MONTH BASIS OR THE COMPANY\\u2019S RECURRING REVENUE SHALL NOT DEVIATE BY MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OVER A CUMULATIVE YEAR-TO-DATE BASIS OF ITS REVENUE PROJECTIONS. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING ON DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE COMPANY\\u2019S ADJUSTED EBITDA, MEASURED ON A MONTHLY BASIS OVER A TRAILING THREE-MONTH PERIOD THEN ENDED, SHALL NOT DEVIATE BY THE GREATER OF THIRTY PERCENT ITS PROJECTED ADJUSTED EBITDA OR $150,000. THE AGREEMENT ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO.  THE ASSET COVERAGE RATIO IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE RATIO OF UNRESTRICTED CASH PLUS CERTAIN ACCOUNTS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE THE COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS DIVIDED BY ALL OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS TO THE BANK. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE NEW LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE  31  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RATIO OF AT LEAST 0.75 TO 1.00 FROM DECEMBER 31, 2019 THROUGH NOVEMBER 30, 2020 AND A MINIMUM ASSET COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST 1.50 TO 1.00 EACH MONTH THEREAFTER.  THE COMPANY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ITS APPLICABLE LOAN COVENANTS AT OCTOBER 31, 2019. AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, THERE WERE NO OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER ITS LINE OF CREDIT.  UPON CLOSING AND FUNDING OF THE SALE OF THE ECM BUSINESS (SEE BELOW), THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO REPAY THE TERM LOAN; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY.  THE COMPANY HAS CLASSIFIED THE PRIOR TERM LOAN FROM WELLS FARGO, AS CURRENT AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2019, BECAUSE OF ITS INTENT AND ABILITY TO REPAY THE REPLACEMENT TERM LOAN, IN FULL, ON OR BEFORE, A TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD EXTENDING FROM THE OCTOBER 31, 2019 BALANCE SHEET DATE.  AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9, THE COMPANY SIGNED A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO SELL ITS LEGACY ECM BUSINESS TO AND PLANS TO USE THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE TO PAY OFF ITS TERM LOAN WITH BRIDGE BANK AND TO FUND THE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT AND INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT IN SALES AND MARKETING IN SUPPORT OF ITS EVALUATORTM CLOUD-BASED PRE- AND POST-BILL CODING ANALYSIS PLATFORM.  THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE APPROVAL OF THE TRANSACTION BY STREAMLINE HEALTH\\u2019S STOCKHOLDERS, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE TRANSACTION TO CLOSE NO LATER THAN MARCH 31, 2020 AND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE $9.6 MILLION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AFTER REPAYING ITS TERM LOAN AND TRANSACTION FEES.

ACCRUED EXPENSES ARE LOWER BY APPROXIMATELY $400,000 IN OCTOBER 2019 COMPARED WITH END OF FISCAL YEAR 2018.  THIS REFLECTS THE PAYMENTS OF THE LEASE OBLIGATIONS, AS WELL AS, CERTAIN OTHER COMMITMENTS.  OUR TYPICAL CLIENTS ARE WELL-ESTABLISHED HOSPITALS, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND MAJOR HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM COMPANIES THAT RESELL OUR SOLUTIONS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE HAD GOOD CREDIT AND PAYMENT HISTORIES FOR THE INDUSTRY. HOWEVER, SOME HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES AS A RESULT OF LIMITS ON THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENTS FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES AND GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES. AGREEMENTS WITH CLIENTS OFTEN INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AND CONTRACT TERMS TYPICALLY REQUIRE CLIENTS TO MAKE PROGRESS PAYMENTS. ADVERSE ECONOMIC EVENTS, AS WELL AS UNCERTAINTY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY FOR SOME OF OUR CLIENTS.  32  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE COMPANY HAS LARGE MAINTENANCE CONTRACTS THAT RENEW IN ITS FOURTH QUARTER EACH YEAR.  THE USE OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS HAS BEEN A HISTORICAL TREND, THAT HAS CONTINUED FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THESE MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS TO BE INVOICED AND COLLECTED SIMILARLY TO YEARS PAST, AND, ACCORDINGLY, THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, IS EXPECTED TO SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL CASH INFLOW.

MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THIS SECTION INCLUDES A DISCUSSION OF OUR OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS PROVIDES INFORMATION WHICH MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IS RELEVANT TO AN ASSESSMENT AND UNDERSTANDING OF OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, AND THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  GENERAL  FOUNDED IN 1906, SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. (\\u201cSSI\\u201d), AN OREGON CORPORATION, IS ONE OF NORTH AMERICA\\u2019S LARGEST RECYCLERS OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS SCRAP METAL, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AND A MANUFACTURER OF FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS.  OUR INTERNAL ORGANIZATIONAL AND REPORTING STRUCTURE INCLUDES TWO OPERATING AND REPORTABLE SEGMENTS: THE AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING (\\u201cAMR\\u201d) BUSINESS AND THE CASCADE STEEL AND SCRAP (\\u201cCSS\\u201d) BUSINESS.  AMR SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL IN BOTH FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS. AMR ACQUIRES, PROCESSES AND RECYCLES AUTO BODIES, RAIL CARS, HOME APPLIANCES, INDUSTRIAL MACHINERY, MANUFACTURING SCRAP AND CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION SCRAP THROUGH  ITS 90  AUTO AND METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES. OUR LARGEST SOURCE OF AUTO BODIES IS OUR OWN NETWORK OF RETAIL AUTO PARTS STORES, WHICH OPERATE UNDER THE COMMERCIAL BRAND-NAME PICK-N-PULL. AMR PROCURES SALVAGED VEHICLES AND SELLS SERVICEABLE USED AUTO PARTS FROM THESE VEHICLES THROUGH ITS  51  SELF-SERVICE AUTO PARTS STORES LOCATED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND WESTERN CANADA. UPON ACQUIRING A SALVAGED VEHICLE, WE REMOVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS, ALUMINUM WHEELS AND BATTERIES FOR SEPARATE PROCESSING AND SALE PRIOR TO PLACING THE VEHICLE IN OUR RETAIL LOT. AFTER RETAIL CUSTOMERS HAVE REMOVED DESIRED PARTS FROM A VEHICLE, WE MAY REMOVE REMAINING MAJOR COMPONENT PARTS CONTAINING FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY SOLD TO WHOLESALERS. THE REMAINING AUTO BODIES ARE CRUSHED AND SHIPPED TO OUR METALS RECYCLING FACILITIES TO BE SHREDDED OR SOLD TO THIRD PARTIES WHERE GEOGRAPHICALLY MORE ECONOMICAL. AMR THEN PROCESSES MIXED AND LARGE PIECES OF SCRAP METAL INTO SMALLER PIECES BY CRUSHING, TORCHING, SHEARING, SHREDDING AND SORTING, RESULTING IN SCRAP METAL PIECES OF A SIZE, DENSITY AND METAL CONTENT REQUIRED BY CUSTOMERS TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION NEEDS. THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS INCLUDES PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF FERROUS AND NONFERROUS MATERIALS THROUGH AUTOMATED AND MANUAL PROCESSES INTO VARIOUS SUB-CLASSIFICATIONS, EACH OF WHICH HAS A VALUE AND METAL CONTENT USED BY OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THEIR END PRODUCTS. AMR USES A VARIETY OF SHREDDING AND SEPARATION SYSTEMS TO EFFICIENTLY PROCESS AND SORT RECYCLED SCRAP METAL.  CSS OPERATES A STEEL MINI-MILL IN MCMINNVILLE, OREGON THAT PRODUCES A RANGE OF FINISHED STEEL LONG PRODUCTS SUCH AS REINFORCING BAR (REBAR) AND WIRE ROD. THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF ITS PRODUCTS IS FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL. CSS\\u2019S STEEL MILL OBTAINS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS SCRAP METAL RAW MATERIAL REQUIREMENTS FROM ITS INTEGRATED METALS RECYCLING AND JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS. CSS\\u2019S METALS RECYCLING OPERATIONS COMPRISE A COLLECTION, SHREDDING AND EXPORT OPERATION IN PORTLAND, OREGON, FOUR FEEDER YARD OPERATIONS LOCATED IN OREGON AND SOUTHERN WASHINGTON, AND ONE METALS RECYCLING JOINT VENTURE OWNERSHIP INTEREST. ADDITIONALLY, CSS PURCHASES SMALL VOLUMES OF FERROUS SCRAP METAL FROM AMR AND SELLS FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL PRIMARILY INTO THE EXPORT MARKET.  WE USE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO MEASURE OUR SEGMENT PERFORMANCE. WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CORPORATE INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES AND OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE TO OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO SHARED SERVICES THAT SUPPORT OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND TRANSACTIONS ARE ALLOCATED FROM CORPORATE TO THE SEGMENTS. UNALLOCATED CORPORATE EXPENSE CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF EXPENSE FOR MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES THAT BENEFIT BOTH REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DO NOT ALLOCATE CERTAIN ITEMS TO SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BECAUSE MANAGEMENT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE INFORMATION IN ITS MEASUREMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. SUCH UNALLOCATED ITEMS INCLUDE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES, CHARGES (NET OF RECOVERIES) RELATED TO LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, AND PROVISIONS FOR CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS. BECAUSE OF THE UNALLOCATED INCOME AND EXPENSE, THE OPERATING INCOME OF EACH REPORTABLE SEGMENT DOES NOT REFLECT THE OPERATING INCOME THE REPORTABLE SEGMENT WOULD REPORT AS A STAND-ALONE BUSINESS. THE RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY, NET OF TAX, FROM THE RESULTS OF ONGOING OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, SEE NOTE 13 - SEGMENT INFORMATION IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS DEPEND IN LARGE PART ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR RECYCLED METAL IN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC MARKETS AND ON THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS, INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, AVAILABLE TO BE PROCESSED AT OUR FACILITIES. WE RESPOND TO CHANGES IN SELLING PRICES FOR PROCESSED METAL BY SEEKING TO ADJUST PURCHASE PRICES FOR UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL IN ORDER TO MANAGE THE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATING INCOME. WE BELIEVE WE GENERALLY BENEFIT FROM SUSTAINED PERIODS OF STABLE OR RISING RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES, WHICH ALLOW US TO BETTER MAINTAIN OR INCREASE BOTH OPERATING INCOME AND UNPROCESSED SCRAP METAL FLOW INTO OUR FACILITIES. WHEN RECYCLED SCRAP METAL SELLING PRICES DECLINE, EITHER SHARPLY OR FOR A SUSTAINED PERIOD, OUR OPERATING MARGINS TYPICALLY COMPRESS.  25  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  OUR DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES ON BOTH THE EAST AND WEST COASTS OF THE U.S. (IN EVERETT, MASSACHUSETTS; PROVIDENCE, RHODE ISLAND; OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA; TACOMA, WASHINGTON; AND PORTLAND, OREGON) AND ACCESS TO PUBLIC DEEP WATER PORT FACILITIES (IN KAPOLEI, HAWAII AND SALINAS, PUERTO RICO) ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY MEET THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR RECYCLED FERROUS METAL BY ENABLING US TO SHIP BULK CARGOES TO STEEL MANUFACTURERS LOCATED IN EUROPE, AFRICA, THE MIDDLE EAST, ASIA, NORTH AMERICA, CENTRAL AMERICA AND SOUTH AMERICA. OUR EXPORTS OF NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL ARE SHIPPED IN CONTAINERS THROUGH VARIOUS PUBLIC DOCKS TO SPECIALTY STEELMAKERS, FOUNDRIES, ALUMINUM SHEET AND INGOT MANUFACTURERS, COPPER REFINERIES AND SMELTERS, BRASS AND BRONZE INGOT MANUFACTURERS, WIRE AND CABLE PRODUCERS, WHOLESALERS, AND OTHER RECYCLED METAL PROCESSORS GLOBALLY. WE ALSO TRANSPORT BOTH FERROUS AND NONFERROUS METALS BY TRUCK, RAIL AND BARGE IN ORDER TO TRANSFER SCRAP METAL BETWEEN OUR FACILITIES FOR FURTHER PROCESSING, TO LOAD SHIPMENTS AT OUR EXPORT FACILITIES, AND TO MEET REGIONAL DOMESTIC DEMAND.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON THE DEMAND AND PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE MANUFACTURE OF WHICH USES INTERNALLY SOURCED FERROUS RECYCLED SCRAP METAL AS THE PRIMARY FEEDSTOCK, AS WELL AS OTHER RAW MATERIALS. OUR STEEL MILL IN OREGON SELLS TO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS PRIMARILY IN NORTH AMERICA.  OUR QUARTERLY OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS FOR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS RECYCLED METAL AND FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS, THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL IN OUR DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND VARYING DEMAND FOR USED AUTO PARTS FROM OUR SELF-SERVICE RETAIL STORES. CERTAIN OF THESE FACTORS ARE INFLUENCED, TO A DEGREE, BY THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL CHANGES INCLUDING SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN IMPACT THE TIMING OF SHIPMENTS AND INHIBIT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY UTILIZING OUR PRODUCTS, SCRAP METAL COLLECTION AT OUR FACILITIES AND PRODUCTION LEVELS IN OUR YARDS, AND RETAIL ADMISSIONS AND PARTS SALES AT OUR AUTO PARTS STORES.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  WE GENERATED CONSOLIDATED REVENUES OF  $406 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020,  A DECREASE  OF  28%  FROM THE $564 MILLION OF CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, PRIMARILY DUE TO  SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS AND NONFERROUS PRODUCTS, IN BOTH EXPORT AND DOMESTIC MARKETS, AND REDUCED SALES VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THESE DECREASES WERE DRIVEN BY WEAKER MARKET CONDITIONS FOR RECYCLED METALS GLOBALLY PRIMARILY DUE TO SOFTER DEMAND FOR FINISHED STEEL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE MARKET FOR CERTAIN RECYCLED NONFERROUS PRODUCTS RESULTING FROM CHINESE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS AND TARIFFS. MARKET SELLING PRICES FOR FERROUS RECYCLED METAL DECLINED SHARPLY BY APPROXIMATELY $60 PER TON, OR APPROXIMATELY 20%, BETWEEN THE BEGINNING OF AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2019, BEFORE PARTIALLY RECOVERING IN NOVEMBER. COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FERROUS PRODUCTS AT AMR DECREASED BY 28% AND FERROUS SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 10%, REFLECTING WEAKER DEMAND GLOBALLY AND REDUCED SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES DUE TO THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT. NONFERROUS REVENUES AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY 14% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, AS NONFERROUS AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES AND SALES VOLUMES AT AMR DECREASED BY 8% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY. S  TEEL REVENUES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020  DECREASED BY 24% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR OUR FINISHED STEEL PRODUCTS AND DECREASED SALES VOLUMES.  CONSOLIDATED OPERATING LOSS  WAS $(8) MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO INCOME OF $23 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING LOSS WAS  $(4) MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO INCOME OF $23 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME FOR EACH PERIOD EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CHARGES FOR LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, NET OF RECOVERIES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT-RELATED ACTIVITIES. SEE THE RECONCILIATION OF ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED OPERATING (LOSS) INCOME IN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AT THE END OF THIS ITEM 2.  AMR REPORTED AN OPERATING LOSS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF  $(2) MILLION  , COMPARED TO INCOME OF  $23 MILLION  IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. THE SHARPLY  DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT DURING MOST OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 HAD A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT ON OPERATING MARGINS AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR FOR THE PERIOD. FERROUS METAL SPREADS AT AMR IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 20% AND AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES FOR AMR\\u2019S NONFERROUS JOINT PRODUCTS THAT ARE RECOVERED FROM THE SHREDDING PROCESS, COMPRISING PRIMARILY ZORBA, DECREASED BY 12%, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. IN THE SHARPLY DECLINING COMMODITY PRICE ENVIRONMENT, AVERAGE INVENTORY COSTS DID NOT DECREASE AS QUICKLY AS PURCHASE  COSTS FOR SCRAP METAL, RESULTING IN AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON COST OF GOODS SOLD AND OVERALL OPERATING RESULTS AT AMR. IN ADDITION, THE LOWER PRICE ENVIRONMENT ADVERSELY IMPACTED THE SUPPLY OF SCRAP METAL INCLUDING END-OF-LIFE VEHICLES, WHICH RESULTED IN LOWER PROCESSED VOLUMES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER. THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE MARKET CONDITIONS ON AMR\\u2019S OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER.  CSS REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF  $4 MILLION  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $12 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF THE DECLINING PRICE ENVIRONMENT FOR FINISHED STEEL DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. FINISHED STEEL AVERAGE NET SELLING PRICES DECLINED  $104  PER TON,  OR 14%,  COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, WHICH LED TO A  COMPRESSION OF FINISHED STEEL MARGINS AS DECREASES IN SELLING PRICES OUTPACED THE REDUCTION IN RAW MATERIAL PURCHASE PRICES AND OTHER INPUT COSTS. THE EFFECTS OF FINISHED STEEL MARGIN COMPRESSION WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES. CSS OPERATING RESULTS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 REFLECTED HIGHER FINISHED STEEL MARGINS COMPARED TO THE CURRENT QUARTER, SUPPORTED BY THE HIGHER AND RISING PRICE ENVIRONMENT AT THE TIME.  CONSOLIDATED SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (\\u201cSG&A\\u201d) EXPENSE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 DECREASED BY  $5 MILLION  , OR 9%, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6 MILLION  DECREASE IN EMPLOYEE-RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING FROM LOWER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ACCRUALS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL MATTER AT AMR.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE INVESTED $24 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING TOWARDS THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AT SEVERAL OF OUR MAJOR EXPORT FACILITIES CONSISTENT WITH OUR STRATEGIC PLAN, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL DELIVER BENEFITS TO OUR PROFITABILITY BEGINNING IN THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2020. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $125 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING $60 MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, INCLUDING ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND TO SUPPORT VOLUME INITIATIVES AND OTHER GROWTH PROJECTS.  27  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.

IF WE DO NOT MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN AN AMENDMENT OR WAIVER FROM OUR LENDERS, A BREACH OF A FINANCIAL COVENANT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN EVENT OF DEFAULT AND ALLOW THE LENDERS TO EXERCISE REMEDIES UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, THE MOST SEVERE OF WHICH IS THE TERMINATION OF THE CREDIT FACILITY UNDER OUR COMMITTED BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT AND ACCELERATION OF THE AMOUNTS OWED UNDER THE AGREEMENT. IN SUCH CASE, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE FUNDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ANY SUCH ALTERNATIVE FUNDS, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES  CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $24 MILLION FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $27 MILLION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. WE CURRENTLY PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $125 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2020, INCLUDING $60 MILLION FOR INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH, INCLUDING ADVANCED METALS RECOVERY TECHNOLOGY AND TO SUPPORT VOLUME INITIATIVES AND OTHER GROWTH PROJECTS, USING CASH GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND AVAILABLE CREDIT FACILITIES.  ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE  BUILDING ON OUR COMMITMENT TO RECYCLING AND OPERATING OUR BUSINESS IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY RESPONSIBLE MANNER, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN FACILITIES THAT IMPROVE OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE. AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DISCUSSED IN THE PRIOR PARAGRAPH, WE  INVESTED $3 MILLION IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2020,  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  SCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC.  AND PLAN TO INVEST UP TO $15 MILLION FOR  SUCH PROJECTS IN FISCAL  2020  . THESE PROJECTS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN STORM WATER SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT TO ENSURE ONGOING COMPLIANCE WITH AIR QUALITY AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.  WE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY AS ONE OF THE POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES THAT OWN OR OPERATE OR FORMERLY OWNED OR OPERATED SITES WHICH ARE PART OF OR ADJACENT TO THE PORTLAND HARBOR SUPERFUND SITE (THE \\u201cSITE\\u201d). SEE NOTE 5 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES IN THE NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT FOR A DISCUSSION OF THIS MATTER, AS WELL AS OTHER LEGACY ENVIRONMENTAL LOSS CONTINGENCIES. WE BELIEVE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF COSTS WHICH WE ARE LIKELY TO OR WHICH IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL INCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH SUCH COSTS COULD BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY. WE HAVE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT WE BELIEVE WILL PROVIDE REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS WE INCUR FOR DEFENSE (INCLUDING PRE-REMEDIAL DESIGN INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITIES), REMEDIAL DESIGN, REMEDIAL ACTION AND MITIGATION FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES CLAIMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SITE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO ASSURANCES THAT THOSE POLICIES WILL COVER ALL OF THE COSTS WHICH WE MAY INCUR. SIGNIFICANT CASH OUTFLOWS IN THE FUTURE RELATED TO THE SITE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS COULD REDUCE THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING THAT COULD OTHERWISE BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS AND COULD RESULT IN OUR FAILURE TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS IN OUR DEBT AGREEMENTS, AND COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR LIQUIDITY.  DIVIDENDS  ON  NOVEMBER 6, 2019, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A DIVIDEND FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 OF $0.1875 PER COMMON SHARE, WHICH EQUATES TO AN ANNUAL CASH DIVIDEND OF $0.75 PER COMMON SHARE. THE DIVIDEND WAS PAID ON NOVEMBER 29, 2019.  SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM  PURSUANT TO OUR AMENDED SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE EXISTING AUTHORIZATION REMAINING UNDER THE PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO APPROXIMATELY  759 THOUSAND SHARES OF OUR CLASS A COMMON STOCK WHEN WE DEEM SUCH REPURCHASES TO BE APPROPRIATE. WE MAY REPURCHASE OUR COMMON STOCK FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, SUCH AS TO OPTIMIZE OUR CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND TO OFFSET DILUTION RELATED TO SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS. WE CONSIDER SEVERAL FACTORS IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO MAKE SHARE REPURCHASES INCLUDING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, OUR CASH NEEDS, THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING, OUR FUTURE BUSINESS PLANS AND THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK.  ASSESSMENT OF LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  HISTORICALLY, OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, CREDIT FACILITIES AND EQUITY OFFERINGS HAVE FINANCED OUR ACQUISITIONS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER FINANCING NEEDS.  WE GENERALLY BELIEVE OUR CURRENT CASH RESOURCES, INTERNALLY GENERATED FUNDS, EXISTING CREDIT FACILITIES AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS WILL PROVIDE ADEQUATE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT OF A SUSTAINED MARKET DETERIORATION, WE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE US TO EVALUATE AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES AND TAKE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT ADDITIONAL FUNDS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT ANY SUCH SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING, IF SOUGHT, COULD BE OBTAINED OR, IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  NONE REQUIRING DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO ITEM 303 OF REGULATION S-K UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019.  WE MAINTAIN STAND-BY LETTERS OF CREDIT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING WORKERS\\u2019 COMPENSATION AND PERFORMANCE BONDS. AS OF NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAD  $10 MILLION  OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AS DESCRIBED IN THE \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\u201d SECTION OF OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, EXCEPT FOR CHANGES RESULTING FROM ADOPTION OF THE NEW LEASE ACCOUNTING STANDARD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  DEBT, NET OF CASH  DEBT, NET OF CASH IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN (I) THE SUM OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS (I.E., TOTAL DEBT) AND (II) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. WE BELIEVE THAT DEBT, NET OF CASH IS A USEFUL MEASURE FOR INVESTORS BECAUSE, AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CAN BE USED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO REPAY INDEBTEDNESS, NETTING THIS AGAINST TOTAL DEBT IS A USEFUL MEASURE OF OUR LEVERAGE.

COMPANY AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOSCIENCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND LICENSING COMPANY FOR OUR PATENTED LIPID NUTRIENT INFUSION DEHYDRATECHTM TECHNOLOGY (THE \\u201cTECHNOLOGY\\u201d) AND WERE INCORPORATED IN 2004 IN NEVADA. OUR TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY INGESTION METHODS, LOWER OVERALL DOSING AND HIGHER EFFECTIVENESS IN ACTIVE MOLECULE DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S FOOD SCIENCES ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PROPRIETARY NUTRIENT INFUSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF FUNCTIONAL FOODS, AND THE PRODUCTION OF ENHANCED FOOD PRODUCTS UNDER OUR CONSUMER PRODUCT BRANDS, VIPOVATM, LEXARIA ENERGYTM, TURBOCBDTM AND CHRGD+TM. THE COMPANY\\u2019S TECHNOLOGY IS BELIEVED TO IMPROVE TASTE, RAPIDITY AND DELIVERY OF BIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS THAT INCLUDE CANNABINOIDS, VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS (NSAIDS), NICOTINE AND OTHER MOLECULES COMPARED TO WHAT IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LIPOPHILIC ENHANCEMENT TECHNOLOGY. ALL OF LEXARIA\\u2019S CONSUMER PRODUCT GOODS ARE MADE WITH COMMONLY AVAILABLE FOOD GRADE INGREDIENTS AND ARE SOLD THROUGH E-COMMERCE PLATFORMS AND FULFILLMENT CENTERS.  LEXARIA HOPES TO REDUCE OTHER COMMON, BUT LESS HEALTHY ADMINISTRATION METHODS SUCH AS SMOKING, AS INDUSTRY SEGMENTS EMBRACE THE BENEFITS OF OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH. THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION IN NATIONAL JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS MORE THAN 50 PATENT APPLICATIONS PENDING WORLDWIDE. DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF PURSUING PATENT PROTECTION, THE QUANTITY OF PATENT APPLICATIONS WILL VARY CONTINUOUSLY AS EACH APPLICATION ADVANCES OR STALLS. LEXARIA IS ALSO FILING NEW PATENT APPLICATIONS FOR NOVEL NEW DISCOVERIES THAT ARISE FROM THE COMPANY\\u2019S R&D PROGRAMS AND, DUE TO THE INHERENT UNPREDICTABILITY OF SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT IF OR HOW OFTEN SUCH NEW APPLICATIONS MIGHT BE FILED.  AS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2019, WE HAVE IDENTIFIED TWO REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LICENSING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.  PAGE 15 OF 24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  OUR CURRENT BUSINESS  OUR COMPANY\\u2019S BUSINESS PLAN IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS WITH LICENSEES FOR OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY IN EXCHANGE FOR UP FRONT AND/OR STAGED LICENSING FEES OVER TIME. SECONDARILY AND MORE GENERALLY, WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S ENHANCED FUNCTIONAL FOOD AND SUPPLEMENT PRODUCT OFFERINGS; TO INVESTIGATE EXPANSIONS AND ADDITIONS TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO; AND TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES IN ALTERNATIVE HEALTH SECTORS. THIS INCLUDES THE ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IF AND WHEN WE BELIEVE IT IS ADVISABLE TO DO SO.  OUR CURRENT PATENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES PATENT FAMILY GRANTS RELATING TO: INFUSED FOOD AND BEVERAGE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF, PERTAINING TO LEXARIA\\u2019S METHOD OF IMPROVING BIOAVAILABILITY AND TASTE, AND THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY AS A DELIVERY PLATFORM FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS (\\u201cAPIS\\u201d) ENCOMPASSING ALL CANNABINOIDS INCLUDING CBD AND THC, FAT SOLUBLE VITAMINS, NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PAIN MEDICATIONS (\\u201cNSAIDS\\u201d); AND NICOTINE.

TO ACHIEVE SUSTAINABLE AND PROFITABLE GROWTH, OUR COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTROL THE TIMING AND COSTS OF OUR PROJECTS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. WE HAVE FILED FOR PATENT PROTECTION OF OUR TECHNOLOGY FOR ADDITIONAL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITORS, HUMAN HORMONES SUCH AS ESTROGEN AND TESTOSTERONE AND MORE.  DURING THE PERIOD ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2019, AND UP TO THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, WE EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS.  THE COMPANY CLOSED A NON-BROKERED PRIVATE PLACEMENT OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES FOR A TOTAL OF 1,823,745 UNITS PRICED AT $0.45 EACH. EACH UNIT CONSISTS OF ONE COMMON SHARE AND ONE SHARE PURCHASE WARRANT. EACH WARRANT SHALL ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY FOR A PERIOD OF TWO YEARS AT A PRICE OF $0.80 PER SHARE UNTIL THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE, AND THEREAFTER AT A PRICE OF $1.20 UNTIL THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE. THE COMPANY PAID $3,937.50 AND ISSUED 8,750 BROKER WARRANTS. THE BROKER WARRANTS HAVE A TERM OF 24 MONTHS AND ARE EACH EXERCISABLE INTO ONE COMMON SHARE OF THE COMPANY AT A PRICE OF $0.80 PER SHARE UNTIL THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE, AND THEREAFTER AT A PRICE OF $1.20 UNTIL THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF ISSUANCE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE BROKER WARRANTS WAS DETERMINED TO BE $1,850, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A SHARE ISSUANCE COST WITHIN ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL FOR A NET EFFECT OF $NIL.  THE UNITS WERE ISSUED PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION EXEMPTIONS EITHER BY WAY OF THE INVESTOR BEING AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR AS EVIDENCED BY THE COMPLETION OF AN ACCREDITED INVESTOR CERTIFICATION, PURSUANT TO REGULATION D, RULE 506 (B), OR A PERSON REPRESENTING THAT HE IS NOT A US PERSON OR ACTING ON BEHALF OF A US PERSON, PURSUANT TO REGULATION S, RULE 903, WHO PURCHASED THE SECURITIES IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION AND WILL BEAR THE REQUIRED REGULATORY HOLD PERIOD LEGENDS.  SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30, 2019, 110,000 OPTIONS WERE EXERCISED FOR A TOTAL OF $11,000.  PAGE 16 OF 24  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  LEXARIA INCURRED $107,463 (2018 $96,973) IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES DURING THE PERIOD ENDING NOVEMBER 30, 2019. SPECIFIC R&D PROGRAMS ARE IN ONGOING DEVELOPMENT AND WILL BE TIGHTLY RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO UNDERTAKE EACH RESEARCH PHASE FOR EACH API. DUE TO OUR EXPANDING PORTFOLIO COVERAGE, WE ARE CONTINUING TO EXAMINE ACCELERATED TIMETABLE OPTIONS FOR TESTING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF EACH API.  THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLANS TO INCLUDE  IN VITRO  ABSORPTION TESTS OF OUR PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OF MOLECULES SUCH AS: VITAMIN E, IBUPROFEN, AND NICOTINE ALLOWED US TO PERFORM TESTING ON NICOTINE WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. OUR PLAN TO CONDUCT OUR FIRST EVER  IN VIVO  ABSORPTION TESTS ON CBD ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS. ONGOING TESTING PLANS ARE PROCEEDING TO FURTHER DEFINE MOLECULAR COMPATIBILITY, ABSORPTION RATES, TIMING AND VIABLE FORMATS OF DELIVERY.  THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY FOCUSES ON NEW R&D PROGRAMS TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL OF ADDITIONAL COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY. THESE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPLORE METHODS TO INTEGRATE NANOEMULSIFICATION CHEMISTRY TECHNIQUES TOGETHER WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY AND TO FURTHER ENHANCE INTESTINAL BIOABSORPTION RATES WITH ITS TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS ONGOING PROGRAMS TO EXPAND THE TYPES AND BREADTH OF PRODUCT FORM FACTORS INTO WHICH ITS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE APPLIED. DEPENDING ON HOW MANY OF THESE TESTS ARE UNDERTAKEN, R&D BUDGETS ARE EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. IT IS IN OUR BEST INTERESTS TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE AT THIS EARLY STAGE OF OUR R&D EFFORTS IN ORDER TO CAPITALIZE ON POTENTIAL NOVEL FINDINGS FROM EARLY-STAGE TESTS AND THUS RE-DIRECT RESEARCH INTO SPECIFIC AVENUES THAT OFFER THE MOST REWARD.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT ARE MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED IN THE UNITED STATES (US GAAP). PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENT'S APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

LONG TERM LIQUIDITY  IT WILL REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL CASH TO ACHIEVE OUR OBJECTIVES FOR DEVELOPING AND PATENTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ACROSS ALL APPLICABLE MARKET AND INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. THIS PROCESS TYPICALLY TAKES MANY YEARS AND POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR EACH SEGMENT. WE WILL NEED TO OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FROM EXISTING OR NEW RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS OUR RESEARCH PROGRAM WITH THE ALTRIA GROUP, INCREASING REVENUE STREAMS OR FROM OTHER SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY SUCH AS THE SALE OF EQUITY, ISSUANCE OF DEBT OR OTHER TRANSACTIONS.

GREYSTONE\\u2019S EXISTING CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES AND ENGAGED IN THE BEVERAGE,  PHARMACEUTICAL AND OTHER INDUSTRIES. GREYSTONE HAS GENERATED, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE TO GENERATE, INTEREST IN ITS PALLETS BY ATTENDING  TRADE SHOWS SPONSORED BY INDUSTRY SEGMENTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM GREYSTONE\\u2019S PRODUCTS. GREYSTONE HOPES TO GAIN WIDER PRODUCT  ACCEPTANCE BY MARKETING THE CONCEPT THAT THE WIDESPREAD USE OF PLASTIC PALLETS COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE DESTRUCTION OF TREES ON  A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

WE MANUFACTURE AND MARKET PRESTRESSED CONCRETE STRAND (\\u201cPC STRAND\\u201d) AND WELDED WIRE REINFORCEMENT, INCLUDING ESM, CONCRETE PIPE REINFORCEMENT AND STANDARD WELDED WIRE REINFORCEMENT. OUR PRODUCTS ARE SOLD PRIMARILY TO MANUFACTURERS OF CONCRETE PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION. WE MARKET OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH SALES REPRESENTATIVES WHO ARE OUR EMPLOYEES. WE SELL OUR PRODUCTS NATIONWIDE ACROSS THE U.S. AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, INTO CANADA, MEXICO, AND CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, DELIVERING THEM PRIMARILY BY TRUCK, USING COMMON OR CONTRACT CARRIERS. OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON: (1) ACHIEVING LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN OUR MARKETS; (2) OPERATING AS THE LOWEST COST PRODUCER IN OUR INDUSTRY; AND (3) PURSUING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN OUR CORE BUSINESSES THAT FURTHER OUR PENETRATION OF THE MARKETS WE CURRENTLY SERVE OR EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT.  17  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2013 SELECTED DATA  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  CHANGE  2018  NET SALES  $97,569  (6.3  )%  $104,110  GROSS PROFIT  6,237  (43.2  )%  10,976  PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  6.4%  10.5%  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  $5,744  (12.1  )%  $6,534  PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES  5.9%  6.3%  OTHER INCOME, NET  $(25  )  (97.0  )%  $(829  )  INTEREST EXPENSE  26  (13.3  )%  30  INTEREST INCOME  (226  )  45.8%  (155  )  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  22.7%  23.5%  NET EARNINGS  $555  (86.5  )%  $4,126  FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019  NET SALES  NET SALES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED 6.3% TO $97.6 MILLION FROM $104.1 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER, REFLECTING A 16.1% DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 11.7% INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS. THE DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES WAS DRIVEN BY COMPETITIVE PRICING PRESSURES RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN LOW-PRICED IMPORT COMPETITION SPURRED BY THE SECTION 232 TARIFFS ON IMPORTED STEEL. THE INCREASE IN SHIPMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED MARKET CONDITIONS AND STRENGTHENING DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS RELATIVE TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH WAS UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE UNUSUALLY WET WEATHER.  GROSS PROFIT  GROSS PROFIT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED 43.2% TO $6.2 MILLION, OR 6.4% OF NET SALES, FROM $11.0 MILLION, OR 10.5% OF NET SALES, IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO LOWER SPREADS BETWEEN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($6.0 MILLION) AND HIGHER MANUFACTURING COSTS ($663,000) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SHIPMENTS ($1.4 MILLION). THE DECREASE IN SPREADS WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES ($19.4 MILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RAW MATERIAL COSTS ($13.2 MILLION) AND FREIGHT EXPENSE ($217,000).  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (\\u201cSG&A EXPENSE\\u201d) FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED 12.1% TO $5.7 MILLION, OR 5.9% OF NET SALES, FROM $6.5 MILLION, OR 6.3% OF NET SALES IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RELATIVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGES IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($871,000). THE VALUE OF THE POLICIES INCREASED $339,000 IN THE CURRENT YEAR QUARTER COMPARED WITH A DECREASE OF $532,000 IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO THE CORRESPONDING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.  OTHER INCOME  OTHER INCOME OF $829,000 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A NET GAIN FROM THE DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ($709,000).  INCOME TAXES  OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED TO 22.7% FROM 23.5% FOR THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER DUE TO CHANGES IN PERMANENT BOOK VERSUS TAX DIFFERENCES.  18  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET EARNINGS  NET EARNINGS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 DECREASED TO $555,000 ($0.03 PER SHARE) FROM $4.1 MILLION ($0.21 PER SHARE) IN THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECREASE IN GROSS PROFIT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN SG&A EXPENSE.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)  THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 28,  DECEMBER 29,  2019  2018  NET CASH PROVIDED BY (USED FOR) OPERATING ACTIVITIES  $29,575  $(22,768  )  NET CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES  (642  )  (5,663  )  NET CASH USED FOR FINANCING ACTIVITIES  -  (7  )  NET WORKING CAPITAL  133,959  125,265  TOTAL DEBT  -  -  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  -  -  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY  $246,180  $245,382  PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL  100.0%  100.0%  TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL DEBT + SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY)  $246,180  $245,382  OPERATING ACTIVITIES  OPERATING ACTIVITIES PROVIDED $29.6 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL PROVIDED $24.6 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $10.2 MILLION INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES, AN $8.8 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A $5.6 MILLION DECREASE IN INVENTORIES. THE INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO HIGHER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS LARGELY RELATED TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES AND DECREASE IN SELLING PRICES. THE REDUCTION IN INVENTORIES WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS.  OPERATING ACTIVITIES USED $22.8 MILLION OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019 PRIMARILY FROM NET EARNINGS ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS TOGETHER WITH A NET DECREASE IN WORKING CAPITAL. WORKING CAPITAL USED $31.2 MILLION OF CASH DUE TO A $25.1 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES AND A $21.1 MILLION INCREASE IN INVENTORIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $15.0 MILLION DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES WAS LARGELY DUE TO LOWER RAW MATERIAL PURCHASES NEAR THE END OF THE QUARTER, AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION FOR THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN INVENTORIES WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE REDUCTION IN SHIPMENTS AND HIGHER AVERAGE UNIT COSTS. THE REDUCTION IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THE USUAL SEASONAL DOWNTURN IN SALES COMPOUNDED BY THE UNUSUALLY WET WEATHER.  WE MAY ELECT TO ADJUST OUR OPERATING ACTIVITIES AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CASH REQUIREMENTS. WHILE A DOWNTURN IN THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY ADVERSELY AFFECTS SALES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, IT GENERALLY REDUCES OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  INVESTING ACTIVITIES  INVESTING ACTIVITIES USED $642,000 OF CASH DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020 COMPARED TO $5.7 MILLION DURING THE PRIOR YEAR QUARTER PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ($5.6 MILLION) AND AN INCREASE IN THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES ($560,000). CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DECREASED TO $600,000 FROM $6.2 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD AND ARE EXPECTED TO TOTAL UP TO $17.0 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2020 PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON COST AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES IN ADDITION TO RECURRING MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.  OUR INVESTING ACTIVITIES ARE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY, PROVIDING US WITH THE ABILITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY CURTAIL OUTLAYS WHEN WARRANTED BASED ON BUSINESS CONDITIONS.  19  TABLE OF CONTENTS  FINANCING ACTIVITIES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES DID NOT PROVIDE OR USE ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF CASH DURING THE CURRENT OR PRIOR YEAR QUARTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2020, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $578,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2020. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2019, WE DECLARED A REGULAR QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND OF $576,000, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, WHICH WAS PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2019.  CASH MANAGEMENT  OUR CASH IS PRINCIPALLY CONCENTRATED AT ONE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, WHICH AT TIMES EXCEEDS FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. WE INVEST EXCESS CASH PRIMARILY IN MONEY MARKET FUNDS, WHICH ARE HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES THAT BEAR MINIMAL RISK.  CREDIT FACILITY  WE HAVE A $100.0 MILLION REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201cCREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) THAT IS USED TO SUPPLEMENT OUR OPERATING CASH FLOW AND FUND OUR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURE, GENERAL CORPORATE AND GROWTH REQUIREMENTS. IN MAY 2019, WE ENTERED INTO A NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH AMENDED AND RESTATED IN ITS ENTIRETY THE PREVIOUS AGREEMENT PERTAINING TO THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY THAT HAD BEEN IN EFFECT SINCE JUNE 2010. THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT, AMONG OTHER CHANGES, EXTENDED THE MATURITY DATE OF THE CREDIT FACILITY FROM MAY 13, 2020 TO MAY 15, 2024 AND PROVIDED FOR AN INCREMENTAL FEATURE WHEREBY ITS SIZE MAY BE INCREASED BY UP TO $50.0 MILLION, SUBJECT TO OUR LENDER\\u2019S APPROVAL. ADVANCES UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY ARE LIMITED TO THE LESSER OF THE REVOLVING LOAN COMMITMENT AMOUNT (CURRENTLY $100.0 MILLION) OR A BORROWING BASE AMOUNT THAT IS CALCULATED BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, NO BORROWINGS WERE OUTSTANDING ON THE CREDIT FACILITY, $71.7 MILLION OF BORROWING CAPACITY WAS AVAILABLE AND OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT TOTALED $1.6 MILLION (SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).  WE BELIEVE THAT, IN THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT UNANTICIPATED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, NET CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE BORROWING AVAILABILITY PROVIDED UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY OUR EXPECTED REQUIREMENTS FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, IF ANY. WE EXPECT TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE AMOUNTS AVAILABLE UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY AS REQUIRED. HOWEVER, SHOULD WE EXPERIENCE FUTURE REDUCTIONS IN OUR OPERATING CASH FLOWS DUE TO WEAKENING CONDITIONS IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND REDUCED DEMAND FROM OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY NEED TO CURTAIL CAPITAL AND OPERATING EXPENDITURES, CEASE DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, DELAY OR RESTRICT SHARE REPURCHASES AND/OR REALIGN OUR WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  SHOULD WE DETERMINE, AT ANY TIME, THAT WE REQUIRED ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY, WE WOULD EVALUATE THE ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING THAT WOULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY SUCH FINANCING, IF PURSUED, WOULD BE OBTAINED, OR IF OBTAINED, WOULD BE ADEQUATE OR ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO US. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR STRONG BALANCE SHEET, FLEXIBLE CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND BORROWING CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY POSITION US TO MEET OUR ANTICIPATED LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, INCLUDING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.  SEASONALITY AND CYCLICALITY  DEMAND IN OUR MARKETS IS BOTH SEASONAL AND CYCLICAL, DRIVEN BY THE LEVEL OF CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, BUT CAN ALSO BE IMPACTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE INVENTORY POSITIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. FROM A SEASONAL STANDPOINT, SHIPMENTS TYPICALLY REACH THEIR HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE YEAR WHEN WEATHER CONDITIONS ARE THE MOST CONDUCIVE TO CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY. AS A RESULT, ASSUMING NORMAL SEASONAL WEATHER PATTERNS, SHIPMENTS AND PROFITABILITY ARE USUALLY HIGHER IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND LOWER IN THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS. FROM A CYCLICAL STANDPOINT, CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY AND DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS GENERALLY CORRELATED WITH GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, ALTHOUGH THERE CAN BE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF NONRESIDENTIAL AND RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION FOR EXTENDED PERIODS.  20  TABLE OF CONTENTS  IMPACT OF INFLATION  WE ARE SUBJECT TO INFLATIONARY RISKS ARISING FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET PRICES FOR OUR PRIMARY RAW MATERIAL, HOT-ROLLED CARBON STEEL WIRE ROD, AND, TO A MUCH LESSER EXTENT, FREIGHT, ENERGY AND OTHER CONSUMABLES THAT ARE USED IN OUR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. WE HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO ADJUST OUR SELLING PRICES TO PASS THROUGH INCREASES IN THESE COSTS OR OFFSET THEM THROUGH VARIOUS COST REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. HOWEVER, OUR ABILITY TO RAISE OUR SELLING PRICES DEPENDS ON MARKET CONDITIONS AND COMPETITIVE DYNAMICS, AND THERE MAY BE PERIODS DURING WHICH WE ARE UNABLE TO FULLY RECOVER INCREASES IN OUR COSTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS DECLINED IN RESPONSE TO LOW-PRICED IMPORT COMPETITION SPURRED BY THE SECTION 232 TARIFF ON IMPORTED STEEL, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS WE CONSUMED HIGHER COST INVENTORY THAT WAS PURCHASED IN PRIOR PERIODS. THE TIMING AND MAGNITUDE OF ANY FUTURE INCREASES IN OUR RAW MATERIAL COSTS AND THE SELLING PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL TRANSACTIONS, ARRANGEMENTS, OBLIGATIONS (INCLUDING CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS), OR OTHER RELATIONSHIPS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS, AS DESCRIBED BY ITEM 303(A)(4) OF REGULATION S-K OF THE SEC, THAT HAVE OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A MATERIAL CURRENT OR FUTURE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, CAPITAL RESOURCES OR SIGNIFICANT COMPONENTS OF REVENUES OR EXPENSES.  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AS DISCLOSED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT OTHER THAN THOSE WHICH OCCUR IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IS BASED ON OUR UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. FOR INTERIM FINANCIAL INFORMATION. THE PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES THE APPLICATION OF THESE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS BASED ON CURRENT AVAILABLE INFORMATION, ACTUARIAL ESTIMATES, HISTORICAL RESULTS AND OTHER ASSUMPTIONS BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. PLEASE REFER TO \\u201cMANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \\u2013 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\u201d INCLUDED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT FOR FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES. AS OF DECEMBER 28, 2019, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES OR THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES FROM THOSE REPORTED IN OUR 2019 ANNUAL REPORT.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  REFER TO NOTE 2 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 1 OF THIS QUARTERLY REPORT FOR RECENTLY ADOPTED AND ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED DATES OF ADOPTION AND ESTIMATED EFFECTS, IF ANY, ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OUTLOOK  LOOKING AHEAD TO THE REMAINDER OF 2020, WE EXPECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS WILL BE FAVORABLY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUED GROWTH IN OUR CONSTRUCTION END-MARKETS AND THE WEATHER-RELATED DEFERRAL OF BUSINESS FROM LAST YEAR. THE INFRASTRUCTURE-RELATED PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS SHOULD BENEFIT FROM HIGHER STATE AND LOCAL SPENDING IN MANY OF OUR MARKETS SUPPORTED BY VARIOUS INITIATIVES SUCH AS FUEL TAX INCREASES, BOND ISSUANCES AND OTHER BALLOT MEASURES TOGETHER WITH INCREASED FEDERAL FUNDING THROUGH THE FAST ACT AND SUPPLEMENTARY MEASURES. THE LEADING INDICATORS AND INDUSTRY FORECASTS FOR NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION HAVE REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE, REFLECTING MODEST GROWTH FOR THE YEAR.  WE EXPECT BUSINESS CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING, HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE SURGE OF LOW-PRICED IMPORTS THAT HAS FOLLOWED THE IMPOSITION OF THE SECTION 232 TARIFF ON IMPORTS OF HOT-ROLLED STEEL WIRE ROD. IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING OUR DIALOGUE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF IMPORTS ON OUR BUSINESS, WE WILL FOCUS ON THE OPERATIONAL FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR BUSINESS: CLOSELY MANAGING AND CONTROLLING OUR EXPENSES; ALIGNING OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES WITH DEMAND IN A PROACTIVE MANNER AS THERE ARE CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS TO MINIMIZE OUR CASH OPERATING COSTS; AND PURSUING FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ALL OUR MANUFACTURING, SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO EXPECT GRADUALLY INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS WE HAVE MADE IN OUR FACILITIES IN THE FORM OF REDUCED OPERATING COSTS AND ADDITIONAL CAPACITY TO SUPPORT FUTURE GROWTH. IN ADDITION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE FURTHER ACQUISITIONS IN OUR EXISTING BUSINESSES THAT EXPAND OUR PENETRATION OF MARKETS WE CURRENTLY SERVE OR EXPAND OUR FOOTPRINT.  21  TABLE OF CONTENTS\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": 1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"INSTEEL INDUSTRIES INC\", \"CIK\": 764401, \"Date\": \"2020-01-16T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"IIIN\", \"Name\": \"Insteel Industries Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"NASDAQ\", \"SIC\": 3310.0, \"Business\": \"NC\", \"Incorporated\": \"NC\", \"IRS\": 560674867.0, \"key\": \"20200116IIIN\", \"labelr1\": 6.9490131578947425, \"labelr2\": 0.0, \"labelr3\": -0.2306805074971252, \"labelr4\": -3.1599229287090562, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.5236972, \"prof1\": 0.47630277, \"return1&2\": 0.9305098684210524, \"return1&2&3\": 0.9326563733078372, \"return1&2&3&4\": 0.9621275958940578, \"return2\": 1.0, \"return1\": 0.9305098684210524, \"return3\": 1.0023068050749713, \"return4\": 1.0315992292870906, \"1_day_return\": 6.949013157894735, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.2422426817898649, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3572, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0694901315789473, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.9906560845260666, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.0134084496190432, \"cumreturndow\": 1.0220298714922647, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.0166026580610665}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3573, \"level_0\": 3666, \"index\": 3638, \"text\": \"ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE NOTES THERETO, APPEARING IN THIS REPORT AND ARE HEREBY REFERENCED.

HOWEVER, OUR MANAGEMENT DISCLAIMS ANY OBLIGATION TO UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WHETHER AS A RESULT OF NEW INFORMATION, FUTURE EVENTS OR OTHERWISE.  THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR MANAGEMENT\\u2019S CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND BELIEFS AND INVOLVE NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS.  YOU SHOULD NOT RELY UPON THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS BECAUSE WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT THE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REFLECTED IN THESE STATEMENTS WILL BE ACHIEVED OR WILL OCCUR.

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS RELATE TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS: OUR SALES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS; CAPITAL  EXPENDITURES; DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSES; SALES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES; OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN AND DEVELOP RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR EXISTING AND POTENTIAL FUTURE CUSTOMERS; AND, OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF  INVESTMENT THAT IS REQUIRED TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.  MANY FACTORS COULD CAUSE OUR ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: VARIABILITY OF OUR REVENUES AND  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE; RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES; THE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN THE MARKETPLACE BY EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS; DISRUPTION OF OPERATIONS OR INCREASES IN EXPENSES DUE TO OUR INVOLVEMENT WITH LITIGATION OR  CAUSED BY CIVIL OR POLITICAL UNREST OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, GOVERNMENT MANDATES; AND, THE CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT OF OUR KEY PERSONNEL AND OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH COMPETITION.  11  OVERVIEW  THE COMPANY WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF FLORIDA ON JANUARY 13, 2011. WE ARE REFOCUSING AND PREPARING TO RELAUNCH THE COMPANY THROUGH A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC  ACQUISITIONS IN THE TEXTILE, SERVICE, AGRICULTURAL, AND/OR INDUSTRIAL SECTORS TO COMPLEMENT AND CAPTURE THE NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA AND NEW ZEALAND. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN OUR EFFORTS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 COMPARED TO THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018  REVENUES  THE COMPANY\\u2019S REVENUES WERE $0 FOR THE THREE-MONTH AND NINE-MONTH PERIODS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2018.  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE $63,702 AS COMPARED TO $7,667 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND  $84,501 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AS COMPARED TO $26,950 FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE HIGHER CONSULTING FEES RELATED TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S  ACQUISITION AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY HAS HAD ONLY NOMINAL OPERATIONS AND DOES NOT HAVE ANY CASH GENERATED FROM BUSINESS OPERATIONS.  WE FUNDED OUR OPERATING EXPENSES BY ISSUING NOTES TO RELATED AND UNRELATED PARTIES AND BORROWING LOANS FROM OUR RELATED PARTIES.  DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017, WE ALSO ISSUED CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK FOR GROSS PROCEEDS OF $515,000.  OUR PLAN IS TO OBTAIN FINANCING FROM VARIOUS INVESTORS AND COMPLETE OUR ACQUISITION PROJECT.  AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE HAD WORKING CAPITAL DEFICITS OF $209,278 AND $124,721, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ESTABLISHED AN ONGOING SOURCE OF REVENUE SUFFICIENT TO COVER ITS OPERATING COSTS AND ALLOW IT TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO  CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY OBTAINING ADEQUATE CAPITAL TO FUND OPERATING LOSSES UNTIL IT BECOMES PROFITABLE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN ADEQUATE CAPITAL, IT COULD BE FORCED TO CEASE OPERATIONS.  THESE FACTORS RAISE  SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  IN ORDER TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN, THE COMPANY WILL NEED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ADDITIONAL CAPITAL RESOURCES. MANAGEMENT\\u2019S PLANS FOCUS ON A VARIETY OF STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS IN  SERVICE, AGRICULTURE AND INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES TO COMPLEMENT AND GROW ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY IS POSITIONING TO CAPTURE THE NEXT WAVE OF GROWTH COMPANIES FROM ASIA. THE COMPANY\\u2019S PLANNED FOCUS IS ALSO ON ADDING VALUE THROUGH SUCCESSFUL PROJECT  DEVELOPMENT, EFFICIENT OPERATIONS, AND OPPORTUNISTIC ACQUISITIONS WHILE MAINTAINING A LOW RISK PROFILE THROUGH PROJECT DIVERSIFICATION, ASTUTE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND OPERATING IN SECURE JURISDICTIONS. TO OBTAIN SUCH RESOURCES FOR THE COMPANY  INCLUDE (I) OBTAINING CAPITAL FROM MANAGEMENT AND SIGNIFICANT STOCKHOLDERS SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS MINIMAL OPERATING EXPENSES; (II) OBTAINING FUNDING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES THROUGH THE SALE OF ITS DEBT AND/OR EQUITY SECURITIES; AND (III) COMPLETING A  MERGER WITH OR ACQUISITION OF AN EXISTING OPERATING COMPANY.  HOWEVER, MANAGEMENT CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN ACCOMPLISHING ANY OF ITS PLANS.  THE ACCOMPANYING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ANY  ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THIS UNCERTAINTY.  12  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $166,530 FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $31,693  FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 DUE TO THE DECREASE IN PREPAID EXPENSE OF $42,101.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  THE NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018 WAS $0.  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WAS $166,530. NET CASH USED IN FINANCING  ACTIVITIES DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 WAS $31,693 DUE TO PAYBACK OF A RELATED PARTY\\u2019S LOAN IN THE AMOUNT OF $42,101.  AVAILABILITY OF ADDITIONAL FUNDS  BASED ON OUR WORKING CAPITAL DEFICIT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND ZERO REVENUES, WE EXPECT TO NEED ADDITIONAL EQUITY AND/OR DEBT FINANCING TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS DURING  THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE EXPECT THAT OUR CURRENT CASH ON HAND WILL NOT FUND OUR OPERATIONS THROUGH DECEMBER 2020.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  OUR UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES APPLIED ON A CONSISTENT  BASIS. THE PREPARATION OF UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH UNITED STATES GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND  LIABILITIES, THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE  ESTIMATES. OUR SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE AMORTIZATION, THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR STOCK, AND THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO THE COMPANY\\u2019S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  THERE WERE NO MATERIAL COMMITMENTS DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  13  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  IN JUNE 2018, THE FASB ISSUED ASU 2018-07, \\u201cCOMPENSATION \\u2013 STOCK COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718): IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING. ASU 2018-07 EXPANDS THE  SCOPE OF TOPIC 718 TO INCLUDE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS FOR ACQUIRING GOODS AND SERVICES FROM NONEMPLOYEES. ASU 2018-07 ALSO CLARIFIES THAT TOPIC 718 DOES NOT APPLY TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS USED TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE (1) FINANCING TO THE  ISSUER OR (2) AWARDS GRANTED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SELLING GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AS PART OF A CONTRACT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606).

IF CONTINUED FUNDING AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE UNAVAILABLE AT REASONABLE TERMS, THE COMPANY MAY  NOT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ITS PLAN OF OPERATIONS OR TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. OUR UNAUDITED, CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  HAVE BEEN PREPARED ON THE BASIS THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE ACCOMPANYING UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE OUTCOME OF THIS UNCERTAINTY.  OFF  BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT  WE  DO NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS.  CRITICAL  ACCOUNTING POLICIES  ACCOUNTING  BASIS  OUR  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED ON THE ACCRUAL BASIS OF ACCOUNTING IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. OUR COMPANY\\u2019S FISCAL YEAR END IS SEPTEMBER 30.  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  CASH  AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ARE REPORTED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AT COST, WHICH APPROXIMATES FAIR VALUE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS CASH EQUIVALENTS INCLUDE ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.  EARNINGS  (LOSS) PER SHARE  OUR  COMPANY ADOPTED FASB ASC 260,  EARNINGS PER SHARE  . BASIC EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR COMPANY\\u2019S  NET INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING OUR COMPANY\\u2019S NET LOSS AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE DILUTED  WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. THE DILUTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING IS  THE BASIC WEIGHTED NUMBER OF SHARES ADJUSTED AS OF THE FIRST OF THE YEAR FOR ANY POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE DEBT OR EQUITY. THERE WERE  NO DILUTIVE OR POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.  INCOME  TAXES  OUR  COMPANY ADOPTED FASB ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  , AT ITS INCEPTION. UNDER FASB ASC 740, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES ATTRIBUTABLE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF  EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, INCLUDING TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS,  AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY  DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED. THE EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF A CHANGE IN TAX RATES  IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE PERIOD THAT INCLUDES THE ENACTMENT DATE. DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE CHANGE DURING  THE PERIOD IN THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. THE COMPONENTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  ARE INDIVIDUALLY CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT BASED ON THEIR CHARACTERISTICS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED BY A VALUATION  ALLOWANCE WHEN, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL  NOT BE REALIZED. A FULL VALUATION ALLOWANCE WAS USED AND NO DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES WERE RECOGNIZED AS OF DECEMBER  31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, RESPECTIVELY.  10  FAIR  VALUE OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS  THE  FAIR VALUE OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, ACCRUED LIABILITIES, AND NOTES PAYABLE APPROXIMATES THE CARRYING AMOUNT  OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DUE TO THEIR SHORT-TERM MATURITY.  USE  OF ESTIMATES  THE  PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE  OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES  DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

CAPITALIZED INTEREST  INCREASED  37%  , OR  $1.0  , DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE CARRYING VALUE OF PROJECTS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  OTHER NON-OPERATING INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, OF  $9.1  DECREASED  51%  , OR  $9.4  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON HEDGING ACTIVITIES DISCUSSED ABOVE AND LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON CASH AND CASH ITEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NON-SERVICE PENSION INCOME.  NET INCOME AND NET INCOME MARGIN  NET INCOME OF  $488.9  INCREASED  37%  , OR  $131.9  , PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING AND HIGHER VOLUMES AS WELL AS THE IMPACTS FROM THE FACILITY CLOSURE AND THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET INCOME MARGIN OF  21.7%  INCREASED  570 BP  , PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FACTORS NOTED ABOVE AS WELL AS LOWER ENERGY PASS-THROUGH AND THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION.  ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN  ADJUSTED EBITDA OF  $908.4  INCREASED  14%  , OR  $113.5  , PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING AND HIGHER VOLUMES. ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN OF  40.3%  INCREASED  460 BP  , PRIMARILY DUE TO POSITIVE PRICING, LOWER ENERGY PASS-THROUGH, AND THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION. THE LOWER ENERGY PASS-THROUGH AND THE INDIA CONTRACT MODIFICATION CONTRIBUTED 230 BP.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  EFFECTIVE TAX RATE  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE EQUALS THE INCOME TAX PROVISION DIVIDED BY INCOME BEFORE TAXES. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS  19.8%  AND  27.0%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEARS  2020  AND  2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  THE HIGHER 2019 TAX RATE REFLECTED A DISCRETE NET INCOME TAX EXPENSE OF  $40.6  RELATED TO IMPACTS FROM THE U.S. TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d). THE NET EXPENSE INCLUDED THE REVERSAL OF A NON-RECURRING  $56.2  ($.26 PER SHARE) BENEFIT RECORDED IN 2018 RELATED TO THE U.S. TAXATION OF DEEMED FOREIGN DIVIDENDS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT OF  $15.6  (  $0.07  PER SHARE) TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATES OF THE IMPACTS OF THE TAX ACT AND REDUCE THE TOTAL EXPECTED COSTS OF THE DEEMED REPATRIATION TAX. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2020. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN TAX LAW AND CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AT VARIOUS ENTITIES IN 2019.  THE ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM  19.0%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2019  TO  19.8%  IN THE  FIRST  QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR  2020  . THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN FOREIGN TAX LAW AND CHANGES IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED AT VARIOUS ENTITIES IN 2019. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EXCESS TAX BENEFITS ON SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2020.

ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (\\\"EPS\\\"), ADJUSTED EBITDA, ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN, AND ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. ON A SEGMENT BASIS, THESE MEASURES INCLUDE ADJUSTED EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA MARGIN. IN ADDITION TO THESE MEASURES, WHICH ARE PRESENTED ABOVE, WE ALSO INCLUDE CERTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT ARE PRESENTED BELOW TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT OUR NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS HAVE ON THE CALCULATION OF OUR ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS. FOR EACH NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, WE PRESENT BELOW A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE FINANCIAL MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP.  THE COMPANY'S NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE NOT MEANT TO BE CONSIDERED IN ISOLATION OR AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE MEASURE CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES PROVIDE INVESTORS, POTENTIAL INVESTORS, SECURITIES ANALYSTS, AND OTHERS WITH USEFUL INFORMATION TO EVALUATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS BECAUSE SUCH MEASURES, WHEN VIEWED TOGETHER WITH FINANCIAL RESULTS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, PROVIDE A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AND TRENDS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTED FUTURE RESULTS.  IN MANY CASES, NON-GAAP MEASURES ARE DETERMINED BY ADJUSTING THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN DISCLOSED ITEMS, OR \\u201cNON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS,\\u201d THAT THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF UNDERLYING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY EXCLUDED CERTAIN EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH COST REDUCTION ACTIONS, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AND GAINS ON DISCLOSED TRANSACTIONS. THE READER SHOULD BE AWARE THAT THE COMPANY MAY RECOGNIZE SIMILAR LOSSES OR GAINS IN THE FUTURE. READERS SHOULD ALSO CONSIDER THE LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE NON-GAAP MEASURES, INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL LACK OF COMPARABILITY OF THESE MEASURES FROM ONE COMPANY TO ANOTHER.  THE TAX IMPACT ON OUR PRE-TAX NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS REFLECTS THE EXPECTED CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX IMPACT OF OUR NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTS. THESE TAX IMPACTS ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE STATUTORY TAX RATE OF THE VARIOUS RELEVANT JURISDICTIONS AND THE TAXABILITY OF THE ADJUSTMENTS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS  THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES A RECONCILIATION TO THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS USED TO CALCULATE ADJUSTED DILUTED EPS, WHICH THE COMPANY VIEWS AS A KEY PERFORMANCE METRIC.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  FINANCIAL STATEMENT PREPARATION  THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, AND FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018, HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY STARBUCKS CORPORATION UNDER THE RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (\\u201cSEC\\u201d). IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 AND DECEMBER 30, 2018 REFLECTS ALL ADJUSTMENTS AND ACCRUALS, WHICH ARE OF A NORMAL RECURRING NATURE, NECESSARY FOR A FAIR PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE INTERIM PERIODS. IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q (\\u201c10-Q\\u201d), STARBUCKS CORPORATION IS REFERRED TO AS \\u201cSTARBUCKS,\\u201d THE \\u201cCOMPANY,\\u201d \\u201cWE,\\u201d \\u201cUS\\u201d OR \\u201cOUR.\\u201d  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE CHANGED THE CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS AND REVISED PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTATION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 WAS THE RECLASSIFICATION OF OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORE OCCUPANCY COSTS FROM COSTS OF SALES TO STORE OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $582.9  MILLION. WE ALSO MADE CERTAIN OTHER IMMATERIAL CHANGES. THERE WAS NO IMPACT TO CONSOLIDATED REVENUES, CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME, OR NET EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THESE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.  THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 IS DERIVED FROM OUR AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2019 (\\u201cFISCAL 2019\\u201d) INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 IN THE FISCAL 2019 ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K (\\u201c10-K\\u201d). THE INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS 10-Q SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FOOTNOTES AND MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE 10-K.  THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019 ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 27, 2020 (\\u201cFISCAL 2020\\u201d).  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WE ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LEASES UTILIZING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPROACH. AS A RESULT, THE PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION REPORTED UNDER THE PREVIOUS LEASE GUIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN RESTATED.  AS PERMITTED UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WE ELECTED THE PACKAGE OF PRACTICAL EXPEDIENTS, WHICH ALLOWED US TO RETAIN OUR PRIOR CONCLUSIONS REGARDING LEASE IDENTIFICATION, CLASSIFICATION AND INITIAL DIRECT COSTS. FOR OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WE ELECTED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL UNDERLYING CLASSES OF ASSETS. FOR OUR ADOPTION, WE DID NOT ELECT TO USE HINDSIGHT FOR OUR EXISTING LEASES. ADDITIONALLY, FOR SHORT-TERM LEASES WITH AN INITIAL LEASE TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS AND WITH PURCHASE OPTIONS WE ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN WILL NOT BE EXERCISED, WE ELECTED TO NOT RECORD RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS OR CORRESPONDING LEASE OBLIGATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. WE WILL CONTINUE TO RECORD RENT EXPENSE FOR EACH SHORT-TERM LEASE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM.  THE NEW GUIDANCE HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET; HOWEVER, IT DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF EARNINGS. THE MOST MATERIAL IMPACT WAS THE RECOGNITION OF RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS OF $8.4  BILLION, WITH CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITIES OF $9.0  BILLION RELATING TO OUR OPERATING LEASES. EXISTING DEFERRED RENT AND TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES OF APPROXIMATELY $568.0  MILLION, PREVIOUSLY RECORDED WITHIN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, WERE RECORDED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR GROSS OPERATING LEASE RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, PURSUANT TO THE TRANSITION GUIDANCE, WE DERECOGNIZED BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASE ASSETS, PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET, ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. ACCORDINGLY, THESE LEASES HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS OPERATING LEASES AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE AND ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE, RIGHT-OF-USE ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019. AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE, ACCUMULATED DEFICIT WITHIN SHAREHOLDER'S EQUITY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET DECREASED BY $17.3  MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DERECOGNITION OF BUILD-TO-SUIT LEASING ARRANGEMENTS.  SEE  NOTE 9  , LEASES, FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION REGARDING THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE.  IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, WE ADOPTED THE NEW GUIDANCE FROM THE FASB ON THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN TAX EFFECTS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (\\u201cAOCI\\u201d) WHICH PERMITS ENTITIES TO RECLASSIFY THE STRANDED TAX EFFECTS RESULTING FROM THE TAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT (THE \\u201cTAX ACT\\u201d) FROM AOCI TO RETAINED EARNINGS. THE GUIDANCE WAS ADOPTED PROSPECTIVELY WITH NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019.  9  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED  IN DECEMBER 2019, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY REMOVING CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES. THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2022. EARLY ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS IS PERMITTED. DEPENDING ON THE AMENDMENT, ADOPTION MAY BE APPLIED ON A RETROSPECTIVE, MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE OR PROSPECTIVE BASIS. WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS OF ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCE  FISCAL 2019  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE SOLD OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL BUSINESS IN THAILAND TO COFFEE CONCEPTS THAILAND, A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN MAXIM'S CATERERS LIMITED AND F&N RETAIL CONNECTION CO. LTD, CONVERTING THIS OPERATION TO A FULLY LICENSED MARKET. THIS TRANSACTION RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $601.9  MILLION, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN NET GAINS RESULTING FROM DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.  IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, WE SOLD OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL BUSINESSES IN FRANCE AND THE NETHERLANDS TO ALSEA, S.A.B. DE C.V. CONVERTING THESE OPERATIONS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS. THESE TRANSACTIONS DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  NOTE 3.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  INTEREST RATES  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO DESIGNATED CASH FLOW HEDGES TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN CASH FLOWS DUE TO CHANGES IN BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES. WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS AND TREASURY LOCKS, WHICH ARE SYNTHETIC FORWARD SALES OF U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES SETTLED IN CASH BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AN AGREED-UPON TREASURY RATE AND THE PREVAILING TREASURY RATE AT SETTLEMENT. THESE AGREEMENTS ARE CASH SETTLED AT THE TIME OF THE PRICING OF THE RELATED DEBT. EACH DERIVATIVE AGREEMENT'S GAIN OR LOSS IS RECORDED IN AOCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED DEBT.  TO HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT, WE ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED DEBT DUE TO CHANGES IN THE RELEVANT BENCHMARK INTEREST RATES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. REFER TO  NOTE 8  DEBT, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  FOREIGN CURRENCY  TO REDUCE CASH FLOW VOLATILITY FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, WE ENTER INTO FORWARD AND SWAP CONTRACTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOWS OF ANTICIPATED INTERCOMPANY ROYALTY PAYMENTS, INVENTORY PURCHASES, AND INTERCOMPANY BORROWING AND LENDING ACTIVITIES. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUE, COST OF SALES, OR INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURES AFFECT NET EARNINGS.  FROM TIME TO TIME, WE MAY ENTER INTO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FORWARD CONTRACTS OR FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED DEBT, TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY EXPOSURE OF OUR NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO NET EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED NET INVESTMENT IS EITHER SOLD OR SUBSTANTIALLY LIQUIDATED.  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO MITIGATE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK OF CERTAIN OTHER BALANCE SHEET ITEMS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE DERIVATIVES ARE LARGELY OFFSET BY THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF TRANSLATING FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED PAYABLES AND RECEIVABLES; THESE GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET.  COMMODITIES  DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY ENTER INTO COFFEE FORWARD CONTRACTS, FUTURES CONTRACTS, AND COLLARS TO HEDGE ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS UNDER OUR PRICE-TO-BE-FIXED GREEN COFFEE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED FURTHER IN  NOTE 5,  INVENTORIES, OR OUR LONGER-DATED FORECASTED COFFEE DEMAND WHERE UNDERLYING FIXED PRICE AND PRICE-TO-BE-FIXED CONTRACTS ARE NOT YET AVAILABLE. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF SALES WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS NET EARNINGS.  DEPENDING ON MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY ALSO ENTER INTO DAIRY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FUTURES CONTRACTS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED CASH FLOWS UNDER OUR DAIRY PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND OUR FORECASTED DAIRY DEMAND. THE RESULTING GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI AND ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF SALES WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS NET EARNINGS.  10  TABLE OF CONTENTS  TO MITIGATE THE PRICE UNCERTAINTY OF A PORTION OF OUR FUTURE PURCHASES, INCLUDING DAIRY PRODUCTS, DIESEL FUEL AND OTHER COMMODITIES, WE ENTER INTO SWAP CONTRACTS, FUTURES AND COLLARS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE RESULTING GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN INTEREST INCOME AND OTHER, NET TO HELP OFFSET PRICE FLUCTUATIONS ON OUR BEVERAGE, FOOD, PACKAGING AND TRANSPORTATION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS.

LEASES  THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT LEASE ACCOUNTING POLICIES FROM OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE ADOPTION OF FASB'S NEW GUIDANCE ON THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF LEASES.  THE MAJORITY OF OUR LEASES ARE OPERATING LEASES FOR OUR COMPANY-OPERATED RETAIL STORE LOCATIONS. WE ALSO LEASE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ROASTING, DISTRIBUTION AND WAREHOUSE FACILITIES AND OFFICE SPACE FOR CORPORATE ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. WE DO NOT ENTER INTO LEASE TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES.  WE CATEGORIZE LEASES AS EITHER OPERATING OR FINANCE LEASES AT THE COMMENCEMENT DATE OF THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS MAY CONTAIN TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES, RENT HOLIDAYS, RENT ESCALATION CLAUSES AND/OR CONTINGENT RENT PROVISIONS. WE HAVE LEASE AGREEMENTS WITH LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR TOGETHER AS A SINGLE LEASE COMPONENT FOR ALL UNDERLYING CLASSES OF ASSETS.  WE RECOGNIZE A RIGHT-OF-USE (\\u201cROU\\u201d) ASSET AND LEASE LIABILITY FOR EACH OPERATING AND FINANCE LEASE WITH A CONTRACTUAL TERM GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS AT THE TIME OF LEASE INCEPTION. WE DO NOT RECORD LEASES WITH AN INITIAL TERM OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET BUT CONTINUE TO RECORD RENT EXPENSE ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. OUR LEASES OFTEN INCLUDE OPTIONS TO EXTEND OR TERMINATE AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE DETERMINATION OF LEASE TERM WHEN THEY ARE REASONABLY CERTAIN TO BE EXERCISED.  OUR LEASE LIABILITY REPRESENTS THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS OVER THE LEASE TERM. GIVEN OUR POLICY ELECTION TO COMBINE LEASE AND NON-LEASE COMPONENTS, WE ALSO CONSIDER FIXED COMMON AREA MAINTENANCE (\\u201cCAM\\u201d) PART OF OUR FIXED FUTURE LEASE PAYMENTS; THEREFORE, FIXED CAM IS ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR LEASE LIABILITY.  WE CANNOT DETERMINE THE INTEREST RATE IMPLICIT IN EACH OF OUR LEASES. THEREFORE, WE USE MARKET AND TERM-SPECIFIC INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATES. OUR INCREMENTAL BORROWING RATE FOR A LEASE IS THE RATE OF INTEREST WE EXPECT TO PAY ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS TO BORROW AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER SIMILAR TERMS. BECAUSE WE DO NOT BORROW ON A COLLATERALIZED BASIS, WE CONSIDER A COMBINATION OF FACTORS, INCLUDING OUR CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE, THE RISK PROFILE AND FUNDING COST OF THE SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC MARKET OF THE LEASE, THE LEASE TERM AND THE EFFECT OF ADJUSTING THE RATE TO REFLECT CONSIDERATION OF COLLATERAL. OUR CREDIT-ADJUSTED RISK-FREE RATE TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION INTEREST RATES WE PAY ON OUR UNSECURED LONG-TERM BONDS AS WELL AS QUOTED INTEREST RATES OBTAINED FROM FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.  TOTAL LEASE COSTS RECORDED AS RENT AND OTHER OCCUPANCY COSTS INCLUDE FIXED OPERATING LEASE COSTS, VARIABLE LEASE COSTS AND SHORT-TERM LEASE COSTS. MOST OF OUR REAL ESTATE LEASES REQUIRE WE PAY CERTAIN EXPENSES, SUCH AS CAM COSTS, REAL ESTATE TAXES AND OTHER EXECUTORY COSTS, OF WHICH THE FIXED PORTION IS INCLUDED IN OPERATING LEASE COSTS. WE RECOGNIZE OPERATING LEASE COSTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE LEASE TERM. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE COSTS, VARIABLE LEASE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS SALES IN EXCESS OF SPECIFIED LEVELS AND ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN PROBABLE AND ARE NOT INCLUDED IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF OUR LEASE LIABILITY. OUR LEASE AGREEMENTS DO NOT CONTAIN ANY MATERIAL RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES OR MATERIAL RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS. A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF OUR LEASES ARE RELATED TO OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES, AND THEIR RELATED COSTS ARE RECORDED WITHIN STORE OPERATING EXPENSES.  THE ROU ASSET IS MEASURED AT THE INITIAL AMOUNT OF THE LEASE LIABILITY ADJUSTED FOR LEASE PAYMENTS MADE AT OR BEFORE THE LEASE COMMENCEMENT DATE, INITIAL DIRECT COSTS, AND ANY TENANT IMPROVEMENT ALLOWANCES RECEIVED. FOR OPERATING LEASES, ROU ASSETS ARE REDUCED OVER THE LEASE TERM BY THE RECOGNIZED STRAIGHT-LINE LEASE EXPENSE LESS THE AMOUNT OF ACCRETION OF THE LEASE LIABILITY DETERMINED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. FOR FINANCE LEASES, ROU ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE SHORTER OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF THE LEASED ASSET OR THE LEASE TERM. INTEREST EXPENSE ON EACH FINANCE LEASE LIABILITY IS RECOGNIZED UTILIZING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD. ROU ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN THE SAME MANNER AS LONG-LIVED ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, WE MONITOR FOR EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY REQUIRE A REASSESSMENT OF ONE OF OUR LEASES AND DETERMINE IF A REMEASUREMENT IS REQUIRED.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  ON APRIL 13, 2010, AN ORGANIZATION NAMED COUNCIL FOR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ON TOXICS (\\u201cPLAINTIFF\\u201d) FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER DEFENDANTS WHO MANUFACTURE, PACKAGE, DISTRIBUTE OR SELL BREWED COFFEE. THE LAWSUIT IS  COUNCIL FOR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ON TOXICS V. STARBUCKS CORPORATION, ET AL  . ON MAY 9, 2011, THE PLAINTIFF FILED AN ADDITIONAL LAWSUIT IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, AGAINST THE COMPANY AND ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS WHO MANUFACTURE, PACKAGE, DISTRIBUTE OR SELL PACKAGED COFFEE. THE LAWSUIT IS  COUNCIL FOR EDUCATION AND RESEARCH ON TOXICS V. BRAD BARRY LLC, ET AL  .. BOTH CASES HAVE SINCE BEEN CONSOLIDATED AND NOW INCLUDE NEARLY EIGHTY DEFENDANTS, WHICH CONSTITUTE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE COFFEE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. PLAINTIFF ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY AND THE OTHER DEFENDANTS FAILED TO PROVIDE WARNINGS FOR THEIR COFFEE PRODUCTS OF EXPOSURE TO THE CHEMICAL ACRYLAMIDE AS REQUIRED UNDER CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE SECTION 25249.5, THE CALIFORNIA SAFE DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1986, BETTER KNOWN AS PROPOSITION 65. PLAINTIFF SEEKS EQUITABLE RELIEF, INCLUDING PROVIDING WARNINGS TO CONSUMERS OF COFFEE PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS CIVIL PENALTIES IN THE AMOUNT OF THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM OF TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER DAY PER VIOLATION OF PROPOSITION 65. THE PLAINTIFF ASSERTS THAT EVERY CONSUMED CUP OF COFFEE, ABSENT A COMPLIANT WARNING, IS EQUIVALENT TO A VIOLATION UNDER PROPOSITION 65.  THE COMPANY, AS PART OF A JOINT DEFENSE GROUP ORGANIZED TO DEFEND AGAINST THE LAWSUIT, DISPUTES THE CLAIMS OF THE PLAINTIFF. ACRYLAMIDE IS NOT ADDED TO COFFEE BUT IS PRESENT IN ALL COFFEE IN SMALL AMOUNTS (PARTS PER BILLION) AS A BYPRODUCT OF THE COFFEE BEAN ROASTING PROCESS. THE COMPANY HAS ASSERTED MULTIPLE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. TRIAL OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE CASE COMMENCED ON SEPTEMBER 8, 2014, AND WAS LIMITED TO THREE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES SHARED BY ALL DEFENDANTS. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2015, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUED A FINAL RULING ADVERSE TO DEFENDANTS ON ALL PHASE 1 DEFENSES. TRIAL OF THE SECOND PHASE OF THE CASE COMMENCED IN THE FALL OF 2017. ON MAY 7, 2018, THE TRIAL COURT ISSUED A RULING ADVERSE TO DEFENDANTS ON THE PHASE 2 DEFENSE, THE COMPANY'S LAST REMAINING DEFENSE TO LIABILITY. ON JUNE 22, 2018, THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (OEHHA) PROPOSED A NEW REGULATION CLARIFYING THAT CANCER WARNINGS ARE NOT REQUIRED FOR COFFEE UNDER PROPOSITION 65. THE CASE WAS SET TO PROCEED TO A THIRD PHASE TRIAL ON DAMAGES, REMEDIES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES ON OCTOBER 15, 2018. HOWEVER, ON OCTOBER 12, 2018, THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL GRANTED THE DEFENDANTS REQUEST FOR A STAY OF THE PHASE 3 TRIAL.  ON JUNE 3, 2019, THE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW (OAL) APPROVED THE COFFEE EXEMPTION REGULATION. THE REGULATION BECAME EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2019. ON JUNE 24, 2019, THE COURT OF APPEAL LIFTED THE STAY OF THE LITIGATION. A STATUS CONFERENCE BEFORE THE TRIAL JUDGE TO DISCUSS THE MOTIONS THAT EACH PARTY HAS FILED IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 23, 2020. AT THIS STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, STARBUCKS BELIEVES THAT THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE COMPANY WILL ULTIMATELY INCUR A LOSS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LITIGATION IS REMOTE. ACCORDINGLY, NO LOSS CONTINGENCY WAS RECORDED FOR THIS MATTER.  STARBUCKS IS PARTY TO VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, INCLUDING CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION CASES THAT HAVE BEEN CERTIFIED AS CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS, BUT, EXCEPT AS NOTED ABOVE, IS NOT CURRENTLY A PARTY TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.  23  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NOTE 15.

AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, STARBUCKS HAD OVER 31,000 COMPANY-OPERATED AND LICENSED STORES, AN INCREASE OF 6% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, WE SELL A VARIETY OF CONSUMER-PACKAGED GOODS, OR CPG, PRIMARILY THROUGH THE GLOBAL COFFEE ALLIANCE ESTABLISHED WITH NESTLE\\u0301 AND OTHER PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND LONG-TERM GROWTH MODEL WILL CONTINUE TO BE DRIVEN BY NEW STORE OPENINGS, COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND MARGIN MANAGEMENT. COMPARABLE STORE SALES REPRESENT COMPANY-OPERATED STORES OPEN FOR 13 MONTHS OR LONGER AND EXCLUDE THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2019, OUR GLOBAL COMPARABLE STORE SALES GREW 5%.  WE HAVE THREE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS: AMERICAS, INTERNATIONAL, AND CHANNEL DEVELOPMENT.

THE GROWTH IN COMPANY-OPERATED STORES REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY A 5% INCREASE IN COMPARABLE STORE SALES ($245 MILLION) AND INCREMENTAL REVENUES FROM 919 NET NEW STARBUCKS  \\u00ae  COMPANY-OPERATED STORE OPENINGS, OR A 6% INCREASE, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS ($236 MILLION). PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES WERE THE CONVERSIONS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THAILAND, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS DURING FISCAL 2019 ($92 MILLION).  LICENSED STORES REVENUE GROWTH ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET REVENUES ($55 MILLION), DRIVEN BY INCREASED PRODUCT AND ROYALTY REVENUES FROM OUR LICENSEES ($39 MILLION), PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM THE OPENING OF 1,008 NET NEW STARBUCKS  \\u00ae  LICENSED STORES, OR A 7% INCREASE, OVER THE PAST 12 MONTHS, AND THE CONVERSIONS OF OUR RETAIL BUSINESSES IN THAILAND, FRANCE, AND THE NETHERLANDS TO FULLY LICENSED MARKETS ($21 MILLION).

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED $4 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREMENTAL COSTS TO DEVELOP AND GROW THE GLOBAL COFFEE ALLIANCE ($5 MILLION).  GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $14 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING THE 2018 U.S STOCK AWARD GRANTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, WHICH WAS FUNDED BY SAVINGS FROM THE TAX ACT AND VESTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019 ($23 MILLION), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREMENTAL STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY.  RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSES DECREASED $37 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING PRIOR YEAR SEVERANCE COSTS ($24 MILLION) AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN THE U.S ($10 MILLION) AND LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF CERTAIN COMPANY-OPERATED STORES ($4 MILLION).  INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED $6 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED COMPARABLE STORE SALES FROM OUR JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS IN SOUTH KOREA AND HIGHER INCOME FROM OUR NORTH AMERICAN COFFEE PARTNERSHIP JOINT VENTURE.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LAPPING THE RELEASE OF INCOME TAX RESERVES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A U.S. TAX EXAMINATION (APPROXIMATELY 350 BASIS POINTS), LOWER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXCESS TAX BENEFIT (APPROXIMATELY 220 BASIS POINTS), LAPPING THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN DERIVED INTANGIBLE INCOME PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR NESTLE\\u0301 TRANSACTION (APPROXIMATELY 130 BASIS POINTS) AND LAPPING OTHER IMMATERIAL TRUE-UPS.

WE ACTIVELY MANAGE OUR CASH AND INVESTMENTS IN ORDER TO INTERNALLY FUND OPERATING NEEDS, MAKE SCHEDULED INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON OUR BORROWINGS, MAKE ACQUISITIONS, AND RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY INCLUDES HIGHLY LIQUID AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, INCLUDING GOVERNMENT TREASURY SECURITIES (FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC) AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION OF CASH WAS HELD IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.  BORROWING CAPACITY  OUR $2.0 BILLION UNSECURED 5-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201c2018 CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) AND OUR $1.0 BILLION UNSECURED 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY (THE \\u201c364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY\\u201d) ARE AVAILABLE FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  THE 2018 CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH $150 MILLION MAY BE USED FOR ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, IS CURRENTLY SET TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 25, 2022. WE HAVE THE OPTION, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATED BANKS, TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT AMOUNT BY AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON LIBOR, AND, FOR U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASE RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY), IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN IS BASED ON THE BETTER OF (I) THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM CREDIT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY MOODY'S AND STANDARD & POOR'S RATING AGENCIES AND (II) THE COMPANY'S FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, PURSUANT TO A PRICING GRID SET FORTH IN THE FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CURRENT APPLICABLE MARGIN IS 0.910% FOR EUROCURRENCY RATE LOANS AND 0.000% (NIL) FOR BASE RATE LOANS.  THE 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH NO AMOUNT MAY BE USED FOR ISSUANCES OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, IS CURRENTLY SET TO MATURE ON OCTOBER 21, 2020. WE HAVE THE OPTION, SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION AND AGREEMENT WITH THE RELATED BANKS, TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM COMMITMENT AMOUNT BY AN ADDITIONAL $500 MILLION. BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITY WILL BEAR INTEREST AT A VARIABLE RATE BASED ON LIBOR, AND, FOR U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED LOANS UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASE RATE (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT FACILITY), IN EACH CASE PLUS AN APPLICABLE MARGIN. THE APPLICABLE MARGIN IS 0.920% FOR EUROCURRENCY RATE LOANS AND 0.000% (NIL) FOR BASE RATE LOANS.  BOTH CREDIT FACILITIES CONTAIN PROVISIONS REQUIRING US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING A MINIMUM FIXED CHARGE COVERAGE RATIO, WHICH MEASURES OUR ABILITY TO COVER FINANCING EXPENSES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD NO BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AND WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE COVENANTS RELATED TO OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, WE MAY ISSUE UNSECURED COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES UP TO A MAXIMUM AGGREGATE AMOUNT OUTSTANDING AT ANY TIME OF $3.0 BILLION, WITH INDIVIDUAL MATURITIES THAT MAY VARY BUT NOT EXCEED 397 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF ISSUE. AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM ARE REQUIRED TO BE BACKSTOPPED BY AVAILABLE COMMITMENTS UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM MAY BE USED FOR WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, BUSINESS EXPANSION, PAYMENT OF CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND SHARE REPURCHASES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE HAD BORROWINGS OF $497.9 MILLION OUTSTANDING, NET OF UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM.  SEE  NOTE 8  ,  DEBT, TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN ITEM 1 OF PART I OF THIS 10-Q FOR DETAILS OF THE COMPONENTS OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT.  THE INDENTURES UNDER WHICH ALL OF OUR SENIOR NOTES WERE ISSUED REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN COMPLIANCE WITH CERTAIN COVENANTS, INCLUDING LIMITS ON FUTURE LIENS AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS ON CERTAIN MATERIAL PROPERTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE COVENANTS.  USE OF CASH  WE EXPECT TO USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH AND INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ADDITIONAL POTENTIAL FUTURE BORROWINGS UNDER THE CREDIT FACILITIES, COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM AND THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT, TO INVEST IN OUR CORE BUSINESSES, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, NEW PRODUCT INNOVATIONS, RELATED MARKETING SUPPORT AND PARTNER AND DIGITAL INVESTMENTS, RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH COMMON STOCK CASH DIVIDEND PAYMENTS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, AS WELL AS OTHER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO OUR CORE AND DEVELOPING BUSINESSES. FURTHER, WE MAY USE OUR AVAILABLE CASH RESOURCES TO MAKE PROPORTIONATE CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR INVESTEES. WE MAY ALSO SEEK STRATEGIC ACQUISITIONS TO LEVERAGE EXISTING CAPABILITIES AND FURTHER BUILD OUR BUSINESS IN SUPPORT OF OUR GROWTH-AT-SCALE AGENDA. ACQUISITIONS MAY INCLUDE INCREASING OUR OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN OUR INVESTEES. ANY DECISIONS TO INCREASE SUCH OWNERSHIP INTERESTS WILL BE DRIVEN BY VALUATION AND FIT WITH OUR OWNERSHIP STRATEGY.  WE BELIEVE THAT FUTURE CASH FLOWS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS AND EXISTING CASH AND INVESTMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY COMBINED WITH OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE OUR BALANCE SHEET THROUGH THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FINANCE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CORE BUSINESSES AS WELL AS SHAREHOLDER DISTRIBUTIONS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SIGNIFICANT NEW JOINT VENTURES, ACQUISITIONS AND/OR OTHER NEW BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL OUTSIDE FUNDING. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL BORROWINGS WOULD RESULT IN INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE FUTURE. IN THIS REGARD, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL DEBT, WITHIN TARGETED LEVELS, AS PART OF OUR PLANS TO FUND OUR CAPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING CASH RETURNS TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.  WE REGULARLY REVIEW OUR CASH POSITIONS AND OUR DETERMINATION OF INDEFINITE REINVESTMENT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. IN THE EVENT WE DETERMINE THAT ALL OR A PORTION OF SUCH FOREIGN EARNINGS ARE NO LONGER INDEFINITELY REINVESTED, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES AND U.S. STATE INCOME TAXES, WHICH COULD BE MATERIAL. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE THE NEED FOR REPATRIATED FUNDS TO THE U.S. TO SATISFY DOMESTIC LIQUIDITY NEEDS.  DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECLARED A QUARTERLY CASH DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF $0.41 PER SHARE TO BE PAID ON FEBRUARY 21, 2020 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS ON FEBRUARY 6, 2020.  WE REPURCHASED 13.0 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK FOR $1.1 BILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2019 UNDER OUR ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. AS OF DECEMBER 29, 2019, 16.2 MILLION SHARES REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE UNDER CURRENT AUTHORIZATIONS.  OTHER THAN NORMAL OPERATING EXPENSES, CASH REQUIREMENTS FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR NEW AND EXISTING STORES AND OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND CORPORATE FACILITIES. TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR FISCAL 2020 ARE EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION.  CASH FLOWS  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES WAS $1.8 BILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, COMPARED TO $2.4 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF TAX PAYMENTS AND REFUNDS.  CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 TOTALED $0.4 BILLION, COMPARED TO CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES OF $0.5 BILLION FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN FISCAL 2019. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS.  CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020 AND FISCAL 2019 TOTALED $1.1 BILLION AND $5.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHANGE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS IN FISCAL 2019.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS  IN MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INCLUDED IN THE 10-K, WE DISCLOSED THAT WE HAD $28.2 BILLION IN TOTAL CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2019. THERE HAVE BEEN NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO OUR TOTAL OBLIGATIONS DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS 10-Q OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS.

COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS  COMMODITY PRICE RISK REPRESENTS OUR PRIMARY MARKET RISK, GENERATED BY OUR PURCHASES OF GREEN COFFEE AND DAIRY PRODUCTS, AMONG OTHER ITEMS. WE PURCHASE, ROAST AND SELL HIGH-QUALITY  ARABICA  COFFEE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND RISK ARISES FROM THE PRICE VOLATILITY OF GREEN COFFEE. IN ADDITION TO COFFEE, WE ALSO PURCHASE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT THE NEEDS OF OUR COMPANY-OPERATED STORES. THE PRICE AND AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMMODITIES DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND WE EXPECT COMMODITY PRICES, PARTICULARLY COFFEE, TO IMPACT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS, SEE PRODUCT SUPPLY IN ITEM 1 OF THE 10-K, AS WELL AS RISK FACTORS IN ITEM 1A OF THE 10-K.  SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS  OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO MODERATE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, OF WHICH OUR FISCAL SECOND QUARTER TYPICALLY EXPERIENCES LOWER REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME. ADDITIONALLY, AS OUR STORED VALUE CARDS ARE ISSUED TO AND LOADED BY CUSTOMERS DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON, WE TEND TO HAVE HIGHER CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE FISCAL YEAR. HOWEVER, SINCE REVENUES FROM OUR STORED VALUE CARDS ARE RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION AND NOT WHEN CASH IS LOADED, THE IMPACT OF SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED. AS A RESULT OF MODERATE SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS, RESULTS FOR ANY QUARTER ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS THAT MAY BE ACHIEVED FOR THE FULL FISCAL YEAR.

GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, COUPLED WITH THE U.S. POLITICAL CLIMATE, HAVE CREATED UNCERTAINTY AND IMPACTED DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY IN OUR SECURITY AND HEALTHCARE DIVISIONS. THE CURRENT STATUS AND POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR UK BUSINESS, INCLUDING OUR ORDERS AND SALES OPERATIONS AND PERSONNEL IN THE UK. WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THIS UNCERTAINTY WILL CONTINUE. THEREFORE, WE EXPECT THAT THERE MAY BE A PERIOD OF DELAYED OR DEFERRED PURCHASING BY OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE FACTORS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR TOTAL REVENUE AND EXPENSES. MANY OF THESE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE DENOMINATED IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR, AND, AS A RESULT, MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.  \\u200b  GLOBAL TRADE.  THE CURRENT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING EXISTING AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO U.S. AND FOREIGN POLICIES RELATED TO GLOBAL TRADE AND TARIFFS, HAVE RESULTED IN UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE FUTURE STATE OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. FURTHER, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT SANCTIONS WOULD BE IMPOSED AGAINST CERTAIN BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS IN SELECT COUNTRIES. ADDITIONAL CHANGES MAY REQUIRE US TO MODIFY OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PRACTICES AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN ANY PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD.  HEALTHCARE CONSIDERATIONS.  OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED IN PRIOR PERIODS BY DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT LAUNCHES IN OUR HEALTHCARE DIVISION. THESE ISSUES MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL PERIODS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS EFFORTS ADVANCED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS TO REPEAL AND REPLACE OR MODIFY THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, WHICH HAS CREATED UNCERTAINTY IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY THAT HAS ADVERSELY IMPACTED, AND MAY CONTINUE TO ADVERSELY IMPACT, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \\u200b  EUROPEAN UNION THREAT DETECTION STANDARDS.  THE EU HAS IMPLEMENTED REGULATIONS FOR ALL AIRPORTS WITHIN THE EU TO HAVE HOLD BAGGAGE SCREENING SYSTEMS THAT ARE COMPLIANT WITH THE EUROPEAN CIVIL AVIATION CONFERENCE (ECAC) STANDARD 3 BY SEPTEMBER 2020. HOWEVER, THIS DEADLINE COULD POTENTIALLY BE DELAYED. OUR SECURITY DIVISION'S REAL TIME TOMOGRAPHY (RTT) PRODUCT HAS PASSED THE ECAC EXPLOSIVE DETECTION SYSTEM STANDARD 3 THREAT DETECTION REQUIREMENT.  \\u200b  GOVERNMENT POLICIES.  OUR NET INCOME COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN U.S. OR FOREIGN GOVERNMENT TAX POLICIES, SUCH AS THE TAX ACT, THE IMPLICATIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. WE ATTEMPT TO MANAGE OUR CURRENCY EXPOSURE IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THE LIBOR INDEX IS EXPECTED TO BE DISCONTINUED BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2021. UNDER OUR CREDIT FACILITY, IF THE LIBOR INDEX IS DISCONTINUED, THE TERMS OF OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOW FOR A  29  TABLE OF CONTENTS  REPLACEMENT RATE TO BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AGREEMENT.  CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES IN THESE AREAS MIGHT IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  \\u200b  MEXICO SAT CONTRACT.  OUR CONTRACT WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE A TURNKEY SECURITY SCREENING SOLUTION AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN JANUARY 2020 WAS EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 13, 2020. WHILE WE ARE ACTIVELY IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT FOR A POTENTIALLY BROADER PROGRAM, WE CANNOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCE THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL BE CONTINUED AND, IF THE PROGRAM IS CONTINUED, UPON WHAT TERMS.  IF THE PROGRAM IS DISCONTINUED OR CONTINUED UPON MODIFIED TERMS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED.  \\u200b  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 (Q2 2019) COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 (Q2 2020) (AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS)  \\u200b  NET REVENUES  \\u200b  THE TABLE BELOW AND THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS ARE BASED UPON THE WAY IN WHICH WE ANALYZE OUR BUSINESS.

SG&A EXPENSE FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS LOWER THAN THE PRIOR COMPARABLE PERIOD PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED COMPENSATION COSTS.  \\u200b  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH RELATED TO NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT ENHANCEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN R&D SPENDING DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 FROM THE SAME PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD REFLECTED INCREASED SPENDING IN OUR SECURITY DIVISION PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.  \\u200b  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES (BENEFIT).  RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER CHARGES GENERALLY CONSIST OF CHARGES RELATED TO REDUCTIONS IN OUR WORKFORCE, FACILITY CONSOLIDATION, COSTS RELATED TO ACQUISITION ACTIVITY, LEGAL CHARGES AND OTHER NON-RECURRING CHARGES. THE NET BENEFIT IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2019 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A RECOVERY OF CERTAIN LEGAL COSTS THROUGH INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EMPLOYEE TERMINATION AND BUSINESS EXIT COSTS FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES IN OUR HEALTHCARE DIVISION. THE NET BENEFIT IN THE SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2020 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A FURTHER RECOVERY OF CERTAIN LEGAL COSTS THROUGH INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL LEGAL FEES AND SEVERANCE COSTS FOR HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS.  \\u200b  OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES  \\u200b  INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, INTEREST AND OTHER EXPENSE, NET WAS $4.8 MILLION AS COMPARED TO $5.6 MILLION IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER LEVELS OF BORROWING UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AS WELL AS LOWER AVERAGE INTEREST RATES DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CURRENT-YEAR PERIOD INCLUDED $2.2 MILLION OF NON-CASH INTEREST EXPENSE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE NOTES (SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION) COMPARED TO $2.0 MILLION DURING THE COMPARABLE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.  \\u200b  INCOME TAXES.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR A PARTICULAR PERIOD VARIES DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING (I) THE MIX OF INCOME EARNED IN VARIOUS TAX JURISDICTIONS, EACH OF WHICH APPLIES A UNIQUE RANGE OF INCOME TAX RATES AND INCOME TAX CREDITS, (II) CHANGES IN PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED VALUATION ALLOWANCES FOR DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (CHANGES ARE BASED UPON OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS OF THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL BE REALIZED), (III) THE LEVEL OF NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXPENSES, (IV) CERTAIN TAX ELECTIONS AND (V) TAX HOLIDAYS GRANTED TO CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $95.1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, A DECREASE OF $1.3 MILLION, OR 1.3%, FROM $96.3 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE GENERATED $59.6 MILLION OF CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS. WE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT OUR AVAILABLE FUNDS, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND CREDIT FACILITIES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OUR OPERATIONAL CASH NEEDS FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  \\u200b  OUR CURRENT REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY ALLOWS US TO BORROW UP TO $535 MILLION AND MATURES IN APRIL 2024. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THERE WAS $91.0 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND $53.7 MILLION OUTSTANDING UNDER THE LETTERS-OF-CREDIT SUB-FACILITY.  \\u200b  CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES.  CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS NET INCOME, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH ITEMS, AND WORKING CAPITAL FLUCTUATIONS IMPACT CASH FLOWS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE GENERATED $59.6 MILLION OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS COMPARED TO $40.8 MILLION IN THE SAME PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS DRIVEN BY AN IMPROVEMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL AS WELL AS HIGHER NET INCOME.  \\u200b  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS $15.6 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO $31.5 MILLION USED FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE USED CASH OF $11.6 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND $3.9 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, WE USED CASH OF $17.5 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF AN OPTOELECTRONICS SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND $0.8 MILLION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF A SECURITY SERVICES BUSINESS AND WE USED CASH OF $12.6 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.  \\u200b  CASH (USED IN) PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES.  NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $45.9 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 COMPARED TO NET CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $3.1 MILLION FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, OUR PRIMARY USES IN FINANCING WERE $53.7 MILLION FOR REPURCHASES OF OUR COMMON SHARES AND TAX PAYMENTS RELATED TO NET SHARE SETTLEMENTS OF EQUITY AWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $3.0 MILLION OF NET BORROWINGS ON OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND $6.1 MILLION OF PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS AND THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF FINANCING WAS $36.0 MILLION BORROWED UNDER OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THIS SOURCE OF FUNDS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $34.0 MILLION USED FOR SHARE REPURCHASES AND TAXES PAID RELATED TO THE NET SHARE SETTLEMENT OF EQUITY AWARDS.  \\u200b  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BORROWINGS  \\u200b  SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A DETAILED DISCUSSION REGARDING OUR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OUR NOTES.  \\u200b  CASH HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES  \\u200b  OUR CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS TOTALED $95.1 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2019. OF THIS AMOUNT, APPROXIMATELY 82% WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND SUBJECT TO REPATRIATION TAX CONSIDERATIONS. THESE FOREIGN FUNDS WERE HELD PRIMARILY BY OUR SUBSIDIARIES IN SINGAPORE, THE UNITED KINGDOM, MALAYSIA AND CANADA AND TO A LESSER EXTENT IN MEXICO, GERMANY, INDIA, AND ALBANIA AMONG OTHERS. WE INTEND TO PERMANENTLY REINVEST CERTAIN EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS, AND WE CURRENTLY DO NOT ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL NEED THIS CASH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO FUND OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. IN THE EVENT WE REPATRIATE CASH FROM CERTAIN FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND TAXES HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN WITHHELD ON THE RELATED EARNINGS, WE WOULD PROVIDE FOR WITHHOLDING TAXES AT THE TIME WE CHANGE OUR INTENTION WITH REGARD TO THE REINVESTMENT OF THOSE EARNINGS.  \\u200b  ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES  \\u200b  THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS INFORMATION ABOUT THE SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WE PURCHASED DURING THE QUARTER ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019.  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  MAXIMUM NUMBER (OR  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  APPROXIMATE DOLLAR  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  VALUE) OF  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  TOTAL NUMBER OF  \\u200b  SHARES (OR  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  SHARES (OR UNITS)  \\u200b  UNITS)  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  PURCHASED AS  \\u200b  THAT MAY  \\u200b  \\u200b  TOTAL NUMBER OF  \\u200b  AVERAGE PRICE  \\u200b  PART OF PUBLICLY  \\u200b  YET BE PURCHASED  \\u200b  \\u200b  SHARES (OR UNITS)  \\u200b  PAID PER SHARE (OR  \\u200b  ANNOUNCED PLANS OR  \\u200b  UNDER THE PLANS OR  \\u200b  PURCHASED  UNIT)  PROGRAMS  PROGRAMS (1)  OCTOBER 1 TO OCTOBER 31, 2019  13,894  \\u200b  $99.66  13,894  422,762  NOVEMBER 1 TO NOVEMBER 30, 2019  114,556  \\u200b  \\u200b  97.14  114,556  308,206  DECEMBER 1 TO DECEMBER 31, 2019  12,373  \\u200b  \\u200b  98.56  12,373  295,833  \\u200b  140,823  \\u200b  \\u200b  \\u200b  140,823  \\u200b  \\u200b  (1)  IN MARCH 2018, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM OF UP TO ONE MILLION SHARES.

AND ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY, ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC.  CORPORATE OVERVIEW  ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC., (TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARY, THE  \\u201cCOMPANY\\u201d OR \\u201cARCH\\u201d) WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEVADA ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2009, UNDER  THE NAME \\u201cALMAH, INC.\\u201d. EFFECTIVE JUNE 26, 2013, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A MERGER (THE \\u201cMERGER\\u201d) WITH ARCH  BIOSURGERY, INC. (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC.), A MASSACHUSETTS CORPORATION (\\u201cABS\\u201d), AND ARCH ACQUISITION  CORPORATION (\\u201cMERGER SUB\\u201d), THE COMPANY\\u2019S WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY FORMED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE TRANSACTION,  PURSUANT TO WHICH MERGER SUB MERGED WITH AND INTO ABS AND ABS THEREBY BECAME THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT  OF THE ACQUISITION OF ABS, THE COMPANY ABANDONED ITS PRIOR BUSINESS PLAN AND CHANGED ITS OPERATIONS TO THE BUSINESS OF A BIOTECHNOLOGY  COMPANY. OUR PRINCIPAL OFFICES ARE LOCATED IN FRAMINGHAM, MASSACHUSETTS.  FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, THE MERGER REPRESENTED A \\u201cREVERSE  MERGER\\u201d. ABS WAS DEEMED TO BE THE ACCOUNTING ACQUIRER IN THE TRANSACTION AND THE PREDECESSOR OF ARCH. CONSEQUENTLY, THE ACCUMULATED  DEFICIT AND THE HISTORICAL OPERATIONS THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRIOR TO THE  MERGER ARE THOSE OF ABS. ALL SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RESTATED TO REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. THE COMPANY\\u2019S FINANCIAL  INFORMATION HAS BEEN CONSOLIDATED WITH THAT OF ABS AFTER CONSUMMATION OF THE MERGER ON JUNE 26, 2013, AND THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY BEFORE THE MERGER HAVE BEEN REPLACED WITH THE HISTORICAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ABS BEFORE THE MERGER  IN THIS REPORT.  ABS WAS INCORPORATED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS  ON MARCH 6, 2006 AS CLEAR NANO SOLUTIONS, INC. ON APRIL 7, 2008, ABS CHANGED ITS NAME FROM CLEAR NANO SOLUTIONS, INC. TO ARCH THERAPEUTICS,  INC. EFFECTIVE UPON THE CLOSING OF THE MERGER, ABS CHANGED ITS NAME FROM ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. TO ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC.  20  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  WE ARE A BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANY IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE. WE  HAVE GENERATED NO REVENUES TO DATE AND ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR OPERATIONAL EFFORTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CORE  TECHNOLOGY. WE ARE DEVELOPING A NOVEL APPROACH TO STOP BLEEDING (\\u201cHEMOSTASIS\\u201d), CONTROL LEAKING (\\u201cSEALANT\\u201d)  AND MANAGE WOUNDS DURING SURGERY, TRAUMA AND INTERVENTIONAL CARE. ARCH IS DEVELOPING PRODUCTS BASED ON AN INNOVATIVE SELF-ASSEMBLING  BARRIER TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING CARE FASTER AND SAFER FOR PATIENTS. WE BELIEVE OUR TECHNOLOGY COULD SUPPORT  AN INNOVATIVE PLATFORM OF POTENTIAL PRODUCTS IN THE FIELD OF STASIS AND BARRIER APPLICATIONS. OUR PLAN AND BUSINESS MODEL IS TO  DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT APPLY THAT CORE TECHNOLOGY FOR USE WITH BODILY FLUIDS AND TISSUES.  TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS PRINCIPALLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH  BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND UNITS CONSISTING OF ITS COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (\\u201cCOMMON  STOCK\\u201d), AND WARRANTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE RELATING TO THE RESEARCH,  DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL TRIALS, AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF ITS POTENTIAL PRODUCTS. AS OF JANUARY 29, 2020, WE BELIEVE THAT OUR CURRENT  CASH ON HAND WILL MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO  RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL, OBTAIN ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT, OR BOTH, IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OPERATIONS. THERE  CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE  COMPANY, IF AT ALL. THEREFORE, THERE EXISTS SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN.  OUR FLAGSHIP DEVELOPMENT STAGE PRODUCT CANDIDATES, KNOWN COLLECTIVELY  AS THE AC5  \\u00ae  DEVICES (WHICH WE SOMETIMES REFER TO AS \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  \\u201d \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL GEL\\u201d, \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  SURGICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE\\u201d, \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  SURGICAL HEMOSTAT\\u201d,  \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL HEMOSTATIC DEVICE\\u201d, OR \\u201cAC5  \\u00ae  TOPICAL HEMOSTAT\\u201d), ARE BEING  DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE HEMOSTASIS DURING SURGICAL, WOUND AND INTERVENTIONAL CARE. THEY RELY ON OUR SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE (\\u201cSAP\\u201d)  TECHNOLOGY AND ARE BEING DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE HEMOSTASIS IN SKIN WOUNDS AND IN MINIMALLY INVASIVE AND OPEN SURGICAL PROCEDURES.  WE INTEND TO DEVELOP OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATES BASED ON OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM FOR USE IN A RANGE OF INDICATIONS. AC5 IS BEING  DESIGNED AS A PRODUCT CONTAINING SYNTHETIC BIOCOMPATIBLE PEPTIDES COMPRISING L-AMINO ACIDS, COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS NATURALLY  OCCURRING AMINO ACIDS. WHEN APPLIED TO A WOUND, AC5 INTERCALATES INTO THE INTERSTICES OF THE CONNECTIVE TISSUE WHERE IT SELF-ASSEMBLES  INTO A PHYSICAL, MECHANICAL NANOSCALE STRUCTURE THAT PROVIDES A BARRIER TO LEAKING SUBSTANCES, SUCH AS BLOOD. AC5 MAY BE APPLIED  DIRECTLY AS A LIQUID, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL MAKE IT USER-FRIENDLY AND ABLE TO CONFORM TO IRREGULAR WOUND GEOMETRY. ADDITIONALLY,  AC5 DOES NOT POSSESS STICKY OR GLUE-LIKE HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE ITS UTILITY IN SEVERAL SETTINGS,  INCLUDING MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES. FURTHER, IN CERTAIN SETTINGS, AC5 LENDS ITSELF TO A CONCEPT THAT WE CALL CRYSTAL  CLEAR SURGERYTM; THE TRANSPARENCY AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF AC5 MAY ENABLE A SURGEON TO OPERATE THROUGH IT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN  A CLEARER FIELD OF VISION AND PROPHYLACTICALLY STOP OR LESSEN BLEEDING AS IT STARTS.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE RESULTS OF EARLY DATA FROM PRECLINICAL TESTS  AS WELL AS CERTAIN CLINICAL INVESTIGATIONS HAVE SHOWN QUICK AND EFFECTIVE HEMOSTASIS WITH THE USE OF AC5 RELATIVE TO THAT REPORTED  WITH OTHER TYPES OF HEMOSTATIC AGENTS, AND THAT TIME TO HEMOSTASIS IS COMPARABLE AMONG TEST SUBJECTS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH  TEST SUBJECT HAD OR HAD NOT BEEN TREATED WITH THERAPEUTIC DOSES OF ANTICOAGULANT OR ANTIPLATELET MEDICATIONS, COMMONLY CALLED \\u201cBLOOD  THINNERS\\u201d. BASED ON TESTING RESULTS, WE BELIEVE THAT AC5 IS BIOCOMPATIBLE. ARCH THERAPEUTICS\\u2019 TECHNOLOGY HAS DEMONSTRATED  HEMOSTASIS IN LIVER AND OTHER ORGANS IN  IN VIVO  SURGICAL MODELS, INCLUDING RAPID HEMOSTASIS WITHIN 15 SECONDS. IN A RANGE  OF SMALL AND LARGE ANIMAL MODELS, OUR SAP COMPOSITIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO STOP BLEEDING, SEAL LEAKING, ALLOW FOR NORMAL HEALING,  AND MITIGATE INFLAMMATION WHILE BEING BIOCOMPATIBLE.  WE HAVE DEVOTED MUCH OF OUR OPERATIONAL EFFORT TO DATE TO THE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR CORE TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING SELECTING OUR INITIAL PRODUCT COMPOSITION, CONDUCTING SAFETY AND OTHER  RELATED TESTS, CONDUCTING A HUMAN TRIAL FOR SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF AC5, DEVELOPING METHODS FOR MANUFACTURING SCALE-UP, REPRODUCIBILITY,  AND VALIDATION, AND DEVELOPING AND PROTECTING THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS UNDERLYING OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM. MANUFACTURING  METHOD AND FORMULATION OPTIMIZATION AND VALIDATION ARE IMPORTANT PARTS OF PEPTIDE DEVELOPMENT. MANUFACTURING AND FORMULATION OPTIMIZATION  FOR OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES HAS BEEN AND CONTINUES TO BE DONE WITH EXTENSIVE COLLABORATION AMONG OUR TEAM AND PARTNERS. THE PROCESSES  ARE FOCUSED ON OPTIMIZING TRADITIONAL PRODUCT PARAMETERS TO TARGET SPECIFICATIONS COVERING PERFORMANCE, BIOCOMPATIBILITY, PHYSICAL  APPEARANCE, STABILITY, AND HANDLING CHARACTERISTICS, AMONG OTHERS. WE AND OUR PARTNERS INTEND TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR MANUFACTURING  PROCESSES AND FORMULATION METHODS CLOSELY, AS SUCCESS OR FAILURE IN BOTH SETTING AND REALIZING APPROPRIATE SPECIFICATIONS MAY DIRECTLY  IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL TRIALS AS WE ESTABLISH AND EXECUTE OUR COMMERCIALIZATION EFFORTS.  OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS PLAN INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING GOALS.  \\u00b7  CONDUCTING BIOCOMPATIBILITY, PRE-CLINICAL, AND CLINICAL STUDIES ON AC5 AND RELATED PRODUCTS;  \\u00b7  EXPANDING AND MAINTAINING PROTECTION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO;  \\u00b7  DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS TO MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTE, MARKET AND OTHERWISE COMMERCIALIZE AC5;  \\u00b7  OBTAINING REGULATORY CERTIFICATION OR CLEARANCE OF AC5 AND RELATED PRODUCTS IN THE EU, THE U.S., AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS AS WE MAY DETERMINE;  \\u00b7  CONTINUING OR DEVELOPING ACADEMIC, SCIENTIFIC AND INSTITUTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS TO COLLABORATE ON PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND  \\u00b7  DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL PRODUCT CANDIDATES IN THE HEMOSTATIC, SEALANT, AND/OR OTHER FIELDS.  21  IN FURTHERANCE OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS GOALS, WE EXPECT TO  CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING ACTIVITIES DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS.  \\u00b7  SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING AS REQUIRED TO SUPPORT THE MILESTONES DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY AND OUR OPERATIONS GENERALLY;  \\u00b7  WORK WITH OUR LARGE SCALE MANUFACTURING PARTNERS TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION OF PRODUCT COMPLIANT WITH CURRENT GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES (\\u201cCGMP\\u201d), WHICH ACTIVITIES WILL BE ONGOING AS WE SEEK TO ADVANCE TOWARD, ENTER INTO, AND, IF SUCCESSFUL, SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASE COMMERCIALIZATION ACTIVITIES;  \\u00b7  FURTHER CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCT PLATFORM;  \\u00b7  PURSUE REGULATORY CLEARANCE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION;  \\u00b7  CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL REPORTING AND CONTROLS;  \\u00b7  SEEK COMMERCIAL PARTNERSHIPS;  \\u00b7  EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PORTFOLIO BY FILING NEW PATENT APPLICATIONS, OBTAINING ALLOWANCES ON CURRENTLY FILED PATENT APPLICATIONS, AND/OR ADDING TO OUR TRADE SECRETS IN SELF-ASSEMBLY, MANUFACTURING, ANALYTICAL METHODS AND FORMULATION, WHICH ACTIVITIES WILL BE ONGOING AS WE SEEK TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATE PORTFOLIO;  \\u00b7  OBTAIN REGULATORY INPUT INTO SUBSEQUENT CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNS;  \\u00b7  ASSESS OUR SELF-ASSEMBLING PEPTIDE PLATFORMS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY AND SELECT PRODUCT CANDIDATES FOR ADVANCEMENT INTO DEVELOPMENT.  WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS CASH ON HAND TO MEET ITS ANTICIPATED  CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. NOTWITHSTANDING THIS, DEPENDING UPON ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM EU AND US REGULATORY  AUTHORITIES, WE MAY NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL BEFORE THEN. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING, OUR ESTIMATED CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  POTENTIALLY COULD INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IF A NUMBER OF RISKS RELATING TO CONDUCTING THESE ACTIVITIES WERE TO OCCUR, INCLUDING  WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING \\u201c  RISK FACTORS  \\u201d IN THIS FILING.  MERGER WITH ABS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES  AS NOTED EARLIER IN THIS DOCUMENT, ON JUNE 26, 2013, THE COMPANY  COMPLETED THE MERGER WITH ABS, PURSUANT TO WHICH ABS BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. IN CONTEMPLATION OF THE MERGER,  EFFECTIVE MAY 24, 2013, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS AUTHORIZED COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $0.001 PER SHARE (\\u201cCOMMON STOCK\\u201d),  FROM 75,000,000 SHARES TO 300,000,000 SHARES AND EFFECTED A FORWARD STOCK SPLIT, BY WAY OF A STOCK DIVIDEND, OF ITS ISSUED AND  OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AT A RATIO OF 11 SHARES TO EACH ONE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARE. ALSO, IN CONTEMPLATION OF  THE MERGER, EFFECTIVE JUNE 5, 2013, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS NAME FROM ALMAH, INC. TO ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND CHANGED THE TICKER  SYMBOL UNDER WHICH ITS COMMON STOCK TRADES ON THE OTC BULLETIN BOARD FROM \\u201cAACH\\u201d TO \\u201cARTH\\u201d.  22  LIGUIDITY  WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND HAVE GENERATED NO OPERATING  REVENUES TO DATE. ON DECEMBER 17, 2018, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE 510(K) PREMARKET NOTIFICATION FOR AC5 TM TOPICAL GEL HAS BEEN  REVIEWED AND CLEARED BY THE FDA, ALLOWING FOR THE PRODUCT TO BE MARKETED. WE DEVOTE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR EFFORTS ON FUNDRAISING,  PLANNING AND CONDUCTING CLINICAL TRIALS, ACTIVITIES IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING REGULATORY APPROVAL, AND PRODUCT RESEARCH. FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD A NET LOSS OF $1,659,754 VERSUS A NET LOSS OF $2,600,237 IN THE COMPARABLE PERIOD  IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES,  INCLUDING REGULATORY APPROVAL AND PRODUCT RESEARCH, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO STOCK BASED COMPENSATION.  THE LOSS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 CAN BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, INCLUDING REGULATORY  APPROVAL AND PRODUCT RESEARCH, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PRIMARILY RELATING TO LEGAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY AND PATENT APPLICATION COSTS, GENERAL CORPORATE LEGAL EXPENSES AND BY AN ADJUSTMENT OF $832,413, TO THE DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $509, DURING THE  THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 TO $1,321,648, COMPARED TO $1,322,157 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. CASH AT  DECEMBER 31, 2019 INCREASED BY $843,059 TO $3,023,388 COMPARED TO $2,180,329 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  ON OCTOBER 17, 2019, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE PRICING OF REGISTERED  DIRECT OFFERING OF 14,285,714 UNITS, EACH UNIT CONSISTING OF A SHARE OF THE COMPANY\\u2019S COMMON STOCK, AND A SERIES I WARRANT  (\\u201cSERIES I WARRANT\\u201d) TO PURCHASE A SHARE OF OUR COMMON STOCK FOR THE COMBINED PURCHASE PRICE OF $0.175 PER UNIT. THE  SERIES I WARRANTS HAVE AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $0.22 PER SHARE AND ARE EXERCISABLE FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS. THE OFFERING CLOSED  ON OCTOBER 18, 2019. THE GROSS PROCEEDS TO ARCH FROM THE 2019 FINANCING WERE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION BEFORE DEDUCTING FINANCING  COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $333,000. PURSUANT TO THE ENGAGEMENT AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY ALSO AGREED TO ISSUE TO THE PLACEMENT AGENT,  OR ITS DESIGNEES, WARRANTS TO PURCHASE UP TO 1,071,429 SHARES (THE \\u201cPLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS\\u201d). THE PLACEMENT AGENT  WARRANTS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AS THE SERIES I WARRANTS, EXCEPT THAT THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS  IS $0.21875 PER SHARE AND THE TERM OF THE PLACEMENT AGENT WARRANTS IS FIVE YEARS.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SHOULD  BE READ TOGETHER WITH THE UNAUDITED INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-Q. THE PERIOD  TO PERIOD COMPARISONS OF OUR INTERIM RESULTS OF OPERATIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

THE DECREASE IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AND CONSULTING  COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYROLL COSTS. GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS  A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL STAFFING TO PREPARE FOR COMMERCIAL USE, INCREASED STOCK BASED COMPENSATION AS WELL AS INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED  WITH THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONTINUED FUNDRAISING EFFORTS.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 31, 2019 WAS $643,734  ,  AN INCREASE OF $54,532 COMPARED TO $589,202 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  THE INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN INVENTORY RESERVE. SINCE  THE COMPANY IS PRE-REVENUE, THE RESERVE IS RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IS PARTIALLY  OFFSET BY THE TIMING OF PRODUCT PURCHASES AND PRECLINICAL TESTING AND EVALUATION. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY  EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF OUR PLANS FOR ADDITIONAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, CLINICAL AND REGULATORY PROGRAMS.  OTHER EXPENSE  OTHER EXPENSE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019  WAS $40,187 A DECREASE OF $792,226 COMPARED TO TOTAL OTHER EXPENSE OF $832,413 FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE  DECREASE IN OTHER EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT OF THE CHANGE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT GENERATED REVENUES FROM THE SALE OF ANY  PRODUCTS AND HAVE PRINCIPALLY RAISED CAPITAL THROUGH BORROWINGS AND THE ISSUANCE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND UNITS CONSISTING OF COMMON  STOCK AND WARRANTS TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD CASH OF $3,023,388 AND POSITIVE WORKING CAPITAL OF $2,921,998.  WORKING CAPITAL  AT DECEMBER 31, 2019, WE HAD TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS OF $3,553,254  (INCLUDING CASH OF $3,023,388) AND WORKING CAPITAL OF $2,921,998. OUR WORKING CAPITAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30,  2019 IS SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN CURRENT ASSETS IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE  TO $2,500,000 RECEIVED FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND WARRANTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES RESULTING  FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COSTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ACTIVITIES TO DEVELOP OUR PRIMARY  PRODUCT CANDIDATE. OUR TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF CASH, INVENTORY  AND PREPAID EXPENSES.  TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 WERE $631,256,  A DECREASE OF $82,555 COMPARED TO $713,811 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PATENT AND PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT  COSTS. OUR TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 WERE COMPRISED OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED  EXPENSES AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

THE DECREASE  IN OPERATING EXPENSES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONSULTING COSTS AND PRODUCT AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYROLL  COSTS.  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES  CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES   INCREASED $2,455 TO  $2,455 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $0 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018. FOR  THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES IS ATTRIBUTED TO COMPUTER HARDWARE.  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES  CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $2,134,762 TO  $2,167,162 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, COMPARED TO $32,400 DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018.  FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, THE CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING RESULTED FROM $2,167,162 FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON  STOCK AND WARRANTS IN THE OCTOBER 2019 FINANCING. FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, THE CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING  RESULTED FROM $32,400 FROM THE EXERCISE OF OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 87,567 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK.  CASH REQUIREMENTS  WE ANTICIPATE THAT OUR OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES WILL INCREASE  SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT OUR BUSINESS PLAN AND PURSUE OUR OPERATIONAL GOALS. AS OF JANUARY 29, 2020, WE BELIEVE  THAT OUR CURRENT CASH ON HAND WILL MEET OUR ANTICIPATED CASH REQUIREMENTS INTO THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020. NOTWITHSTANDING  THIS, DEPENDING UPON ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM EU AND US REGULATORY AUTHORITIES, WE DO NOT EXPECT TO GENERATE REVENUES FROM OPERATIONS  BEFORE WE NEED TO RAISE ADDITIONAL CAPITAL. FURTHER, OUR ESTIMATES REGARDING OUR USE OF CASH COULD CHANGE IF WE ENCOUNTER UNANTICIPATED  DIFFICULTIES OR OTHER ISSUES ARISE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE SET FORTH UNDER THE HEADING \\u201c  RISK FACTORS  \\u201d  IN THIS FILING, IN WHICH CASE OUR CURRENT FUNDS MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO OPERATE OUR BUSINESS FOR THE PERIOD WE EXPECT.  WE ARE IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND HAVE GENERATED NO OPERATING  REVENUES TO DATE. WE DO NOT PRESENTLY HAVE, NOR DO WE EXPECT IN THE NEAR FUTURE TO HAVE, REVENUE TO FUND OUR BUSINESS FROM OUR  OPERATIONS, AND WILL NEED TO OBTAIN ALL OF OUR NECESSARY FUNDING FROM EXTERNAL SOURCES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. WE DO NOT HAVE  ANY COMMITMENTS FOR FUTURE CAPITAL. SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL FINANCING WILL BE REQUIRED TO FUND OUR PLANNED OPERATIONS IN THE NEAR  TERM AND IN FUTURE PERIODS, INCLUDING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES RELATING TO OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCT CANDIDATE, SEEKING  REGULATORY APPROVAL OF THAT OR ANY OTHER PRODUCT CANDIDATE WE MAY CHOOSE TO DEVELOP, COMMERCIALIZING ANY PRODUCT CANDIDATE FOR  WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL OR CERTIFICATION, SEEKING TO LICENSE OR ACQUIRE NEW ASSETS OR BUSINESSES, AND MAINTAINING  OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND PURSUING RIGHTS TO NEW TECHNOLOGIES. WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING ON  COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE OR ACCEPTABLE TERMS WHEN NEEDED, OR AT ALL. WE ARE BOUND BY CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS AND OBLIGATIONS THAT  MAY LIMIT OR OTHERWISE IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO RAISE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN THE NEAR-TERM INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROVISIONS  IN THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA RESTRICTING OUR ABILITY TO EFFECT OR ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT TO EFFECT ANY ISSUANCE BY THE COMPANY  OR ANY OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES OF COMMON STOCK OR SECURITIES CONVERTIBLE, EXERCISABLE OR EXCHANGEABLE FOR COMMON STOCK (OR A COMBINATION  OF UNITS THEREOF) INVOLVING A VARIABLE RATE TRANSACTION (AS DEFINED IN THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA) INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,  AN EQUITY LINE OF CREDIT OR \\u201cAT-THE-MARKET\\u201d FINANCING FACILITY UNTIL THE THREE LEAD INVESTORS IN THE 2017 FINANCING  AND THE 2018 FINANCING COLLECTIVELY OWN LESS THAN 20% OF THE SERIES F WARRANTS AND SERIES G WARRANTS PURCHASED BY THEM PURSUANT  TO THE 2017 SPA AND 2018 SPA. THESE RESTRICTIONS AND PROVISIONS COULD MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING FOR US TO RAISE CAPITAL THROUGH  THE INCURRENCE OF DEBT OR THROUGH EQUITY ISSUANCES. IF WE CANNOT RAISE THE MONEY THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OUR  BUSINESS, WE WILL BE FORCED TO DELAY, SCALE BACK OR ELIMINATE SOME OR ALL OF OUR PROPOSED OPERATIONS. IF ANY OF THESE WERE TO OCCUR,  THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT OUR BUSINESS WOULD FAIL AND OUR STOCKHOLDERS COULD LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENTS.  AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, SINCE INCEPTION WE HAVE FUNDED OUR OPERATIONS  PRIMARILY THROUGH EQUITY AND DEBT FINANCINGS AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SEEK TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. IF WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL  FINANCING BY ISSUING EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS\\u2019 OWNERSHIP WILL BE DILUTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE TERMS OF  SECURITIES WE MAY ISSUE IN FUTURE CAPITAL-RAISING TRANSACTIONS MAY BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR OUR NEW INVESTORS, AND IN PARTICULAR MAY  INCLUDE PREFERENCES, SUPERIOR VOTING RIGHTS AND THE ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS OR OTHER DERIVATIVE SECURITIES, WHICH MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL  DILUTIVE EFFECTS. IF WE OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING BY INCURRING DEBT, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS  ON OUR OPERATIONS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF ANY LOAN OR CREDIT AGREEMENT GOVERNING THE DEBT. FURTHER, OBTAINING ANY LOAN, ASSUMING  A LOAN WOULD BE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WOULD INCREASE OUR LIABILITIES AND FUTURE CASH COMMITMENTS. WE MAY ALSO  SEEK FUNDING FROM COLLABORATION OR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FUTURE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THAT WE RELINQUISH POTENTIALLY VALUABLE  RIGHTS TO OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES OR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES OR GRANT LICENSES ON TERMS THAT ARE NOT FAVORABLE TO US. MOREOVER,  REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH WE SEEK TO RAISE CAPITAL, WE MAY INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IN THOSE PURSUITS, INCLUDING INVESTMENT  BANKING FEES, LEGAL FEES, ACCOUNTING FEES, PRINTING AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES AND OTHER RELATED COSTS. IN ADDITION, AS DESCRIBED  IN GREATER DETAIL UNDER THE RISK FACTOR ENTITLED \\u201c  THE TERMS OF THE 2017 FINANCING AND 2018 FINANCING COULD IMPOSE ADDITIONAL  CHALLENGES ON OUR ABILITY TO RAISE FUNDING IN THE FUTURE  ,\\u201d INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q, THE 2017  SPA AND THE 2018 SPA IMPOSES CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE EQUITY OR DEBT SECURITIES.  25  GOING CONCERN  FROM INCEPTION, WE HAVE NOT EARNED OPERATING REVENUES FROM  SALES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND HAVE RECURRING LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL HAVE  CASH ON HAND INTO THE  THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2020, THE CONTINUATION OF OUR BUSINESS AS A GOING CONCERN IS DEPENDENT UPON  RAISING ADDITIONAL CAPITAL AND EVENTUALLY ATTAINING AND MAINTAINING PROFITABLE OPERATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2019, THERE IS  SUBSTANTIAL DOUBT ABOUT THE COMPANY\\u2019S ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS  QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q DO NOT INCLUDE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MIGHT BE NECESSARY SHOULD OPERATIONS DISCONTINUE.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND  ESTIMATES  PURSUANT TO CERTAIN DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE SEC, THE  SEC DEFINES \\u201cCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\u201d AS THOSE THAT REQUIRE THE APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT\\u2019S MOST DIFFICULT,  SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS, OFTEN AS A RESULT OF THE NEED TO MAKE ESTIMATES ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY  UNCERTAIN AND MAY CHANGE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL REQUIRE THE APPLICATION  OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT, SUBJECTIVE OR COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENTED WITH  THIS FORM 10-Q INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ARCH THERAPEUTICS, INC. AND ITS WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ARCH BIOSURGERY, INC. A BIOTECHNOLOGY  COMPANY. ALL INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  THE COMPANY IS IN THE DEVELOPMENT STAGE AND IS DEVOTING SUBSTANTIALLY  ALL OF ITS EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING TECHNOLOGIES, RAISING CAPITAL, ESTABLISHING CUSTOMER AND VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS, AND RECRUITING  NEW EMPLOYEES.  USE OF ESTIMATES  MANAGEMENT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT  AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATES OF THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUE AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIODS. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THOSE  ESTIMATES.  IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS  LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN CIRCUMSTANCES  INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 360,  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  FOR ASSETS THAT ARE TO BE HELD AND USED, IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE  ASSET OR GROUP OF ASSETS IS LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IF IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, AN ADJUSTMENT IS MADE TO WRITE THE ASSET DOWN  TO ITS FAIR VALUE, AND A LOSS IS RECORDED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUES ARE DETERMINED  BASED ON QUOTED MARKET VALUES, DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL APPRAISALS, AS APPLICABLE. ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED  OF ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  WE EXPENSE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS,  INCLUDING COSTS OF FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS, IN THE PERIOD INCURRED  ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN  ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) ASC TOPIC 718,  COMPENSATION-STOCK  COMPENSATION  (\\u201cFASB ASC TOPIC 718\\u201d), WHICH REQUIRES ALL SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING GRANTS OF  EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. WE ACCOUNT FOR NON-EMPLOYEE  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE OF FASB ASC TOPIC 505,  EQUITY  (\\u201cFASB ASC TOPIC 505\\u201d),  WHICH REQUIRES THAT COMPANIES RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED TO NON-EMPLOYEES  OVER THEIR VESTING PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE PERIOD DURING WHICH SERVICES ARE RENDERED BY SUCH NON-EMPLOYEES. FASB ASC TOPIC  505 REQUIRES US TO RE-MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED TO NON-EMPLOYEES AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD DURING THE VESTING  PERIOD OR UNTIL SERVICES ARE COMPLETE.  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 718, WE HAVE ELECTED TO USE  THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED AND WE RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION COST OF  SHARE-BASED AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD.  THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT  AWARDS UTILIZING THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL IS AFFECTED BY THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMMON STOCK AND A NUMBER OF OTHER ASSUMPTIONS,  INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE AND EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY  DID NOT HAVE A SUFFICIENT HISTORY OF MARKET PRICES OF THE COMMON STOCK, AND AS SUCH VOLATILITY WAS ESTIMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH  ASC 718-10-S99  COMPENSATION-STOCK COMPENSATION  (\\u201cASC 718-10-S99\\u201d). PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY\\u2019S  EXPECTED VOLATILITY WAS DERIVED FROM THE HISTORICAL DAILY CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICE OF ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE IT EXITED SHELL  COMPANY STATUS, AS WELL AS THE HISTORICAL DAILY CHANGE IN THE MARKET PRICE FOR THE PEER GROUPS AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY. EFFECTIVE  JANUARY 1, 2018, THE COMPANY IS USING ITS HISTORICAL MARKET PRICES TO CALCULATE THE VOLATILITY OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THE LIFE TERM  FOR AWARDS USES THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR ALL \\u201cPLAIN VANILLA\\u201d OPTIONS, AS DEFINED IN ASC 718-10-S99 AND THE CONTRACTUAL  TERM FOR ALL OTHER EMPLOYEE AND NON-EMPLOYEE AWARDS. THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON OBSERVED INTEREST RATES  APPROPRIATE FOR THE TERMS OF OUR AWARDS. THE DIVIDEND YIELD ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON HISTORY AND THE EXPECTATION OF PAYING NO DIVIDENDS.  FORFEITURES ARE ESTIMATED AT THE TIME OF GRANT AND REVISED, IF NECESSARY, IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS IF ACTUAL FORFEITURES DIFFER FROM  THOSE ESTIMATES. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHEN RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IS BASED ON AWARDS THAT ARE ULTIMATELY  EXPECTED TO VEST.  26  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  WE MEASURE BOTH FINANCIAL AND NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC TOPIC 820,  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES  , INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED  IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS. THE STANDARD CREATED A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY WHICH PRIORITIZES THE  INPUTS TO VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE BROAD LEVELS AS FOLLOWS: LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES  (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES; LEVEL 2 INPUTS ARE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES INCLUDED  WITHIN LEVEL 1 THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY; AND LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE  INPUTS THAT REFLECT OUR OWN VIEWS ABOUT THE ASSUMPTIONS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.  INCOME TAXES  IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB ASC 740,  INCOME TAXES  , WE RECOGNIZE  DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OR EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND/OR TAX RETURNS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE BASED UPON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL  STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS AND THE TAX BASES OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOR LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS USING ENACTED  TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THE DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO REVERSE. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REDUCED  BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME PORTION OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WILL NOT BE REALIZED.  WE PROVIDE RESERVES FOR POTENTIAL PAYMENTS OF TAX TO VARIOUS  TAX AUTHORITIES RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS WILL BE INCURRED  RELATED TO THESE MATTERS AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS IS REASONABLY DETERMINABLE.  DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS WARRANTS AND OTHER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL  INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER EQUITY OR LIABILITIES BASED UPON THE CHARACTERISTICS AND PROVISIONS OF EACH INSTRUMENT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH  FASB ASC TOPIC 815,  DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING  . WARRANTS CLASSIFIED AS EQUITY ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF THE DATE OF  ISSUANCE ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND NO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THEIR VALUATION ARE MADE. WARRANTS CLASSIFIED  AS DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AND OTHER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT REQUIRE SEPARATE ACCOUNTING AS LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED  ON THE COMPANY\\u2019S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUE ON THE DATE OF ISSUANCE AND WILL BE REVALUED ON EACH SUBSEQUENT  BALANCE SHEET DATE UNTIL SUCH INSTRUMENTS ARE EXERCISED OR EXPIRE, WITH ANY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS  RECORDED AS OTHER INCOME OR EXPENSE. MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE LIABILITIES USING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND ASSUMPTIONS  THAT ARE BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE WARRANTS OR INSTRUMENTS ON THE VALUATION DATE, AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS FOR  FUTURE FINANCINGS, EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED LIFE, YIELD, AND RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE.  INVENTORIES  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE  VALUE. THE COST OF INVENTORIES COMPRISES EXPENDITURES INCURRED IN ACQUIRING THE INVENTORIES, THE COST OF CONVERSION AND OTHER COSTS  INCURRED IN BRINGING THEM TO THEIR EXISTING LOCATION AND CONDITION. THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS, WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND FINISHED GOODS  AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE DETERMINED ON A FIRST IN FIRST OUT (FIFO) BASIS. WHEN DETERMINING NET REALIZABLE VALUE, APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION  IS GIVEN TO OBSOLESCENCE, EXCESSIVE LEVELS, DETERIORATION, AND OTHER FACTORS IN EVALUATING NET REALIZABLE VALUE.  RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE  ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (ASU) 2018-07, \\u201cCOMPENSATION\\u2014STOCK  COMPENSATION (TOPIC 718) IMPROVEMENTS TO NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ACCOUNTING\\u201d WAS ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING  STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) IN JUNE 2018. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO ADDRESS ASPECTS OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR NONEMPLOYEE SHARE-BASED  PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR FISCAL YEARS, AND FOR INTERIM  PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2018-07  DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND  THE IMPACT WAS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  ASU 2016-02, \\u201cLEASES (TOPIC 842)\\u201d WAS ISSUED  BY THE FASB IN FEBRUARY 2016. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AMENDMENT IS TO RECOGNIZE MOST OPERATING LEASES BY RECORDING A RIGHT-TO-USE  ASSET AND CORRESPONDING LEASE LIABILITY. THE AMENDMENTS IN THIS UPDATE ARE EFFECTIVE FOR PUBLIC BUSINESS ENTITIES FOR FISCAL  YEARS, AND FOR INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS, BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2018. THE COMPANY ADOPTED ASU 2016-02  DURING OUR FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2020, AND  THE IMPACT WAS CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS ONE OPERATING LEASE AND AS OF THE ADOPTION DATE THE REMAINING TERM WAS LESS THAN ONE YEAR.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAVE  OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO HAVE A CURRENT OR FUTURE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION, REVENUES OR EXPENSES, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,  LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR CAPITAL RESOURCES THAT IS MATERIAL TO STOCKHOLDERS.  27\", \"is_valid\": false, \"label\": -1, \"Form Type\": \"10-Q\", \"Company Name\": \"Arch Therapeutics, Inc.\", \"CIK\": 1537561, \"Date\": \"2020-01-30T00:00:00\", \"Ticker\": \"ARTH\", \"Name\": \"Arch Therapeutics Inc\", \"Exchange\": \"OTCBB\", \"SIC\": 5531.0, \"Business\": \"L2\", \"Incorporated\": \"NV\", \"IRS\": 460524102.0, \"key\": \"20200130ARTH\", \"labelr1\": 0.0, \"labelr2\": -2.97872340425531, \"labelr3\": -1.3157894736842115, \"labelr4\": -13.333333333333336, \"pred\": -1.0, \"prof-1\": 0.6048225, \"prof1\": 0.39517748, \"return1&2\": 1.0297872340425531, \"return1&2&3\": 1.0433370660694288, \"return1&2&3&4\": 1.182448674878686, \"return2\": 1.0297872340425531, \"return1\": 1.0, \"return3\": 1.013157894736842, \"return4\": 1.1333333333333333, \"1_day_return\": 0.0, \"cumulative_return1\": 0.308677590684675, \"cumulative_return1&2\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3\": -0.0, \"cumulative_return1&2&3&4\": 0.0, \"indexx\": 3593, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9423446950285075, \"cumreturn1b\": 0.931107587729317, \"cumreturn1c\": 0.8944615991276363, \"cumreturndow\": 0.9900762536557943, \"cumreturnsp500\": 0.9787739196841426}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3599, \"level_0\": 3694, \"index\": 33520, \"text\": \"ITEM 2.

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES' (COLLECTIVELY, THE \\\"COMPANY\\\" OR \\\"CAVCO\\\") CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE RELATED NOTES THAT APPEAR IN ITEM 1 OF THIS REPORT. REFERENCES TO \\\"NOTE\\\" OR \\\"NOTES\\\" PERTAIN TO THE NOTES TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  OVERVIEW  HEADQUARTERED IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA, THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND PRODUCES FACTORY-BUILT HOMES PRIMARILY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A NETWORK OF INDEPENDENT AND COMPANY-OWNED RETAILERS, PLANNED COMMUNITY OPERATORS AND RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPERS. THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRODUCERS OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES, BASED ON REPORTED WHOLESALE SHIPMENTS, MARKETED UNDER A VARIETY OF BRAND NAMES INCLUDING CAVCO, FLEETWOOD, PALM HARBOR, FAIRMONT, FRIENDSHIP, CHARIOT EAGLE, LEXINGTON AND DESTINY. THE COMPANY IS ALSO ONE OF THE LEADING PRODUCERS OF PARK MODEL RVS, VACATION CABINS AND SYSTEMS-BUILT COMMERCIAL STRUCTURES, AS WELL AS MODULAR HOMES. CAVCO'S FINANCE SUBSIDIARY, COUNTRYPLACE ACCEPTANCE CORP. (\\\"COUNTRYPLACE\\\"), IS AN APPROVED FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION (\\\"FANNIE MAE\\\") AND FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION (\\\"FREDDIE MAC\\\") SELLER/SERVICER AND A GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ISSUER THAT OFFERS CONFORMING MORTGAGES, NON-CONFORMING MORTGAGES AND HOME-ONLY LOANS TO PURCHASERS OF FACTORY-BUILT HOMES. OUR INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, STANDARD CASUALTY CO. (\\\"STANDARD CASUALTY\\\"), PROVIDES PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE TO OWNERS OF MANUFACTURED HOMES.  COMPANY GROWTH  FROM ITS INCEPTION IN 1965, CAVCO TRADITIONALLY SERVED AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKETS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES PRINCIPALLY THROUGH MANUFACTURED HOME PRODUCTION. DURING THE PERIOD FROM 1997 TO 2000, CAVCO WAS PURCHASED BY, AND BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF, CENTEX CORPORATION, WHICH OPERATED THE COMPANY UNTIL 2003, WHEN CAVCO BECAME A STAND-ALONE PUBLICLY-HELD COMPANY TRADED ON THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET UNDER THE TICKER SYMBOL CVCO.  THE COMPANY HAS STRATEGICALLY EXPANDED ITS FACTORY OPERATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESS ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE ACQUISITION OF INDUSTRY COMPETITORS. THIS HAS ENABLED CAVCO TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKET ON A NATIONAL BASIS.  33  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE PURCHASE OF THE FLEETWOOD AND PALM HARBOR ASSETS IN AUGUST 2009 AND APRIL 2011, RESPECTIVELY, INCREASED HOME PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES AND PROVIDED FOR VERTICAL INTEGRATION THROUGH ENTRY INTO FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES SPECIFIC TO THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRY. THESE TRANSACTIONS EXPANDED THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC REACH AT A NATIONAL LEVEL BY ADDING FACTORIES AND RETAIL LOCATIONS SERVING THE NORTHWEST, WEST, SOUTH, SOUTH CENTRAL AND MID-ATLANTIC REGIONS.  THE PURCHASES OF CHARIOT EAGLE, FAIRMONT, LEXINGTON AND DESTINY, IN MARCH 2015, MAY 2015, APRIL 2017 AND AUGUST 2019, RESPECTIVELY, PROVIDED ADDITIONAL OPERATING CAPACITY, INCREASED HOME PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES AND FURTHER STRENGTHENED THE COMPANY'S MARKET IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL PROVINCES IN CANADA.  THE COMPANY OPERATES  20  HOMEBUILDING FACILITIES LOCATED IN MILLERSBURG AND WOODBURN, OREGON; NAMPA, IDAHO; RIVERSIDE, CALIFORNIA; PHOENIX AND GOODYEAR, ARIZONA; AUSTIN, FORT WORTH, SEGUIN AND WACO, TEXAS; MONTEVIDEO, MINNESOTA; NAPPANEE, INDIANA; LAFAYETTE, TENNESSEE; LEXINGTON, MISSISSIPPI; MARTINSVILLE AND ROCKY MOUNT, VIRGINIA; DOUGLAS AND MOULTRIE, GEORGIA; AND OCALA AND PLANT CITY, FLORIDA. THE MAJORITY OF THE HOMES PRODUCED ARE SOLD TO, AND DISTRIBUTED BY, INDEPENDENTLY OWNED AND CONTROLLED RETAIL OPERATIONS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S HOMES ARE SOLD THROUGH  39  COMPANY-OWNED U.S. RETAIL LOCATIONS.  OUR OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED ON A DECENTRALIZED BASIS, WITH OVERSIGHT FROM THE HOME OFFICE. THIS DECENTRALIZATION ENABLES THE COMPANY'S OPERATORS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO LOCAL MARKET DEMAND, BE MORE CUSTOMER FOCUSED AND HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO MAKE SWIFT DECISIONS, WHILE STILL BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.  THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND STRIVES TO IMPROVE DESIGNS, PRODUCTION METHODS AND MARKETING STRATEGIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON GAINING OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AMONG ITS OPERATIONS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE ORGANIC GROWTH POTENTIAL.  COMPANY OUTLOOK  THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A CONSERVATIVE COST STRUCTURE IN AN EFFORT TO BUILD ADDED VALUE INTO ITS HOMES AND HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO MAINTAIN A SOLID FINANCIAL POSITION. OUR BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, INCLUDING OUR POSITION IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHOULD HELP US AVOID LIQUIDITY PROBLEMS AND ENABLE US TO ACT EFFECTIVELY AS MARKET OPPORTUNITIES PRESENT THEMSELVES.  THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES ARE STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND UTILIZE LOCAL MARKET RESEARCH TO DESIGN HOMES TO MEET THE DEMANDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO CUSTOMIZE FLOOR PLANS AND DESIGNS TO FULFILL SPECIFIC NEEDS AND INTERESTS. BY OFFERING A FULL RANGE OF HOMES FROM ENTRY-LEVEL MODELS TO LARGE CUSTOM HOMES AND WITH THE ABILITY TO ENGINEER DESIGNS IN-HOUSE, THE COMPANY CAN ACCOMMODATE VIRTUALLY ANY CUSTOMER REQUEST. IN ADDITION TO HOMES BUILT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL MANUFACTURING HOME CONSTRUCTION AND SAFETY STANDARDS (\\\"HUD CODE\\\") PROMULGATED BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT (\\\"HUD\\\"), THE COMPANY ALSO CONSTRUCTS MODULAR HOMES THAT CONFORM TO STATE AND LOCAL CODES, PARK MODEL RVS AND CABINS AND LIGHT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AT MANY OF ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  THE COMPANY SEEKS OUT NICHE MARKET OPPORTUNITIES WHERE ITS DIVERSE PRODUCT LINES AND CUSTOM BUILDING CAPABILITIES PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. OUR GREEN BUILDING INITIATIVES INVOLVE THE CREATION OF AN ENERGY EFFICIENT ENVELOPE AND HIGHER UTILIZATION OF RENEWABLE MATERIALS. THESE HOMES PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS, TYPICALLY LOWER UTILITY COSTS AND SUSTAINABILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO BUILDS HOMES DESIGNED TO USE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS SOLAR AND WIND. FROM BAMBOO FLOORING AND TANKLESS WATER HEATERS TO SOLAR-POWERED HOMES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DIVERSE AND TAILORED TO A WIDE RANGE OF CONSUMER INTERESTS. INNOVATION IN HOUSING DESIGN IS A FORTE OF THE COMPANY AND IT CONTINUES TO INTRODUCE NEW MODELS AT COMPETITIVE PRICE POINTS WITH EXPRESSIVE INTERIORS AND EXTERIORS THAT COMPLEMENT HOME STYLES IN THE AREAS IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED.  34  TABLE OF CONTENTS  BASED ON THE RELATIVELY LOW COST ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURED HOME OWNERSHIP, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS HAVE TRADITIONALLY COMPETED WITH RENTAL HOUSING'S MONTHLY PAYMENT AFFORDABILITY. RENTAL HOUSING ACTIVITY IS REPORTED TO HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE IN RECENT YEARS, WHICH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A DECLINE IN TENANT HOUSING VACANCY RATES AND A CORRESPONDING RISE IN RENTAL RATES. THESE FACTORS, AMONG OTHER MARKET AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, MAY CAUSE SOME RENTERS TO BECOME BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE-HOUSING ALTERNATIVES, INCLUDING MANUFACTURED HOMES.  FURTHER, WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL RISE IN DEMAND FOR RENTAL HOUSING, THE COMPANY HAS REALIZED A LARGER PROPORTION OF ORDERS AND INTEREST FROM DEVELOPERS AND COMMUNITY OWNERS FOR NEW MANUFACTURED HOMES INTENDED FOR USE AS RENTAL HOMES, ALTERNATIVE DWELLING UNITS AND SEASONAL LIVING. THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIVE TO THE UNIQUE PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS OF THESE BUYERS AND VALUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE UNITS THAT ARE WELL SUITED FOR THESE PURPOSES.  CAVCO MAINTAINS A BACKLOG OF ORDERS FROM ITS NETWORK OF LICENSED DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS. DISTRIBUTORS MAY CANCEL ORDERS PRIOR TO PRODUCTION WITHOUT PENALTY. ACCORDINGLY, UNTIL THE PRODUCTION OF A PARTICULAR UNIT HAS COMMENCED, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS BACKLOG TO BE FIRM ORDERS. THE BACKLOG OF SALES ORDERS AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  WAS  $115 MILLION  IN TOTAL COMPARED TO  $166 MILLION  AT  DECEMBER 29, 2018  . WHILE ORDER BACKLOG LEVELS VARY PER FACTORY, THE CURRENT BACKLOG LEVEL IN TOTAL IS CONSIDERED HEALTHY. A HEALTHY BACKLOG IS INDICATIVE OF THE GENERAL ABILITY TO COORDINATE EFFICIENT FACTORY PRODUCTION SCHEDULES, TIMELY OBTAIN RAW MATERIALS BASED ON PRODUCT MIX AND ACHIEVE THE UNIT COMPLETION TIMEFRAME EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG AT  DECEMBER 29, 2018  WAS ELEVATED AS A RESULT OF EXCESSIVE ORDER VOLUME FROM INDUSTRY DISTRIBUTORS. THE HIGH ORDER RATES MAY HAVE BEEN DRIVEN IN PART BY WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN CONCERNS ABOUT MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INVENTORY LEVELS IN A PERIOD WHERE DISTRIBUTORS MAY HAVE PERCEIVED UNDERLYING AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEMAND TO BE ACCELERATING FASTER THAN EXPECTED.  THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPING ORDER VOLUME GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES BY WORKING TO INCREASE ITS PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES AND ADJUSTING PRODUCT OFFERINGS AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO MANAGE ITS PRODUCTION LEVELS AND WORKFORCE SIZE IN ORDER TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS WHILE ENSURING EFFICIENT USE OF ITS PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS WAGE RATES OF ITS PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES AND HAS ESTABLISHED OTHER MONETARY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO ENSURE COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY IS WORKING TO MORE EXTENSIVELY USE ON-LINE RECRUITING TOOLS, UPDATE RECRUITMENT BROCHURES AND IMPROVE THE APPEARANCE AND APPEAL OF ITS PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN ORDER TO IMPROVE THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED PRODUCTION EMPLOYEES AND REDUCE ANNUALIZED TURNOVER RATES. EVEN WITH THESE CHALLENGES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS ABILITY TO HELP MEET THE OVERALL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTINUES TO IMPROVE.  THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN CERTAIN COMMERCIAL LOAN PROGRAMS WITH MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. UNDER THESE PROGRAMS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS THAT INDEPENDENT FINANCIERS THEN LEND TO DISTRIBUTORS TO FINANCE RETAIL INVENTORIES OF ITS PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DIRECT COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR FINANCING HOMES (SEE NOTE  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE COMPANY'S INVOLVEMENT IN COMMERCIAL LOANS HELPS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF MANUFACTURED HOME FINANCING TO DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS. PARTICIPATION IN WHOLESALE FINANCING IS HELPFUL TO THESE CUSTOMERS AND PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITY FOR PRODUCT EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS. THESE INITIATIVES SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S ONGOING EFFORTS TO EXPAND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION. HOWEVER, THESE INITIATIVES DO EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THIS CUSTOMER BASE AND THE COMPANY'S INVENTORY FINANCING PARTNERS.  35  TABLE OF CONTENTS  THE LACK OF AN EFFICIENT SECONDARY MARKET FOR MANUFACTURED HOME LOANS AND THE LIMITED NUMBER OF INSTITUTIONS LENDING TO MANUFACTURED HOME BUYERS RESULT IN HIGHER INTEREST RATES FOR LOANS SECURED BY MANUFACTURED HOMES COMPARED TO THOSE FOR SITE-BUILT HOMES. THIS CONTINUES TO CONSTRAIN INDUSTRY GROWTH. THE COMPANY IS WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OTHER INDUSTRY PARTICIPANTS TO DEVELOP SECONDARY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR MANUFACTURED HOME LOAN PORTFOLIOS AND EXPAND LENDING AVAILABILITY IN THE INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST IN COMMUNITY-BASED LENDING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE HOME-ONLY FINANCING TO NEW RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES. OUR MORTGAGE SUBSIDIARY ALSO DEVELOPS AND INVESTS IN HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS TO GROW SALES OF HOMES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION POINTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT GROWING ITS INVESTMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN HOME-ONLY LENDING MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SALES GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT, AS WELL AS PROVIDE A MEANS THAT COULD LEAD TO INCREASED HOME SALES FOR ITS FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING OPERATIONS.  THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING THROUGH INDUSTRY TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO ENCOURAGE FAVORABLE LEGISLATIVE AND GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED ENTERPRISE (\\\"GSE\\\") ACTION TO ADDRESS THE MORTGAGE FINANCING NEEDS OF BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES. FEDERAL LAW REQUIRES THE GSES TO COMPLY WITH A \\\"DUTY TO SERVE\\\" THE UNDERSERVED MARKETS SPECIFIED IN THE FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISES FINANCIAL SAFETY AND SOUNDNESS ACT OF 1992, AS AMENDED BY THE HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT OF 2008. MANUFACTURED HOUSING IS ONE OF THE SPECIFIED UNDERSERVED MARKETS. IN DECEMBER 2017, FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC RELEASED THEIR FINAL UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS THAT DESCRIBE, WITH SPECIFICITY, THE ACTIONS THEY WILL TAKE OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD TO FULFILL THEIR \\\"DUTY TO SERVE\\\" OBLIGATIONS. THESE PLANS BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2018. EACH OF THE THREE-YEAR PLANS OFFERS AN ENHANCED MORTGAGE LOAN PRODUCT THROUGH THEIR \\\"MH ADVANTAGE\\\" AND \\\"CHOICEHOME\\\" PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY, THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN THE LATTER PART OF CALENDAR 2018. SMALL-SCALE PILOT PROGRAMS FOR THE PURCHASE OF HOME-ONLY LOANS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE GSE\\u2019S UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS. IMPLEMENTATION OF VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE GSE\\u2019S UNDERSERVED MARKETS PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THEIR REGULATOR, THE FEDERAL HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY, AND THEIR APPROVAL IS NOT ASSURED. EXPANSION OF THE SECONDARY MARKET FOR LENDING THROUGH THE GSES COULD SUPPORT FURTHER DEMAND FOR HOUSING, AS LENDING OPTIONS WOULD LIKELY BECOME MORE AFFORDABLE TO HOME BUYERS. ALTHOUGH SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS AREA, MEANINGFUL POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE FORM OF INCREASED HOME ORDERS HAS YET TO BE REALIZED.  ON JANUARY 25, 2018, HUD ANNOUNCED A TOP-TO-BOTTOM REVIEW OF ITS MANUFACTURED HOUSING RULES AS PART OF A BROADER EFFORT TO IDENTIFY REGULATIONS THAT MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, OVERLY BURDENSOME, OR EXCESSIVELY COSTLY GIVEN THE CRITICAL NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN ADDITION, ON JUNE 25, 2019, PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING FEDERAL AGENCIES TO WORK TOGETHER TO ALLEVIATE BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER CREATED A WHITE HOUSE COUNCIL ON ELIMINATING REGULATORY BARRIERS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CONSISTING OF MEMBERS FROM EIGHT FEDERAL AGENCIES AND CHAIRED BY THE HUD SECRETARY. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN NO TIMELINE ESTABLISHED, IF CERTAIN CHANGES ARE MADE, THE COMPANY MAY BE ABLE TO SERVE A BROADER RANGE OF HOME BUYERS.  THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM EXCESSIVE POLICY CLAIMS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING PERIODS OF INCLEMENT WEATHER, INCLUDING SEASONAL SPRING STORMS OR FALL HURRICANE ACTIVITY IN TEXAS WHERE MOST OF ITS POLICIES ARE UNDERWRITTEN. WHERE APPLICABLE, LOSSES FROM CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ARE SOMEWHAT LIMITED BY REINSURANCE CONTRACTS IN PLACE AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S LOSS MITIGATION STRUCTURE.  AS DISCLOSED IN PART II, ITEM 1,  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  , THE COMPANY AND JOSEPH STEGMAYER, THE COMPANY'S FORMER CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, RECEIVED SUBPOENAS FROM THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION'S (\\\"SEC\\\") DIVISION OF ENFORCEMENT SEEKING DOCUMENTS RELATED TO TRADING IN STOCK OF ANOTHER PUBLIC COMPANY. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR EXPENSES RELATED TO THIS MATTER THAT MAY MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS. THOSE COSTS INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER ITEMS, ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES FOR MR. STEGMAYER PURSUANT TO HIS INDEMNITY AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE \\\"AUDIT COMMITTEE\\\") CONDUCTED AND COMPLETED AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION LED BY INDEPENDENT LEGAL COUNSEL AND OTHER ADVISERS IN RELATION TO THIS INQUIRY. THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION HAVE BEEN SHARED WITH THE COMPANY'S AUDITORS, LISTING EXCHANGE AND THE SEC STAFF. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO MADE INTERNAL RECORDS AND PERSONNEL AVAILABLE TO THE SEC STAFF AND INTENDS TO CONTINUE COOPERATING WITH THE SEC ON THIS MATTER.  36  TABLE OF CONTENTS  AS A RESULT OF THIS INQUIRY, THE COMPANY INCURRED  $0.9 MILLION  AND  $2.5 MILLION  IN LEGAL AND OTHER EXPENSES DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR RELATED COSTS PERTAINING TO THIS MATTER. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019, THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWED THE SUFFICIENCY OF ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE AND AS A RESULT, CAVCO'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS MADE A DECISION TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL DIRECTOR AND OFFICER (\\\"D&O\\\") LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THESE NEW 22-MONTH POLICIES WERE IMPLEMENTED DECEMBER 21, 2018. TOTAL PREMIUMS PAID DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2019 FOR THESE POLICIES WERE $15.3 MILLION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECORDED  $2.1 MILLION  AND  $6.3 MILLION  OF ADDITIONAL D&O POLICY PREMIUM EXPENSE DURING THE THREE AND  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY, AND EXPECTS TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $2.1 MILLION PER QUARTER IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE FROM THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE POLICY PREMIUMS THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2021. ANY ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF MAINTAINING ADEQUATE D&O INSURANCE FOR THE COMPANY.  INDUSTRY OVERVIEW  ACCORDING TO DATA REPORTED BY THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INSTITUTE, INDUSTRY HOME SHIPMENTS DECREASED  2.9%  FOR THE FIRST  11  MONTHS OF CALENDAR YEAR 2019 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR. SOME OF THIS DECREASE WAS THE RESULT OF THE INDUSTRY'S PRODUCTION OF DISASTER-RELIEF HOMES FOR THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2018 THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN CALENDAR YEAR 2019. DURING CALENDAR YEAR  2018  , THE MANUFACTURED HOUSING INDUSTRY SHIPPED APPROXIMATELY  97,000  HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES, AN INCREASE OF  4.3%  OVER THE APPROXIMATELY  93,000  UNITS SHIPPED IN  2017  . THROUGH 2018, ANNUAL SHIPMENTS HAVE INCREASED EACH YEAR SINCE CALENDAR YEAR 2009 WHEN 50,000 HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES WERE SHIPPED, THE LOWEST LEVEL SINCE THE INDUSTRY BEGAN RECORDING STATISTICS IN 1959. WHILE SHIPMENTS OF HUD CODE MANUFACTURED HOMES HAVE IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS, THE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO OPERATE AT RELATIVELY LOW LEVELS COMPARED TO HISTORICAL SHIPMENT STATISTICS.  \\\"FIRST-TIME\\\" AND \\\"MOVE-UP\\\" BUYERS OF AFFORDABLE HOMES ARE HISTORICALLY AMONG THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PURCHASERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EMPLOYMENT RATES AMONG THESE GROUPS AND OTHER POTENTIAL HOME BUYERS WHO FAVOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING ARE STRONG. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVED CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS EVIDENT AMONG MANUFACTURED HOME BUYERS INTERESTED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS FOR SEASONAL OR RETIREMENT LIVING THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONCERNED ABOUT FINANCIAL STABILITY, AND NOW APPEAR TO BE LESS HESITANT TO COMMIT TO A NEW HOME PURCHASE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES SALES GROWTH IS MOST ACHIEVABLE WHEN EMPLOYMENT AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE LEVELS ARE STRONG.  THE TWO LARGEST MANUFACTURED HOUSING CONSUMER DEMOGRAPHICS, YOUNG ADULTS AND THOSE WHO ARE AGE 55 AND OLDER, ARE BOTH GROWING. THE U.S. ADULT POPULATION IS ESTIMATED TO EXPAND BY APPROXIMATELY  11.8 MILLION  BETWEEN  2020  AND  2025  . YOUNG ADULTS BORN FROM 1976 TO 1995, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS GEN Y, REPRESENT A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. LATE-STAGE GEN Y IS APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE LARGER THAN THE NEXT AGE CATEGORY BORN FROM 1966 TO 1975, GEN X, AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE IN THE PEAK HOME-BUYING YEARS. GEN Y REPRESENTS PRIME FIRST-TIME HOME BUYERS WHO MAY BE ATTRACTED BY THE AFFORDABILITY, SUSTAINABILITY, DIVERSITY AND LOCATION FLEXIBILITY OF FACTORY-BUILT HOMES. THE AGE 55 AND OLDER CATEGORY IS REPORTED TO BE THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE U.S. POPULATION. THIS GROUP IS SIMILARLY INTERESTED IN THE VALUE PROPOSITION; HOWEVER, THEY ARE ALSO MOTIVATED BY THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND LOW MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS OF SYSTEMS-BUILT HOMES, AND BY THE LIFESTYLE OFFERED BY PLANNED COMMUNITIES SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR HOMEOWNERS THAT FALL INTO THIS AGE GROUP.  37  TABLE OF CONTENTS  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  COMPARED TO  DECEMBER 29, 2018  NET REVENUE.  NET REVENUE CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD).

NET REVENUE FROM THE OPERATIONS OF DESTINY HOMES WAS  $11.2 MILLION  AND  $17.6 MILLION  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , RESPECTIVELY.  38  TABLE OF CONTENTS  NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD IS A VOLATILE METRIC DEPENDENT UPON SEVERAL FACTORS. A PRIMARY FACTOR IS THE PRICE DISPARITY BETWEEN SALES OF HOMES TO INDEPENDENT DISTRIBUTORS, BUILDERS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS (\\\"WHOLESALE\\\") AND SALES OF HOMES TO CONSUMERS BY COMPANY-OWNED RETAIL CENTERS (\\\"RETAIL\\\"). WHOLESALE SALES PRICES ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF THE HOME AND THE COST TO SHIP THE HOME FROM A HOMEBUILDING FACILITY TO THE HOME-SITE. RETAIL HOME PRICES INCLUDE THESE ITEMS AND RETAIL MARKUP, AS WELL AS ITEMS THAT ARE LARGELY SUBJECT TO HOME BUYER DISCRETION, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, INSTALLATION, UTILITY CONNECTIONS, SITE IMPROVEMENTS, LANDSCAPING AND ADDITIONAL SERVICES. CHANGES TO THE PROPORTION OF HOME SALES AMONG THESE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS BETWEEN REPORTING PERIODS IMPACTS THE OVERALL NET REVENUE PER HOME SOLD. FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , THE COMPANY SOLD  9,222  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  2,231  HOMES RETAIL VERSUS  8,891  HOMES WHOLESALE AND  1,979  HOMES RETAIL IN THE COMPARABLE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD. FURTHER, FLUCTUATIONS IN NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD ARE THE RESULT OF CHANGES IN PRODUCT MIX, WHICH RESULTS FROM HOME BUYER TASTES AND PREFERENCES AS THEY SELECT HOME TYPES/MODELS, AS WELL AS OPTIONAL HOME UPGRADES WHEN PURCHASING THE HOME. THESE SELECTIONS VARY REGULARLY BASED ON CONSUMER INTERESTS, LOCAL HOUSING PREFERENCES AND ECONOMIC CIRCUMSTANCES. OUR PRODUCT PRICES ARE ALSO PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED FOR THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS INCLUDED IN, AND LABOR USED TO PRODUCE, EACH HOME. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED, AND EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, VOLATILITY IN OVERALL NET FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING REVENUE PER HOME SOLD.  FINANCIAL SERVICES SEGMENT REVENUE  INCREASED  FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  , FROM GREATER UNREALIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS IN THE INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY\\u2019S PORTFOLIO, AN INCREASE IN HOME LOAN SALES COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD, ADDITIONAL INTEREST INCOME ON COMMERCIAL LOANS OUTSTANDING AND MORE INSURANCE POLICIES IN FORCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE OVERALL  INCREASE  IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST INCOME EARNED ON THE ACQUIRED LOAN PORTFOLIOS THAT CONTINUE TO AMORTIZE.  GROSS PROFIT.

THE DECREASE FOR THE  THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF A REDUCTION IN BOND INTEREST EXPENSE, AS THE COMPANY EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO REPURCHASE THE 2005-1 AND 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIOS IN JANUARY AND AUGUST 2019, RESPECTIVELY, THEREBY ELIMINATING THE RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AT  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , TOGETHER WITH CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS AND PROVIDE FOR GROWTH FOR THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS CASH IN U.S. TREASURY AND OTHER MONEY MARKET FUNDS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN EXCESS OF FEDERALLY INSURED LIMITS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS OF, OR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN, BUSINESSES THAT ARE COMPLEMENTARY TO THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS OTHER EXPANSION OPPORTUNITIES. SUCH TRANSACTIONS MAY REQUIRE THE USE OF CASH AND HAVE OTHER IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE RECENT ACQUISITION OF DESTINY HOMES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR LIQUIDITY OR CAPITAL RESOURCES. BECAUSE OF THE COMPANY'S SUFFICIENT CASH POSITION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT HISTORICALLY SOUGHT EXTERNAL SOURCES OF LIQUIDITY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN CREDIT FACILITIES FOR ITS HOME-ONLY LENDING PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES, IT MAY NEED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL OR ALTERNATIVE SOURCES OF FINANCING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH FINANCING WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON SATISFACTORY TERMS, IF AT ALL. IF THIS FINANCING WERE NOT AVAILABLE, IT COULD BE NECESSARY FOR THE COMPANY TO REEVALUATE ITS LONG-TERM OPERATING PLANS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT USE OF ITS EXISTING CAPITAL RESOURCES. THE EXACT NATURE OF ANY CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PLANS THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED DEPENDS ON VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS CONDITIONS IN THE FACTORY-BUILT HOUSING INDUSTRY AND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S CONTROL.  STATE INSURANCE REGULATIONS RESTRICT THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS THAT CAN BE PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES. AS A RESULT, THE ASSETS OWNED BY THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE TO SATISFY THE CLAIMS OF CAVCO OR ITS LEGAL SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AT ITS INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY REMAINS SUFFICIENT AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS ABILITY TO PAY ORDINARY DIVIDENDS TO CAVCO WILL BE RESTRICTED PER STATE REGULATIONS.  THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S CASH FLOWS FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2019  AND  DECEMBER 29, 2018  , RESPECTIVELY (IN THOUSANDS).

CONSUMER LOAN ORIGINATIONS  INCREASED  BY  $22.9 MILLION  TO  $121.6 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 28, 2019  FROM  $98.7 MILLION  FOR THE  NINE MONTHS ENDED  DECEMBER 29, 2018  . PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF CONSUMER LOANS PROVIDED  $117.1 MILLION  IN CASH, COMPARED TO  $96.7 MILLION  IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR.  42  TABLE OF CONTENTS  WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER LENDING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOUSING, STATES MAY CLASSIFY MANUFACTURED HOMES FOR BOTH LEGAL AND TAX PURPOSES AS PERSONAL PROPERTY RATHER THAN REAL ESTATE. AS A RESULT, FINANCING FOR THE PURCHASE OF MANUFACTURED HOMES IS CHARACTERIZED BY SHORTER LOAN MATURITIES AND HIGHER INTEREST RATES. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY HAVE MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. SEE ITEM IA, \\\"RISK FACTORS\\\" IN THE COMPANY'S FORM 10-K.  CAVCO HAS ENTERED INTO COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN DISTRIBUTORS OF ITS PRODUCTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR WHOLESALE PURCHASES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO DIRECT COMMERCIAL LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH DISTRIBUTORS, COMMUNITIES AND DEVELOPERS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY PROVIDES FUNDS FOR FINANCING HOMES. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO INVESTED IN COMMUNITY-BASED LENDING INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE HOME-ONLY FINANCING TO NEW RESIDENTS OF CERTAIN MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES (SEE NOTE  7  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FURTHER, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN AND DEVELOPED HOME-ONLY LOAN POOLS AND LENDING PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT THIRD PARTY FINANCIER INTEREST IN ORDER TO GROW SALES OF NEW HOMES THROUGH TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION POINTS.  NET CASH FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS PRIMARILY USED TO FUND THE ACQUISITION OF DESTINY HOMES, WHICH OPERATES A MANUFACTURED AND MODULAR HOUSING FACTORY IN MOULTRIE, GEORGIA.  FINANCING ACTIVITIES USED  $13.2 MILLION  MORE CASH DURING THE PERIOD COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, AS THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THE 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO IN AUGUST 2019, ELIMINATING THE RELATED SECURITIZED FINANCINGS.  FINANCINGS.  IN AUGUST 2019, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THE 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO, LEAVING NO FURTHER SECURITIZED FINANCING BALANCE OUTSTANDING.  THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO SECURED CREDIT FACILITIES WITH INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY BANKS WITH DRAW PERIODS FROM ONE TO FIFTEEN MONTHS AND MATURITY DATES OF TEN YEARS AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE DRAW PERIODS. THIS DRAW DOWN PERIOD EXPIRED IN SEPTEMBER 2019. THE PROCEEDS ARE USED BY THE COMPANY TO ORIGINATE AND HOLD CONSUMER HOME-ONLY LOANS SECURED BY MANUFACTURED HOMES, WHICH ARE PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL TO THE FACILITIES. UPON COMPLETION OF THE DRAW DOWN PERIOD, THE FACILITIES WERE CONVERTED INTO AN AMORTIZING LOAN BASED ON A 20-YEAR AMORTIZATION PERIOD WITH A BALLOON PAYMENT DUE UPON MATURITY. THE MAXIMUM ADVANCE FOR LOANS UNDER THIS PROGRAM WAS 80% OF THE OUTSTANDING COLLATERAL PRINCIPAL BALANCE, WITH THE COMPANY PROVIDING THE REMAINING FUNDS. AS OF  DECEMBER 28, 2019  , THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE CONVERTED LOANS WAS  $10.8 MILLION  AT A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 4.91%.  CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES.  OTHER THAN THE COMPANY'S REPURCHASE OF THE 2007-1 SECURITIZED LOAN PORTFOLIO, WHICH IS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS SET FORTH IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.
