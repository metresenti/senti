A WELLS FARGO ATM MACHINE IS SHOWN IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S. OCTOBER 19, 2018. REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE  WELLS FARGO HAS STRUGGLED TO REGAIN ITS FOOTING SINCE SALES ABUSES CAME TO LIGHT IN THAT BUSINESS MORE THAN TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN THE BANK SAID EMPLOYEES HAD OPENED MILLIONS OF FAKE ACCOUNTS IN CUSTOMERS\\u2019 NAMES WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION.  MANAGEMENT HAS SINCE CENTRALIZED RISK CONTROLS, OVERHAULED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND PUSHED A RENEWED FOCUS ON CUSTOMER WELLNESS TO ADDRESS UNDERLYING PROBLEMS.  SOME OF THOSE CHANGES ARE HURTING REVENUE, EXECUTIVES ACKNOWLEDGED ON TUESDAY WHEN DISCUSSING FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS. FOR INSTANCE, THE BANK NOW SENDS CUSTOMERS REAL-TIME LOW BALANCE ALERTS TO PROTECT THEM FROM OVERDRAFT FEES.  WELLS FARGO IS ALSO EXPERIENCING CYCLICAL PRESSURE IN MORTGAGE LENDING, WHICH WAS ONCE ITS MAIN MONEY-MAKER, AND HAS INTENTIONALLY PULLED BACK FROM SOME AREAS, LIKE AUTO LENDING, WHERE EXECUTIVES FELT PROFIT POTENTIAL WAS LIMITED.  COMBINED WITH LEGAL AND REGULATORY PENALTIES FOR ITS SALES ABUSES, WHICH ALSO INVOLVED OVERCHARGING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CUSTOMERS ON AUTO LOANS, MORTGAGES AND ACCOUNT FEATURES THEY DID NOT REQUEST, THE BANK HAS STRUGGLED TO GET ITS PROFIT ENGINE HUMMING AGAIN.  IN LIEU OF REVENUE GROWTH, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER TIM SLOAN HAS LAID OUT AN AGGRESSIVE COST-CUTTING PLAN TO BUOY PROFITS.  THE BANK\\u2019S SHARES FELL 1.5 PERCENT TO CLOSE AT $47.67.  ASSET CAP  SLOAN SAID ON TUESDAY HE EXPECTS THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO MAINTAIN AN ASSET CAP ON THE BANK THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR.  THE FED IMPOSED THAT PENALTY IN FEBRUARY AS PUNISHMENT FOR THE SALES ABUSES, SAYING IT WOULD ONLY BE LIFTED ONCE THE BANK PROVED IT HAD FIXED WHAT WAS WRONG.  WELLS FARGO EXECUTIVES INITIALLY SAID THE CAP WOULD NOT HINDER THE BANK\\u2019S BUSINESS GROWTH, AND AS RECENTLY AS JULY PREDICTED IT WOULD BE LIFTED BY MID-2019.  BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN EXPECTED, SLOAN SAID ON A CALL WITH ANALYSTS, WHO PEPPERED HIM WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROFIT IMPACT OF THE ASSET CAP.  \\u201cIT IS HARD NOT TO FEEL LIKE THE REGULATORY PENALTY BOX IS ENDLESS,\\u201d SAID BRIAN FORAN, AN ANALYST WITH AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH.  THE BANK HAS ALREADY PAID BILLIONS IN COMBINED FINES AND SETTLEMENTS WITH REGULATORS AND PRIVATE LITIGANTS OVER ITS SALES ABUSES, AND REMAINS ON A TIGHT LEASH WITH THE U.S. CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY AS IT CONTINUES REMEDIATION EFFORTS.  WELLS FARGO ALSO FACES PROBES FROM THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE BANK\\u2019S LOAN BOOK SHRANK 1 PERCENT AND DEPOSITS FELL 3 PERCENT. CONSUMER LOANS POSTED THE BIGGEST DECLINE, HURT PRIMARILY BY MORE PEOPLE PAYING OFF THEIR MORTGAGES THAN TAKING OUT NEW ONES. MORTGAGE BANKING REVENUE FELL BY HALF.  WELLS FARGO\\u2019S OVERALL QUARTERLY PROFIT OF $5.71 BILLION, OR $1.21 PER SHARE, WAS DOWN 1 PERCENT FROM THE $5.74 BILLION, OR $1.16 PER SHARE, A YEAR EARLIER.  THOSE RESULTS REFLECTED SPECIAL ITEMS INCLUDING SOME $432 MILLION IN OPERATING LOSSES FROM LEGAL COSTS, REGULATORY PENALTIES AND CUSTOMER REMEDIATION, AND A $614 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF TROUBLED MORTGAGE LOANS THAT PREDATE THE 2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  ANALYSTS ON AVERAGE EXPECTED EARNINGS OF $1.19 PER SHARE, ACCORDING TO IBES DATA FROM REFINITIV.  REVENUE FELL 5 PERCENT TO $20.98 BILLION, BELOW WALL STREET\\u2019S $21.73 BILLION ESTIMATE.  WELLS FARGO MET SLOAN\\u2019S EXPENSE TARGET LAST YEAR WHEN EXCLUDING BIG ONE-TIME ITEMS LIKE LEGAL COSTS, REGULATORY PENALTIES AND CUSTOMER REMEDIATION EXPENSES.  THE BANK IS NOW AIMING TO SLASH EXPENSES TO A RANGE OF $52 BILLION TO $53 BILLION THIS YEAR, AND $50 BILLION TO $51 BILLION BY 2020. WELLS FARGO IS ON TRACK TO HIT THOSE GOALS THROUGH EFFICIENCY PROGRAMS THAT WILL REDUCE OVERALL HEADCOUNT BY 5 PERCENT TO 10 PERCENT, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER JOHN SHREWSBERRY SAID.

A SAUDI MAN WHO'S BROTHER DIED IN THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT ET 302 PLANE CRASH, TOUCHES A DEBRIS AFTER A COMMEMORATION CEREMONY AT THE SCENE OF THE CRASH, NEAR THE TOWN OF BISHOFTU, SOUTHEAST OF ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA MARCH 13, 2019. REUTERS/BAZ RATNER  SUNDAY\\u2019S CRASH OCCURRED FIVE MONTHS AFTER THE SAME MODEL OF THE PLANE WENT DOWN IN INDONESIA, AN ACCIDENT THAT PROMPTED A STRING OF U.S. LAWSUITS AGAINST BOEING BY FAMILIES OF THE 189 VICTIMS.  WHILE NO LAWSUITS HAVE YET BEEN FILED SINCE THE CRASH OF ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT 302, SOME PLAINTIFFS\\u2019 LAWYERS SAID THEY EXPECT THAT BOEING WILL BE SUED IN THE UNITED STATES.  BOEING DID NOT IMMEDIATELY COMMENT.  THE COMPANY, WHICH HAS ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS IN CHICAGO, HAS OFTEN CONVINCED U.S. JUDGES TO DISMISS AIR CRASH CASES IN FAVOR OF LITIGATION IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THE EVIDENCE AND WITNESSES ARE, USUALLY WHERE THE CRASH OCCURRED.  THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO AVOID U.S. JURIES, WHICH CAN AWARD HEFTY PUNITIVE DAMAGES TO ACCIDENT VICTIMS FOR WRONGFUL DEATH, EMOTIONAL SUFFERING AND ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS OF SURVIVING FAMILY.  BOEING MAY HAVE A TOUGHER TIME WITH THAT STRATEGY AFTER THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH, SOME LEGAL EXPERTS SAID.  THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE EIGHT U.S. CITIZENS DIED AND BECAUSE PLAINTIFFS COULD ARGUE THAT LIABILITY HINGES ON SYSTEM DESIGN AND SAFETY DECISIONS MADE BY BOEING EXECUTIVES SINCE THE LION AIR CRASH IN INDONESIA.  \\u201cNOW WITH TWO CRASHES WITH A BRAND-NEW AIRCRAFT, WHAT BOEING DID IN THE INTERVENING FIVE MONTHS IS MORE RELEVANT, AND THAT ALL HAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES,\\u201d SAID DANIEL ROSE, A LAWYER WITH KREINDLER & KREINDLER, A FIRM THAT REPRESENTS AIR CRASH VICTIMS AND THEIR RELATIVES.  THE CAUSES ARE STILL UNKNOWN, BUT BOTH INVOLVED A RELATIVELY NEW 737 MAX 8 AIRCRAFT THAT CRASHED WITHIN MINUTES OF TAKEOFF AND EXPERIENCED SUDDEN DROPS IN ALTITUDE WHEN THE AIRCRAFTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEADILY CLIMBING.  THIS HAS RAISED FRESH QUESTIONS AMONG REGULATORS ABOUT A DIGITAL ANTI-STALL SYSTEM KNOWN AS MANEUVERING CHARACTERISTICS AUGMENTATION SYSTEM, OR MCAS, DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE MAX TO OFFSET THE EXTRA LIFT FROM LARGER ENGINES MOUNTED ON ITS LOW-SLUNG FRAME.  IN A MARCH 4 COURT FILING IN LITIGATION OVER THE INDONESIA CRASH, BOEING ASKED THE JUDGE TO LIMIT ALL DISCOVERY IN THE CASE TO ISSUES OF FORUM, OR WHICH COUNTRY THE CASED BELONGED, AND SAID IT PLANNED TO FILE A MOTION TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT.  LIABILITY  WHILE POTENTIAL PLAINTIFFS MAY NAME ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES AS A DEFENDANT IN ANY LAWSUITS, THE FOCUS ON THE 737 MAX 8 ANTI-STALL SYSTEM MAKES BOEING A LIKELY TARGET OF LITIGATION, SOME LAWYERS SAID.  ARTHUR WOLK, AN ATTORNEY WHO REPRESENTS PLAINTIFFS IN AIR CRASH LITIGATION AND SAID HE HAS BEEN CONTACTED BY A POTENTIAL PLAINTIFF OVER THE ETHIOPIAN AIRLINES CRASH, SAID BOEING WOULD LIKELY FACE CLAIMS FOR STRICT LIABILITY. THAT MEANS THEY COULD FACE AN ALLEGATION OF HAVING SOLD A PRODUCT THAT WAS INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE AND DANGEROUS.  PLAINTIFFS WILL ALSO CLAIM BOEING FAILED TO EXERCISE REASONABLE CARE IN DESIGNING PLANES OR FAILED TO INFORM FLIGHT CREWS ABOUT HOW THE PLANES OPERATE, WOLK SAID.  ROSE, THE LAWYER FOR PASSENGERS, SAID TWO ACCIDENTS SO CLOSE TOGETHER WILL PUT THE FOCUS OF ANY LAWSUITS ON THE ETHIOPIAN CRASH ON HOW BOEING TRIED TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS WITH ITS MCAS SYSTEM AFTER THE LION AIR CRASH.  \\u201cWERE THERE OTHER EFFORTS BY BOEING TO ESSENTIALLY MINIMIZE THE PROBLEM OR HIDE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM?\\u201d ROSE ASKED. IF LAWYERS CAN SHOW BOEING MANAGEMENT ACTED RECKLESSLY, IT COULD CLEAR THE WAY FOR SUBSTANTIAL PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HE SAID.  SOME LAWYERS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF SUCH CASES ARE LESS SURE ABOUT BOEING\\u2019S POTENTIAL LIABILITY.  KENNETH QUINN, A LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS AIRLINES AND MANUFACTURERS, SAID HE THOUGHT BOEING HAD A GOOD CHANCE OF GETTING BOTH SETS OF U.S. CASES DISMISSED ON FORUM GROUNDS.  HE SAID THE TREND IN U.S. COURTS WAS IN BOEING\\u2019S FAVOR.  \\u201cINCREASINGLY, ATTEMPTS TO LITIGATE FOREIGN CRASHES INVOLVING FOREIGN AIRLINES ON FOREIGN SOIL ARE BEING DISMISSED,\\u201d HE SAID.  IN NOVEMBER, A FEDERAL JUDGE IN WASHINGTON, D.C. DISMISSED A CASE AGAINST BOEING AND OTHER DEFENDANTS STEMMING FROM THE DISAPPEARANCE OF A MALAYSIAN AIRLINES FLIGHT IN 2014 BECAUSE THE PRESUMED CRASH HAD A STRONGER CONNECTION TO MALAYSIA THAN THE UNITED STATES.  IN 2011, A FEDERAL JUDGE IN LOS ANGELES DISMISSED 116 WRONGFUL DEATH AND PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES AGAINST BOEING OVER THE 2008 CRASH OF A SPANAIR JET ON A DOMESTIC FLIGHT IN SPAIN, WHERE THE JUDGE DETERMINED THE CASES SHOULD BE HEARD.  IF THE COMPANY HAS TO DEFEND U.S. CASES, IT WOULD LIKELY ARGUE THAT CLAIMS AGAINST IT ARE PREEMPTED BECAUSE THE FAA HAD APPROVED THE PLANE\\u2019S DESIGN, SAID JUSTIN GREEN, A PLAINTIFFS LAWYER.  WHILE MANUFACTURERS IN THE PAST HAVE ENJOYED BROAD PROTECTION UNDER THE FEDERAL AVIATION ACT, A DECISION BY THE 3RD U.S. COURT OF APPEALS HAS CALLED INTO QUESTION WHETHER MANUFACTURERS CAN RELY ON PREEMPTION WHEN THEY COULD HAVE EASILY SUBMITTED CHANGES TO THE FAA FOR APPROVAL.\", \"Ticker\": \"BA\", \"Date\": \"2019-03-15T00:00:00\", \"key\": \"20190315BA\", \"labelr0\": 1.524243236003214, \"labelr1\": -1.7704952637272846, \"labelr2\": 0.3089072740947766, \"labelr3\": 0.7310607074953855, \"labelr4\": -0.9198213526159176, \"pos\": 0.272, \"neg\": 0.361, \"compound\": -0.1779, \"0_day_return\": 1.52424323600322, \"1_day_return\": -1.7704952637272895, \"2_day_return\": -1.4670571782896658, \"3_day_return\": -0.7467215493812573, \"4_day_return\": -1.6596743977413733, \"return\": 0.0037059469240238938, \"excess_return\": -1.7742012106513136, \"count_of_word\": 859, \"pred\": -1, \"prof-1\": 0.4803303, \"prof1\": 0.5196697, \"fst_sentencepc_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_pred\": -1, \"linearsgdlog_prof_-1\": 0.5173404970409593, \"linearsgdlog_prof_1\": 0.4826595029590407, \"fst_sentencepc_prof-1\": 0.4803303, \"fst_sentencepc_prof1\": 0.5196697, \"vader_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof-1\": 0.51748085, \"fst_spacy_prof1\": 0.48251912, \"tr_pred\": 1, \"tr_prof-1\": 0.46570387, \"tr_prof1\": 0.53429615, \"fst_spacy_pred2\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof2-1\": 0.44665244, \"fst_spacy_prof21\": 0.5533475999999999, \"fst_sentencepc_pred2\": -1, \"fst_sentencepc_prof2-1\": 0.56066656, \"fst_sentencepc_prof21\": 0.43933347, \"headline_pred\": -1, \"headline_prof2-1\": 0.56589633, \"headline_prof21\": 0.43410373, \"textplusheadline_pred\": -1, \"textplusheadline_prof2-1\": 0.5713676, \"textplusheadline_prof21\": 0.4286324000000001, \"tr_headlineplustext_pred\": 1, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof-1\": 0.26548025, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof1\": 0.7345198000000001, \"tr_headline_prof-1\": 0.8214906999999999, \"tr_headline_prof1\": 0.17850934, \"tr_headline_pred\": -1, \"catboost_pred\": 1, \"lgbm_pred\": 1, \"xtrees_pred\": 1, \"label\": -1, \"returnpred\": -1.7704952637272895, \"returnpredcat\": -1.7704952637272895, \"returnpredlgbm\": -1.7704952637272895, \"returnpredxtree\": -1.7704952637272895, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0084098760648827, \"dailyaveragereturncat\": 1.0084098760648827, \"dailyaveragereturnlgbm\": 1.0079151505545512, \"dailyaveragereturnxtree\": 1.0084098760648827, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.0597935173934534, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.1525517279079172, \"cumreturn1d\": 1.1248016654555166, \"cumreturn1e\": 1.04328164279594, \"cumreturndow\": 1.1286478282208627, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.1099902746336152}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 3662, \"level_0\": 3662, \"index\": 3662, \"text\": \"FILE PHOTO: THE LOGO OF AMERICA MOVIL IS PICTURED ON THE WALL OF A RECEPTION AREA IN THE COMPANY'S CORPORATE OFFICES IN MEXICO CITY, MEXICO, MAY 18, 2017.

REUTERS/SERGIO PEREZ/FILE PHOTO  SANTANDER SAID IT WAS AIMING FOR INCREMENTAL ANNUAL COST SAVINGS OF 1.2 BILLION EUROS ($1.4 BILLION) IN THE MEDIUM TERM, OF WHICH 1 BILLION EUROS WOULD COME FROM EUROPE.  EUROPE\\u2019S BANKS ARE FOCUSED ON COST SAVINGS AS THEY ATTEMPT TO OFFSET A SQUEEZE ON MARGINS DUE TO ONGOING RECORD-LOW INTEREST RATES IN THE EURO ZONE.  SANTANDER SHARES WERE UP 2.1 PERCENT AT 116 GMT AGAINST A 1.4 PERCENT RISE ON THE EUROPEAN STOXX BANKING INDEX.  AS PART OF ITS FOCUS ON EFFICIENCY IN EUROPE, IT SAID IT WAS EXPECTING 250 MILLION EUROS OF ADDITIONAL COST SAVINGS IN SPAIN FROM THE INTEGRATION OF POPULAR TO BOOST ITS UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY TO BETWEEN 14-16 PERCENT FROM AROUND 11 PERCENT.  WHEN IT FIRST ANNOUNCED THE ACQUISITION OF POPULAR IN 2017, SANTANDER SAID IT WAS EXPECTING COST SYNERGIES OF CLOSE TO 500 MILLION EUROS PER YEAR FROM 2020.

OF ITS MAIN MARKETS, BRITAIN WAS THE AREA WITH THE LOWEST UNDERLYING PROFITABILITY TARGET RATIO. IT SET OUT A TARGET OF BETWEEN 10-12 PERCENT FROM 9 PERCENT IN 2018.

THE BANK ALSO SAID IT WAS AIMING TO REACH A COST-INCOME RATIO - A MEASURE OF EFFICIENCY - OF BETWEEN 42 PERCENT AND 45 PERCENT AT GROUP LEVEL IN THE MEDIUM TERM FROM 47 PERCENT.

LATIN AMERICA PROFITABILITY  IN BRAZIL, THE BANK\\u2019S BIGGEST MARKET, SANTANDER SAID IT WAS EXPECTING LOW INTEREST RATES TO MAINTAIN GROWTH IN ITS LOAN BOOK AND KEEP IMPROVING ITS UNDERLYING ROTE ABOVE 20 PERCENT.  ITS BUSINESS IN LATIN AMERICA, RESPONSIBLE FOR 43 PERCENT OF THE BANK\\u2019S PROFITS, WAS SEEN RISING ITS PROFITABILITY TO BETWEEN 20-22 PERCENT, THANKS TO HIGH AND SUSTAINABLE REVENUE GROWTH.

FILE PHOTO: THE TRAFIGURA LOGO IS PICTURED AT THE COMPANY ENTRANCE IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND MARCH 11, 2012. REUTERS/DENIS BALIBOUSE/FILE PHOTO  TO BE SURE, THOSE LOSSES ARE ON PAPER AND COULD BE ELIMINATED OR TURN INTO GAINS IN THE FUTURE IF THE MARKET TURNS IN TRAFIGURA\\u2019S FAVOUR. OR THEY COULD GET BIGGER IF THE OPPOSITE HAPPENS.  THE HEDGING LOSSES AT PRIVATELY OWNED TRAFIGURA, WHICH MADE A NET PROFIT OF $873 MILLION LAST YEAR, HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED.  LIKE MANY OTHER TRADING HOUSES, TRAFIGURA HAS MOVED INTO THE FAST-GROWING, GLOBAL MARKET FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS (LNG).  PRIVATELY OWNED TRADERS VITOL AND GUNVOR AND LISTED GLENCORE ARE ALSO EXPANDING IN LNG AND SAID THEY WERE USING HEDGES TO PROTECT THEIR EXPOSURE IN THAT SECTOR.  IN 2018, TRAFIGURA SIGNED A DEAL WITH U.S. COMPANY CHENIERE TO BUY LNG FOR 15 YEARS AND EXPORT IT TO EUROPE AND ASIA. ON SIGNING THE DEAL, TRAFIGURA HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO U.S. LNG PRICES AGAINST SHARP PRICE MOVES IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.  BUT HEDGING LNG IS COMPLICATED AND CONTAINS RISKS, SAYS TRAFIGURA\\u2019S OWN 2018 REPORT AND ITS AUDITOR PWC, WHICH REVIEWED AND SIGNED OFF ON TRAFIGURA\\u2019S ACCOUNTS FOR LAST YEAR.  TO HEDGE THE DEAL, TRAFIGURA HAD TO RELY ON A COMBINATION OF LIQUID PRICES SUCH AS THOSE OF U.S. NATURAL GAS OR BRENT CRUDE AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE CORRELATION OF THOSE LIQUID BENCHMARKS TO ILLIQUID GLOBAL LNG PRICES FOR UP TO FIVE YEARS FORWARD.  \\u201cTHIS HEDGE IS NOT PERFECT BUT IT IS THE BEST ONE AVAILABLE OUT THERE AT THE MOMENT,\\u201d A TRAFIGURA SOURCE SAID. AS THE LNG MARKET DEVELOPS, HE SAID, MORE INSTRUMENTS WILL APPEAR.  \\u201cIT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO EFFECTIVELY HEDGE THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS, ESPECIALLY IN A NEW MARKET LIKE LNG,\\u201d SAID ARNAUD VAGNER, FOUNDER OF ICEBERG RESEARCH. VITOL ALSO SAID CONTRACT MATURITIES CREATED HEDGING COMPLEXITIES.  BIG VALUE MOVES  INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (IFRS) REQUIRE COMPANIES TO MARK-TO-MARKET - OR MEASURE THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OVER TIME - THE SHORT AND LONG POSITIONS THEY USE FOR HEDGING.  IN ADDITION TO LNG, TRAFIGURA IN 2018 HEDGED ITS U.S. OIL PIPELINE AND REFINING DEALS AGAINST SHARP MOVES IN U.S. CRUDE VERSUS BRENT PRICES.  TO HEDGE LNG, PIPELINES AND REFINING TRAFIGURA BUILT A SHORT POSITION WITH A FAIR VALUE LOSS OF AROUND $1.9 BILLION USING LIQUID INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS BRENT, U.S. NATURAL GAS AND DIESEL.  THE MARGIN CALLS WERE FINANCED VIA A REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND OTHER BANK LINES ADDING TO TRAFIGURA\\u2019S DEBT, WHICH STANDS AT A TOTAL OF $32 BILLION. ITS ADJUSTED NET DEBT - DEBT LESS CASH AND INVENTORIES - STANDS AT $6 BILLION.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE \\u2013 THE LONG SIDE \\u2013 TRAFIGURA HAD FAIR VALUE GAINS OF $1.75 BILLION FROM LNG, PIPELINES AND REFINING DEALS. THE LNG PORTION OF THE GAINS WAS $646 MILLION.  FAIR VALUE GAINS AND LOSSES WERE UP MORE THAN 10-FOLD COMPARED TO 2017, BEFORE TRAFIGURA ENTERED INTO THOSE LNG, PIPELINE AND REFINING HEDGING DEALS.  FAIR VALUE GAINS AND LOSSES IMPACT BOTH BALANCE SHEET AND PROFITS AS THEY ARE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF SALES.  BECAUSE THE SHORT POSITION WAS BUILT ON LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE LOSSES BELONGED TO THE SO-CALLED LEVEL 1 ACCOUNTING HIERARCHY - THE STRICTEST CATEGORY THAT MAKES FEW ASSUMPTIONS.  BY CONTRAST, FAIR VALUE GAINS WERE BASED ON LEVEL 2 AND, IN THE CASE OF LNG, ON LEVEL 3, THE MOST JUDGMENTAL CATEGORY IN THE FAIR VALUATION ACCOUNTING HIERARCHY, WHICH IS MAINLY BASED ON PRICE MODELLING RATHER THAN MARKET PRICES.  \\u201cCHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE GROUP\\u2019S FUTURE RESULTS,\\u201d SAID PWC, ADDING THAT IT WAS STILL ABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT JUDGEMENTS WERE REASONABLE AND FREE FROM BIAS.  \\u201cLEVEL 3 GIVES A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO COMMODITY TRADERS AS IN PRACTICE FUTURE PRICES ARE WHATEVER THE TRADER HAS DECIDED THEY WOULD BE,\\u201d ICEBERG\\u2019S VAGNER SAID.  PERFORMANCE RISK  AS LOSSES FROM THE SHORTS EXCEEDED GAINS FROM THE LONGS, TRAFIGURA HAD TO BOOK A $254 MILLION LOSS REPRESENTING A REDUCTION OF 22 PERCENT OF THE POTENTIAL NET PROFIT IT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE ACHIEVED IN 2018.  BESIDES MID-TERM PRICE RISK, SUCH HEDGES ALSO BEAR THE LONGER-TERM RISK OF DEALS FALLING APART.  FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THE UNITED STATES BANS LNG EXPORTS, TRADERS WOULD BE STUCK WITH SHORTS AGAINST NON-PERFORMING LONGS.  \\u201cWHEN YOU HEDGE MARKET RISK, YOU TAKE PERFORMANCE RISK. THIS IS HOW HEDGING WORKS,\\u201d THE TRAFIGURA SOURCE SAID, ADDING THAT \\u201cTHE PERFORMANCE RISKS CAN BE MITIGATED NOTABLY BY INSURANCE MECHANISMS\\u201d.  VAGNER SAID: \\u201cTHE LNG CONTRACT IS 15 YEARS LONG. THIS TYPE OF CONTRACT IS RISKY AS ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO YOUR SUPPLIER AND ITS MARKET DURING THAT TIME\\u201d.  VAGNER IS KNOWN FOR HAVING ACCUSED SINGAPORE-BASED TRADER NOBLE GROUP OF USING FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING TO INFLATE PROFITS. NOBLE DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS BUT SUBSEQUENTLY DEFAULTED AND SOLD MANY OF ITS ASSETS AS PROFITS COLLAPSED.  BY CONTRAST, TRAFIGURA SAID IT USES FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING ONLY ON ITS HEDGING DEALS, INVENTORIES AND CERTAIN OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  \\u201cWE DON\\u2019T TAKE PROFIT OR LOSS ON UNREALISED PHYSICAL TRANSACTIONS. TRADERS ARE REMUNERATED ON THEIR REALISED PERFORMANCE,\\u201d THE TRAFIGURA SOURCE SAID.  OFFICIALS AND SOURCES AT OTHER TRADING HOUSES ALSO SAID THEY WERE NOT BOOKING UNREALISED PROFITS FROM LNG HEDGES.  \\u201cGUNVOR ONLY MARK-TO-MARKETS CONTRACTS IN THE ACTIVE TRADING PERIOD,\\u201d A SPOKESMAN SAID, WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE TIMEFRAME.\", \"Ticker\": \"GLNG\", \"Date\": \"2019-04-10T00:00:00\", \"key\": \"20190410GLNG\", \"labelr0\": 4.4620723847297885, \"labelr1\": 1.9458946369245376, \"labelr2\": -1.7690875232774628, \"labelr3\": -0.8056872037914772, \"labelr4\": -1.863354037267084, \"pos\": 0.0, \"neg\": 0.204, \"compound\": -0.3182, \"0_day_return\": 4.462072384729798, \"1_day_return\": 4.462072384729798, \"2_day_return\": 0.1423825344091023, \"3_day_return\": -0.6644518272425404, \"4_day_return\": -2.515424774561004, \"return\": 3.812292093953168e-05, \"excess_return\": 4.462034261808858, \"count_of_word\": 918, \"pred\": -1, \"prof-1\": 0.41684994, \"prof1\": 0.5831501, \"fst_sentencepc_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_prof_-1\": 0.4985200327327178, \"linearsgdlog_prof_1\": 0.5014799672672822, \"fst_sentencepc_prof-1\": 0.41684994, \"fst_sentencepc_prof1\": 0.5831501, \"vader_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof-1\": 0.6769970999999999, \"fst_spacy_prof1\": 0.32300287, \"tr_pred\": 1, \"tr_prof-1\": 0.4426338, \"tr_prof1\": 0.55736613, \"fst_spacy_pred2\": 1, \"fst_spacy_prof2-1\": 0.5524114999999999, \"fst_spacy_prof21\": 0.44758853, \"fst_sentencepc_pred2\": 1, \"fst_sentencepc_prof2-1\": 0.46284387, \"fst_sentencepc_prof21\": 0.53715616, \"headline_pred\": 1, \"headline_prof2-1\": 0.34587009999999996, \"headline_prof21\": 0.6541299, \"textplusheadline_pred\": -1, \"textplusheadline_prof2-1\": 0.5462800999999999, \"textplusheadline_prof21\": 0.45371985, \"tr_headlineplustext_pred\": 1, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof-1\": 0.47083038, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof1\": 0.5291696, \"tr_headline_prof-1\": 0.79835516, \"tr_headline_prof1\": 0.20164493, \"tr_headline_pred\": -1, \"catboost_pred\": 1, \"lgbm_pred\": -1, \"xtrees_pred\": -1, \"label\": 1, \"returnpred\": 4.462072384729798, \"returnpredcat\": 4.462072384729798, \"returnpredlgbm\": -4.462072384729798, \"returnpredxtree\": -4.462072384729798, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.015950973834914, \"dailyaveragereturncat\": 1.015950973834914, \"dailyaveragereturnlgbm\": 0.9935209874475338, \"dailyaveragereturnxtree\": 0.9935209874475338, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.142314923686318, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.2517414587503881, \"cumreturn1d\": 1.1598828731671538, \"cumreturn1e\": 1.0823952037315767, \"cumreturndow\": 1.1507113598759262, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.119797043077066}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 4982, \"level_0\": 4982, \"index\": 4982, \"text\": \"(REUTERS) - SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON UTILITY SAID ON THURSDAY IT REQUESTED A FEDERAL AGENCY TO ADJUST THE EXTRAORDINARY WILDFIRE RISK FOR THE PORTION REGULATED BY IT IN THE COMPANY\\u2019S AUTHORIZED RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE).

WESTERN OIL COMPANIES AND EUROPEAN REFINERS THAT BOUGHT THE OIL A MONTH AGO, BEFORE DISCOVERING IT WAS UNUSABLE, HAVE SO FAR REFRAINED FROM FREEZING PAYMENTS AS THEY ARE KEEN TO MAINTAIN GOOD LONG-TERM RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD\\u2019S SECOND BIGGEST OIL EXPORTER AND AVOID PROTRACTED LEGAL BATTLES IN RUSSIAN COURTS.  INSTEAD, SEVERAL WESTERN BUYERS HAVE ASKED RUSSIAN PRODUCERS IF THEY CAN POSTPONE PAYMENTS FOR THE TAINTED CRUDE WHILE BUYERS AND SELLERS AGREE HOW TO RESOLVE THE MESS - AND HOW TO SHARE THE COSTS, FOUR TRADERS INVOLVED IN RUSSIAN OIL TRADING SAID.  FOR THE BUYERS OF AN ESTIMATED 19 MILLION BARRELS OF CONTAMINATED CRUDE STUCK IN THE PIPELINE AND LOADED ON TANKERS, IT\\u2019S A $1.2 BILLION QUESTION.  THE BUYERS WANT RUSSIAN PRODUCERS TO GIVE GUARANTEES IN THE FORM OF BANK DEPOSITS THAT THEY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CLEAN-UP, OR DELAY PAYMENTS DUE THIS WEEK UNTIL THE CRISIS IS RESOLVED, SAID A SOURCE AT EUROPEAN REFINER, WHO DECLINED TO BE NAMED.  \\u201cTHERE\\u2019S AROUND 0.8-0.9 MILLION TONNES OF DIRTY OIL SITTING IN THE PIPELINES BETWEEN BELARUS AND GERMANY THAT NO REFINER WANTS TO TAKE,\\u201d HE SAID. \\u201cTHIS OIL NEEDS TO BE EVACUATED SOMEWHERE TO RESTART THE PIPELINE.

BUT WE WANT RUSSIAN PRODUCERS TO COME UP WITH FINANCIAL GUARANTEES THAT THEY WILL HELP COVER THE COSTS,\\u201d SAID A SECOND BUYER OF RUSSIAN OIL IN EUROPE.  RUSSIAN STATE-OWNED OIL PRODUCER ROSNEFT SAID IT WAS TOO EARLY TO COMMENT ON THE ISSUE. LUKOIL DECLINED TO COMMENT AND SURGUTNEFTEGAS SAID IT WAS HOLDING NORMAL COMMERCIAL TALKS WITH ITS BUYERS.  INTERNATIONAL OIL COMPANIES AND TRADING HOUSES HAVE NOT COMMENTED PUBLICLY ON THE CONTAMINATION CRISIS.  STATE RUSSIAN PIPELINE MONOPOLY TRANSNEFT DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE ISSUE OF COMPENSATION. IT SAID ON TUESDAY IT WAS NOT TO BLAME FOR THE ORGANIC CHLORIDE CONTAMINATION BECAUSE IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN ADDED BY PRODUCERS.  MAY DEADLINES  IT HAS BEEN THREE WEEKS SINCE BELARUS TOLD OIL REFINERS AND PIPELINE OPERATORS IN EUROPE THAT THE CRUDE HEADING TOWARDS THEM DOWN THE 5,500 KM (3,400 MILE) DRUZHBA PIPELINE NETWORK WAS HEAVILY CONTAMINATED WITH ORGANIC CHLORIDE.  RUSSIAN OIL FLOWS VIA DRUZHBA WERE HALTED, SENDING CRUDE TO A SIX-MONTH HIGH ABOVE $75 A BARREL AND TARNISHING RUSSIA\\u2019S REPUTATION AS AN EXPORTER AT A TIME OF RISING COMPETITION WITH U.S. AND MIDDLE EASTERN OIL SALES.  RUSSIA HAS SINCE SAID THE OIL WAS CONTAMINATED DELIBERATELY BY AN UNNAMED LOCAL PRODUCER WHILE BELARUS SAID IT WOULD TAKE MONTHS TO RESTORE CLEAN OIL SUPPLIES TO EUROPE VIA DRUZHBA.  ORGANIC CHLORIDE IS USED TO CLEAN OIL WELLS AND ACCELERATE THE FLOW OF CRUDE BUT IT SHOULD BE REMOVED BEFORE THE OIL ENTERS THE SUPPLY CHAIN AS THE COMPOUNDS CAN DAMAGE REFINING EQUIPMENT.  TO GET THE PIPELINE WORKING AGAIN, THE TAINTED OIL NEEDS TO BE REMOVED AND STORED SOMEWHERE SO IT CAN BE DILUTED WITH CLEAN OIL - IN SOME CASES IN PROPORTIONS OF ONE TO 30 - TO BRING THE ORGANIC CHLORIDE DOWN TO SAFE LEVELS.  TRADERS ESTIMATE THE PROCESS FOR ALL THE CONTAMINATED OIL IN DRUZHBA WOULD COST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.  RELATED COVERAGE RUSSIA SAYS IT MAY SELL CONTAMINATED OIL AT A DISCOUNT: IFX  IN THE MEANTIME, THE QUESTION OF WHO SHOULD PAY FOR THE CONTAMINATED OIL WHEN THE BILLS COME DUE THIS WEEK REMAINS.  $1.2 BILLION QUESTION  EXPORTS TO EUROPE VIA DRUZHBA ARE FAIRLY COMPLICATED BECAUSE THEY INVOLVE DOZENS OF SELLERS, BUYERS AND BANKS. NORMALLY, CONTRACTS ARE ROLLED OVER AND LETTERS OF CREDIT RENEWED AS PAYMENTS ARE MADE VIA INTERMEDIARIES - AND THE OIL KEEPS FLOWING.  BUT THE CONTAMINATION HAS THROWN A SPANNER IN THE WORKS.  RUSSIAN PRODUCERS SELL OIL TO EUROPEAN REFINERS ALONG THE DRUZHBA PIPELINE IN GERMANY, POLAND, SLOVAKIA, HUNGARY AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. THOSE REFINERIES ARE OWNED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS PKN ORLEN, GRUPA LOTOS, MOL, TOTAL, ENI AND SHELL, AMONG OTHERS.  ONCE THE RUSSIAN OIL PRODUCERS HAVE TRANSFERRED THEIR CRUDE TO TRANSNEFT, IT EFFECTIVELY BECOMES RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE RIGHT QUALITY OF CRUDE TO PIPELINE COMPANIES IN EUROPE.  AS SOON AS THOSE COMPANIES, SUCH AS POLAND\\u2019S PERN OR SLOVAKIA\\u2019S TRANSPETROL, ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF OIL FROM TRANSNEFT, THE OWNERSHIP OF THE CRUDE PASSES FROM RUSSIAN SELLERS TO EUROPEAN BUYERS.  BUT NO MONEY CHANGES HANDS AT THIS POINT AS PAYMENT IS USUALLY DUE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT MONTH, MEANING THE BILLS FOR OIL EXPORTED VIA DRUZHBA IN APRIL SHOULD BE PAID BY MID-MAY.  ACCORDING TO TRADING SOURCES, AT LEAST 19 MILLION BARRELS OF CONTAMINATED CRUDE, WORTH $1.2 BILLION AT CURRENT MARKET PRICES, HAS YET TO BE PAID FOR.  THAT INCLUDES 8 MILLION BARRELS IN THE DRUZHBA PIPELINE AND ANOTHER 11 MILLION BARRELS LOADED ONTO TANKERS AT UST-LUGA PORT IN THE BALTIC. THOSE VESSELS ARE NOW ANCHORED OFF EUROPE BECAUSE THE TRADING HOUSES THAT TOOK ON THE OIL ARE STRUGGLING TO SELL IT TO REFINERS.  RUSSIAN PRODUCERS, MEANWHILE, HAVE ALREADY PAID TAXES TO THE RUSSIAN STATE FOR THE OIL THEY SOLD IN APRIL - SUCH AS EXPORT DUTIES AND MINERAL EXTRACTION TAXES - PUTTING THEM UNDER PRESSURE TO RECOUP MONEY OWED BY THE BUYERS.  \\u2018EXPENSIVE EXERCISE\\u2019  WITH PAYMENT DEADLINES LOOMING, NONE OF THE WESTERN OIL BUYERS HAS YET INSTRUCTED THEIR BANKS TO WITHHOLD FUNDS AS THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT REPERCUSSIONS, ACCORDING TO TRADERS.  \\u201cYOU CAN OF COURSE SAY THAT I WON\\u2019T PAY BECAUSE I DIDN\\u2019T GET THE RIGHT QUALITY OIL,\\u201d SAID AN EXECUTIVE AT A MAJOR COMMODITIES TRADING HOUSE. \\u201cBUT NO ONE WANTS THIS NUCLEAR OPTION. WE PREFER RESPONSIBLE DIALOGUE.\\u201d  ANOTHER SOURCE WITH A MAJOR BUYER SAID THE MONEY IT OWES FOR UST-LUGA CARGOES WILL BE PAID ON TIME BUT IT WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES AGAINST THE SELLERS FOR POOR QUALITY.  FURTHER COMPLICATING TALKS BETWEEN BUYERS AND SELLERS IS THE FACT THAT THE VARIOUS OIL CONTRACTS IN QUESTION FALL UNDER DIFFERENT LEGAL SYSTEMS.  MOST SALES ALONG THE PIPELINE ARE GOVERNED BY RUSSIAN LAW - WHICH LEAVES ISSUES OF OIL QUALITY OPEN TO INTERPRETATION. SALES FROM UST-LUGA, MEANWHILE, ARE MOSTLY GOVERNED BY ENGLISH LAW, ACCORDING TO TRADERS FAMILIAR WITH THE CONTRACTS.  \\u201cWE EXPECT A COMPLICATED CLAIM HANDLING THROUGH THE WHOLE SUPPLY CHAIN OF RUSSIAN CRUDE OIL,\\u201d SAID SWEDISH REFINER PREEM.

REUTERS/VLADIMIR SOLDATKIN/FILE PHOTO  BELARUSIAN REFINER NAFTAN SAID IT HAD FILED CLAIMS AGAINST UNNAMED RUSSIAN SUPPLIERS FOR DELIVERING LOW QUALITY OIL DURING APRIL.  FOR NOW THOUGH, UNTIL BUYERS AND SELLERS CAN AGREE HOW TO GET THE TAINTED OIL OUT OF DRUZHBA - AND WHO WILL FOOT THE BILL - THE PIPELINE IS SET TO REMAIN SHUT.  \\u201cBASED ON DRUZHBA\\u2019S NORMAL THROUGHPUT, EVERY NEW DAY OF STOPPAGE COSTS RUSSIA $80 MILLION IN LOST REVENUE.

CARIGE\\u2019S TEMPORARY ADMINISTRATORS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIND A BUYER FOR MONTHS BUT THEIR EFFORTS WERE THROWN INTO DISARRAY LAST MONTH WHEN BLACKROCK PULLED OUT OF A PROPOSED RESCUE PLAN.

TWO OF THE SOURCES SAID ON WEDNESDAY APOLLO, WHICH ALREADY OWNS CARIGE\\u2019S INSURANCE UNITS, HAD PRESENTED ITS OFFER THROUGH ITALIAN BROKER EQUITA, WHICH IS ACTING AS ITS ADVISER.

THE BANKS WOULD PLUG THE BULK OF THE REMAINDER THROUGH THE 320 MILLION EUROS BOND CONVERSION, WHICH WOULD GIVE THEM A CONTROLLING STAKE IN CARIGE.

NEW ORDERS FOR LONG-LASTING U.S.-MADE GOODS FELL FOR A SECOND STRAIGHT MONTH IN MAY AS TROUBLES AT BOEING WEIGHED ON DEMAND FOR AIRCRAFT, SUGGESTING MANUFACTURING COULD REMAIN WEAK EVEN AS BUSINESS SPENDING ON EQUIPMENT APPEARS TO STABILIZE.  FILE PHOTO - A BOEING WORKER IS PICTURED IN THE WING SYSTEM INSTALLATION AREA AT THEIR FACTORY IN RENTON, WASHINGTON, U.S., FEBRUARY 13, 2017. PICTURE TAKEN FEBRUARY 13, 2017. REUTERS/JASON REDMOND  THE REPORT FROM THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ON WEDNESDAY ADDED TO A RAFT OF WEAK DATA ON TRADE, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, HOUSING AND EMPLOYMENT GROWTH THAT HAVE INDICATED A SHARP LOSS OF MOMENTUM IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE SECOND QUARTER.  THE ECONOMY, WHICH WILL CELEBRATE A RECORD 10 YEARS OF EXPANSION NEXT MONTH, IS LOSING SPEED AMID AN EBB IN BOTH BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IN THE WAKE OF AN ESCALATION IN TRADE TENSIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.  MOMENTUM IS ALSO FIZZLING AS THE STIMULUS FROM LAST YEAR\\u2019S $1.5 TRILLION TAX CUT PACKAGE AND MORE GOVERNMENT SPENDING FADES. THE GROWING RISKS TO THE ECONOMY COUPLED WITH LOW INFLATION PROMPTED THE FEDERAL RESERVE TO LAST WEEK SIGNAL INTEREST RATE CUTS STARTING AS EARLY AS JULY.  \\u201cWE SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR FURTHER WEAKNESS AS THE FACTORY SECTOR CONTINUES TO FACE A CONFLUENCE OF HEADWINDS INCLUDING SLUGGISH GLOBAL GROWTH, RISING TRADE UNCERTAINTY, AN INVENTORY GLUT AND BOEING\\u2019S TRAVAILS,\\u201d SAID LYDIA BOUSSOUR, A SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST AT OXFORD ECONOMICS IN NEW YORK.  ORDERS FOR DURABLE GOODS, ITEMS RANGING FROM TOASTERS TO AIRCRAFT THAT ARE MEANT TO LAST THREE YEARS OR MORE, DROPPED 1.3% LAST MONTH AFTER DECLINING 2.8% IN APRIL, THE GOVERNMENT SAID. ECONOMISTS POLLED BY REUTERS HAD FORECAST DURABLE GOODS ORDERS WOULD SLIP 0.1 PERCENT IN MAY.  ORDERS FOR TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT TUMBLED 4.6% AFTER DIVING 7.6% IN APRIL. THAT REFLECTED A 28.2% PLUNGE IN ORDERS FOR NON-DEFENSE AIRCRAFT. CIVILIAN AIRCRAFT ORDERS PLUMMETED 39.3% IN APRIL.  BOEING REPORTED ON ITS WEBSITE THAT IT HAD RECEIVED NO AIRCRAFT ORDERS IN MAY AFTER GETTING ORDERS FOR FOUR PLANES IN APRIL. THE WORLD\\u2019S LARGEST PLANE MAKER HAS CUT PRODUCTION OF ITS FASTEST-SELLING MAX 737 JETLINER, WHICH WAS GROUNDED IN MARCH FOLLOWING TWO FATAL PLANE CRASHES IN FIVE MONTHS.  DELIVERIES OF THE PLANE HAVE ALSO BEEN SUSPENDED, LEADING TO A 1.4% DROP IN AIRCRAFT SHIPMENTS IN MAY. AIRCRAFT INVENTORIES SURGED 2.5% LAST MONTH. THE PROBLEMS AT BOEING ALSO ARE CONTRIBUTING TO AN UNDERCUTTING OF PRODUCTION AT FACTORIES.  MANUFACTURING, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT 12% OF THE ECONOMY, IS ALSO BEING UNDERMINED BY AN INVENTORY OVERHANG, ESPECIALLY IN THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY, WHICH HAS RESULTED IN FEWER ORDERS BEING PLACED WITH FACTORIES. MOTOR VEHICLES ORDERS REBOUNDED 0.6% IN MAY, LEAVING THE BULK OF APRIL\\u2019S 3.2% DROP INTACT.  SLOWING GLOBAL GROWTH AND THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THE DOLLAR\\u2019S STRENGTH LAST YEAR AGAINST THE CURRENCIES OF THE UNITED STATES\\u2019 TRADE PARTNERS ALSO ARE HOBBLING ACTIVITY.  OVERALL DURABLE GOODS SHIPMENTS ROSE 0.4% AND INVENTORIES INCREASED 0.5% IN MAY. UNFILLED DURABLE GOODS ORDERS FELL 0.5 PERCENT, THE MOST SINCE JUNE 2016, POINTING TO CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN MANUFACTURING IN THE MONTHS AHEAD. REGIONAL MANUFACTURING SURVEYS HAVE ALSO WEAKENED IN JUNE.  THE DOLLAR WAS LARGELY FLAT AGAINST A BASKET OF CURRENCIES, WHILE U.S. TREASURY PRICES WERE TRADING LOWER. STOCKS ON WALL STREET ROSE.  RAYS OF HOPE  THERE ARE SOME GLIMMERS OF HOPE FOR MANUFACTURING. ORDERS FOR NON-DEFENSE CAPITAL GOODS EXCLUDING AIRCRAFT, A CLOSELY WATCHED PROXY FOR BUSINESS SPENDING PLANS, INCREASED 0.4% LAST MONTH AMID INCREASES IN DEMAND FOR MACHINERY, AND COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS. THESE SO-CALLED CORE CAPITAL GOODS ORDERS DROPPED 1.0% IN APRIL.  SHIPMENTS OF CORE CAPITAL GOODS INCREASED 0.7% LAST MONTH AFTER AN UPWARDLY REVISED 0.4% GAIN IN THE PRIOR MONTH. CORE CAPITAL GOODS SHIPMENTS ARE USED TO CALCULATE EQUIPMENT SPENDING IN THE GOVERNMENT\\u2019S GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT MEASUREMENT.  THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED TO HAVE BEEN UNCHANGED IN APRIL. BUSINESS SPENDING ON EQUIPMENT CONTRACTED IN THE FIRST QUARTER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THREE YEARS.  FED CHAIRMAN JEROME POWELL LAST WEDNESDAY ACKNOWLEDGED THE WEAK BUSINESS SPENDING AND SAID MANY POLICYMAKERS \\u201cCITED THE INVESTMENT PICTURE AND WEAKER BUSINESS SENTIMENT ... AS SUPPORTING THEIR JUDGMENT THAT THE RISK OF LESS FAVORABLE OUTCOMES HAS RISEN.\\u201d  \\u201cWHILE CORE CAPITAL GOODS ORDERS SUGGEST BUSINESSES ARE NOT FULLY RETRENCHING AS THEY AWAIT CLARITY ON TRADE AND CONTEND WITH SLOWING GROWTH ABROAD, EQUIPMENT SPENDING STILL LOOKS SET TO CONTRACT THIS QUARTER,\\u201d SAID SARAH HOUSE, A SENIOR ECONOMIST AT WELLS FARGO SECURITIES IN CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA.  SLOWING GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER WAS ALSO UNDERSCORED BY ANOTHER REPORT FROM THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ON WEDNESDAY SHOWING THE GOODS TRADE DEFICIT WIDENED 5.1% TO $74.5 BILLION IN MAY AS AN INCREASE IN IMPORTS OFFSET A RISE IN EXPORTS.  FILE PHOTO - SHIP AND CONTAINERS ARE SHOWN AT THE PORT OF LOS ANGELES IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, U.S. JULY 16, 2018. REUTERS/MIKE BLAKE  FOLLOWING THE REPORTS, THE ATLANTA FED TRIMMED ITS GDP GROWTH ESTIMATE FOR THE SECOND QUARTER BY ONE-TENTH OF A PERCENTAGE POINT TO A 1.9% ANNUALIZED RATE. THE ECONOMY GREW AT A 3.1% RATE IN THE FIRST QUARTER, BOOSTED BY A SPURT IN EXPORTS AND AN ACCUMULATION OF INVENTORIES.  LAST MONTH, IMPORTS OF GOODS INCREASED $7.8 BILLION TO $214.7 BILLION, BOOSTED BY A SURGE IN IMPORTS OF MOTOR VEHICLES, CAPITAL GOODS, INDUSTRIAL SUPPLIES AND CONSUMER GOODS. EXPORTS OF GOODS ROSE $4.1 BILLION TO $140.2 BILLION LAST MONTH. THERE WERE INCREASES IN EXPORTS OF FOOD, MOTOR VEHICLES, CONSUMER AND CAPITAL GOODS.  THE WIDER GOODS TRADE DEFICIT WILL LIKELY SUBTRACT FROM GDP GROWTH IN THE SECOND QUARTER. THE GOVERNMENT ALSO SAID INVENTORIES ROSE 0.4% IN MAY AND STOCKS AT RETAILERS GAINED 0.5%. THE PACE OF INVENTORY ACCUMULATION IS SLOWING FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR. INVENTORIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE A DRAG ON SECOND-QUARTER GDP GROWTH.\", \"Ticker\": \"BA\", \"Date\": \"2019-06-26T00:00:00\", \"key\": \"20190626BA\", \"labelr0\": 1.5217155854001962, \"labelr1\": -2.912465994559134, \"labelr2\": -0.002747101807590491, \"labelr3\": -2.074118842888935, \"labelr4\": -0.6452336868091664, \"pos\": 0.0, \"neg\": 0.423, \"compound\": -0.5267, \"0_day_return\": 1.5217155854001962, \"1_day_return\": -2.9124659945591325, \"2_day_return\": -2.9151330879607418, \"3_day_return\": -4.928788606176992, \"4_day_return\": -5.54222008854749, \"return\": 0.003823175699307406, \"excess_return\": -2.9162891702584397, \"count_of_word\": 948, \"pred\": 1, \"prof-1\": 0.43018967, \"prof1\": 0.5698104, \"fst_sentencepc_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_prof_-1\": 0.480149877101802, \"linearsgdlog_prof_1\": 0.519850122898198, \"fst_sentencepc_prof-1\": 0.43018967, \"fst_sentencepc_prof1\": 0.5698104, \"vader_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_pred\": 1, \"fst_spacy_prof-1\": 0.4958251, \"fst_spacy_prof1\": 0.5041749, \"tr_pred\": -1, \"tr_prof-1\": 0.6007718000000001, \"tr_prof1\": 0.39922822, \"fst_spacy_pred2\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof2-1\": 0.67688394, \"fst_spacy_prof21\": 0.32311599999999996, \"fst_sentencepc_pred2\": -1, \"fst_sentencepc_prof2-1\": 0.55840355, \"fst_sentencepc_prof21\": 0.44159654, \"headline_pred\": -1, \"headline_prof2-1\": 0.6798380999999999, \"headline_prof21\": 0.3201619, \"textplusheadline_pred\": 1, \"textplusheadline_prof2-1\": 0.4520352, \"textplusheadline_prof21\": 0.5479649000000001, \"tr_headlineplustext_pred\": -1, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof-1\": 0.53358954, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof1\": 0.46641046, \"tr_headline_prof-1\": 0.3928161, \"tr_headline_prof1\": 0.6071839, \"tr_headline_pred\": 1, \"catboost_pred\": 1, \"lgbm_pred\": 1, \"xtrees_pred\": 1, \"label\": -1, \"returnpred\": 2.9124659945591325, \"returnpredcat\": -2.9124659945591325, \"returnpredlgbm\": -2.9124659945591325, \"returnpredxtree\": -2.9124659945591325, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0081973325386884, \"dailyaveragereturncat\": 0.999840244203099, \"dailyaveragereturnlgbm\": 1.0107303051557903, \"dailyaveragereturnxtree\": 0.999840244203099, \"cumreturn1b\": 1.4879153680600385, \"cumreturn1c\": 1.6045583865499533, \"cumreturn1d\": 1.280471036344347, \"cumreturn1e\": 1.4393432481567323, \"cumreturndow\": 1.1652928005667298, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.1362249258177506}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 8485, \"level_0\": 8485, \"index\": 8485, \"text\": \"FILE PHOTO - AN EMIRATI MAN IS SEEN NEAR THE LOGO OF ADNOC IN RUWAIS, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES MAY 14, 2018.

REUTERS/LUCAS JACKSON/FILE PHOTO  THE U.S. INVESTMENT BANK\\u2019S JOINT VENTURE INFORMED THE CHINA SECURITIES REGULATORY COMMISSION (CSRC) A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO ABOUT PLANS TO CHANGES IN EQUITY HOLDING, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVAL, THE PEOPLE SAID.  MORGAN STANLEY IS SEEKING TO RAISE ITS HOLDING IN THE VENTURE WITH CHINESE PARTNER HUAXIN SECURITIES TO 51% FROM 49%. THE VENTURE\\u2019S OFFERINGS INCLUDES UNDERWRITING AND SPONSORING OF STOCK AND BOND SALES.  THE APPROVAL IS LIKELY TO COME IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR, THE PEOPLE SAID, WITH ONE SAYING IT IS LIKELY TO BE AS SOON AS THE FOURTH QUARTER.  THE TIMELINE FOR POSSIBLE APPROVAL TO OWNERSHIP CHANGES IN THE JOINT VENTURE HAS NOT BEEN REPORTED BEFORE.  WHEN APPROVED, MORGAN STANLEY WILL JOIN RIVALS HSBC HOLDINGS PLC (HSBA.L), JPMORGAN CHASE & CO (JPM.N), NOMURA HOLDINGS INC (8604.T) AND UBS GROUP AG (UBSG.S) IN OWNING CONTROLLING STAKES IN ONSHORE SECURITIES JOINT VENTURES IN CHINA UNDER LIBERALIZED RULES ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER 2017.  THE MOVE BY MORGAN STANLEY COMES EVEN AS THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA HAVE WAGED A YEAR-LONG TRADE WAR MARKED BY TIT-FOR-TAT IMPORT TARIFFS ON EACH OTHER\\u2019S GOODS. THE LIKELY APPROVAL, HOWEVER, WILL BE ANOTHER INDICATION THAT CHINA IS NEVERTHELESS PUSHING AHEAD WITH ITS AGENDA TO OPEN UP ITS FINANCIAL SECTOR, AFTER JPMORGAN\\u2019S APPROVAL IN MARCH.  CHINA HAS IN RECENT MONTHS ALLOWED MANY FOREIGN FINANCIAL FIRMS TO EITHER SET UP NEW BUSINESSES ONSHORE OR EXPAND THEIR PRESENCE THROUGH MAJORITY OWNERSHIP IN DOMESTIC JOINT VENTURES ACROSS MUTUAL FUNDS, INSURANCE AND BROKERAGE BUSINESSES.  EARLIER IN JUNE, MORGAN STANLEY CHIEF EXECUTIVE JAMES GORMAN SAID HE WANTED MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF A JOINT VENTURE IN CHINA, BUT THAT REGULATORS HAS NOT SIGNED OFF ON THE IDEA. MORGAN STANLEY ALSO HAS A FUND MANAGEMENT JOINT VENTURE IN THE COUNTRY. GORMAN DID NOT IDENTIFY WHICH VENTURE HE WAS REFERRING TO.  MORGAN STANLEY\\u2019S SENIOR HONG KONG BANKERS IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN WORKING ON INTEGRATING ITS OPERATIONS WITH THE JOINT VENTURE\\u2019S, ANOTHER PERSON SAID. THOSE EFFORTS ARE PROGRESSING \\u201cAT FULL SPEED\\u201d, THE PERSON SAID.  THE OUTCOME OF SINO-U.S. TALKS TO REACH A TRADE DEAL COULD, HOWEVER, IMPACT THE APPROVAL TIMELINE, SAID THE PEOPLE, WHO DECLINED TO BE IDENTIFIED AS THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DISCUSS REGULATORY MATTERS WITH MEDIA.  A SPOKESWOMAN FOR MORGAN STANLEY IN HONG KONG DECLINED TO COMMENT. THE CSRC HAS NOT RESPONDED TO A REUTERS REQUEST FOR COMMENT.  MORE SERVICES  SHANGHAI FORTUNE, THE PARENT OF HUAXIN, SAID IN A JUNE 13 REGULATORY FILING THAT IT PLANNED TO DIVEST OF A 2% STAKE IN MORGAN STANLEY HUAXIN SECURITIES THROUGH A BIDDING PROCESS FOR NO LESS THAN 376.2 MILLION YUAN ($54.72 MILLION).  THE FIRM DID NOT DISCLOSE POSSIBLE BIDDERS, BUT SUCH A PROCESS IS USUALLY A MEANS OF TRANSFERRING ADDITIONAL SHARES TO AN EXISTING JOINT VENTURE PARTNER. AFTER WINNING THE AUCTION, THE BIDDER WOULD STILL NEED REGULATORY APPROVAL.  MORGAN STANLEY RAISED ITS STAKE IN THE VENTURE TO 49% FROM 33.3% IN 2017, BETTING ON STRONG DEALS MOMENTUM. BEFORE EASING OWNERSHIP RULES IN LATE 2017, CHINA ALLOWED FOREIGNERS TO OWN A MAXIMUM 49% IN SUCH VENTURES.  THAT LACK OF CONTROL AND LIMITED CONTRIBUTION TO REVENUE HAVE LONG BEEN A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR WALL STREET BANKS, AND BECAME A KEY ISSUE IN WASHINGTON\\u2019S PUSH TO PERSUADE BEIJING TO OPEN UP ITS MARKET FOR WIDER FOREIGN PARTICIPATION.  THE LIFTING OF THE CAP ON FOREIGN STAKES TO 51% HAS ALLOWED WESTERN BANKS TO BUY MORE SHARES FROM THEIR PARTNERS IN EXISTING JOINT VENTURES OR ENTER INTO NEW PARTNERSHIPS.  JPMORGAN AND NOMURA BECAME THE LATEST TO WIN REGULATORY APPROVAL TO SET UP MAJORITY-OWNED BROKERAGE JOINT VENTURES IN MARCH THIS YEAR. UBS RECEIVED APPROVAL IN NOVEMBER TO HOLD A MAJORITY STAKE IN ITS EXISTING JOINT VENTURE.

STARTUPS SUCH AS OXBOTICA, FIVEAI AND WAYVE THAT ARE TESTING CARS IN BRITAIN SAY THE OLD CONTINENT IS A UNIQUE PROPOSITION WITH QUIRKS AND CHALLENGES THAT TECH GIANT ALPHABET\\u2019S (GOOGL.O) WAYMO, UBER (UBER.N), AURORA AND OTHERS HAVE YET TO CRACK.  OPERATING ON A SHOESTRING RELATIVE TO THEIR U.S. RIVALS, THE EUROPEAN STARTUPS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN FORCED TO GET CREATIVE AND FOCUS ON CHEAPER, MORE TAILORED TECHNOLOGIES THAT COULD COPE IN A HEAVY DOWNPOUR ON A BUSY LONDON STREET.  \\u201cA CAR TRAINED TO DRIVE ON THE WIDE OPEN HIGHWAYS OF ARIZONA ISN\\u2019T GOING TO SURVIVE ON THE STREETS OF CROYDON. IT\\u2019S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT,\\u201d SAID ALEX VAN SOMEREN, VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTOR AT AMADEUS CAPITAL, WHICH HAS A STAKE IN FIVEAI.  THE STARTUPS HOPE THAT BY DEVELOPING SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE THAT WORK IN THE MOST TRYING CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY WILL BE IN PRIME POSITION WHEN DEEP-POCKETED U.S. FIRMS EXPAND INTO NEW REGIONS TO CAPITALIZE ON A FUTURE OF SELF-DRIVING CARS.  ACCORDING TO THE BOSTON CONSULTING GROUP (BCG), THE ERA OF CONNECTED HIGH-TECH VEHICLES IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT $150 BILLION OF NEW PROFITS FOR THE AUTO SECTOR BY 2035, MAKING THE RACE TO NAIL THE TECHNOLOGY A POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE ONE.  SOME INVESTORS ESTIMATE A FIFTH OF GLOBAL NEW CAR SALES WILL BE SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES BY 2030.  WHILE ONLY A HANDFUL OF STARTUPS ARE LIKELY TO SURVIVE, INVESTORS HAVE POURED $70 BILLION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT SINCE 2014 INTO MORE THAN 3,400 FIRMS GLOBALLY INVOLVED IN \\u201cNEW MOBILITY\\u201d, RANGING FROM AUTONOMOUS DRIVING TO RIDE HAILING TO ELECTRIC SCOOTERS TO MACHINE LEARNING, ACCORDING TO BCG.  ON A SHOESTRING  IN THE ENGLISH UNIVERSITY CITY OF OXFORD, PAUL NEWMAN FOUNDED ROBOTICS AND SELF-DRIVING COMPANY OXBOTICA TO DEVELOP \\u201cUNIVERSAL AUTONOMY\\u201d SOFTWARE THAT COULD BE SOLD TO ANY CARMAKER, FLEET OPERATOR, DELIVERY FIRM OR TRANSPORT COMPANY.  THE COMPANY HAS BEEN TESTING ITS SOFTWARE IN A FORD MONDEO CROWNED WITH ASSORTED CAMERAS AND SENSORS ON THE BUSY STREETS OF THE CITY, DRIVING THE SAME LOOP, DOWN THE HIGH STREET AND PAST THE RED LION PUB, FIVE TIMES A DAY FOR THREE MONTHS.  REPEATING DIFFERENT CIRCUITS OVER AND OVER AGAIN WITH ITS FLEET OF CARS GIVES THE COMPANY A BASELINE TO MEASURE ITS PROGRESS, AND IN TRICKY AREAS IT ALLOWS THE SOFTWARE TO COME UP WITH NEW DATA RELEVANT TO A SPECIFIC PLACE, NEWMAN SAID.  \\u201cTHE NEGOTIATIONS ONE HAS TO DO WITH BICYCLISTS AND UNDERGRADUATES IN THE EARLY HOURS - AROUND STREETS THAT FRANKLY WERE DESIGNED FOR PONIES - IN THESE EUROPEAN CITIES IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT,\\u201d HE SAID.  THE FIRM NOW PLANS TO OPEN OFFICES IN NORTH AMERICA AND CHINA, AND AIMS TO LAUNCH A SELF-DRIVING TAXI SERVICE IN 2021 IN LONDON ON SPECIFIC ROUTES - WITH A SAFETY DRIVER PRESENT - AS PART OF A CONSORTIUM WORKING WITH CAB COMPANY ADDISON LEE.  OXBOTICA\\u2019S PUBLIC ROAD TRIALS ARE LABOR-INTENSIVE AND COSTLY, AND DEMONSTRATE THE EXTENT OF THE CHALLENGE FACING COMPANIES ASPIRING TO TAKE ON WAYMO AND UBER ON A SHOESTRING.  LIKE WAYVE AND FIVEAI, OXBOTICA IS MAKING DO WITH A FRACTION OF THE FUNDING DOLED OUT IN THE UNITED STATES TO FUTURISTIC TRANSPORT COMPANIES. IT HAS RECEIVED FUNDING OF 22.6 MILLION POUNDS ($28 MILLION), WHILE FIVEAI HAS RAISED $37.7 MILLION, ACCORDING TO THE LATEST FIGURES FROM CRUNCHBASE.  BY WAY OF COMPARISON, GENERAL MOTORS\\u2019 (GM.N) SELF-DRIVING DIVISION CRUISE RAISED $1.15 BILLION IN MAY IN NEW EQUITY, VALUING THE UNIT AT $19 BILLION, WHILE CALIFORNIA-BASED DRIVERLESS DELIVERY STARTUP NURO RAISED $940 MILLION IN FEBRUARY.  THE AMOUNT OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING GOING INTO AUTONOMOUS CAR AND TECH COMPANIES IN EUROPE DOUBLED IN 2018, BUT WAS STILL A TINY FRACTION OF THE AMOUNT PUMPED INTO U.S. STARTUPS. THE EUROPEAN FIRMS PULLED IN $89 MILLION LAST YEAR, JUST 2% OF THE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING COLLECTED BY U.S. COMPANIES, ACCORDING TO DATA FROM CB INSIGHTS.

REUTERS/TOBY MELVILLE  RAIN STOPS PLAY  U.S. STARTUPS MAY BENEFIT FROM GENEROUS FUNDING BUT EUROPEANS ARGUE THE YAWNING GAP IN FINANCING \\u2013 COUPLED WITH THE PARTICULAR REGIONAL NEEDS - HAS PUSHED THEM TO FIND CHEAPER WAYS TO PLUG THE TECHNOLOGICAL GAPS.  LIDAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE LASER PULSE TECHNOLOGY USED WIDELY IN U.S. AUTONOMOUS CARS, STRUGGLES TO PAINT AN ACCURATE PICTURE OF A VEHICLE\\u2019S SURROUNDINGS ONCE RAIN, FOG OR SNOW SET IN - SO DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE ARE TESTING A RANGE OF OTHER TOOLS.  \\u201cTHE CHALLENGES WE HAVE TO SOLVE HERE ARE SUBTLY DIFFERENT AND THAT CALLS FOR A DIFFERENT SET OF SENSORS ... AND MORE EMPHASIS ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING, USE OF VISUAL TECHNIQUES FOR LOCALIZATION,\\u201d SAID STAN BOLAND, FOUNDER AND CEO OF FIVEAI,  \\u201cTHE DETERIORATION OF LIDAR IN THE RAIN IS PRETTY HORRENDOUS,\\u201d SAID BOLAND.  FIVEAI STARTED ROAD TESTS IN THE LONDON BOROUGHS OF BROMLEY AND CROYDON THIS YEAR AND HOPES TO LAUNCH PASSENGER TRIALS IN 2020. ITS LONG-TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO OPERATE AN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE FLEET TO COMPLEMENT PUBLIC TRANSPORT.  WHILE OXBOTICA\\u2019S NEWMAN AND BOLAND ARGUE THAT LIDAR HAS A ROLE TO PLAY - ALONGSIDE OTHER SENSORS AND CAMERAS - WAYVE, AN AUTONOMOUS DRIVING COMPANY BASED IN THE UNIVERSITY CITY OF CAMBRIDGE, INSISTS THE LASER TECHNOLOGY IS UNNECESSARY.  LIDAR STARTUPS VIE FOR SUPREMACY: TMSNRT.RS/2EASKUC  WAYVE CO-FOUNDER AMAR SHAH SAID RECENT IMPROVEMENTS MEANT YOU COULD NOW GET RELIABLE RELATIVE DEPTH ESTIMATES USING CAMERAS ALONE, AND THAT WOULD BE FAR CHEAPER AND MORE RELIABLE WHEN IT COMES TO MASS PRODUCING SELF-DRIVING CARS.  HE SAID WAYVE WOULD BE LOOKING FOR PARTNERSHIPS IN THE NEAR FUTURE WITH CAR MAKERS, SUPPLIERS AND ANY OTHER BODIES SUCH AS REGULATORS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING A DRIVERLESS FUTURE. HE ALSO SHRUGGED OFF THE IDEA COMPANIES SUCH AS WAYMO AND CRUISE WOULD POSE A SERIOUS THREAT WITH THEIR BIGGER FINANCIAL CLOUT.  \\u201cTHEY\\u2019VE SPENT TEN YEARS IN PHOENIX, ARIZONA AND CAN BARELY GET OUT OF THERE, SO HOW CAN THEY COME TO EUROPE?\\u201d SAID SHAH.  \\u2018AUTONOMY WINTER\\u2019  NEVERTHELESS, ANALYSTS AND CONSULTANTS PAINT A FUTURE DOMINATED BY COMPANIES SUCH AS UBER AND WAYMO WITH MASSIVE FLEETS OFFERING CHEAP MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR ON-DEMAND, SELF-DRIVING VEHICLES. BUT FULL AUTONOMY COULD STILL BE YEARS AWAY.  \\u201cFROM THE FIRST IDEA THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN FAIRLY QUICKLY, NOW THE AUTONOMY WINTER HAS COME,\\u201d SAID ARTHUR KIPFERLER, PARTNER AT AUTOMOTIVE CONSULTANCY BERYLLS STRATEGY ADVISORS.  THE CHALLENGES THE TECHNOLOGY FACES WERE HIGHLIGHTED WHEN A PEDESTRIAN WAS KILLED IN MARCH 2018 BY A SELF-DRIVING CAR BEING TESTED BY UBER. THE INCIDENT CAUSED A TEMPORARY HALT TO UBER\\u2019S DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM.  \\u201cWHEN YOU GET ON THE GROUND AND YOU GO ON A TEST DRIVE IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES, WHETHER IT\\u2019S IN SAN FRANCISCO OR IN CHINA, IN UNFAMILIAR, COMPLEX URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, THEY\\u2019RE STILL A WAYS OFF IN TERMS OF GETTING TO FULL AUTONOMY,\\u201d SAID DEBORAH ORIDA, GLOBAL HEAD OF ACTIVE EQUITIES AT CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD, WHICH HAS INVESTED IN SELF-DRIVING STARTUPS AURORA AND ZOOX.  FOR EUROPEAN START-UPS, WARINESS ON THE PART OF INVESTORS ABOUT PROMISES OF ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL AUTONOMY COULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SELL THEIR MESSAGE.  BUT WHILE THEY MAY SEE SELF-DRIVING AS A FUNDAMENTALLY REGIONAL CHALLENGE, OTHERS ARE CRITICAL OF THEIR LOCALIZED APPROACH, SAYING THE U.S. GIANTS WILL WIN OUT BY ENSURING COMMERCIALLY VIABLE SERVICES FIRST.

FILE PHOTO: A TOYOTA LOGO IS DISPLAYED AT THE 89TH GENEVA INTERNATIONAL MOTOR SHOW IN GENEVA, SWITZERLAND, MARCH 5, 2019. REUTERS/DENIS BALIBOUSE/FILE PHOTO  GLOBAL HYBRID LEADERS TOYOTA MOTOR CORP (7203.T) AND HONDA MOTOR CO LTD (7267.T) WOULD BE AMONG THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF SUCH CHANGE, WHICH COULD ALLOW THEM TO MAKE MORE HYBRIDS AND LESS OF THE MORE COSTLY ALL-ELECTRIC VEHICLES, EXPERTS SAID, AFTER REVIEWING THE DRAFT POLICY PROPOSAL PUBLISHED ON TUESDAY BY THE MINISTRY OF INDUSTRY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.  CHINA HAS SOME OF THE WORLD\\u2019S STRICTEST RULES REGARDING THE PRODUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS-EMITTING VEHICLES, AS IT BATTLES UNHEALTHY LEVELS OF AIR POLLUTION IN ITS CROWDED CITIES.  THOSE RULES HAVE PUSHED BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL AUTOMAKERS TO SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF SO-CALLED NEW-ENERGY VEHICLES (NEVS), SUCH AS THOSE POWERED SOLELY BY ELECTRICITY AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS, AS WELL AS PLUG-IN HYBRIDS.  UNDER A SYSTEM THAT KICKED IN THIS YEAR, AUTOMAKERS IN CHINA ARE OBLIGED TO MAKE UP FOR A PORTION OF THE \\u201cNEGATIVE\\u201d POINTS THEY INCUR WHEN THEY PRODUCE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE VEHICLES WITH POINTS WON FOR PRODUCING NEVS.  THOUGH MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT THAN PETROL- AND DIESEL-POWERED VEHICLES, HYBRIDS, INTRODUCED IN 1997 WITH TOYOTA\\u2019S PRIUS, ARE CURRENTLY CLASSED ALONGSIDE THOSE POWERED BY FOSSIL FUELS.  IN THE DRAFT PROPOSAL, HYBRIDS WOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED FOSSIL-FUELLED BUT RE-CLASSIFIED AS \\u201cLOW FUEL CONSUMPTION PASSENGER VEHICLES\\u201d. SIGNIFICANTLY, THE NUMBER OF NEGATIVE POINTS INCURRED FOR MAKING HYBRIDS WILL BE LESS THAN FOR TRADITIONAL VEHICLES.  THAT COULD SEE MORE OF THOSE TRADITIONAL VEHICLES REPLACED WITH HYBRIDS, EXPERTS SAID, BECAUSE WHEN AUTOMAKERS PRODUCE HYBRIDS, THEY WOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR FEWER NEGATIVE POINTS.  THE PROPOSED CHANGE CAME AS A SURPRISE, SOME EXPERTS AND INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAID, BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT FOR HYBRID TECHNOLOGY.

INVESTORS ARE NERVOUS ABOUT GE BECAUSE THE BOSTON-BASED CONGLOMERATE IS EXPECTED TO LOSE AS MUCH AS $1 BILLION IN CASH THIS YEAR, HAS SLASHED ITS DIVIDEND AND PROFIT FORECAST AND TAKEN MORE THAN $40 BILLION IN CHARGES AND WRITE-OFFS IN RECENT YEARS.  AMONG THE BIGGEST SHOCKS TO INVESTORS, GE SAID IN 2017 THAT IT WOULD SET ASIDE $15 BILLION FOR LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE PAYOUTS, ONE OF THE LARGEST SUCH AMOUNTS EVER.  GRAPHIC: GE'S LONG-TERM PLAN - HERE  MARKOPOLOS SAID GE WOULD NEED TO PUT ASIDE AN ADDITIONAL $29 BILLION FOR INSURANCE LOSSES, AND THAT IT HAD IMPROPERLY COUNTED PROFIT FROM OIL AND GAS SERVICES SUBSIDIARY BAKER HUGHES.  A REUTERS ARTICLE IN MARCH FOUND THAT GE\\u2019S RESERVES WERE THEN IN LINE WITH OTHER INSURERS, BUT SOME EXPERTS SAID GE WOULD NEED TO SET ASIDE $12 BILLION MORE BECAUSE ITS ESTIMATES RELIED ON OPTIMISTIC ASSUMPTIONS.  GE\\u2019S SHARES FELL AS MUCH AS 15% AFTER MARKOPOLOS\\u2019 REPORT CAME OUT, RECOUPING MUCH OF THE DECLINE ON FRIDAY. ON MONDAY, GE SHARES WERE DOWN 1.4% AT $8.67 IN AFTERNOON TRADING.  IN RESPONSE TO THE CONCERNS ABOUT INSURANCE, WINOKER SAID ON MONDAY THAT THE AMOUNT OF GE\\u2019S LONG-TERM CARE PAYOUTS WOULD BE DETERMINED \\u201cOVER DECADES, NOT YEARS,\\u201d AND THAT GE USES \\u201cRIGOROUS TESTING,\\u201d \\u201cSOUND ACTUARIAL ANALYSIS\\u201d AND FOLLOWS \\u201cREGULATORY AND ACCOUNTING\\u201d RULES.  ADDRESSING THE BAKER HUGHES QUESTIONS, WINOKER SAID ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE GE TO INCLUDE THE SUBSIDIARY\\u2019S RESULTS IN ITS EARNINGS REPORTS BECAUSE IT IS THE MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER.  GE DISCLOSED IN 2018 THAT ITS ACCOUNTING WAS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. IT ALSO IS THE SUBJECT OF A CLASS-ACTION SHAREHOLDER LAWSUIT THAT ALLEGES FRAUD IN GE\\u2019S INSURANCE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING.  WINOKER, WHO COVERED GE AS AN ANALYST AT UBS BEFORE TAKING HIS CURRENT JOB IN JANUARY, SAID INVESTORS\\u2019 QUESTIONS ABOUT MARKOPOLOS\\u2019 REPORT PROMPTED GE TO COMMENT ON MONDAY, BUT DID NOT SAY HOW MANY QUESTIONS GE RECEIVED OR CHARACTERIZE THEM.  SHORT PROFITS  MARKOPOLOS SAID IN THE REPORT THAT HE STOOD TO SHARE IN PROFITS FROM A HEDGE FUND THAT SOLD GE SHARES SHORT BEFORE THE REPORT CAME OUT, A BET THAT THE SHARE PRICE WOULD FALL.  SHORT SALES OF GE SHARES ROSE BY ABOUT $995 MILLION IN THE MONTH BEFORE MARKOPOLOS\\u2019 REPORT CAME OUT, ACCORDING TO S3 PARTNERS, A NEW YORK FINANCIAL ANALYTICS FIRM.  GE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER LARRY CULP SAID LAST WEEK THAT MARKOPOLOS\\u2019 REPORT WAS \\u201cMARKET MANIPULATION - PURE AND SIMPLE\\u201d - A REFERENCE TO MARKOPOLOS\\u2019 POTENTIAL TO PROFIT FROM SHORT-SELLING TIMED TO THE REPORT.  CULP AND LESLIE SEIDMAN, CHAIR OF GE\\u2019S AUDIT COMMITTEE, SAID MARKOPOLOS DID NOT TALK WITH GE BEFORE ISSUING HIS REPORT. GE SAID CULP, SEIDMAN AND OTHER GE DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVES BOUGHT SHARES AFTER THE REPORT CAME OUT.  GE SAID IN THE STATEMENT ON MONDAY THAT IT HAS NOT UNDER-PROVISIONED FOR LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE, WHICH PAYS FOR ASSISTED LIVING AND NURSING HOME CARE FOR POLICY HOLDERS. SUCH POLICIES HAVE PUSHED SOME INSURERS INTO FINANCIAL TROUBLE, AND EVEN BANKRUPTCY, BECAUSE THE COSTS HAVE TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH HIGHER THAN WERE ASSUMED WHEN THE POLICIES WERE WRITTEN IN THE LATE 1990S AND EARLY 2000S.  GE IS NOW ONLY A REINSURER OF SUCH COVERAGE AND SAYS IT HAS NOT WRITTEN NEW LONG-TERM CARE POLICIES SINCE 2006.  FILE PHOTO: GENERAL ELECTRIC CO.

THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS (UAW) UNION, WHICH WENT ON STRIKE LAST WEEK, AGREES.  THE SPRAWLING LORDSTOWN PLANT AT ONE TIME EMPLOYED MORE THAN 4,500 WORKERS. GM\\u2019S DECISION TO CLOSE IT AND THREE OTHER U.S. FACILITIES DUE TO SAGGING U.S. PASSENGER CAR SALES HAS DRAWN WIDESPREAD CRITICISM, INCLUDING FROM PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP. OHIO IS A CRUCIAL SWING STATE IN THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  THE CLOSURE IS PART OF THE REASON FOR THE UAW STRIKE, TO DEMAND THAT GM BUILD ANOTHER VEHICLE THERE. THE UNION ALSO WANTS GM TO REDUCE THE USE OF TEMPORARY WORKERS AND SHARE MORE OF ITS PROFITS, A DECADE AFTER THE UNION HELPED THE COMPANY THROUGH A GOVERNMENT-LED BANKRUPTCY.  VISITING NEARBY YOUNGSTOWN SOON AFTER BECOMING PRESIDENT IN 2017, TRUMP TOLD WORKERS THAT FACTORY JOBS WOULD NOT LEAVE, ADVISING THEM: \\u201cDON\\u2019T MOVE, DON\\u2019T SELL YOUR HOUSE.\\u201d SINCE GM\\u2019S ANNOUNCEMENT, TRUMP HAS URGED THE DETROIT COMPANY TO MOVE VEHICLE PRODUCTION BACK TO THE UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO.

SEPARATELY, IT SAYS IT IS ALSO NEGOTIATING TO SELL THE PLANT TO A GROUP AFFILIATED WITH EV START-UP WORKHORSE GROUP INC (WKHS.O).

MOST WORKERS HERE HAVE TAKEN TRANSFERS TO OTHER GM PLANTS. BUT AROUND 450 WORKERS HAVE NOT, MANY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT WANT TO UPROOT THEIR FAMILIES.  EVEN IF THE WORKHORSE DEAL GOES THROUGH, WORKERS WONDER HOW MANY PEOPLE THE PLANT WOULD EMPLOY, WHETHER THEY WOULD STILL BE WORKING FOR GM AND WHAT KIND OF PAY CUT THAT WOULD ENTAIL.  UAW WORKERS AT THE TOP OF THE WAGE SCALE EARN ABOUT $31 AN HOUR, COMPARED WITH THE $15-$17 AN HOUR WORKERS ARE PAID AT A GM BATTERY PLANT NEAR DETROIT THAT OPERATES UNDER A SIDE AGREEMENT.

FILE PHOTO: A SIGN IS DISPLAYED ON THE MORGAN STANLEY BUILDING IN NEW YORK U.S., JULY 16, 2018. REUTERS/LUCAS JACKSON  THE BANKS, WHICH OPERATE THE TWO BIGGEST U.S. WEALTH MANAGEMENT FIRMS, ARE FOCUSED ON DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BENEFITS BUSINESS, EXECUTIVES TOLD REUTERS. BUT BOTH STRATEGIES CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FIRMS TO MARKET TO YOUNGER AND MIDDLE-CLASS CLIENTS.  MORGAN STANLEY IS BUILDING ON ITS $850 MILLION PURCHASE OF SOLIUM CAPITAL, WHICH MANAGES EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS FOR SOME 3,400 COMPANIES AND 2.7 MILLION EMPLOYEES.  MORGAN STANLEY HAS RENAMED IT SHAREWORKS AND IS LOOKING TO ROLL OUT DEFERRED COMPENSATION MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS AND STUDENT LOAN REFINANCING. THE FIRM IS ALSO CONSIDERING PARTNERING WITH A PAYROLL COMPANY.  MEANWHILE, BANK OF AMERICA HAS FOCUSED ON RETIREMENT SERVICES, WITH SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN ITS 401(K)S AND HEALTH SERVICE ACCOUNTS BUSINESSES.  THE BANK NOW MANAGES PLANS FOR ABOUT 30,000 COMPANIES COVERING 5 MILLION PEOPLE. IT RANKED NO. 7 ON PLANSPONSOR.COM\\u2019S ANNUAL LIST OF 401(K) RECORD-KEEPERS BY ASSETS LAST YEAR, THREE NOTCHES HIGHER THAN IN 2017.  THE TWO BANKS TYPICALLY CATER TO OLDER, WEALTHY FAMILIES. BY PROVIDING WEALTH SERVICES TO COMPANIES, THEY HOPE TO START RELATIONSHIPS WITH YOUNG WORKERS THAT COULD DEVELOP INTO ONE-ON-ONE WEALTH MANAGEMENT RELATIONSHIPS LATER.  THE INVESTMENTS MORGAN STANLEY AND BANK OF AMERICA ARE MAKING IN WORKPLACE BENEFITS SERVICES REFLECT THE GLOBAL BANKING INDUSTRY\\u2019S SHIFT TOWARD STEADIER, FEE-DRIVEN BUSINESSES TO OFFSET A SECULAR DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE SINCE THE 2007-2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  HOWEVER, THE BUSINESS HAS BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE IN RECENT YEARS. FIDELITY, VANGUARD AND TIAA ARE CONSISTENTLY RANKED AS THE TOP THREE EMPLOYEE-BENEFITS PROVIDERS, AND CHARLES SCHWAB CORP (SCHW.N) AND E TRADE FINANCIAL CORP (ETFC.O) HAVE SUBSTANTIAL STOCK PLAN BUSINESSES.  COMPANIES ONLY CONSIDER CHANGING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ABOUT ONCE A DECADE, AND RETIREMENT PRODUCTS ARE FAIRLY STANDARDIZED, LEAVING LITTLE INCENTIVE TO SWITCH.  COMBINED WITH A PUSH TO REDUCE INVESTOR FEES AND THE HEFTY EXPENSE OF OPERATING AN EMPLOYEE-BENEFITS OPERATION AT SCALE, IT COULD BE HARD FOR MORGAN STANLEY AND BANK OF AMERICA TO SUCCEED, ANALYSTS SAID.  \\u201cTHIS IS A VERY FEE-SENSITIVE INDUSTRY,\\u201d SAID ANASTASIA KRYMKOWSKI, AN ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR AT RESEARCH FIRM CERULLI ASSOCIATES SPECIALIZING IN RETIREMENT. \\u201cIT\\u2019S AN EVEN BIGGER DEAL IN 401(K) PLAN MANAGEMENT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS IDEA OF BEING A GOOD FIDUCIARY.\\u201d  OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH  NONETHELESS, EXECUTIVES AT THE TWO BANKS TOLD REUTERS IN SEPARATE INTERVIEWS THAT THEY SEE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW REVENUES AND GAIN CLIENTS THROUGH THESE BUSINESSES.  BANK OF AMERICA BELIEVES IT CAN PICK UP CLIENTS LEFT BEHIND BY JPMORGAN CHASE & CO (JPM.N) AND WELLS FARGO & CO (WFC.N), WHICH BOTH QUIT THE 401(K) BUSINESS IN RECENT YEARS.  AND MORGAN STANLEY BOUGHT THE MOST POPULAR SOFTWARE PLATFORM FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK PLANS, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR RIVALS TO COMPETE.  MORGAN STANLEY HAS ADDED 200 NEW CORPORATE CLIENTS SINCE THE ACQUISITION AND ESTIMATES THAT, OVERALL, EMPLOYEES ON SHAREWORKS\\u2019 PLATFORM HAVE $1.5 TRILLION IN OTHER ACCOUNTS.  EXECUTIVES PREDICT THAT, OVER THE NEXT DECADE, THEY CAN TURN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES INTO CUSTOMERS OF THE FIRM\\u2019S ROBO-ADVISER OR ITS FULL-SERVICE BROKERAGE.  \\u201cIT CREATES VALUE FOR THE EMPLOYER, THE EMPLOYEE AND CREATES A NEW SOURCE OF POTENTIAL CLIENTS FOR US,\\u201d SAID JED FINN, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF MORGAN STANLEY\\u2019S WEALTH UNIT.  ANALYSTS SAID REVENUES EARNED FROM SHAREWORKS WILL BE MINIMAL IN THE NEAR-TERM BUT LATER COULD CREATE SUBSTANTIAL BUSINESS.  BANK OF AMERICA\\u2019S STRATEGY TO MARKET A FULL SUITE OF EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING 401(K)S, EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS AND HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS, TO EXISTING CLIENTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BANK ALSO MAKES IT MONEY NOW.  BANK OF AMERICA ADDED NEARLY 3,000 CORPORATE CLIENTS TO ITS INSTITUTIONAL RETIREMENT BUSINESS IN 2018, UP ABOUT 50% FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. SO FAR THIS YEAR, IT HAS ADDED ANOTHER 2,190 OF THEM. THAT INCLUDES 401(K)S, HSAS, EMPLOYEE STOCK AND DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS.  \\u201cTHE VAST AMOUNT OF WINS COME FROM EXISTING CLIENTS,\\u201d SAID ALASTAIR BORTHWICK, BANK OF AMERICA\\u2019S GLOBAL HEAD OF COMMERCIAL BANKING.

NO CHANGES TO TEXT.)  BY BRYAN WOOLSTON  BOWLING GREEN, KY. - OCT 3 (REUTERS) - WHILE STRIKING WORKERS AT GENERAL MOTORS CO\\u2019S U.S. AUTO PLANTS CONTINUE WALKING PICKET LINES FOR A THIRD WEEK TO DEMAND BETTER PAY AND BENEFITS, THE FINANCIAL PRESSURE HAS MOUNTED FOR UNION MEMBERS LIKE FRANK LEE.  ANALYSTS ESTIMATE THAT GM COULD LOSE $1 BILLION FROM THE LABOR DISPUTE THAT BEGAN ON SEPT. 16 AND IS NOW THE LONGEST NATIONWIDE STRIKE AT THE AUTOMAKER SINCE 1970. FOR GM, WHICH HAD $24 BILLION IN CASH AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS OF JUNE 30, THAT COST IS LIKELY MANAGEABLE.  BUT IT\\u2019S A DIFFERENT STORY FOR SOME STRIKERS.  FRANK LEE, A UNITED AUTO WORKERS UNION MEMBER AT GM\\u2019S CORVETTE ASSEMBLY PLANT IN BOWLING GREEN, KENTUCKY, IS FENDING OFF BILL COLLECTORS.  \\u201cUNTIL YESTERDAY, I WAS NEGATIVE IN MY BANK ACCOUNT,\\u201d SAID LEE. \\u201cI CALLED THE BANK TO TRY AND STOP AN INSURANCE PAYMENT FROM COMING OUT. I FAILED TO DO THAT; IT WAS TOO LATE.\\u201d  ADDING TO THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS SITUATION, UNION REGULATIONS PROHIBIT LEE FROM SEEKING OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WHILE ON STRIKE. IF HE FINDS ANOTHER JOB, OR SUPPLEMENTS THE WEEKLY $250 STRIKE PAY, HE WILL LOSE THE BENEFITS WITH THE UNION.  NEGOTIATORS FOR THE UNITED AUTO WORKERS AND GENERAL MOTORS CO CONTINUED TALKING ON WEDNESDAY, WITH NO WORD ON WHEN A DEAL WOULD BE AGREED THAT WOULD GET THE AUTOMAKER\\u2019S U.S. ASSEMBLY LINES ROLLING AGAIN.  GM AND THE UAW SAID THEY TRADED WHAT WERE DESCRIBED AS COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSALS ON TUESDAY. THE UNION REJECTED GM\\u2019S PLAN, SAYING IT FELL SHORT ON WAGES, HEALTHCARE, JOB SECURITY AND THE TREATMENT OF TEMPORARY WORKERS, WHICH HAS BECOME A CENTRAL ISSUE FOR THE UAW.  LEE IS A TEMPORARY WORKER WHO WAS HIRED AT THE BOWLING GREEN PLANT THREE YEARS AGO. THE 47-YEAR-OLD HAS TRAINED TO WORK AT MORE THAN 30 POSITIONS WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY PLANT.  BUT EVEN AFTER THREE YEARS ON THE JOB, LEE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR THE SAME PAY AND BENEFITS AS FULL-TIME UAW WORKERS, WHO EARN $7 TO $14 AN HOUR MORE THAN TEMPORARY WORKERS IN THE SAME FACTORIES.  LEE LIVES WITH HIS SON, ISIAH, IN A TRAILER HOME THIRTY MILES SOUTH OF THE BOWLING GREEN PLANT.  \\u201cBEFORE THE STRIKE EVEN HAPPENED, THE MONEY I MAKE AS A TEMPORARY IS WEEK TO WEEK; PAYCHECK COMES IN, PAYCHECKS GO OUT, AND WE BARELY SURVIVE,\\u201d SAID LEE, MAKING HIS COMMENTS IN BETWEEN PHONE CALLS WITH BILL COLLECTORS.  ON FRIDAY, UNION MEMBERS AT GM WILL MARK THEIR SECOND PAYDAY WITHOUT A CHECK.  \\u201cI\\u2019VE GOT BILLS THAT ARE BEHIND ALREADY. I\\u2019VE GOT BILL COLLECTORS; THEY\\u2019RE ALREADY CALLING ME,\\u201d LEE SAID. \\u201cTHERE\\u2019S A STACK OF BILLS THAT SEEMED TO HAVE DOUBLED. RENT IS DUE. I DON\\u2019T KNOW WHERE THAT MONEY IS COMING FROM.\\u201d  LEE HAS CALLED HIS CREDIT CARD PROVIDERS, EXPLAINING THAT PAYING RENT AND BUYING GROCERIES WOULD NEED TO TAKE PRIORITY.  THE UAW IS WORKING WITH CHARITIES IN COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY THE STRIKE TO GET ADDITIONAL HELP FOR STRIKERS, A UNION SPOKESMAN SAID.  LEE SAID FINANCIAL PRESSURE HAD INCREASED FOR HIM NOT BECAUSE OF THE STRIKE BUT DUE TO THE WAY GENERAL MOTORS TREATS TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES. HE HAD BELIEVED HIS TEMPORARY POSITION WOULD LEAD TO A JOB WITH FULL PAY AND BENEFITS.  DESPITE THE STRESS AND FINANCIAL HARDSHIP, LEE FINDS INSPIRATION IN HIS SON, ISIAH.  \\u201cI\\u2019M IN THIS FOR MY SON, AND WE ARE SURVIVORS,\\u201d HE SAID. \\u201cWE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.\\u201d  AT THE BARGAINING TABLES IN DETROIT, THE ISSUE OF HOW TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES ARE TREATED IS BASED ON THE UNION\\u2019S PRINCIPLE THAT WORKERS AT THE SAME PLANT SHOULD GET SIMILAR WAGES FOR SIMILAR WORK.  HIGH ABSENTEEISM POSES A PROBLEM FOR GM MANAGEMENT AS THE COMPANY TENDS TO RELY ON TEMPORARY WORKERS TO FILL IN FOR MISSING FULL TIME WORKERS.  THE UNION HAS URGED GM TO GIVE TEMPORARY WORKERS A PAY RISE AND AN EASIER PATH TO JOBS AT FULL UAW PAY AND BENEFITS. GM PAYS TEMPORARY WORKERS BETWEEN $15.78 AND $22 AN HOUR DEPENDING ON WHEN THEY WERE HIRED, ACCORDING TO A SUMMARY OF THE NOW EXPIRED CONTRACT. FULL TIME ASSEMBLY WORKERS CAN EARN A BASE PAY OF NEARLY $30 AN HOUR OR MORE.

REGULATORS PUT CLEARINGHOUSES AT THE CENTER OF TRADING IN OVER-THE-COUNTER CREDIT DERIVATIVES AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS AFTER THE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS. BUT THE REGULATORS HAVE YET TO AGREE ON DETAILED PROTOCOLS FOR SHORING UP, OR SAFELY WINDING DOWN, CLEARINGHOUSES WOUNDED BY CUSTOMER DEFAULTS.

THE CLEARINGHOUSES, KNOWN AS CENTRAL COUNTERPARTIES, STAND BETWEEN BOTH SIDES OF TRADES AND ENSURE THEIR COMPLETION EVEN IF ONE SIDE GOES BUST.  THE CLEARINGHOUSES WERE EMBRACED AFTER THE FAILURE OF LEHMAN BROTHERS IN 2008 LEFT A MESS OF UNKNOWN LOSSES AMID CRISS-CROSSED TRADES BOOKED DIRECTLY BETWEEN EACH SIDE.  SINCE THEN, CLEARING HAS BECOME CONCENTRATED IN A FEW CLEARINGHOUSES PRIMARILY OWNED BY THE LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE GROUP PLC, (LSE.L) INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE INC (ICE.N) AND CME GROUP INC (CME.O). MOST OF THE TRADES CLEARED THROUGH THEM COME FROM ABOUT 10 BIG BANKS, KNOWN AS CLEARING MEMBERS AND USED BY FUND MANAGERS TO TAKE POSITIONS.  THE BANKS AND FUND MANAGERS CONTEND THAT THE CLEARINGHOUSES DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH OF THEIR OWN MONEY AT RISK, LEAVING THEM WITH TOO LITTLE INCENTIVE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE RISK MANAGEMENT AGAINST DEFAULTS, OPERATIONAL FAILURES AND CYBERATTACKS.  THEY ALSO CALL FOR CHANGES IN GOVERNANCE RULES TO GIVE CLEARING MEMBERS MORE SAY IN RISKS THE CLEARINGHOUSES MAY TAKE ON, SUCH AS CLEARING NEW INSTRUMENTS WITH UNKNOWN VOLATILITY.  CLEARINGHOUSES, IN PAST COMMENTS TO REGULATORS AND WHITE PAPERS OF THEIR OWN, HAVE SAID THAT THE BANKS SHOULD HAVE A MAJOR RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES TO PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING TOO MUCH RISK WITH TRADES AND CLIENTS.  CLEARINGHOUSES WERE TRADITIONALLY OWNED BY THEIR USERS. AS INVESTOR-OWNED COMPANIES, THEY AND THEIR USERS HAVE COME IN MORE CONFLICT.  THE BANKS ARE UNDER INCREASED PRESSURE FROM REGULATIONS TO LIMIT HOW MUCH CAPITAL THEY HAVE AT RISK. SOME OF THOSE RULES HAVE PROMPTED SOME BANKS TO BACK AWAY FROM DERIVATIVES, WHICH IS A CONCERN TO FUND MANAGERS WHO USE THEM.

SHARES OF TD AMERITRADE SURGED 16% TO CLOSE AT $48.38, GIVING IT A MARKET VALUE OF $26.2 BILLION, AFTER CNBC FIRST REPORTED ON THE POTENTIAL DEAL. CHARLES SCHWAB SHARES ENDED 7.3% HIGHER AT $48.03, GIVING THE COMPANY A MARKET VALUE OF $61.6 BILLION.  PRESSURE ON THE DISCOUNT BROKER BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN RISING IN RECENT YEARS, AS COMPANIES SPEND MORE ON THEIR TRADING PLATFORMS TO KEEP UP WITH TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, WHILE LOWERING FEES TO ATTRACT MORE CUSTOMERS.  WITH DISRUPTORS SUCH AS MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA-BASED ROBINHOOD MARKETS INC RAPIDLY GAINING MARKET SHARE BY ELIMINATING STOCK TRADING COMMISSIONS, LARGE BROKERS WERE FORCED TO DO THE SAME: SCHWAB WAS FIRST LAST MONTH, COVERING ONLINE TRADING OF STOCKS, ETFS AND OPTIONS, FOLLOWED BY OTHERS SUCH AS FIDELITY INVESTMENTS, E TRADE FINANCIAL CORP (ETFC.O) AND TD AMERITRADE.  WHILE THE BROKERAGE INDUSTRY HAS BENEFITED FROM THE STOCK MARKET RALLY OF THE LAST DECADE THAT HAS TURNED MORE MOM-AND-POP INVESTORS INTO CUSTOMERS, THE DEAL COULD ALSO SIGNIFY THAT COMPANIES ARE NOW SEEKING TO CONSOLIDATE AHEAD OF A POTENTIAL MARKET DOWNTURN.  EARNING LESS FROM TRADING HAS PLACED INCREASED FOCUS ON OTHER POSSIBLE REVENUE SOURCES, IN PARTICULAR MANAGEMENT OF CUSTOMER ASSETS WHICH THESE FIRMS CONTROL.  SCHWAB EARNED ABOUT HALF OF ITS MORE THAN $10 BILLION IN REVENUE IN 2018 FROM INTEREST INCOME.  THE COMBINED COMPANY WOULD HAVE ASSETS OF AROUND $5 TRILLION, ACCORDING TO REUTERS CALCULATIONS.  THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE\\u2019S THREE INTEREST RATE CUTS THIS YEAR HAVE MADE INCOME FROM INVESTING CUSTOMER BALANCES LESS PROFITABLE.

UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, OVERSIGHT BODIES HAVE BEEN MORE WILLING TO APPROVE BIG FINANCIAL MERGERS: THIS WEEK, THE FED CLEARED A COMBINATION OF BB&T CORP BBT.N AND SUNTRUST BANKS INC STI.N, IN THE LARGEST BANK MERGER SINCE THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS.  HOWEVER, WHILE THE UNITED STATES HAS THOUSANDS OF BANKS, THE DISCOUNT BROKER SPACE IS MUCH MORE CONSOLIDATED: FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMBINED COMPANY WOULD HAVE ABOUT 65% TO 70% OF INVESTMENT ACCOUNT ASSETS, ACCORDING TO A RESEARCH NOTE FROM KBW.  THE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION, SO SOON AFTER THE ELIMINATION OF ONLINE TRADING FEES BY SCHWAB, COULD ALSO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT PREDATORY PRICING MOVES.  \\u201cBECAUSE SCHWAB JUST CUT COMMISSIONS TO ZERO, THEN BID FOR THEIR MOST HINDERED COMPETITOR, THAT COULD LEAD TO LEGAL CHALLENGES AND WILL LIKELY DRAW ANTI-COMPETITIVE SCRUTINY,\\u201d UBS ANALYSTS WROTE IN A RESEARCH NOTE.

ON DEADLINE  JAPAN\\u2019S NUCLEAR REGULATION AUTHORITY (NRA) HAS TAKEN A STRICT LINE ON ENFORCING DEADLINES BY WHICH THE BACK-UP ANTI-TERROR BASES ARE TO BE CONSTRUCTED. IT TURNED DOWN A REQUEST FROM KYUSHU ELECTRIC FOR A DEADLINE EXTENSION EARLIER THIS YEAR, LEAVING THE UTILITY WITH NO OPTION BUT TO DECIDE ON TEMPORARY SHUTDOWN.

BUT ANALYSTS FORECAST THE UTILITY WILL BE OBLIGED TO SUSPEND OPERATIONS AT THE REACTORS IF IT IS TO MEET ITS DEADLINES.  LUCY CULLEN, PRINCIPAL ANALYST AT WOOD MACKENZIE, PREDICTS KANSAI WILL CLOSE THE TWO TAKAHAMA REACTORS NEXT YEAR AND EXPECTS A COMBINATION OF COAL, LNG AND EVEN OIL COULD BE USED TO OFFSET THE LOST NUCLEAR GENERATION.  IF BOTH COAL AND GAS-FIRED GENERATION CAPACITY ARE AVAILABLE, THE CHOICE OF SUBSTITUTES FOR NUCLEAR ULTIMATELY DEPENDS ON RELATIVE FUEL ECONOMICS, CULLEN SAID.  \\u201cWHEN CONTRACTED LNG VOLUMES ARE AVAILABLE WE WOULD EXPECT (UTILITIES) TO USE LNG.

ASML CEO PETER WENNINK ON WEDNESDAY CONFIRMED THAT THE COMPANY HAD REQUESTED BUT NOT RECEIVED PERMISSION TO SEND A MACHINE WITH \\u201cEXTREME ULTRAVIOLET\\u201d, OR EUV, TECHNOLOGY TO A CHINESE CUSTOMER, UNDERSTOOD TO BE SMIC.  \\u201cWE NEED TO ABIDE BY THE LAW, AND IF WE WANT TO SHIP A CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY...WE NEED TO GO TO OUR GOVERNMENT AND APPLY FOR AN EXPORT LICENSE,\\u201d HE TOLD REUTERS IN AN INTERVIEW.  HE CONFIRMED THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL WAITING FOR APPROVAL TO SHIP THE ORDER TO CHINA, BUT ESTIMATED THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE DELAY ON THE COMPANY AS \\u201cZERO\\u201d.  EARLIER ON WEDNESDAY ASML REPORTED FOURTH QUARTER NET PROFIT OF 1.13 BILLION EUROS ($1.25 BILLION), UP 43% FROM THE SAME PERIOD OF 2018 AS SALES ROSE 29% TO 4.04 BILLION EUROS.  WENNINK SAID THAT ANY MACHINES DESTINED FOR, BUT NOT SENT TO, CHINA WOULD EVENTUALLY BE SOLD ELSEWHERE AS GLOBAL DEMAND FOR COMPUTER CHIPS GROWS.  \\u201cIF WE CANNOT SHIP TO CUSTOMER A OR COUNTRY B, WE\\u2019LL SHIP IT TO CUSTOMER C AND COUNTRY D,\\u201d HE SAID.  ASML SHARES, WHICH HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED OVER THE PAST YEAR AS ITS CUSTOMERS ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INVEST HEAVILY IN NEW CHIPMAKING CAPACITY, TRADED 0.5% HIGHER AT 272.6 EUROS AT 1311 GMT.  DESPITE PROBLEMS SHIPPING CUTTING-EDGE EQUIPMENT, ASML REGULARLY SENDS PREVIOUS-GENERATION TECHNOLOGY TO CHINA, WHERE CUSTOMERS SUCH AS TSMC, INTEL AND SAMSUNG HAVE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES.  CHINESE CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 12% OF ASML\\u2019S TOTAL SALES IN 2019, DOWN FROM 19% THE PREVIOUS YEAR, WITH WENNINK SAYING THAT WAS DUE TO GENERAL WEAKNESS IN END-MARKET DEMAND FOR MEMORY CHIPS, RATHER THAN RESTRICTIONS ON ASML\\u2019S TECHNOLOGY.  HE ADDED THAT THE MARKET FOR LOGIC CHIPS USED IN SMART PHONES AND 5G TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS WAS EXPECTED TO REMAIN STRONG, WHILE CUSTOMERS WERE STARTING TO SEE THE FIRST SIGNS OF RECOVERY IN THE MEMORY CHIP MARKET.  ASML FORECAST SALES OF 3.1-3.3 BILLION EUROS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AND ANNOUNCED A NEW 6 BILLION EURO SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM THROUGH 2022.\", \"Ticker\": \"ASML\", \"Date\": \"2020-01-22T00:00:00\", \"key\": \"20200122ASML\", \"labelr0\": -0.7205093833780085, \"labelr1\": -0.6514767932489475, \"labelr2\": 0.5130470236477273, \"labelr3\": -3.904269343879936, \"labelr4\": 2.075418601378934, \"pos\": 0.281, \"neg\": 0.311, \"compound\": -0.1531, \"0_day_return\": -0.7205093833780096, \"1_day_return\": -0.7205093833780096, \"2_day_return\": -0.1417721518987558, \"3_day_return\": -4.040506329113958, \"4_day_return\": -2.048945147679337, \"return\": 0.0011409765936629724, \"excess_return\": -0.7216503599716726, \"count_of_word\": 474, \"pred\": 1, \"prof-1\": 0.5341229000000001, \"prof1\": 0.46587718, \"fst_sentencepc_pred\": -1, \"linearsgdlog_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_prof_-1\": 0.4533675092548256, \"linearsgdlog_prof_1\": 0.5466324907451744, \"fst_sentencepc_prof-1\": 0.5341229000000001, \"fst_sentencepc_prof1\": 0.46587718, \"vader_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_pred\": 1, \"fst_spacy_prof-1\": 0.43124480000000004, \"fst_spacy_prof1\": 0.56875527, \"tr_pred\": -1, \"tr_prof-1\": 0.55275667, \"tr_prof1\": 0.44724333, \"fst_spacy_pred2\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof2-1\": 0.7561429000000001, \"fst_spacy_prof21\": 0.24385706, \"fst_sentencepc_pred2\": -1, \"fst_sentencepc_prof2-1\": 0.5260482, \"fst_sentencepc_prof21\": 0.47395182, \"headline_pred\": -1, \"headline_prof2-1\": 0.64406633, \"headline_prof21\": 0.35593364, \"textplusheadline_pred\": 1, \"textplusheadline_prof2-1\": 0.3894995, \"textplusheadline_prof21\": 0.6105005, \"tr_headlineplustext_pred\": 1, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof-1\": 0.33636892, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof1\": 0.66363114, \"tr_headline_prof-1\": 0.27071044, \"tr_headline_prof1\": 0.7292896, \"tr_headline_pred\": 1, \"catboost_pred\": 1, \"lgbm_pred\": 1, \"xtrees_pred\": 1, \"label\": -1, \"returnpred\": 0.7205093833780096, \"returnpredcat\": -0.7205093833780096, \"returnpredlgbm\": -0.7205093833780096, \"returnpredxtree\": -0.7205093833780096, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 0.9924897311086772, \"dailyaveragereturncat\": 0.9918287990452991, \"dailyaveragereturnlgbm\": 0.9907035639598626, \"dailyaveragereturnxtree\": 0.9918287990452991, \"cumreturn1b\": 3.8895543795041996, \"cumreturn1c\": 4.21577806359886, \"cumreturn1d\": 2.1052495595512615, \"cumreturn1e\": 3.7130732638829205, \"cumreturndow\": 1.3249004994274503, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.2490272331530745}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 17278, \"level_0\": 17278, \"index\": 17278, \"text\": \"JAN 23 (REUTERS) - INTEL CORP FORECAST FULL-YEAR REVENUE ABOVE ANALYSTS\\u2019 ESTIMATES ON THURSDAY, HELPED BY HIGHER SALES OF ITS CHIPS USED IN DATA CENTERS THAT POWER INTERNET-BASED SERVICES, SENDING ITS SHARES UP 5%.

PICTURE TAKEN OCTOBER 19, 2017. REUTERS/CHRIS HELGREN  (REUTERS) - WELLS FARGO & CO AND ITS OFFICIALS HAVE RACKED UP WELL OVER $4 BILLION (3 BILLION POUNDS) IN PENALTIES SINCE A SALES PRACTICES SCANDAL ERUPTED IN 2016, AND CONTINUES TO FACE HEADWINDS.  HERE ARE SOME OF THE REMAINING SHOES THAT HAVE YET TO DROP:  PROBES: A NUMBER OF FEDERAL AGENCIES ARE EXAMINING THE BANK AND ITS EMPLOYEES FOR POTENTIAL WRONGDOING. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS LOOKING INTO WHETHER EXECUTIVES WITHHELD DETAILS ABOUT FAKE ACCOUNTS TO THE WELLS FARGO BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, THE LEAD REGULATOR FOR NATIONAL BANKS, REUTERS HAS REPORTED. THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\\u2019S PHILADELPHIA OFFICE, MEANWHILE, HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING WHETHER WELLS FARGO MISLED INVESTORS BY INFLATING PERFORMANCE METRICS AND WHETHER THE BANK PENALIZED WHISTLEBLOWERS, REUTERS ALSO REPORTED. THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR IS ALSO EXAMINING WHETHER THE BANK ACTED ON STAFF WHISTLEBLOWER COMPLAINTS.  CONSENT ORDERS: WELLS FARGO IS CURRENTLY OPERATING UNDER ROUGHLY 14 CONSENT ORDERS WITH VARIOUS REGULATORS INCLUDING THE OCC, SEC, AND THE CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU. UNDER THE ORDERS, THE BANK WILL ENDURE INTENSE REGULATORY SCRUTINY UNTIL IT PROVES IT HAS FIXED PROCEDURES THAT ALLOWED EMPLOYEES TO CREATE POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF UNAUTHORIZED ACCOUNTS, AND SELL AUTO INSURANCE AND OTHER ADD-ON PRODUCTS THAT CUSTOMERS DID NOT WANT OR NEED. THE ORDERS ALSO REQUIRE WELLS FARGO TO REPAY CUSTOMERS FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CONSUMER ABUSES. SO FAR THE BANK HAS PAID OUT AT LEAST TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN REMEDIATION.  ASSET CAP: THE MOST NOTABLE CONSENT ORDER LOOMING OVER THE BANK IS THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE\\u2019S ASSET CAP, WHICH PUT AN UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH RESTRICTION ON THE BANK\\u2019S BALANCE SHEET UNTIL IT PROVES THAT IT HAS OVERHAULED ITS RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS. SINCE THE ASSET CAP WAS ANNOUNCED IN EARLY 2018, BANK EXECUTIVES REPEATEDLY EXTENDED THE TIMELINE FOR GETTING IT REMOVED AND HAVE SINCE STOPPED GIVING ANY GUIDANCE ON THE ISSUE. ON HIS FIRST PUBLIC CALL WITH THE COMPANY EARLIER THIS MONTH, NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHARLIE SCARF DID NOT SET A NEW TIMELINE.  COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ACT (CRA) RATING: EVEN IF WELLS FARGO\\u2019S ASSET CAP IS LIFTED, ITS GROWTH COULD STILL BE HAMPERED BY ITS CRA RATING, WHICH ASSESSES HOW WELL BANKS SERVICE POORER COMMUNITIES. IN 2017, FEDERAL REGULATORS DOWNGRADED WELLS FARGO TWO NOTCHES TO \\u201cNEEDS TO IMPROVE\\u201d FROM \\u201cOUTSTANDING\\u201d SHORTLY AFTER THE SCANDAL BROKE. THE RATING, WHICH IS TYPICALLY ONLY REVIEWED EVERY FIVE YEARS, CURTAILS THE BANK\\u2019S ABILITY TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS AND OPEN BRANCHES, AND REQUIRES WELLS FARGO TO SEEK REGULATORY APPROVAL IN FINANCING DECISIONS LIKE ISSUING OR PREPAYING DEBT. A LESS THAN SATISFACTORY RATING ALSO PREVENTS THE BANK FROM COURTING CERTAIN GOVERNMENT BUSINESS THAT REQUIRES A HIGHER CRA RATING.  MORE HEARINGS: THE BANK\\u2019S EXECUTIVES HAVE IN THE PAST BEEN CALLED TO TESTIFY BEFORE CONGRESS ABOUT THE BANK\\u2019S WRONGDOINGS AND EXPLAIN HOW THE BANK HAS CHANGED. NEW CEO SCHARF HAS TRIED TO PLACE THE SCANDAL SQUARELY IN THE PAST, DESCRIBING \\u201cHISTORICAL AND \\u201cLEGACY\\u201d ISSUES DURING HIS FIRST CALL, BUT LAWMAKERS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE REHASHING WELLS FARGO\\u2019S MISTAKES IN PUBLIC.

WITH GOLDMAN\\u2019S STOCK VALUE WEAK AND WITH IT DOING LESS BUSINESS WITH AVERAGE INVESTORS, THE E TRADE DEAL WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO EXPENSIVE, SAID DAVID HENDLER OF VIOLA RISK ADVISORS.  \\u201cMORGAN STANLEY IS BETTER POSITIONED TO ACQUIRE E TRADE BECAUSE OF ITS HIGHER STOCK VALUATION AND MORE SIGNIFICANT CROSS-OVER INTO ITS NETWORK OF BROKERS AND WORKPLACE ASSETS THAN GOLDMAN SACHS,\\u201d SAID HENDLER.  GOLDMAN\\u2019S SHARE PRICE AS OF THURSDAY\\u2019S CLOSE WAS 1.1 TIMES ITS STATED TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE AS OF THE FOURTH QUARTER COMPARED WITH 1.3 TIMES TANGIBLE BOOK VALUE FOR MORGAN STANLEY.  GOLDMAN ENTERED THE RETAIL SPACE A LONG TIME AFTER MORGAN STANLEY OR OTHER U.S. RIVALS.  IT PURCHASED $16 BILLION WORTH OF DEPOSITS FROM A GENERAL ELECTRIC CO SUBSIDIARY IN 2015, AND HAS SINCE BOUGHT A FEW RELATIVELY SMALL COMPANIES TO EXPAND ITS PRESENCE IN RETAIL AND WEALTH MANAGEMENT: A PERSONAL-FINANCE STARTUP CALLED CLARITY MONEY, A RETIREMENT PLATFORM CALLED HONEST DOLLAR AND AN INVESTMENT-ADVISORY FIRM CALLED UNITED CAPITAL.  BUT NONE OF THOSE DEALS GAVE GOLDMAN A BIG POOL OF RETAIL DEPOSITS OR OTHER KINDS OF BUSINESSES THAT COULD OFFSET A SHARP DECLINE IN TRADING REVENUE.  MICHAEL MCTAMNEY, AN ANALYST OF BIG BANKS AND BROKERS FOR CREDIT RATING SERVICE DBRS MORNINGSTAR, SAID MORGAN STANLEY\\u2019S MOVE DEAL PUTS MORE PRESSURE ON GOLDMAN.  \\u201cGOLDMAN SACHS HAS, HISTORICALLY, BEEN A BUILD-UP-THEMSELVES ORGANIZATION AS OPPOSED TO MAKING ACQUISITIONS,\\u201d MCTAMNEY SAID. NOW THERE WILL BE MORE QUESTIONS FROM INVESTORS ABOUT WHETHER ACQUISITIONS ARE NEEDED, HE SAID.  DEALMAKER IN CHIEF  ASSOCIATES SAY THAT SOLOMON IS STAKING HIS LEGACY ON TURNING GOLDMAN INTO A GLOBAL, FULL-SERVICE FINANCIAL SERVICES FIRM THAT CAN COMPETE WITH RIVALS. HIS PREDECESSOR, LLOYD BLANKFEIN, HAS EXPRESSED REGRET ABOUT NOT ACQUIRING DURING THE CRISIS FOR THE SAME KIND OF GROWTH  A LONGTIME DEALMAKER, SOLOMON BECAME CEO IN 2018 AND WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN A TURNAROUND PLAN THAT PRECEDED HIS ELEVATION. AT GOLDMAN\\u2019S FIRST-EVER INVESTOR DAY IN LATE JANUARY, HIS MANAGEMENT TEAM SET AMBITIOUS TARGETS TO GROW THE BANK\\u2019S CONSUMER DIVISION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.  GOLDMAN MAY BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITHOUT AN ACQUISITION, BUT A DEAL WOULD HELP, SAID DICK BOVE, A SENIOR RESEARCH ANALYST AT ODEON CAPITAL.  \\u201cIF THEY ACQUIRE A BANK, WHICH WILL BRING IN LOW-COST DEPOSITS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A BIG PLUS,\\u201d HE SAID.  \\u201cGOLDMAN, CLEARLY UNDER BLANKFEIN, MISSED THE BOAT.\\u201d\", \"Ticker\": \"MS\", \"Date\": \"2020-02-20T00:00:00\", \"key\": \"20200220MS\", \"labelr0\": -4.546261765228206, \"labelr1\": -2.4744186046511603, \"labelr2\": -5.227012590614273, \"labelr3\": -3.3212560386473404, \"labelr4\": -1.6448053300020802, \"pos\": 0.0, \"neg\": 0.0, \"compound\": 0.0, \"0_day_return\": -4.54626176522821, \"1_day_return\": -2.4744186046511643, \"2_day_return\": -7.572093023255823, \"3_day_return\": -10.64186046511628, \"4_day_return\": -12.111627906976741, \"return\": -0.01051810288962261, \"excess_return\": -2.4639005017615405, \"count_of_word\": 708, \"pred\": -1, \"prof-1\": 0.5241443, \"prof1\": 0.47585562, \"fst_sentencepc_pred\": -1, \"linearsgdlog_pred\": 1, \"linearsgdlog_prof_-1\": 0.4971248135687429, \"linearsgdlog_prof_1\": 0.5028751864312571, \"fst_sentencepc_prof-1\": 0.5241443, \"fst_sentencepc_prof1\": 0.47585562, \"vader_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_pred\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof-1\": 0.52043664, \"fst_spacy_prof1\": 0.47956329999999997, \"tr_pred\": -1, \"tr_prof-1\": 0.5402954000000001, \"tr_prof1\": 0.4597046, \"fst_spacy_pred2\": -1, \"fst_spacy_prof2-1\": 0.5530208000000001, \"fst_spacy_prof21\": 0.44697928, \"fst_sentencepc_pred2\": -1, \"fst_sentencepc_prof2-1\": 0.58572865, \"fst_sentencepc_prof21\": 0.41427138, \"headline_pred\": -1, \"headline_prof2-1\": 0.6137060999999999, \"headline_prof21\": 0.38629386, \"textplusheadline_pred\": -1, \"textplusheadline_prof2-1\": 0.52228767, \"textplusheadline_prof21\": 0.47771233, \"tr_headlineplustext_pred\": -1, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof-1\": 0.7505348000000001, \"tr_headlineplustext_prof1\": 0.24946523, \"tr_headline_prof-1\": 0.46472174, \"tr_headline_prof1\": 0.53527826, \"tr_headline_pred\": 1, \"catboost_pred\": 1, \"lgbm_pred\": -1, \"xtrees_pred\": -1, \"label\": -1, \"returnpred\": 2.4744186046511643, \"returnpredcat\": -2.4744186046511643, \"returnpredlgbm\": 2.4744186046511643, \"returnpredxtree\": 2.4744186046511643, \"dailyaveragereturn\": 1.0244002358763387, \"dailyaveragereturncat\": 1.020507171343253, \"dailyaveragereturnlgbm\": 1.009884267168019, \"dailyaveragereturnxtree\": 1.009884267168019, \"cumreturn1b\": 4.168501556857305, \"cumreturn1c\": 4.866654152801971, \"cumreturn1d\": 2.3570639514707814, \"cumreturn1e\": 4.0769337938151775, \"cumreturndow\": 1.3297649675250147, \"cumreturnsp500\": 1.2418449337198756}, {\"Unnamed: 0\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"Unnamed: 0.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1\": 19175, \"level_0\": 19175, \"index\": 19175, \"text\": \"(REUTERS) - T-MOBILE US (TMUS.O) AND SPRINT CORP (S.N) SAID ON THURSDAY THAT THEY HAD AGREED ON NEW MERGER TERMS THAT WOULD REDUCE THE STAKE OF MAJOR SPRINT SHAREHOLDER SOFTBANK, WHILE LEAVING THE OFFER TO OTHER SHAREHOLDERS UNCHANGED.
